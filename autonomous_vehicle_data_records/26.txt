AB Image segmentation plays a central role in a broad range of applications, such as medical image analysis, autonomous vehicles, video surveillance and augmented reality. Portrait segmentation, which is a subset of semantic image segmentation, is widely used as a preprocessing step in multiple applications such as security systems, entertainment applications, video conferences, etc. A substantial amount of deep learning-based portrait segmentation approaches have been developed, since the performance and accuracy of semantic image segmentation have improved significantly due to the recent introduction of deep learning technology. However, these approaches are limited to a single portrait segmentation model. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using an ensemble method by combining multiple heterogeneous deep-learning based portrait segmentation models to improve the segmentation performance. The Two-Models ensemble and Three-Models ensemble, using a simple soft voting method and weighted soft voting method, were experimented. Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, IoU standard deviation and false prediction rate were used to evaluate the performance. Cost efficiency was calculated to analyze the efficiency of segmentation. The experiment results show that the proposed ensemble approach can perform with higher accuracy and lower errors than single deep-learning-based portrait segmentation models. The results also show that the ensemble of deep-learning models typically increases the use of memory and computing power, although it also shows that the ensemble of deep-learning models can perform more efficiently than a single model with higher accuracy using less memory and less computing power.

TI A Conformance Testing Methodology and System for Cognitive Radios
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB The fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks has started its operation in some countries and is aimed at meeting demands beyond the current system capabilities such as the huge amount of connected devices from IoT applications (e.g., smart cities), explosive growth of high-speed mobile data traffic (e.g., ultrahigh definition video streaming), and ultrareliable and low latency communication (e.g., autonomous vehicle). To attend to these needs, the electromagnetic spectrum must be made available, but the static spectrum allocation policy has caused a spectrum shortage and impaired the employment/expansion of the wireless systems. To overcome this issue, the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been promoted in 5G/6G networks, which is enabled by the cognitive radio (CR) technology. Although diverse mechanisms have been developed to tackle the challenges that emerge in different CR layers/functionalities, a standardized testing methodology and system for CR is still immature. Existing standards or methodologies and systems for CR only focus on the definition of network technologies (e.g., IEEE 802.22 and IEEE 802.11af), performance evaluation of CR algorithms/mechanisms, or definition of the device cognition level via performance results or psychometric approaches, not covering systems/methodologies to verify if the device meets the CR capabilities and regulatory policies, neglecting the conformance testing. In this respect, this paper proposes a flexible methodology and system for CR conformance testing under two perspectives, functionalities and limits. We instantiate it by using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) software-defined radio platform and present a proof-of-concept with a conformance metric. The results show the feasibility of our proposal.

AB Over the past decade, unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs; widely known as drones) are quickly being deployed in various civilian as well as military applications. Drones can self-organize into a connected swarm (Flying Ad Hoc Networks - FANETs) to complete various challenging missions. As the primary building block of Internet-of-Drones (IoD), FANETs have an important role to play in governing the autonomous movement of drones and supporting drone-to-everything (D2X) communications. However, factors such as flying characteristics and the highly dynamic topology of FANETs compound the challenges of packet forwarding; thus, the focus of this article. Specifically, a stochastic packet forwarding algorithm (hereafter referred to as SPA) is proposed for FANETs, where the data packets can be efficiently transferred to the destination. In SPA, the packet sender evaluates each next hop forwarding candidate drone based on different network metrics, prior to selecting the next hop forwarding drone according to the forwarding probability. In addition, an analytical model is developed to evaluate the performance of SPA. Then, the link expiration time and link throughput are chosen as network metrics for network simulation experiments, where SPA is evaluated and compared with prior schemes (e.g, DTNgeo and GeoUAVs). The performance of SPA is evaluated in a real-world testbed to complement the network simulation experiments. Findings from the evaluations demonstrate that SPA obtains better performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet delivery latency, the number of delivered data packets, average link lifetime, and bit error rate.

AB Floating autonomous vehicles are very often equipped with modern systems that collect information about the situation under the water surface, e.g., the depth or type of bottom and obstructions on the seafloor. One such system is the multibeam echosounder (MBES), which collects very large sets of bathymetric data. The development and analysis of such large sets are laborious and expensive. Reduction of the spatial data obtained from bathymetric and other systems collecting spatial data is currently widely used. In commercial programs used in the development of data from hydrographic systems, methods of interpolation to a specific mesh size are very frequently used. The authors of this article previously proposed original the true bathymetric data reduction method (TBDRed) and Optimum Dataset (OptD) reduction methods, which maintain the actual position and depth for each of the measured points, without their interpolation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods has already been presented in previous articles. This article proposes the fusion of original reduction methods, which is a new and innovative approach to the problem of bathymetric data reduction. The article contains a description of the methods used and the methodology of developing bathymetric data. The proposed fusion of reduction methods allows the generation of numerical models that can be a safe, reliable source of information, and a basis for design. Numerical models can also be used in comparative navigation, during the creation of electronic navigation maps and other hydrographic products.

AB This study proposed an investigation-based multiple-criteria coordinated model to evaluate the sustainable development of urban public transport (PT) infrastructure, based on economic, social and environmental data from 2009 to 2019. The main problem with the traditional approach for assessing urban PT development is that economic and social benefits are considered individually, but also attention to environmental factors and coordination among the three issues are nearly overlooked. This leads to the likelihood of inaccuracies in the handling/assessment of sustainable development or an imbalance among the attributes in different cities. An investigation-based coordinated model was introduced in which a survey of 35 sub-criteria was conducted to derive the criteria necessary for coupling/coordination. A case study involving 13 cities in Jiangsu Province, China, illustrated the problems in coordinating PT systems and verified the efficacy of the proposed approach. With employing the entropy method, this study validated coordination of the PT infrastructure development of various cities in a balanced manner and used panel regression formulas to analyse the theoretical gap and empirical bottlenecks existing among economic, social and environmental benefits. With the findings of the study, the data-based investigation from 13 cities enabled the city planners/managers (including ones from other cities with similar urban levels) to give the individual priority between the ternary benefits, advance technology, allow big data-based informatisation and implement near-future autonomous PT vehicles.

AB Monitoring tasks in control room environments require operators to perform various mental and physical subtasks in series and simultaneously over long periods of time with minimal error. These tasks vary in cognitive complexity, ranging from low-level sensory processing to high-level decision making. Cognitive load, a measure of the effort required by the working memory, can serve as an indicator of tasks that may have higher risk of error. Task decomposition models for cognitive complexity can be combined with objective and subjective measures of workload to measure human performance in response to control room stimuli. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a cognitive task analysis approach to structure the design of experiments for the purpose of evaluating human performance in control room simulated use activities. Participants completed monitoring tasks in a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control room that required the completion of tasks ranging in cognitive complexity. Performance measures taken during the study were used to validate the breakdown of tasks complexity, and to identify potential sources of human error in workstation monitoring tasks. These findings can be linked to design specifications for workstation optimization. Results indicated that the task breakdown appropriately represented the use-case scenario, and the classification model adequately captured differences in cognitive workload experienced by participants. This research has broad implications on complex system design validation, providing a structure to achieve cognitive depth for the evaluation of human performance and subsequent design risk mitigation.

AB Automated driving technologies offer the opportunity to substantially reduce the number of road accidents and fatalities. This requires the development of systems that can handle traffic scenarios more reliable than the human driver. The extreme number of traffic scenarios, though, causes enormous challenges in testing and proving the correct system functioning. Due to its efficiency and reproducibility, the test procedure will involve environment simulations to which the system under test is exposed. A combination of traffic, driving and Vulnerable Road User (VRU) simulation is therefore required for a holistic environment simulation. Since these simulators have different requirements and support various formats, a concept for integrated spatio-semantic road space modeling is proposed in this paper. For this purpose, the established standard OpenDRIVE, which describes road networks with their topology for submicroscopic driving simulation and HD maps, is combined with the internationally used semantic 3D city model standard CityGML. Both standards complement each other, and their combination opens the potentials of both application domains-automotive and 3D GIS. As a result, existing HD maps can now be used by model processing tools, enabling their transformation to the target formats of the respective simulators. Based on this, we demonstrate a distributed environment simulation with the submicroscopic driving simulator Virtual Test Drive and the pedestrian simulator MomenTUM at a sensitive crossing in the city of Ingolstadt. Both simulators are coupled at runtime and the architecture supports the integration of automated driving functions.

AB Recent efforts in soft-body control have been hindered by the infinite dimensionality of soft bodies. Without restricting the deformation space of soft bodies to desired degrees of freedom, it is difficult, if not impossible, to guarantee that the soft body will remain constrained within a desired operating range. In this article, we present novel modeling and fabrication techniques for leveraging the reorientation of fiber arrays in soft bodies to restrict their deformation space to a critical case. Implementing this fiber reinforcement introduces unique challenges, especially in complex configurations. To address these challenges, we present a geometric technique for modeling fiber reinforcement on smooth elastomeric surfaces and a two-stage molding process to embed the fiber patterns dictated by that technique into elastomer membranes. The variable material properties afforded by fiber reinforcement are demonstrated with the canonical case of a soft, circular membrane reinforced with an embedded, intersecting fiber pattern such that it deforms into a prescribed hemispherical geometry when inflated. It remains constrained to that configuration, even with an additional increase in internal pressure. Furthermore, we show that the fiber-reinforced membrane is capable of maintaining its hemispherical shape under a load, and we present a practical application for the membrane by using it to control the buoyancy of a bioinspired autonomous underwater robot developed in our lab. An additional experiment on a circular membrane that inflates to a conical frustum is presented to provide additional validation of the versatility of the proposed model and fabrication techniques.

ID TARGET DETECTION; ALGORITHM
AB We offer a new unsupervised statistically-based algorithm for the detection of underwater objects in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery due to its high-resolution imagery and because its resolution is independent of the range. In contrast to other methods that do not utilize the statistical model of the shadow region, our algorithm combines highlight detection and shadow detection using a weighted likelihood ratio test, while exploiting the expected spatial distribution of potential objects. We detect highlights by a higher-order-statistics representation of the image, followed by a segmentation process to form a region-of-interest (ROI). Then, while taking into account the sonar elevation and scan angle, for each ROI, we use a support vector machine (SVM) over the statistical features of the pixels within the ROI to detect shadow-related pixels and background pixels. Our algorithm has the benefit of being robust as a result of setting its main parameters in situ. Moreover, we do not require knowledge about the target's shape or size, thereby making our algorithm suitable for all sonar detection applications and sonar types. To test detection performance, using our own autonomous underwater vehicle, we collected 270 sonar images, which we also share with the community. Compared to the results of benchmark schemes, our detection algorithm shows a trade-off between the probability of detection and the false alarm rate (FAR), which is close to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence lower bound.

AB Internet of Things simulations play significant roles in the diverse kinds of activities in our daily lives and have been extensively researched. Creating and controlling virtual agents in three-dimensional Internet of Things simulations is a key technology for achieving realism in three-dimensional simulations. Given that traditional virtual agent-based approaches have limitations for realism, it is necessary to improve the realism of three-dimensional Internet of Things simulations. This article proposes a Q-Network-based motivation framework that applies a Q-Network to select motivations from desires and hierarchical task network planning to execute actions based on goals of the selected motivations. The desires are to be identified and calculated based on states. Selected motivations will be chosen to determine the goals that agents must achieve. In the experiments, the proposed framework achieved an average accuracy of up to 85.5% when the Q-Network-based motivation model was trained. To verify the Q-Network-based motivation framework, a traditional Q-learning is also applied in the three-dimensional virtual environment. Comparing the results of the two frameworks, the Q-Network-based motivation framework shows better results than those of traditional Q-learning, as the accuracy of the Q-Network-based motivation is higher by 15.58%. The proposed framework can be applied to the diverse kinds of Internet of Things systems such as a training autonomous vehicle. Moreover, the proposed framework can generate big data on animal behaviors for other training systems.

AB The Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) diverted wastewater discharge (5.3 x 10(8) I d(-1)) from its primary deep (56 m) outfall 8 km offshore, to a secondary shallower (16 m) outfall 1.6 km offshore for a period of three weeks. It was anticipated that the low salinity and density of the effluent would cause it to rise to the surface with limited dilution, elevating nutrient concentrations in near-surface waters and stimulating phytoplankton blooms in the region. Three Teledyne Webb Slocum gliders and a Liquid Robotics surface wave glider were deployed on transects near the outfalls to acquire high spatial and temporal coverage of physical and chemical parameters before, during, and after the wastewater diversion. Combined autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and MODIS-Aqua satellite ocean color data indicated that phytoplankton biomass increased in the upper water column in response to the diversion, but that the magnitude of the response was spatially patchy and significantly less than expected. Little evidence of the plume or its effects was detectable 72 h following the diversion. The effluent plume exhibited high rates of dilution and mixed throughout the upper 20 m and occasionally throughout the upper 40 m during the diversion. Rapid plume advection and dilution appeared to contribute to the muted impact of the nutrient-rich effluent on the phytoplankton community in this coastal ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ID OCEAN CIRCULATION; MODEL
AB In order to simulate the biogeochemical function of estuaries across the land-ocean continuum, circulation models must represent a cascade of complex physical processes spanning several spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, governing physical processes tend to vary under different flow regimes, in response to external forcings. Model validation must therefore cover all relevant flow regimes and span sufficiently long time to represent transient and slowly-varying phenomena. We focus in a multi-year hindcast simulation of the Columbia River estuary - a mesotidal, river-dominated estuary that is also influenced by coastal upwelling in an Eastern Boundary Current system. Model skill is assessed against long-term observational time series, covering the lower estuary (for salinity) as well as most of the tidal river (for water temperature and elevation). In addition, high-resolution profiles of velocity and salinity are used to study salt transport mechanisms at a single station. Results indicate that the model captures the estuarine dynamics of the system, but the skill depends on the flow regime: In general the model performs far better during spring tides (i.e., under partially mixed or time-dependent salt wedge regimes) than under neap tides (i.e., salt wedge and strongly stratified regimes). While the model accurately represents tidal salt transport mechanisms, it tends to underestimate gravitational transport which becomes more important under neap tide conditions. Furthermore, the skill decreases during high river discharge periods, because the model has difficulty capturing the extremely strong stratification characteristic to those periods.

AB The search for signs of life on extraterrestrial planetary bodies is among NASA's top priorities in Solar System exploration. The associated pursuit of organics and biomolecules as evidence of past or present life demands in situ investigations of planetary bodies for which sample return missions are neither practical nor affordable. These in situ studies require instrumentation capable of sensitive chemical analyses of complex mixtures including a broad range of organic molecules. Instrumentation must also be capable of autonomous operation aboard a robotically controlled vehicle that collects data and transmits it back to Earth. Microchip capillary electrophoresis (mu CE) coupled to laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection provides this required sensitivity and targets a wide range of relevant organics while offering low mass, volume, and power requirements. Thus, this technology would be ideally suited for in situ studies of astrobiology targets, such as Mars, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. In this review, we introduce the characteristics of these planetary bodies that make them compelling destinations for extraterrestrial astrobiological studies, and the principal groups of organics of interest associated with each. And although the technology we describe here was first developed specifically for proposed studies of Mars, by summarizing its evolution over the past decade, we demonstrate how mu CE-LIF instrumentation has become an ideal candidate for missions of exploration to all of these nearby worlds in our Solar System.

AB Current control systems regulate the behavior of dynamic systems by reacting to noise and unexpected disturbances as they occur. To improve the performance of such control systems, experience from iterative executions can be used to anticipate recurring disturbances and proactively compensate for them. This paper presents an algorithm that exploits data from previous repetitions in order to learn to precisely follow a predefined trajectory. We adapt the feed-forward input signal to the system with the goal of achieving high tracking performance-even under the presence of model errors and other recurring disturbances. The approach is based on a dynamics model that captures the essential features of the system and that explicitly takes system input and state constraints into account. We combine traditional optimal filtering methods with state-of-the-art optimization techniques in order to obtain an effective and computationally efficient learning strategy that updates the feed-forward input signal according to a customizable learning objective. It is possible to define a termination condition that stops an execution early if the deviation from the nominal trajectory exceeds a given bound. This allows for a safe learning that gradually extends the time horizon of the trajectory. We developed a framework for generating arbitrary flight trajectories and for applying the algorithm to highly maneuverable autonomous quadrotor vehicles in the ETH Flying Machine Arena testbed. Experimental results are discussed for selected trajectories and different learning algorithm parameters.

AB Habitats and ecological communities occurring in the mesophotic region of the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, were investigated using autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from 51 to 145 m. High-resolution multibeam bathymetry of the outer-shelf at Hydrographers Passage in the central GBR revealed submerged linear reefs with tops at 50, 55, 80, 90, 100 and 130 m separated by flat, sandy inter-reefal areas punctuated by limestone pinnacles. Cluster analysis of AUV images yielded five distinct site groups based on their benthic macrofauna, with rugosity and the presence of limestone reef identified as the most significant abiotic factors explaining the distribution of macrofaunal communities. Reef-associated macrofaunal communities occurred in three distinct depth zones: (1) a shallow (< 60 m) community dominated by photosynthetic taxa, notably scleractinian corals, zooxanthellate octocorals and photosynthetic sponges; (2) a transitional community (60-75 m) comprising both zooxanthellate taxa and azooxanthellate taxa (notably gorgonians and antipatharians); and (3) an entirely azooxanthellate community (> 75 m). The effects of depth and microhabitat topography on irradiance most likely play a critical role in controlling vertical zonation on reef substrates. The lower depth limits of zooxanthellate corals are significantly shallower than that observed in many other mesophotic coral ecosystems. This may be a result of resuspension of sediments from the sand sheets by strong currents and/or a consequence of cold water upwelling.

ID DEPTH-INTEGRATED FLOW; CIRCULATION; PACIFIC; SOUTH; ISLAND
AB The South Equatorial Current ( SEC) entering the Coral Sea through the gap between New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands was observed by an autonomous underwater vehicle ( Spray glider) and an overlapping oceanographic cruise during July-October 2005. The measurements of temperature, salinity, and absolute velocity included high-horizontal-resolution profiles to 600-m depth by the glider, and sparser, 2000-m-deep profiles from the cruise. These observations confirm the splitting of the SEC into a North Vanuatu Jet ( NVJ) and North Caledonian Jet ( NCJ), with transport above 600 m of about 20 and 12 Sv, respectively. While the 300-km-wide NVJ is associated with the slope of the main thermocline and is thus found primarily above 300 m, the NCJ is a narrow jet about 100 km wide just at the edge of the New Caledonian reef. It extends to at least a 1500-m depth with very little shear above 600 m and has speeds of more than 20 cm s(-1) to at least 1000 m. An Argo float launched east of New Caledonia with a parking depth fixed at 1000 m became embedded in the NCJ and crossed the glider/cruise section at high speed about 3 months before the glider, suggesting that the jet is the continuation of a western boundary current along the east side of the island and extends across the Coral Sea to the coast of Australia. In the lee of New Caledonia, the glider passed through a region of eddies whose characteristics are poorly understood.

AB Offloading computation to nearby edge/fog computing nodes, including the ones carried by moving vehicles, e.g., vehicular fog nodes (VFN), has proved to be a promising approach for enabling low-latency and compute-intensive mobility applications, such as cooperative and autonomous driving. This work considers vehicular fog computing scenarios where the clients of computation offloading services try to minimize their own costs while deciding which VFNs to offload their tasks. We focus on decentralized multi-agent decision-making in a repeated unknown game where each agent, e.g., service client, can observe only its own action and realized cost. In other words, each agent is unaware of the game composition or even the existence of opponents. We apply a completely uncoupled learning rule to generalize the decentralized decision-making algorithm presented in [7] for the multi-agent case. The multi-agent solution proposed in this work can capture the unknown offloading cost variations susceptive to resource congestion under an adversarial framework where each agent may take implicit cost estimation and suitable resource choice adapting to the dynamics associated with volatile supply and demand. According to the evaluation via simulation, this work reveals that such individual perturbations for robustness to uncertainty and adaptation to dynamicity ensure a certain level of optimality in terms of social welfare, e.g., converging the actual sequence of play with unknown and asymmetric attributes and lowering the correspondent cost in social welfare due to the self-interested behaviors of agents.

AB This think piece discusses current barriers to the rapid decarbonization of transport , ways to overcome them. Policymakers face a set of contradictory goals, leading them to ponder only incremental measures: The need to reduce carbon emissions conflicts with accessibility improvements and the resulting induced traffic. At the same time, the prevention of urban sprawl as a means of promoting sustainable mobility is fundamentally thwarted by technical advances in electric cars and autonomous driving. Unable to attract public acceptance for measures that would effectively reduce travel demand, transport policy is failing to provide convincing transition pathways toward sustainable and equitable mobility for growing urban populations.As a possible way forward, we propose a new starting point for transport policy discussions, exploring the feasibility of urban transport systems based on sustainable, flexible , relatively cheap modes of active mobility - the E-Bike City. This paper aims to outline a research agenda for testing the effects of such a policy direction. In contrast to the literature on "cycling cities", this effort should include possibilities newly opened by the recent availability of electric micro-mobility vehicles. Also, it should aim for a balanced and realistic tran-sition rather than a unimodal utopia.Inspired by friendly conversations around recent urban visions like 15-Minute Cities or Superblocks, this paper is meant to begin a new discussion about alternative future directions for transport policy beyond mere opti-mization and technical incrementalism.

AB The visual information complexity of automotive head-up displays (HUDs) may affect cognitive load and reduce driver performance in critical situations. This study investigated whether physiological indicators of cognitive load can predict the type of HUD while driving. Physiological signals of heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature, and pupil dilation were recorded from 28 participants using a motion-based driving simulator. Two types of HUD with different information complexities were compared: baseline HUD and augmented reality HUD. Heart rate and EDA were processed to create standardized biomedical features. Time-series analysis and basic statistics generated two sets of features for pupil dilation and skin temperature. The effect of signal combinations on classification performance was tested using signal fusion. Three gradient boosting classifiers (LGBM, HGBC, and XGB) were trained on physiological signals to predict HUD type. The fusion of HRV, EDA, and time-series features for skin temperature and pupil dilation yielded moderate performance, with average AUC ROC scores of XGB = 0.67, LGBM = 0.69, and HGBC = 0.70. Combining HRV, EDA, and basic statistical features for skin temperature and pupil dilation, the classifiers achieved an improved average AUC ROC score of 0.76. The best scores were 0.96 (LGBM and XGB) and 0.98 (HGBC). These results demonstrate the potential of physiological signals for modeling HUD-induced cognitive load and dynamically regulating its effects in real-time.

AB Reliable data collection techniques, whose aim is to ensure that sensed data are received successfully by a sink, are essential for applications in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs). However, traditional data collection with Radio Frequency (RF) functions poorly in UWSNs due to peculiar features of underwater. Moreover, acoustic communication creates challenges for the reliability of data collection such as high bit error rate, packet collision and voids in routing. Furthermore, the deployment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in some scenarios changed the paradigm of data collection and introduced new issues that affect reliability such as inaccurate navigation and lengthy travel time. Consequently, numerous studies focus on the relative reliability of various currently available data collection in UWSNs. In this paper, we first review the problems specific to UWSNs and their impact on reliable data collection. It is followed by a discussion about characteristics, challenges, and features associated with the design of reliable techniques in UWSNs. Afterward, to provide readers with an overview of reliable data collection techniques in UWSNs, this paper categorizes them according to their ability to enhance reliability at all the key stages of data collection. In this categorization framework, the advantages and disadvantages of each technique have been in-depth discussed. Finally, several possible areas for further research are identified and discussed.

AB With technical advances, various locomotion mechanisms for use on bumpy roads have been introduced. Among these locomotion mechanisms, crawler-based platforms are widely employed. However, due to their tilt on uneven terrain, accidents such as overturning and falling loads have been reported. To overcome these situations, this paper proposes a constant balance scheme for crawler-based transportation systems (hereinafter called crawler robots for simplicity). Practically, a variable-shape crawler robot with four foldable legs is designed to maintain a constant upper-frame posture regardless of ground conditions. The four legs by coordinating expand and contract, thereby enabling the robot to adapt to local surface conditions and configure its desired posture while traveling. The coordination-based crawler mechanism is realized by employing rack-and-pinion units for raising and lowering. The effectiveness and performance of the developed crawler robot are demonstrated by verifying its movement under continuous and discontinuous surface conditions with the use of a balanced posture from a tilted state. Specifically, we pose an innovative challenge of information transformation to maintain balance effectively. In detail, three-dimensional state variations (e.g., gradients and inclinations) of the crawler robot depending on ground conditions are transformed into one-dimensional displacements. Unlike previous works, this study presents the novel idea of coordinating the motions of individual legs to configure a variable-shape crawler robot. In other words, the crawler shape is deformed while it maintains the desired balance.

AB In the literature, city logistics in terms of last mile delivery on the e-commerce market is quite new area of research that is not thoroughly investigated. It can be observed that there are many papers discussing various topics from the perspective of different groups of stakeholders such as residents, governments, shippers, receivers, transport companies (CEP), and others. However, there is no holistic approach covering the presented field of research. Therefore, the paper's purpose is identification of trends in sustainable last mile delivery on ecommerce market in cities from the perspective of various stakeholders.

AB This study proposes a new active fault-tolerant control (FTC) and fault estimation scheme for a non-linear octorotor system. The proposed method utilises the idea of an online control allocation (CA) scheme to fully engage the rotors redundancy based on the information from the fault estimation unit. The nominal performance is first achieved using non-linear dynamic inversion (NDI) technique and then to incorporate the robustness, an adaptive non-linear sliding mode control is united with a baseline NDI controller. The proposed method is used to attain the desired altitude and attitude tracking control of an octorotor system. Furthermore, to control the un-actuated states (called internal dynamics) of octorotor system, a separate integral sliding mode-based NDI controller is designed that provides the translational axes control by generating the desired roll and pitch commands. Simulations on the non-linear model of octorotor system validate the dominant performance of the proposed scheme compared to the existing methods in the literature.

AB Bridges are a critical piece of infrastructure in the network of road and rail transport system. Many of the bridges in Norway (in Europe) are at the end of their lifespan, therefore regular inspection and maintenance are critical to ensure the safety of their operations. However, the traditional inspection procedures and resources required are so time consuming and costly that there exists a significant maintenance backlog. The central thrust of this paper is to demonstrate the significant benefits of adapting a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted inspection to reduce the time and costs of bridge inspection and established the research needs associated with the processing of the (big) data produced by such autonomous technologies. In this regard, a methodology is proposed for analysing the bridge damage that comprises three key stages, (i) data collection and model training, where one performs experiments and trials to perfect drone flights for inspection using case study bridges to inform and provide necessary (big) data for the second key stage, (ii) 3D construction, where one built 3D models that offer a permanent record of element geometry for each bridge asset, which could be used for navigation and control purposes, (iii) damage identification and analysis, where deep learning-based data analytics and modelling are applied for processing and analysing UAV image data and to perform bridge damage performance assessment. The proposed methodology is exemplified via UAV-assisted inspection of Skodsberg bridge, a 140 m prestressed concrete bridge, in the Viken county in eastern Norway.

AB This study proposes a novel control scheme to investigate the time-varying formation tracking control problem for multi-agent systems with model uncertainties and the absence of leader's velocity measurements. For each agent, a novel fixed-time cascaded leader state observer (CLSO) without velocity measurements is first designed to reconstruct the states of the leader. Radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are adopted to deal with the model uncertainties online. Taking the square of the norm of the NN weight vector as a newly developed adaptive parameter, a novel RBFNN-based adaptive control scheme with minimal learning-parameter approach and fixed-time CLSO is then constructed to tackle the time-varying formation tracking problem. The uniform ultimate boundedness property of the formation tracking error is guaranteed through Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, two simulation scenario results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation tracking control scheme.

AB Corrosion is a major defect in structural systems that has a significant economic impact and can pose safety risks if left untended. Currently, an inspector visually assesses the condition of a structure to identify corrosion. This approach is time-consuming, tedious, and subjective. Robotic systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, paired with computer vision algorithms have the potential to perform autonomous damage detection that can significantly decrease inspection time and lead to more frequent and objective inspections. This study evaluates the use of convolutional neural networks for corrosion detection. A convolutional neural network learns the appropriate classification features that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. Eliminating the need for dependence on prior knowledge and human effort in designing features is a major advantage of convolutional neural networks. This article presents different convolutional neural network-based approaches for corrosion assessment on metallic surfaces. The effect of different color spaces, sliding window sizes, and convolutional neural network architectures are discussed. To this end, the performance of two pretrained state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures as well as two proposed convolutional neural network architectures are evaluated, and it is shown that convolutional neural networks outperform state-of-the-art vision-based corrosion detection approaches that are developed based on texture and color analysis using a simple multilayered perceptron network. Furthermore, it is shown that one of the proposed convolutional neural networks significantly improves the computational time in contrast with state-of-the-art pretrained convolutional neural networks while maintaining comparable performance for corrosion detection.

ID GUIDANCE
AB A number of hurdles must be overcome in order to integrate unmanned aircraft into civilian airspace for routine operations. The ability of the aircraft to land safely in an emergency is essential to reduce the risk to people, infrastructure, and aircraft. To date, few field-demonstrated systems have been presented that show online replanning and repeatability from failure to touchdown. This paper presents the development of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) component of an automated emergency landing system (AELS) intended to address this gap, suited to a variety of fixed-wing aircraft. Field-tested on both a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Cessna 172R during repeated emergency landing experiments, a trochoid-based path planner computes feasible trajectories, and a simplified control system executes the required maneuvers to guide the aircraft toward touchdown on a predefined landing site. This is achieved in zero-thrust conditions with engine forced to idle to simulate failure. During an autonomous landing, the controller uses airspeed, inertial, and GPS data to track motion and maintains essential flight parameters to guarantee flyability, while the planner monitors glide ratio and replans to ensure approach at correct altitude. Simulations show reliability of the system in a variety of wind conditions and its repeated ability to land within the boundary of a predefined landing site. Results from field-tests for the two aircraft demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GNC system in live operation. Results show that the system is capable of guiding the aircraft to close proximity of a predefined keyhole in nearly 100% of cases. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Nature employs a variety of tactics to precisely time and execute the processes and mechanics of life, relying on sequential sense and response cascades to transduce signaling events over multiple length and time scales. Many of these tactics, such as the activation of a zymogen, involve the direct manipulation of a material by a stimulus. Similarly, effective therapeutics and diagnostics require the selective and efficient homing of material to specific tissues and biomolecular targets with appropriate temporal resolution. These systems must also avoid undesirable or toxic side effects and evade unwanted removal by endogenous clearing mechanisms. Nanoscale delivery vehicles have been developed to package materials with the hope of delivering them to select locations with rates of accumulation and clearance governed by an interplay between the carrier and its cargo. Many modern approaches to drug delivery have taken inspiration from natural activatable materials like zymogens, membrane proteins, and metabolites, whereby stimuli initiate transformations that are required for cargo release, prodrug activation, or selective transport. This Perspective describes key advances in the field of stimuli-responsive nanomaterials while highlighting some of the many challenges faced and opportunities for development. Major hurdles include the increasing need for powerful new tools and strategies for characterizing the dynamics, morphology, and behavior of advanced delivery systems in situ and the perennial problem of identifying truly specific and useful physical or molecular biomarkers that allow a material to autonomously distinguish diseased from normal tissue.

AB We consider the design of a Dual-Function Radar-Communication (DFRC) system, aided by an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS). The radar precoding matrix and IRS parameters are optimized to maximize the weighted sum of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the radar receiver and the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) at the communication receivers, all while adhering to power constraints, a beampattern error constraint, and constant modulus constraints on the IRS parameters. The primary challenge in this maximization problem stems from the doubly reflected echo, wherein the signal reaches the target after reflection on the IRS and subsequently returns to the radar following reflection upon the IRS. This renders the SNR a non-convex quartic function of the IRS parameters. The problem is decomposed into two sub-problems: waveform design and IRS parameter design, and it is addressed through alternating optimization. The first sub-problem is tackled using semi-definite programming. The second sub-problem, which involves a non-convex quartic polynomial and unit modulus IRS parameter constraints, is resolved through Riemannian Manifold Optimization (RMO). In contrast to prior methods, our approach does not involve bounds or a surrogate function construction, but rather optimizes directly the original objective, thus providing more accurate evaluation of the system performance metrics. Design insights are derived, specifically regarding the selection of IRS size, IRS location, and the comparative analysis of paths involving single or double IRS reflections.

AB Lightweight Network Architecture is essential for autonomous and intelligent monitoring of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), such as in object detection, image segmentation, and crowd counting applications. The state-of-the-art lightweight network learning based on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) usually costs enormous computation resources. Alternatively, low-performance embedded platforms and high-resolution drone images pose a challenge for lightweight network learning. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a new lightweight object detection model, called GhostShuffleNet (GSNet), for UAV images, which is built based on Zero-Shot Neural Architecture Search. This paper also introduces the new components which compose GSNet, namely GhostShuffle units (loosely based on ShuffleNetV2) and the backbone GSmodel-L. Firstly, a lightweight search space is constructed with the GhostShuffle (GS) units to reduce the parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs). Secondly, the parameters, FLOPs, layers, and memory access cost (MAC) as constraints add to search strategy on a Zero-Shot Neural structure search algorithm, which then searches for an optimal network GSmodelL. Finally, the optimal GSmodel-L is used as the backbone network and a Ghost-PAN feature fusion module and detection heads are added to complete the design of the lightweight object detection network (GSNet). Extensive experiments are conducted on the VisDrone2019 (14.92%mAP) dataset and the our UAV-OUC-DET (8.38%mAP) dataset demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of GSNet.

AB With increasing availability and use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as sensors and video cameras, large amounts of streaming data is now being produced at high velocity. Applications which require low latency response such as video surveillance, augmented reality and autonomous vehicles demand a swift and efficient analysis of this data. Existing approaches employ cloud infrastructure to store and perform machine learning-based analytics on this data. This centralized approach has limited ability to support real-time analysis of large-scale streaming data due to network bandwidth and latency constraints between data source and cloud. We propose RealEdgeStream (RES) an edge enhanced stream analytics system for large-scale, high performance data analytics. The proposed approach investigates the problem of video stream analytics by proposing (i) filtration and (ii) identification phases. The filtration phase reduces the amount of data by filtering low-value stream objects using configurable rules. The identification phase uses deep learning inference to perform analytics on the streams of interest. The phases consist of stages which are mapped onto available in-transit and cloud resources using a placement algorithm to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints identified by a user. We demonstrate that for a 10K element data streams, with a frame rate of 15-100 per second, the job completion in the proposed system takes 49 percent less time and saves 99 percent bandwidth compared to a centralized cloud-only based approach.

AB Bio-inspired long-based undulating fin propulsion is commonly employed in biological autonomous underwater vehicles (BAUVs), while the hydrodynamic characteristics of various undulating patterns are different. To investigate what kind of undulating pattern has outstanding propulsion or braking performance for BAUVs in directional maneuvers, undulations with four basic undulating patterns are numerically examined under the Open-source Field Operation And Manipulation environment at the Reynolds number of 5 x 10(2), 5 x 10(3), and 5 x 10(4), corresponding to viscous, transitional, and inertial flow regimes, respectively. The study is conducted at various non-dimensional phase speeds c (0.5-2.0, normalized by incoming flow speed) at a constant maximum amplitude of 0.08 and a wavelength of 0.5 (both are normalized by the fin cord length) to imitate the long-based fin. The numerical results indicate that the undulating fin motion with the amplitude envelope gradually increasing from the anterior part to the posterior (conical sinusoidal wave) part may be preferable for thrust generation; undulating with the amplitude envelope increasing from the anterior part to the mid part and decreasing toward the posterior (fusiform sinusoidal wave) presents the superior braking performance when the phase speed is low enough. Moreover, the influence of undulating patterns on the wake structure is analyzed. Through further comparative analysis for propulsion and braking performances, the results obtained here may have instructional significance to the propulsion mechanism in bionic design.

AB The endurance of a deep-sea AUV is closely related to its sailing resistance, the amount of carrying batteries and equipment load, which involves interactions among multiple disciplines. In this paper, in order to develop the conceptual design of a long-range AUV in the early stage, a multidisciplinary optimization design framework is presented for decision-makers to explore the given design space, which takes into account the coupling between the disciplines of hull form, structural design and energy use. A Self-adaptive Surrogate Ensemble (SASE) method is proposed to replace the expensive process of hydrodynamic analysis, a recommended approach by the China Classification Society (CCS) specification is applied to carry out the design of metallic pressure hulls, and the classical lamination theory and Tsai-Wu criteria are adopted in the design of composite pressure hulls. Finally, the evaluation model of AUV endurance is created from the perspective of energy capacity and consumption. The conceptual design of a 200 kg-class AUV is executed to maximize the endurance based on the proposed multidisciplinary optimization design framework. The results show that the most important factors that affect AUV endurance are the velocity and diameter, and the optimum velocity of the AUV increases with the load power. The Sea-Whale 2000 AUV was developed based on the optimal result and the excellent endurance performance in the sea trial validated the effectiveness of the proposed design method in the preliminary design process.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become an essential tool in artificial intelligence, with a wide range of applications such as computer vision, medical diagnosis, security, robotics, and autonomous vehicle. The DNNs deliver the state-of-the-art performance in many applications. The complexity of the DNN models generally increases with application complexity and deployment of complex DNN models requires high computational power. General-purpose processors are unable to process complex DNNs within the required throughput, latency, and power budget. Therefore, domain-specific hardware accelerators are required to provide high computational resources with superior energy efficiency and throughput within a small chip area. In this paper, existing DNN hardware accelerators are reviewed and classified based on the optimization techniques used in their implementations. Each optimization technique generally improves one or more specific performance parameter(s). For example, the hardware optimized for sparse DNNs may provide poor performance for dense DNNs in terms of power and throughput. Therefore, understanding the tradeoff between different hardware accelerators helps to identify the best accelerator model for application deployment. We identify three major areas, ALU, dataflow, and sparsity, in hardware architectures having the potential to improve the overall performance of an accelerator. Existing hardware accelerators for inference are broadly classified into these three categories. As there is no standard model or performance metrics to evaluate the efficiency of the new DNN hardwares in the literature, the classification model can help to identify appropriate performance parameters and benchmark accelerators.

AB To mitigate the problem of multiple unmanned aircraft systems (MUAS) conflicts at low altitude and ensure the operational safety, this paper proposes a Multivariate Combined Conflict Detection (MCCD) method for MUAS by combining the characteristics of nominal and probabilistic trajectory method. Firstly, the structural framework of the MCCD method is established based on the concept of potential conflict pool, and a detection pattern is derived for MUAS. Secondly, a three-dimensional conflict fast detection model is constructed by velocity obstacle methods, which can rapidly detect potential conflict risks. Thirdly, a trajectory prediction model is constructed by using bidirectional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) network, and then a probability-based conflict detection model can be obtained by the expected value and error distribution of trajectory prediction, which can accurately calculate the collision probability of UAS pair. By fully integrating the above models, the fast and accurate detection of MUAS conflicts is achieved. Finally, multiple conflicting trajectories are constructed to analyze the effectiveness of MCCD method, the tests indicate that the average detection time of the proposed method is less than 15ms, the false positive rate is less than 0.01 and the false negative rate is less than 0.0035. The results show that the MCCD has the accuracy advantage and better real-time performance for MUAS conflict detection compared to the method of velocity trend extrapolation, single probabilistic conflict detection and probabilistic neural network.

AB Joint radar and communication (JRC) has recently attracted substantial attention. The first reason is that JRC allows individual radar and communication systems to share spectrum bands and thus improves the spectrum utilization. The second reason is that JRC enables a single hardware platform, e.g., an autonomous vehicle or a UAV, to simultaneously perform the communication function and the radar function. As a result, JRC is able to improve the efficiency of resources, i.e., spectrum and energy, reduce the system size, and minimize the system cost. However, there are several challenges to be solved for the JRC design. In particular, sharing the spectrum imposes the interference caused by the systems, and sharing the hardware platform and energy resource complicates the design of the JRC transmitter and compromises the performance of each function. To address the challenges, several resource management approaches have been recently proposed, and this paper presents a comprehensive literature review on resource management for JRC. First, we give fundamental concepts of JRC, important performance metrics used in JRC systems, and applications of the JRC systems. Then, we review and analyze resource management approaches, i.e., spectrum sharing, power allocation, and interference management, for JRC. In addition, we present security issues to JRC and provide a discussion of countermeasures to the security issues. Finally, we highlight important challenges in the JRC design and discuss future research directions related to JRC.

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS
AB Monitoring and analysis of open air basins is a critical task in waste water plant management. These tasks generally require sampling waters at several hard to access points, be it real time with multiparametric sensor probes, or retrieving water samples. Full automation of these processes would require deploying hundreds (if not thousands) of fixed sensors, unless the sensors can be translated. This work proposes the utilization of robotized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms to work as a virtual high density sensor network, which could analyze in real time or capture samples depending on the robotic UAV equipment. To check the validity of the concept, an instance of the robotized UAV platform has been fully designed and implemented. A multi-agent system approach has been used (implemented over a Robot Operating System, ROS, middleware layer) to define a software architecture able to deal with the different problems, optimizing modularity of the software; in terms of hardware, the UAV platform has been designed and built, as a sample capturing probe. A description on the main features of the multi-agent system proposed, its architecture, and the behavior of several components is discussed. The experimental validation and performance evaluation of the system components has been performed independently for the sake of safety: autonomous flight performance has been tested on-site; the accuracy of the localization technologies deemed as deployable options has been evaluated in controlled flights; and the viability of the sample capture device designed and built has been experimentally tested.

AB This article deals with the development of capacitive voltage divider for high voltage measurements and presents a method of analysis and optimization of its parameters. This divider is a part of a combined voltage and current sensor for measurements in high voltage power networks. The sensor allows continuous monitoring of the network distribution status and performs a quick diagnosis and location of possible network failures. Deployment of these devices will support semi-autonomous control of power networks and it can be considered as a step from traditional power grids toward smart grids. This is a worldwide trend connected with increasing number of renewable energy sources and plug-in electric vehicles as described in. In this way, it contributes to the reliability of the distribution network. Together with automated control techniques and fault location methods, it enables its self-healing capability. The following characteristics required for the sensor include: current measurement error up to 2 %, voltage measurement error up to 0.5 %, and power measurement error up to 5 %. At the same time, it is necessary that the sensor is cost-effective - relatively cheap. There were selected capacitors made in series production for the capacitive divider designing. The capacitive voltage divider was tested in terms of time and temperature stability; the results are described in the paper. Then, the method of mathematical correction of a temperature dependence of the capacitive voltage divider was suggested and tested.

TI Automating Data Collection for Robotic Bridge Inspections
SO JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING

DT Article
ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB Regular bridge inspections are key to maintaining healthy infrastructure and to preventing unanticipated structural failures. In recent years, mobile inspection robots have been proposed as a tool to aid bridge inspections. Their key advantages include the ability to access areas of a bridge that are otherwise difficult to inspect and the ability to automate the process of collecting and processing data to increase repeatability and reliability of inspections. Although software algorithms have successfully demonstrated the ability to automate defect detection, many data collection platforms, such as drones and ground vehicles, still require an operator to control the robot via teleoperation, and they do not adequately address the challenges associated with automating data collection for bridge inspection, which is central to achieve repeatability of inspections over time. In this study, the challenges associated with automating data collection for visual inspection of bridges are addressed using a ground-based robot, and an autonomy framework, which can meet the requirements for management and execution of inspection plans, is presented. Key tasks considered in this study are managing inspection plan execution on a ground-based robot, robot localization and mapping, and autonomous navigation in a bridge environment. This automated data collection framework is demonstrated on a concrete bridge by automatically building an accurate point cloud reconstruction of the bridge. Automating data collection can enable more systematic and repeatable inspections, which is a critical upstream task to constructing deterioration models in structural components using inspection data collected over the lifetime of a bridge.

AB Randomized experiments have enormous potential to improve human welfare in many domains, including healthcare, education, finance, and public policy. However, such "A/B tests" are often criticized on ethical grounds even as similar, untested interventions are implemented without objection. We find robust evidence across 16 studies of 5,873 participants from three diverse populations spanning nine domains-from healthcare to autonomous vehicle design to poverty reduction-that people frequently rate A/B tests designed to establish the comparative effectiveness of two policies or treatments as inappropriate even when universally implementing either A or B, untested, is seen as appropriate. This "A/B effect" is as strong among those with higher educational attainment and science literacy and among relevant professionals. It persists even when there is no reason to prefer A to B and even when recipients are treated unequally and randomly in all conditions (A, B, and A/B). Several remaining explanations for the effect-a belief that consent is required to impose a policy on half of a population but not on the entire population; an aversion to controlled but not to uncontrolled experiments; and a proxy form of the illusion of knowledge (according to which randomized evaluations are unnecessary because experts already do or should know "what works")-appear to contribute to the effect, but none dominates or fully accounts for it. We conclude that rigorously evaluating policies or treatments via pragmatic randomized trials may provoke greater objection than simply implementing those same policies or treatments untested.

AB Lake Superior receives inputs from approximately 2,800 tributaries that provide nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the nearshore zone of this oligotrophic lake. Here, we review the magnitude and timing of tributary export and plume formation in Lake Superior, how these patterns and interactions may shift with global change, and how emerging technologies can be used to better characterize tributary-lake linkages. Peak tributary export occurs during snowmelt-driven spring freshets, with additional pulses during rain-driven storms. Instream processing and transformation of nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can be rapid but varies seasonally in magnitude. Tributary plumes with elevated DOC concentration, higher turbidity, and distinct DOM character can be detected in the nearshore during times of high runoff, but plumes can be quickly transported and diluted by in-lake currents and mixing. Understanding the variability in size and load of these tributary plumes, how they are transported within the lake, and how long they persist may be best addressed with environmental sensors and remote sensing using autonomous and unmanned vehicles. The connections between Lake Superior and its tributaries are vulnerable to climate change, and understanding and predicting future changes to these valuable freshwater resources will require a nuanced and detailed consideration of tributary inputs and interactions in time and space.

AB Some female moths attract male moths by emitting series of pulses of pheromone filaments propagating downwind. The turbulent nature of the wind creates a complex flow environment, and causes the filaments to propagate in the form of patches with varying concentration distributions. Inspired by moth navigation capabilities, we propose a navigation strategy that enables a flier to locate an upwind pulsating odor source in a windy environment using a single threshold-based detection sensor. This optomotor anemotaxis strategy is constructed based on the physical properties of the turbulent flow carrying discrete puffs of odor and does not involve learning, memory, complex decision making or statistical methods. We suggest that in turbulent plumes from a pulsating point source, an instantaneously measurable quantity referred as a "puff crossing time", improves the success rate as compared to the navigation strategies based on temporally regular zigzags due to intermittent contact, or an "internal counter", that do not use this information. Using computer simulations of fliers navigating in turbulent plumes of the pulsating point source for varying flow parameters such as turbulent intensities, plume meandering and wind gusts, we obtained statistics of navigation paths towards the pheromone sources. We quantified the probability of a successful navigation as well as the flight parameters such as the time spent searching and the total flight time, with respect to different turbulent intensities, meandering or gusts. The concepts learned using this model may help to design odor-based navigation of miniature airborne autonomous vehicles.

DT Review
DE Fault diagnosis; Multiple faults; Conflicts; Diagnoses; Hitting sets;
   Spatial mission
AB The paper deals with the application of a formalized fault diagnosis strategy for multiple faults occurring in an autonomous spatial vehicle. The research work draws expertise from a collaboration between the European Space Agency, the "Laboratoire de l'Integration du Materiau au Systeme" and the Thales Alenia Space industry. The goal is to demonstrate the benefits of novel fault diagnosis methods to enhance spacecraft autonomy. The applicative support is the Mars Sample Return mission, a spacecraft mission undertaken jointly by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency. In this paper, a formalized framework, based on first order logic formulas, is detailed and an algorithm based on Boolean algebraic tools is presented in order to cope with the multiple fault diagnosis problem. The method uses the concepts of conflicts and diagnoses and aims at establishing the set of minimal diagnoses which is nothing else than the minimal list of the system components that have been identified to be faulty, solving de facto the fault isolation problem. The paper addresses this problem using jointly the concept of Analytical Redundancy Relations and their associated characteristics called their "supports". With respect to the application, the faulty scenarios concern the failure of sensors in the orbiter during the rendezvous phase of the Mars Sample Return mission. Simulation results from a high-fidelity industrial simulator demonstrate the feasibility and the efficiency of the proposed technique. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Extended range underwater optical imaging techniques can be classified into one of two broad categories; those which use synchronously scanned narrow source and receiver paths to restrict both back-scattered and forward-scattered light reaching the receiver (continuous-wave laser line scan); and those which use pulsed sources and time-gating to remove back-scatter noise ( pulsed laser line scan and pulse-gated laser line scan). Laser line scan systems are observed to perform at up to 5 to 6 optical attenuation lengths, but greater standoff distances are desirable for seabed imaging using the growing fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Currently, a moderate physical separation between laser and receiver is necessary to reject near-field multiple back-scatter, which imposes restrictions on AUV miniaturization. Recent experiments and theoretical modeling reveal that significant imaging improvements are possible over the existing continuous-wave laser line scan systems (LLS), by using a pulsed-gated version of the LLS (PG-LLS). However, the use of such a technique has a greater advantage in reducing the overall form factor over conventional LLS imaging system, as well as providing greater depth-of-field. In this paper, we present experimental results comparing both LLS and PG-LLS systems for several source-receiver separations and standoff distances. These results compare favorably with images obtained from validated LLS image simulation tools, and indicate the potential for reducing the source-receiver separation and therefore the system size.

AB Currently, most of the existing fusion methods ignore the rich multi-source information of different types of sensor nodes in the underwater unknown environment, which makes it challenging for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to accurately perceive the external environment and make actionable decisions. Considering the key issues such as attitude estimation, positioning and obstacle avoidance involved in performing AUV tasks, this paper proposed a Multi-Source Information Fusion (MSIF) model for Spherical Underwater Robots (SURs) we developed based on various low-cost sensors. Multi-source information from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Pressure Sensor Array (PSA), Obstacle Avoidance Sensor Array (OASA), Depth Sensor (DS), Looking-Down Camera (LDC) and Acoustic Communication System (ACS) were fused to enable SUR to obtain high-precision estimated data for attitude estimation, positioning and obstacle avoidance, etc. More precisely, ac-cording to the correlation between the sensors, the optimized model was constructed to compensate for angle errors, velocity errors, orientation errors, etc. Subsequently, a machine learning method using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) was proposed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the MSIF model through feature selection, data training, and feature estimation, etc. Finally, a series of experiments were performed under different scenarios, such as motion and obstacle avoidance experiments. The theoretical derivation and comprehensive evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model, which provided a new reference value for solving issues such as attitude estimation, positioning and obstacle avoidance of AUVs.

AB It is necessary to investigate the dynamic performance during autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) underwater docking to aid in control and to enhance docking safety. Therefore, in this study, the docking hydrodynamic characteristics (including the docking system's streamline, velocity vector, and surface pressure during the overall docking process) of the AUV with conical hood dock are determined by using the dynamic grid technology, and the water drag force situations of the AUV docking with conical hood dock are studied from the perspectives of different velocities, accelerations, navigation modes, and structures. Additionally, the multiple nonlinear regression fits and the preliminary docking test were examined. Furthermore, brief inferences obtained are as follows: First, the maximum pressure is situated at the upstream surface of the dock conical hood and the head of the AUV, and the maximum rotation angle of the streamline is situated at the outermost ring of dock conical hood. Within a specified range, the rotation angle of the streamline affected by the conical hood progressively declines as the AUV docks deeper into the conical hood. Second, low velocity uniform docking, deceleration docking, and chase docking can reduce the drag force to a certain extent during docking. Finally, both arc shape and mesh structure can decrease the water drag force of docking to a specified degree. This research provides a theoretical basis and reference methods for the dynamic research of the docking system, and other related research can be carried out through the methods and results of this research.

AB The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) radar program was conceived in the mid-1970s as a means of utilizing advanced airborne radar and smart munitions technologies to counter the potential of a massive armed vehicle invasion of Western Europe. Initiated by several cooperative research and development programs sponsored by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Program Agency (DARPA) and the U.S. Air Force's Advanced Research Laboratories in Rome, NY, USA, and supplemented by parallel complementary research and devleopment activities within various U.S. Army agencies, the technology was developed and field tested in a series of real-world tactical demonstrations. The demonstrations, conducted at the Air Force's extensive facility in Alamogordo, NM, USA, involved combinations of both stationary and remotely controlled tanks deployed in a variety of configurations and, additionally employed state-of-the-art airborne radar sensors from two different large radar system corporations and two different types of autonomous terminally guided multiple-submunition-based weapons designed to achieve multivehicle kills on each weapon launch. DARPA and Air Force programs that contributed to the success of the tactical demonstrations and the ultimate development and operational deployment of the Joint STARS system included Pave Mover and Assault Breaker. Related Army programs included Airborne Long-range Alerting Radar for MTI (ALARM), Project Periodically Elevated Electronic Kibitzer (PEEK), and Stand Off Target Acquisition System (SOTAS).

AB This article presents a method for mobile robotic systems to reduce the size of 3-D point cloud maps while achieving small localization errors even though the reduced maps are used for localization. Localization with dense depth maps especially in large environments could be computationally expensive, so not affordable for robotic systems with limited computational resources. Since such point cloud data collected using a multichannel 3-D LiDAR have representational redundancy, some amount of the data could be removed for compactness. However, existing methods demand annotations and descriptors defined by human experts or lose important spatial features for accurate localization. We propose a fully-automatic reduction method for reliable navigation of mobile systems with low computing power and limited storage. Given a full 3-D point cloud map, our method generates a graph whose vertices and edges represent robot poses and the similarity between the data collected from a pair of robot poses, respectively. Each robot pose is associated with a point cloud set. We find a dominating set of the graph, which is a subset of robot poses such that the robot can localize reliably only with the point clouds collected from those poses. Experimental results with indoor environments show that our system reduces the amount of map data up to 93% while not exceeding acceptable ranges of average translation and rotation errors, which are 0.25 m and 0.5 degrees, respectively.

AB As a flexible passive 3D sensing means, unsupervised learning of depth from monocular videos is becoming an important research topic. It utilizes the photometric errors between the target view and the synthesized views from its adjacent source views as the loss instead of the difference from the ground truth. Occlusion and scene dynamics in real-world scenes still adversely affect the learning, despite significant progress made recently. In this paper, we show that deliberately manipulating photometric errors can efficiently deal with these difficulties better. We first propose an outlier masking technique that considers the occluded or dynamic pixels as statistical outliers in the photometric error map. With the outlier masking, the network learns the depth of objects that move in the opposite direction to the camera more accurately. To the best of our knowledge, such cases have not been seriously considered in the previous works, even though they pose a high risk in applications like autonomous driving. We also propose an efficient weighted multi-scale scheme to reduce the artifacts in the predicted depth maps. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset and additional experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have verified the proposed approach's effectiveness on depth or ego-motion estimation. Furthermore, for the first time, we evaluate the predicted depth on the regions of dynamic objects and static background separately for both supervised and unsupervised methods. The evaluation further verifies the effectiveness of our proposed technical approach and provides some interesting observations that might inspire future research in this direction.

AB Background: Transportation policies and projects have multiple impacts on health. Research on these impacts can help promote positive and reduce adverse health consequences of decisions made by transportation agencies. Methods: In 2019 the U.S. National Cooperative Highway Research Program published a research roadmap for transportation and public health based on an extensive literature search and key informant interviews. The roadmap identified 44 research gaps and 122 research needs on a wide range of relevant topics. From this list, using pre-established criteria including specificity, equity, potential impact, and long-term usefulness, we selected 20 topics suitable for further research especially in academic settings.
   Results: We present the questions, context, and possible research approach for each of the 20 topics. These topics cover issues ranging from integrating equity into performance measures and developing forecasting models for active travel to incorporating health questions into routine household travel surveys and examining health impacts of autonomous vehicles. We added questions on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on transportation. Discussion: This list will be useful to faculty, researchers, and students as they consider topics for research in transportation and public health. Results of research on these topics could influence transportation decisions in policy making, planning and community participation, capital programming, project design, and implementation. Future leaders of transportation agencies, transportation providers, and advocacy organizations may be more likely to consider transportation policies that incorporate a health perspective if their training includes research findings that increase their awareness of the health impacts of these policies.

AB Morphology analysis (MA)-based roadmapping has been considered an effective means to support the process of technology innovation in a business environment. However, previous research on MA-based roadmaps has commonly focused on the process of developing existing technology roadmaps (TRMs), while the paths of layer expansion for seeking new opportunities is rarely a focus. Thus, the aim of this research is to develop MA-based TRMs by utilizing MA to describe the characteristics of the technology and product layers in the TRMs and apply the improved theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) inventive principles to establish innovation paths for new opportunities with the aid of text mining tools. This study suggests using a morphological matrix to construct existing TRMs by calculating the correlations among different technology and product nodes and two sparse generative topographic mapping (SGTM)-based maps to discover new technology and product opportunities by identifying technology and product development trends and innovation elements in sparse areas, which is the objective of simplifying TRIZ application. To illustrate the performance of the proposed approach, a case study is conducted using patents and product manuals for underwater vehicles, which are becoming popular high-tech and secure tools to explore sub-sea resources. This approach contributes by suggesting a semi-autonomous and systematic procedure to extend the existing MA-based TRM and simplifying TRIZ application according to the occurrence frequency of the keywords.

AB State-of-the-art autonomous vehicles use all kinds of sensors based on light, such as a camera or LIDAR (Laser Imaging Detection And Ranging). These sensors tend to fail when exposed to airborne particles. Ultrasonic sensors have the ability to work in these environments since they have longer wavelengths and are based on acoustics, making them able to pass through the mentioned distortions. However, they have a lower angular resolution compared to their optical counterparts. In this article a 3D in-air sonar sensor is simulated, consisting of a Uniform Rectangular Array similar to the newly developed micro Real Time Imaging Sonar ( mu RTIS) by CoSys-Lab. Different direction of arrival techniques will be compared for an 8 by 8 uniform rectangular microphone array in a simulation environment to investigate the influence of different parameters in a completely controlled environment. We will investigate the influence of the signal-to-noise ratio and number of snapshots to the angular and spatial resolution in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the emitted signal, respectively called the angular and range resolution. We will compare these results with real-life imaging results of the mu RTIS. The results presented in this article show that, despite the fact that in-air sonar applications are limited to only one snapshot, more advanced algorithms than Delay-And-Sum beamforming are viable options, which is confirmed with the real-life data captured by the mu RTIS.

ID BANDWIDTH AGGREGATION; WIRELESS NETWORKS; ASSIGNMENT; CAPACITY
AB With the emergence of connected and autonomous vehicles, sensors are increasingly deployed within cars to support new functionalities. Traffic generated by these sensors congest traditional intra-car networks, such as CAN buses. Furthermore, the large amount of wires needed to connect sensors makes it harder to design cars in a modular way. To alleviate these limitations, we propose, simulate, and implement a hybrid wired/wireless architecture, in which each node is connected to either a wired interface or a wireless interface or both. Specifically, we propose a new protocol, called Hybrid-Backpressure Collection Protocol (Hybrid-BCP), to efficiently collect data from sensors in intra-car networks. Hybrid-BCP is backward-compatible with the CAN bus technology, and builds on the BCP protocol, designed for wireless sensor networks. We theoretically prove that an idealized version of Hybrid-BCP achieves optimal throughput. Our testbed implementation, based on CAN and ZigBee transceivers, demonstrates the load balancing and routing functionalities of Hybrid-BCP and its resilience to DoS attacks and wireless jamming attacks. We further provide simulation results, obtained with the ns-3 simulator and based on real intra-car RSSI traces, that compare between the performance of Hybrid-BCP and a tree-based data collection protocol. Notably, the simulations show that Hybrid-BCP outperforms the tree-based protocol on throughput by 12 percent. The results also show that Hybrid-BCP maintains high packet delivery rate and low packet delay for safety-critical sensors that are directly connected to the sink through wire.

AB This paper describes a novel coordination methodology of autonomous mobile robots for jams in a congested system with bottlenecks. This methodology consists of two approaches based on an interaction force and behavior regulation rule for a robot. The former is for directly controlling velocity of a robot in the behavioral dynamics, and the latter is for amplifying the interaction force so that velocity of a robot is externally reduced in a certain place. In the first approach, a previously-proposed robot behavior control technique by the authors that utilizes the interaction force among robots is improved, and it enables the robots to reduce their velocity in response to not only a jam but also a decelerating robot immediately in front of them. In the second approach, a behavior regulation rule in connection with the interaction force is designed and provided in congested segments on a lane. Thus, the amplified interaction force causes the robots to move more slowly in the congested segments. The improved robot behavior control technique and behavior regulation rule are implemented in simulation experiments and compared to the previous robot behavior control technique and adaptive cruise control (ACC) that has been proposed for vehicles. Furthermore, the improved interaction force and behavior regulation rule are appended to ACC, and the potential of using ACC with the two approaches is discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the improved interaction force and the behavior regulation rule for multi-robot coordination in a congested system with bottlenecks is shown. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Across-shelf transects over the eastern flank of Barrow Canyon were obtained in August 2005 with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Here, the shelf topography creates a " choke" point in which a substantial portion of Pacific inflow from the Bering Strait is concentrated within 30 km of the coast, providing an ideal setup for monitoring the flow with the AUV. Four transects, extending similar to 10 km offshore of Barrow, Alaska, inshore of the similar to 80 m isobath, were used in conjunction with a process-oriented numerical model to diagnose the wind-driven modification of the Alaskan coastal current. Poleward transports of 0.12 Sv were consistent among all sections, although the transport-weighted temperature was about 1 degrees C colder in the transect obtained during peak winds. An idealized numerical model reproduces the observed hydrographic structure and across-shelf circulation reasonably well in that (1) winds were not sufficient to reverse the poleward flow, (2) upwelling was most pronounced in the nearshore, and (3) the onshore return flow occurred throughout the interior as opposed to the bottom boundary layer. The across-shelf circulation provides a possible mechanism for a meltwater intrusion observed on the offshore side of the AUV transect made during peak winds. Also of interest is that the observed anticyclonic shear was much stronger (vertical bar partial derivative u/partial derivative y vertical bar > f) than previously measured in the region.

AB This article is concerned with decentralised output regulation of hierarchical systems subject to input and output disturbances. It is assumed that the disturbance can be represented as the output of an autonomous linear time invariant (LTI) system with an unknown initial state. The primary objective is to design a decentralised controller with the property that not only does it reject the degrading effect of the disturbance on the output (to achieve a satisfactory steady-state performance), it also results in a small linear quadratic (LQ) cost function (implying a good transient behaviour). To this end, the underlying problem is treated in two phases. In the first step, a number of modified systems are defined in terms of the original system. The problem of designing an LQ centralised controller which stabilises all the modified systems and rejects the disturbance in the original system is considered, and it is shown that this centralised controller can be found efficiently by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. In the second step, a method recently presented in the literature is exploited to decentralise the designed centralised controller. It is shown that the obtained controller satisfies the prescribed design specifications including disturbance rejection. Finally, in a more pragmatic context, the system is assumed to be subject to input delay, and a robustness analysis is carried out accordingly. Simulation results elucidate the efficacy of the proposed control law.

AB Swarming is one of the important trends in the development of small multi-rotor UAVs. The stable operation of UAV swarms and air-to-ground cooperative operations depend on precise relative position information within the swarm. Existing relative localization solutions mainly rely on passively received external information or expensive and complex sensors, which are not applicable to the application scenarios of small-rotor UAV swarms. Therefore, we develop a relative localization solution based on airborne monocular sensing data to directly realize real-time relative localization among UAVs. First, we apply the lightweight YOLOv8-pose target detection algorithm to realize the real-time detection of quadcopter UAVs and their rotor motors. Then, to improve the computational efficiency, we make full use of the geometric properties of UAVs to derive a more adaptable algorithm for solving the P3P problem. In order to solve the multi-solution problem when less than four motors are detected, we analytically propose a positive solution determination scheme based on reasonable attitude information. We also introduce the maximum weight of the motor-detection confidence into the calculation of relative localization position to further improve the accuracy. Finally, we conducted simulations and practical experiments on an experimental UAV. The experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, in which the performance of the core algorithm is significantly improved over the classical algorithm. Our research provides viable solutions to free UAV swarms from external information dependence, apply them to complex environments, improve autonomous collaboration, and reduce costs.

AB The demand for oceanic resource exploration and development is increasing, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have emerged as potential tools for ocean exploration. To meet specific operational requirements, AUVs are required to operate in close proximity to the seafloor. However, complex and changeable seafloor terrains have complex spatiotemporal characteristics, which produce unsteady hydrodynamic interference on AUVs, affecting their safety and stability. In order to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of AUVs in turbulent flow fields near seafloor terrains, this study selects a typical dune terrain. Based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, the flow field around an AUV near the seafloor is simulated, and the flow field is solved using the large eddy simulation (LES) method, calculating the AUV's hydrodynamic instantaneous and average characteristics, as well as flow field characteristics at different inflow velocities and distances from the seafloor. The results indicate that when the AUV is situated within the turbulent flow field caused by the terrain, its drag, lift, and pitch moment performance present significant fluctuations. Variations in total resistance are primarily caused by variations in pressure resistance. Variations in lift and pitch moment are more sensitive to variations in the flow field structure. The AUV also affects the development of the turbulent flow field near the terrain. When the AUV is in close proximity to the seafloor, it hampers the development of vortices below it. These results will offer guidance for the maneuverability and control of AUVs in practical engineering applications.

AB Current monocular 3D object detection algorithms generally suffer from inaccurate depth estimation, which leads to reduction of detection accuracy. The depth error from image-to-image generation for the stereo view is insignificant compared with the gap in single-image generation. Therefore, a novel pseudo-monocular 3D object detection framework is proposed, which is called Pseudo-Mono. Particularly, stereo images are brought into monocular 3D detection. Firstly, stereo images are taken as input, then a lightweight depth predictor is used to generate the depth map of input images. Secondly, the left input images obtained from stereo camera are used as subjects, which generate enhanced visual feature and multi-scale depth feature by depth indexing and feature matching probabilities, respectively. Finally, sparse anchors set by the foreground probability maps and the multi-scale feature maps are used as reference points to find the suitable initialization approach of object query. The encoded visual feature is adopted to enhance object query for enabling deep interaction between visual feature and depth feature. Compared with popular monocular 3D object detection methods, Pseudo-Mono is able to achieve richer fine-grained information without additional data input. Extensive experimental results on the datasets of KITTI, NuScenes, and MS-COCO demonstrate the generalizability and portability of the proposed method. The effectiveness and efficiency of Pseudo-Mono have been demonstrated by extensive ablation experiments. Experiments on a real vehicle platform have shown that the proposed method maintains high performance in complex real-world environments.

TI Underwater UXO detection using magnetometry on hovering AUVs

AB The EU-funded project BASTA (Boost Applied munition detection through Smart data inTegration and AI workflows, ) aimed at improving underwater unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection approaches and advancing data acquisition techniques. One aspect of the project was performing autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based magnetic measurements. In this paper, we present the first results of integrating three submersible fluxgate magnetometers to a Girona 500 AUV in the context of underwater UXO detection. The hovering capabilities of these AUVs allow them to maintain a fixed position or to precisely navigate at very low velocities and altitudes. The magnetic sensors are rigidly attached to the nose of the AUV at a lateral distance of 2 m and are arranged in the shape of a vertical triangle, thereby allowing for the calculation of three spatial magnetic gradients. A series of surveys was performed when visiting several munitions dumpsites in the German Baltic Sea. Furthermore, we successfully conducted a test survey with surrogate objects of known magnetic moments in a naval port basin in Kiel, Germany. With a noise floor of approximately 2 nT, the system is capable of reliably detecting munitions similar in size to 81 mm shells from altitudes of 1 m above the seafloor. For ground-truthing purposes and for a concluding confirmation or rejection of a UXO suspicion, the AUV is equipped with a high-resolution camera system. This newly developed system aims at improving the industry standard's technical potentials of autonomously discriminating between hazardous UXO and anthropogenic debris or rocks and therefore reducing the number of target points before underwater UXO clearance campaigns.

AB Blockchain and machine learning (ML) has garnered growing interest as cutting-edge technologies that have witnessed tremendous strides in their respective domains. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and immutable ledger, enabling secure and transparent transactions without intermediaries. Alternatively, ML is a sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers systems to enhance their performance by learning from data. The integration of these data-driven paradigms holds the potential to reinforce data privacy and security, improve data analysis accuracy, and automate complex processes. The confluence of blockchain and ML has sparked increasing interest among scholars and researchers. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis is carried out to investigate the key focus areas, hotspots, potential prospects, and dynamical aspects of the field. This paper evaluates 700 manuscripts drawn from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database, spanning from 2017 to 2022. The analysis is conducted using advanced bibliometric tools (e.g., Bibliometrix R, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace) to assess various aspects of the research area regarding publication productivity, influential articles, prolific authors, the productivity of academic countries and institutions, as well as the intellectual structure in terms of hot topics and emerging trends. The findings suggest that upcoming research should focus on blockchain technology, AI-powered 5G networks, industrial cyber-physical systems, IoT environments, and autonomous vehicles. This paper provides a valuable foundation for both academic scholars and practitioners as they contemplate future projects on the integration of blockchain and ML.

AB Light detection and ranging systems based on optical phased arrays and integrated silicon photonics have sparked a surge of applications over the recent years. This includes applications in sensing, free-space communications, or autonomous vehicles, to name a few. Herein, we report a design of two-dimensional optical phased arrays, which are arranged in a grid of concentric rings. We numerically investigate two designs composed of 110 and 820 elements, respectively. Both single-wavelength (1550 nm) and broadband multi-wavelength (1535 nm to 1565 nm) operations are studied. The proposed phased arrays enable free-space beam steering, offering improved performance with narrow beam divergences of only 0.5 degrees and 0.22 degrees for the 110-element and 820-element arrays, respectively, with a main-to-sidelobe suppression ratio higher than 10 dB. The circular array topology also allows large element spacing far beyond the sub-wavelength-scaled limits that are present in one-dimensional linear or two-dimensional rectangular arrays. Under a single-wavelength operation, a solid-angle steering between 0.21 pi sr and 0.51 pi sr is obtained for 110- and 820-element arrays, respectively, while the beam steering spans the range of 0.24 pi sr and 0.57 pi sr for a multi-wavelength operation. This work opens new opportunities for future optical phased arrays in on-chip photonic applications, in which fast, high-resolution, and broadband beam steering is necessary.

AB Deep neural network-based systems are now state-of-the-art in many robotics tasks, but their application in safety-critical domains remains dangerous without formal guarantees on network robustness. Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was recently shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into another lane. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certifiably robust for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose a robust action under a worst case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. Moreover, the resulting policy comes with a certificate of solution quality, even though the true state and optimal action are unknown to the certifier due to the perturbations. The approach is demonstrated on a deep Q-network (DQN) policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios, a classic control task, and Atari Pong. This article extends our prior work with new performance guarantees, extensions to other reinforcement learning algorithms, expanded results aggregated across more scenarios, an extension into scenarios with adversarial behavior, comparisons with a more computationally expensive method, and visualizations that provide intuition about the robustness algorithm.

AB Abyssal polymetallic nodule fields constitute an unusual deep-sea habitat. The mix of soft sediment and the hard substratum provided by nodules increases the complexity of these environments. Hard substrata typically support a very distinct fauna to that of seabed sediments, and its presence can play a major role in the structuring of benthic assemblages. We assessed the influence of seafloor nodule cover on the megabenthos of a marine conservation area (area of particular environmental interest 6) in the Clarion Clipperton Zone (3950-4250 m water depth) using extensive photographic surveys from an autonomous underwater vehicle. Variations in nodule cover (1-20%) appeared to exert statistically significant differences in faunal standing stocks, some biological diversity attributes, faunal composition, functional group composition, and the distribution of individual species. The standing stock of both the metazoan fauna and the giant protists (xenophyophores) doubled with a very modest initial increase in nodule cover (from 1% to 3%). Perhaps contrary to expectation, we detected little if any substantive variation in biological diversity along the nodule cover gradient. Faunal composition varied continuously along the nodule cover gradient. We discuss these results in the context of potential seabed-mining operations and the associated sustainable management and conservation plans. We note in particular that successful conservation actions will likely require the preservation of areas comprising the full range of nodule cover and not just the low cover areas that are least attractive to mining.

AB We have been focused on the exploitation of the limits of the performance of low cost sensors, used in an integratedway, both for classical and geodetic navigation. In this work, the navigation performance of the Android smartphone's IMU was assessed thoroughly. The raw IMU data from two smartphones, "Xiaomi 8'' and "Honor Play'' were recorded, using different sampling rates, and compared with the measurements, recorded simultaneously from higher grade IMU's. For assessing the navigation capabilities of the smartphones IMU sensors, two kinematic tests were designed. In these tests, the smartphones IMU data were processed using a 15-state Kalman Filter developed by our group, while the reference IMU data were processed using a commercial software. The details of the comparisons between the positioning, velocity and attitude solutions are discussed. The results show that the navigation solutions of both smartphones are quite close to that of the reference IMUs', showing differences of around 0.2 m in positioning, 0.3 m/s in velocity, and 1 degrees in roll and pitch. The quality of the yaw estimation, with an accuracy of a few degrees, is clearly worse than that of the other attitude parameters. However, the results of the second test reveal that using a higher data rate setting for the IMU samplings, it is possible to improve the solution. The assessment study of the smartphone's IMUs performed in this work can be useful for the development of many different applications, including the exploitation for Autonomous Vehicles, Intelligent Transport Systems, and Smart Cities.

AB In this paper, a new framework based on matrix theory is proposed to analyze and design cooperative controls for a group of individual dynamical systems whose outputs are sensed by or communicated to others in an intermittent, dynamically changing, and local manner. In the framework, sensing/communication is described mathematically by a time-varying matrix whose dimension is equal to the number of dynamical systems in the group and whose elements assume piecewise-constant and binary values. Dynamical systems are generally heterogeneous and can be transformed into a canonical form of different, arbitrary, but finite relative degrees. Utilizing a set of new results on augmentation of irreducible matrices and on lower triangulation of reducible matrices, the framework allows a designer to study how a general local-and-output-feedback cooperative control can determine group behaviors of the dynamical systems and to see how changes, of sensing/communication would impact the group behaviors over time. A necessary and sufficient condition on convergence of a multiplicative sequence of reducible row-stochastic (diagonally positive) matrices is explicitly derived, and through simple choices of a gain matrix in the cooperative control law, the overall closed-loop system is shown to exhibit cooperative behaviors (such as single group behavior, multiple group behaviors, adaptive cooperative behavior for the group, and cooperative formation including individual behaviors). Examples, including formation control of nonholonomic systems in the chained form, are used to illustrate the proposed framework.

AB Mobile robots capable of moving autonomously in more or less structured environments are being increasingly employed in the automation of certain industrial processes. Along these lines, the authors constructed a platform, on the base of a commercial industrial truck, provided with sufficient autonomy to carry out tasks within an industrial environment (VIA: Autonomous Industrial Vehicle).
   One of the sensor systems used in the truck is a system of artificial vision which enables it to move on asphalted surfaces both in open environments (roads) and closed ones, seeking the markings which most easily allow it to determine the path marked in the images. The system for following roads is capable of following painted lines, determining the sides of the road by texture analysis or determining the minimum width of the road for the robot to pass, according to the circumstances. A model of the road predicts its situation and enables a decision to be made on whether the information provided by the algorithm is reliable or not. At the same time, a neural network is trained with the results obtained by any of the previous algorithms, in such a way that when the training process converges the network takes over the steering of the truck.
   The vision system, composed of a CCD colour camera and a "frame grabber" installed in a PCI slot of a Pentium 120 PC, provides a path every 100 ms, which allows the industrial truck to be steered at its maximum speed of 10 m/s.

AB Robotic agents are now ubiquitous in both home and work environments; moreover, the degree of task complexity they can undertake is also increasing exponentially. Now that advanced robotic agents are commonplace, the question for utilisation becomes how to enable collaboration of these agents, and indeed, many have considered this over the last decade. If we can leverage the heterogeneous capabilities of multiple agents, not only can we achieve more complex tasks, but we can better position the agents in more chaotic environments and compensate for lacking systems in less sophisticated agents. Environments such as search and rescue, agriculture, autonomous vehicles, and robotic maintenance are just a few examples of complex domains that can leverage collaborative robotics. If the use of a robotic agent is fruitful, the question should be: How can we provide a world state and environment mapping, combined with a communication method, that will allow these robotic agents to freely communicate? Moreover, how can this be decentralised such that agents can be introduced to new and existing environments already understood by other agents? The key problem that is faced is the communication method; however, when looking deeper we also need to consider how the change of an environment is mapped while considering that there are multiple differing sensors. To this end, we present the voxel grid approach for use in a decentralised robotic colony. To validate this, results are presented to show how the single-agent and multiagent systems compare.

AB Unfortunately, accidents caused by bad weather have regularly made headlines throughout history. Some of the more catastrophic events to recently make news include a plane crash, ship collision, railway derailment, and several vehicle accidents. The public's attention has been directed to the severe issue of safety and security under extreme weather conditions, and many studies have been conducted to highlight the susceptibility of transportation services to environmental factors. An automated method of determining the weather's state has gained importance with the development of new technologies and the rise of a new industry: intelligent transportation. Humans are well-suited for determining the temperature from a single photograph. Nevertheless, this is a more challenging problem for a fully autonomous system. The objective of this research is developing a good weather classifier that uses only a single image as input. To resolve quality-of-life challenges, we propose a modified deep-learning method to classify the weather condition. The proposed model is based on the Yolov5 model, which has been hyperparameter tuned with the Learning-without-Forgetting (LwF) approach. We took 1499 images from the Roboflow data repository and divided them into training, validation, and testing sets (70%, 20%, and 10%, respectively). The proposed model has gained 99.19% accuracy. The results demonstrated that the proposed model gained a much higher accuracy level in comparison with existing approaches. In the future, this proposed model may be implemented in real-time.

AB The Intervention-Autonomous Vehicle (I-AUV) as the effective operation equipment in the deep sea is suppressed to the external and physical constraints, which makes it challenging to achieve underwater missions. Aiming at the trajectory tracking control of I-AUV with input saturation and output constraints, a higher-order control barrier function-quadratic program (HoCBF-QP) based control scheme is proposed in this paper considering the uncertainties, disturbance and dynamic interaction. Firstly, a robust adaptive control is presented to track the desired trajectory in a finite time, where a feedback control term, based on the continuous terminal sliding mode (TSM) technique, is designed to improve the tracking performance under the uncertainties, disturbance and dynamic interaction. Secondly, a time-varying HoCBF is further developed to handle the high relative degree time-varying output constraints, then the multiple high-order control barrier functions can bring a family of safety-critical control input to preserve the reachability of AUV posture and joints motion. Thirdly, a convex quadratic program (QP)-based separation control frame is designed to conduct the tracking problem and output satisfaction separately. Due to its globally optimal advantage, the proposed control design provides a flexible frame to track objectives for the constrained I-AUV systems. Comparable simulation results demonstrate the fast convergence, robustness and high tracking accuracy of the proposed HoCBF-QP control for I-AUV systems with constraints.

AB Semantic segmentation of mobile LiDAR point clouds is an essential task in many fields such as road network management, mapping, urban planning, and 3D High Definition (HD) city maps for autonomous vehicles. This study presents an approach to improve the evaluation metrics of deep-learning-based point cloud semantic segmentation using 3D geometric features and filter-based feature selection. Information gain (IG), Chi-square (Chi2), and ReliefF algorithms are used to select relevant features. RandLA-Net and Superpoint Grapgh (SPG), the current and effective deep learning networks, were preferred for applying semantic segmentation. RandLA-Net and SPG were fed by adding geometric features in addition to 3D coordinates (x, y, z) directly without any change in the structure of the point clouds. Experiments were carried out on three challenging mobile LiDAR datasets: Toronto3D, SZTAKI-CityMLS, and Paris. As a result of the study, it was demonstrated that the selection of relevant features improved accuracy in all datasets. For RandLA-Net, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) was 70.1% with the features selected with Chi2 in the Toronto3D dataset, 84.1% mIoU was obtained with the features selected with the IG in the SZTAKI-CityMLS dataset, and 55.2% mIoU with the features selected with the IG and ReliefF in the Paris dataset. For SPG, 69.8% mIoU was obtained with Chi2 in the Toronto3D dataset, 77.5% mIoU was obtained with IG in SZTAKI-CityMLS, and 59.0% mIoU was obtained with IG and ReliefF in Paris.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging computing paradigm that decreases the computing time and extends the lifespan of user equipments (UEs). In MEC, the computational tasks are offloaded from UEs to the base station (BS) at the edge of the network for processing. However, MEC cannot cope with environments where there are no BS or where communication facilities have been destroyed. In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of UAV equipped with MEC servers as a mobile base station to serve users. The problem involves user offloading decision, UAV location and allocation with computational resources, and is a hybrid optimization problem with continuous and discrete variables. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid nature-inspired optimization algorithm (HNIO) and its version for discrete optimization, where HNIO incorporates mutation and population diversity detection mechanisms to boost its global optimization capability, and we design a probabilistic selection-based coding strategy for the discrete optimization version. The experimental study is conducted based on ten cases with different numbers of UEs. Comparing HNIO with several other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, it is concluded from the Friedman and Wilcoxon's test of the experimental results that HNIO shows better precision and stability in nine out of the ten cases with higher number of UEs.

DE Underwater positioning; Federated Kalman filters; Integrated positioning
AB The navigation and positioning subsystem offers important position information for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system. It plays a crucial role during the underwater exploration and operations of AUV. Many scholars research underwater navigation and positioning. Various improved methods and systems were presented. However, as the diversity of the ocean environment, the random drift of the gyroscope, error accumulation, the variety of tasks, and other negative factors, the navigation and positioning results are uncertain and incredible. The accuracy, stability, and robustness are not guaranteed, which cannot meet the increasing application requirement. Therefore, we put forward a SINS/DVL/USBL integrated navigation and positioning IoT system with multiple resource fusion and a federated Kalman filter. In this method, we first present an improved SINS/DVL combined subsystem with a filtering gain compensation strategy. So we can enhance the accuracy and stability of the navigation and position system. Secondly, we proposed a USBL positioning subsystem with the Kalman filtering acoustic signals to improve USBL positioning performance. Lastly, we present a federated Kalman filter to fuse the positioning information from the SINS/DVL combined positioning subsystem and the USBL positioning subsystem. Through the three methods, we can enhance the positioning accuracy and robustness. Comprehensive simulation results indicated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed SINS/DVL/USBL integrated navigation and positioning system, which provides critical reference for other positioning method, and it also offers crucial position information for AUV to achieve high accuracy and efficiency tasks.

AB The Intensity Vector Autonomous Recorder (IVAR) measures acoustic particle velocity and pressure simultaneously. IVAR was deployed on the seabed during the 2017 Seabed Characterization Experiment (SBCEX) with the primary objective to study sound propagation within underwater waveguides for which the seabed consists of fine-grained, muddy sediments. In this study, a Bayesian framework is applied to underwater noise recorded by IVAR from a cargo ship traversing the central region of the SBCEX2017 area for the purpose of inversion to characterize sediment properties. The vector acoustic data are in the form of a bounded, nondimensional form known as circularity, a quantity that is independent of the ship noise-source spectrum and that can be interpreted as the normalized curl of active intensity. The inversion model space for the seabed consists of a low-compressional speed layer and underlying basement half-space, with each having compressional and shear components. The interpretative model for producing a replica of the data is based on the plane wave reflection coefficient for a layered, elastic seabed in conjunction with the depth-dependent Green's function that is integrated in the complex wave number plane to obtain pressure and particle velocity fields. The small change in water depth between the location of the ship source and IVAR is addressed using adiabatic mode theory. The inversion results exhibit slow variation over the 20-min observation period, representing approximately 5 km of travel by the ship source.

AB In contrast to previous works on data augmentation using LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), which mostly consider point clouds under good weather conditions, this paper uses point clouds which are affected by spray. Spray water can be a cause of phantom braking and understanding how to handle the extra detections caused by it is an important step in the development of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)/AV (Autonomous Vehicles) functions. The extra detections caused by spray cannot be safely removed without considering cases in which real solid objects may be present in the same region in which the detections caused by spray take place. As collecting real examples would be extremely difficult, the use of synthetic data is proposed. Real scenes are reconstructed virtually with an added extra object in the spray region, in a way that the detections caused by this obstacle match the characteristics a real object in the same position would have regarding intensity, echo number and occlusion. The detections generated by the obstacle are then used to augment the real data, obtaining, after occlusion effects are added, a good approximation of the desired training data. This data is used to train a classifier achieving an average F-Score of 92. The performance of the classifier is analyzed in detail based on the characteristics of the synthetic object: size, position, reflection, duration. The proposed method can be easily expanded to different kinds of obstacles and classifier types.

AB Non-mechanical beam steerers with lightweight, compact, high-efficiency, high-precision, and/or large-angle are pivotal for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) of autonomous vehicles, eye-tracking for near-eye displays, microscopy, optical tweezers, and high-precision three-dimensional (3D) printing. However, even the most matured optical phased array can only provide quasi-continuous, efficient beam steering within a small angle range. A telescope module with an angle magnification function can be coupled to enlarge the steering range or precision. But obtaining a compact, low-cost, lightweight, high-quality telescope module with conventional optics remains challenging. Patterned liquid crystal-based planar optical elements offer great design freedom for manipulating the phase profile of light in 2D space. Owing to the advantages of high efficiency, thinness, low cost, easy processing, flexibility, and response to environmental stimuli, a plethora of high-quality optical devices have been demonstrated. Here, a miniature planar telescope mediated by liquid crystal polymers is proposed to offer angle magnification independent of incident spatial location. It consists of two cascaded liquid crystal planar optical elements, each performing a predefined mathematical transformation. By this concept, planar optical elements are fabricated using a new exposure method and assembled into planar telescopes with different magnification factors. Within the incident field range, over 84.6% optical efficiency is achieved with small wavefront distortion. Such a miniature planar telescope shows the potential of cascaded liquid crystal planar optical elements for realizing functionalities that cannot be fulfilled by single optical elements, and enables lightweight, low loss, passive optical transmitters for widespread applications.

AB It is broadly accepted that the silicon-based CMOS has touched its scaling limits and alternative substrate materials are needed for future technology nodes. An Indium-Gallium-Arsenide (InGaAs)-based device is well situated for further technology nodes. This material also has better mobility of the electrons and holes for the high performance and real-time system design. The improved mobility helps to increase the operating frequency of the device which is useful for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, InGaAs-based High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) limits the reliability of the device due to the presence of dangling bonds at the channel-gate insulator interfaces. Weak dangling-bonds get broken under electric stress, and positive hydrogen atoms are trapped into the oxide. This charge trapping depends on the material parameters and device geometry. In this paper, the existing Bias-Temperature-Instability (BTI) model is modified based on the material parameters and device geometry. Charge trapping and annealing constants are the most critical BTI model parameters that are modeled and evaluated based on different HEMT material parameters. The proposed model was compared to experimental and TCAD simulation results. The proposed model has been used for lifetime prediction of the InGaAs HEMT-based Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) cell because it is used to store and process the information in the IoT applications.

AB This paper presents the development and experimental validation of a bio-inspired autopilot, called TauPilot, based on the ecological tau theory proposed by the psychologist David Lee. Tau theory postulates that animals and humans use a combination of simple guidance strategies and the tau variable (tau) (representing time-to-contact) to prospectively guide and control most of their purposeful movements. This research investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of applying tau theory principles to guidance and control of movement in four dimensions (three spatial dimensions plus time), with application to various crucial maneuvres of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) such as braking, automated aerial docking and automatic landing. TauPilot includes a tau-guidance system, a tau-navigation system and a tau-controller, resulting in a four-dimensional (4D) guidance, navigation and control system that has the capability to accurately fit maneuvres or actions into 4D slots using only the universal temporal variable, tau. TauPilot has been integrated into two rotorcraft UAS and demonstrated in more than 1000 successful tau-controlled flights. TauPilot provided the UAS with the capability to perform the following maneuvres with high spatial and temporal accuracy: tau-braking, 4D straight- and curved-path tau-docking to a virtual target (a three-dimensional point in space), vertical and 4D coordinated tau-landing, and 4D tau-interception of a moving target point.

AB LiDAR point clouds are significantly impacted by snow in driving scenarios, introducing scattered noise points and phantom objects, thereby compromising the perception capabilities of autonomous driving systems. Current effective methods for removing snow from point clouds largely rely on outlier filters, which mechanically eliminate isolated points. This research proposes a novel translation model for LiDAR point clouds, the 'L-DIG' (LiDAR depth images GAN), built upon refined generative adversarial networks (GANs). This model not only has the capacity to reduce snow noise from point clouds, but it also can artificially synthesize snow points onto clear data. The model is trained using depth image representations of point clouds derived from unpaired datasets, complemented by customized loss functions for depth images to ensure scale and structure consistencies. To amplify the efficacy of snow capture, particularly in the region surrounding the ego vehicle, we have developed a pixel-attention discriminator that operates without downsampling convolutional layers. Concurrently, the other discriminator equipped with two-step downsampling convolutional layers has been engineered to effectively handle snow clusters. This dual-discriminator approach ensures robust and comprehensive performance in tackling diverse snow conditions. The proposed model displays a superior ability to capture snow and object features within LiDAR point clouds. A 3D clustering algorithm is employed to adaptively evaluate different levels of snow conditions, including scattered snowfall and snow swirls. Experimental findings demonstrate an evident de-snowing effect, and the ability to synthesize snow effects.

AB Quadrotor drones have rapidly gained interest recently. Numerous studies are underway for the commercial use of autonomous drones, and distribution businesses especially are taking serious reviews on drone-delivery services. However, there are still many concerns about urban drone operations. The risk of failures and accidents makes it difficult to provide drone-based services in the real world with ease. There have been many studies that introduced supplementary methods to handle drone failures and emergencies. However, we discovered the limitation of the existing methods. Most approaches were improving PID-based control algorithms, which is the dominant drone-control method. This type of low-level approach lacks situation awareness and the ability to handle unexpected situations. This study introduces an event-based control methodology that takes a high-level diagnosing approach that can implement situation awareness via a time-window. While low-level controllers are left to operate drones most of the time in normal situations, our controller operates at a higher level and detects unexpected behaviors and abnormal situations of the drone. We tested our method with real-time 3D computer simulation environments and in several cases, our method was able to detect emergencies that typical PID controllers were not able to handle. We were able to verify that our approach can provide enhanced double safety and better ensure safe drone operations. We hope our discovery can possibly contribute to the advance of real-world drone services in the near future.

AB Featured Application This paper fuses different sensors to form a general high-precision SLAM framework for multi-scene applications. The algorithm framework in this paper can be extended to the fields of autonomous driving, robot navigation, and 3D reconstruction. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an essential feature in many applications of mobile vehicles. To solve the problem of poor positioning accuracy, single use of mapping scene, and unclear structural characteristics in indoor and outdoor SLAM, a new framework of tight coupling of dual lidar inertial odometry is proposed in this paper. Firstly, through external calibration and an adaptive timestamp synchronization algorithm, the horizontal and vertical lidar data are fused, which compensates for the narrow vertical field of view (FOV) of the lidar and makes the characteristics of vertical direction more complete in the mapping process. Secondly, the dual lidar data is tightly coupled with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to eliminate the motion distortion of the dual lidar odometry. Then, the value of the lidar odometry after correcting distortion and the pre-integrated value of IMU are used as constraints to establish a non-linear least-squares objective function. Joint optimization is then performed to obtain the best value of the IMU state values, which will be used to predict the state of IMU at the next time step. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Accessibility is a key concept in the field of transportation, and there is a rich amount of reviews available on this topic which concentrate on certain perspectives. However, none of them presents a comprehensive and quantitative overview on accessibility-related publications. To fill this gap, this study reviewed two decades of publications (during 2000-2019) drawn from Web of Science (WoS), and aims to figure out the evolution pathway of accessibility related studies so that future research directions can be recognized. By employing the bibliometric analysis techniques, this study provides the potential to trace historical and geographic trends at global level, covering leading journals and institutions, keywords characteristics, citation network analysis, and a qualitative review of the most influential papers. The output results show that there is an increasing geographic spread along with the growth spurt of research publications on the topic of accessibility especially since 2010s. Both the keywords' characteristics and citation network analysis help to identify research hot points, categorized as new indicators development and accessibility-based applications. Finally, this paper highlights the need for further studies for those two hot points respectively. It is hoped the results output here could benefit researchers engaging in this field to sharpen their own future research directions, and provide practitioners with a greater understanding of the various types of accessibility metrics and help them to identify the most appropriate practice for their specific situation.

AB While aerial shark spotting has been a standard practice for beach safety for decades, new technologies offer enhanced opportunities, ranging from drones/unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that provide new viewing capabilities, to new apps that provide beachgoers with up-to-date risk analysis before entering the water. This report describes the Sharkeye platform, a first-of-its-kind project to demonstrate personal shark alerting for beachgoers in the water and on land, leveraging innovative UAV image collection, cloud-hosted machine learning detection algorithms, and reporting via smart wearables. To execute, our team developed a novel detection algorithm trained via machine learning based on aerial footage of real sharks and rays collected at local beaches, hosted and deployed the algorithm in the cloud, and integrated push alerts to beachgoers in the water via a shark app to run on smartwatches. The project was successfully trialed in the field in Kiama, Australia, with over 350 detection events recorded, followed by the alerting of multiple smartwatches simultaneously both on land and in the water, and with analysis capable of detecting shark analogues, rays, and surfers in average beach conditions, and all based on -1 h of training data in total. Additional demonstrations showed potential of the system to enable lifeguard-swimmer communication, and the ability to create a network on demand to enable the platform. Our system was developed to provide swimmers and surfers with immediate information via smart apps, empowering lifeguards/lifesavers and beachgoers to prevent unwanted encounters with wildlife before it happens.

DE UW-WSN; Bi-partite graph; Cluster head; Relay-AUV; CB-BG
ID ALGORITHM
AB In an underwater wireless sensor networks, it is very difficult to communicate data over the 3-D underwater acoustic signal. In acoustic communication, there is no proper transmission between a source node to sink node. In existing work, single-hop clustering protocols were used for direct communication from cluster head to base station. Since direct communication is involved, the transmission range is very large and hence the data communication becomes difficult. In proposed work, additional leverage is achieved by introducing multi-hop clustering for speedy data transmission by selecting Relay Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (Relay-AUV) without delay and maximum channel capacity in acoustic wireless communication. The proposed scheme presents Relay-AUV selection algorithm using Contextual Bandit Bi-partite Graph (CB-BG) formulated by multi-hop data transmission, which provides maximum leverage for energy saving in cluster networks. Theoretical analysis and experimental simulation results are evaluated based on performance metrics such as successive transmission rate, throughput, cost of execution time and packet delivery ratio. The results shows that the proposed CB-BG system has maximum increase in data transmission rate of 58.33%, maximum increase in throughput and network throughput of 54.95%, maximum increase in operational time cost of 27.77% and high packet delivery ratio of 66.66%. The results are encouraging and our proposed method is found to be more efficient than the weight matching algorithms and minimum distances relay policies. The proposed CB-BG mechanism performs faster and reliable communication.

TI Modeling Dynamic 3D Environments by Means of The Stixel World
SO IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB Correlation-based stereo vision has proven its power in commercially available driver assistance systems. Recently, real-time dense stereo matching algorithms have become available on inexpensive lowpower FPGA hardware. In order to manage that huge amount of data, a medium-level representation named "Stixel World" has been proposed for further analysis. In this representation the free space in front of the vehicle is limited by adjacent rectangular sticks of a certain width. Distance and height of each so called Stixel are determined by those parts of the obstacle it represents. This Stixel World is a compact but flexible representation of the three-dimensional traffic situation. The underlying model assumption is that objects stand on the ground and have a vertical pose with a flat surface.
   So far, this representation is static since it is computed for each frame independently. Driver assistance, however, is most interested in pose and motion state of obstacles. For this reason, we have introduced a tracking scheme for Stixels. Using the 6D-Vision Kalman filter framework, lateral as well as longitudinal motion is estimated for each Stixel. Thus, grouping Stixels to clusters based on similar motion as well as the detection of moving obstacles turns out to be significantly simplified. The dynamic Stixel World is well suited as a common basis for scene understanding tasks of driver assistance and autonomous systems. Experimental evaluation by using a high performance laser scanner attests the Stixel World outstanding accuracy performance. This contribution has the objective to embrace the work that has been done with respect to the Stixel World.

AB This study presents the development of a biosynthetic fish skin to be used on aquatic robots that can emulate fish. Smoothness of the external surface is desired in improving high propulsive efficiency and maneuvering agility of autonomous underwater vehicles such as the RoboTuna (Triantafyllou, M., and Triantafyllou, G. Sci. Am. 272, 64, 1995). An initial step was to determine the seeding density and select a polymer for the scaffolds. The attachment and proliferation of chinook salmon embryo (CHSE-214) and brown bullhead (BB) cells were studied on different compositions of a poly(ethylene glycol terephthalate) (PEGT) and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) copolymer (Polyactive). Polymer films were used, cast of three different compositions of PEGT/PBT (weight ratios of 55145, 60/40, and 70/30) and two different molecular masses of PEGT (300 and 1000 Da). When a 55 wt% and a 300-Da molecular mass form of PEGT was used, maximum attachment and proliferation of CHSE-214 and BB cells were achieved. Histological studies and immunostaining indicate the presence of collagen and cytokeratins in the extracellular matrix formed after 14 days of culture. Porous scaffolds of PEGT/PBT copolymers were also used for three-dimensional tissue engineering of fish skin, using BB cells. Overall, our results indicate that fish cells can attach, proliferate, and express fish skin components on dense and porous Polyactive scaffolds.

AB Intelligent detection of traffic signs has great potential in autonomous driving. Certain elements can make the detection difficult. In the road images captured by vehicle cameras, there could be various types of traffic sign objects some of which are quite similar. On top of that the complex background is adding additional noise which makes it challenging to balance detection speed and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a real-time traffic sign detection network based on the Anchor-free mechanism to solve this problem. First, we present the idea of reparameterization. In the training stage, the Conv3 x 3 convolution in the feature extraction network CSPDarknet53 is reconstructed to enhance the extraction ability of traffic sign features. In the inference stage, the multi-branch structure is equivalently converted into a single-way structure to improve the inference speed of the model. Second, to improve the accuracy of locating small objects, we introduce the SIoU position regression loss function, which addresses the challenge of sensitive position regression for small objects. Lastly, test results on TT-100K, GTSDB and CCTSDB datasets show that the model can achieve a performance trade-off between speed and accuracy. This paper proposes a model that achieves an inference speed of 153.8 FPS on the CCTSDB dataset when tested on the GTX 2080ti, and a speed of 23.3 FPS on the Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX, demonstrating its ability to perform fast and efficient traffic sign detection on different hardware platforms.

AB Ocean exploration is in its infancy with more than 80% of the oceans still unexplored. Contrary to space exploration, electromagnetic waves have seldom been used underwater because of their heavy absorption by seawater. In this article, we present guidance, navigation, and control systems to steer autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) such that a permanent optical network can be set up between the deep sea and the surface. The challenge is to guarantee that there is consistently a path through the AUV network to relay the signal for an unlimited time despite the finite battery's lifetime of the AUVs. To achieve this, the guidance system combines a decentralized model predictive control (D-MPC) with graph theory to compute the trajectory of each agent relaying the optical signal as well as of redundant agents forming local leader-follower formations with each relay acting as leader of its own subfleet. The D-MPC solves a constrained optimization problem where the communication and collision avoidance constraints are formulated to enable two successive leaders and one of their followers to remain within optical range and thus allowing to immediately re-route the ad hoc network if a leader fails to relay the signal. Its combination with graph theory allows to change the dynamic topology of the swarm, with additional agents diving from a charging station, such that the network can relay the optical signal for an unlimited time.

AB The emergence of ride-sourcing services has radically changed travel behavior and has important implications for future urban mobility. However, despite the growing market for mobility-on-demand (MOD), empirical studies on the operational characteristics of ride-sourcing systems are sparse. This paper provides an exploratory analysis of the operations of ride-sourcing using large-scale dis-aggregate mobility service data and documents the findings. From a case study in Singapore, we found that the demand follows reproducible patterns, which allows for realistic estimates of fleet operations over time and space. High travel demand during peak periods is observed along with a surge in prices (by 1.6 times on average). Shift behavior such as number of shifts, shift duration, and choices of shift start and end time affect fleet operations and fleet utilization rate. From the user metrics, we found that passengers may experience higher waiting and travel time due to the longer distance required to pickup in residential areas, the network congestion in commercial and business districts, and the detouring effects for sharing. Finally, the driver's total and marginal revenue were analyzed, which indicated a lower average revenue per unit time, distance, and service item in a shared ride compared to a single ride. These empirical observations can help understand the spatio-temporal characteristics of ride-sourcing operations in an urban area and provide insights for transportation planning and operations.

AB Near-field (NF) localization is a key research topic in various applications, including autonomous vehicles, real-time tracking, target monitoring, etc. However, the traditional NF localization methods mostly rely on the line-of-sight (LOS) condition, and the performance may suffer degradation when there are lacking LOS paths. In this paper, we introduce a promising technology named reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to resolve the problem and investigate the NF RSS-based localization algorithms. To be specific, we apply RIS to construct virtual line-of-sight (VLOS) paths between the anchor node (AN) and the unknown node (UN) for the sake of addressing the LOS absence problem, and propose the RIS phase adjustment schemes by maximizing the received signal strength (RSS) of the UN. On this basis, we derive the relationship between the azimuth and the phase parameters, and the accurate estimation of the UN's position is derived via weighted least square (WLS) and alternate iteration methods. Next, we further resolve the coexisting problem in terms of LOS and VLOS paths by adjusting the reflection factors. Lastly, we put forward a method for discriminating whether the UN lies in the far-field (FF) or NF of the RIS subparts to minimize the localization error. Several simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

AB Seeking to give unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) a higher level of autonomous control, this study uses edge computing systems to replace the ground control station (GCS) commonly used to control UAVs. Since the GCS belongs to the central control architecture, the edge computing system of the distributed architecture can give drones more flexibility in dealing with changing environmental conditions, allowing them to autonomously and instantly plan their flight path, fly in formation, or even avoid obstacles. Broadcast communications are used to realize UAV-to-UAV communications, thus allocating tasks among a swarm of UAVs and ensuring that each individual UAV collaborates as an integrated member of the group. The dynamic path programming problem for UAV swarm missions uses a two-phase tabu search with a 2-Opt exchange method and an A* search as the path programming algorithm. Distance is taken as a cost function for path programming. The turning points of no-fly zones are then increased and expanded based on drone fleet coverage, thus preventing drones from entering prohibited areas. Unlike previous work, which mostly considers only single no-fly zones, this approach accounts for multiple restricted areas, ensuring that a UAV swarm can complete its assigned task without violating no-fly zones. A drone encountering an obstacle while traveling along the route set by the algorithm will update the map information in real time, allowing for instant recharting of the optimal path to the goal as a reverse search using the D* Lite algorithm.

AB Vehicular networks can aid in traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, and car accidents prevention. Yet, the deployment of these networks has been delayed due to the limited spectrum, especially for the case of unlicensed operations. To handle this issue, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed to permit Wi-Fi devices to operate in the 5.9 GHz band allocated to the intelligent transportation system (ITS). In a recent work, we analyzed the impact of the coexistence of dedicated short range communications (DSRC) and Wi-Fi on future DSRC network deployments by developing a stochastic geometry analytical model that considers a dynamic medium access probability (MAP) of DSRC nodes which uses carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). This previous work was based on the standard 2D homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP) model. In this work, we model the roads using the more applicable but more complex Poisson line process (PLP) Cox point process. We generate performance metrics represented through coverage probability and area system throughput, and we compare these results to our earlier work. The importance of this work is two-fold. First, it allows a further understanding of the impact of DSRC-Wi-Fi coexistence on future DSRC network deployments, and second, it highlights the effectiveness of the PLP in modeling the distribution of vehicles in an area by producing more accurate performance results.

AB Increased global competition has placed a premium on customer satisfaction, and there is a greater demand for manufacturers to be flexible with their products and services. This challenge is usually addressed with the introduction of human operators for precise tasks that require dexterity, flexibility and cognitive decision making. On the other hand, robots, through automation, are very effective in carrying out repetitive, nonergonomic tasks. Owing to the complementary nature of robots' and humans' capabilities, there is an increased interest towards a shared workspace for humans and robots to work together collaboratively, forming the motivation behind the field of human-robot collaboration (HRC). Research in HRC in industry is concerned with the safety of the humans and robots, extent, and modes of collaboration among them, and the level of autonomy and adaptability of robots that can be trained for different tasks. This paper introduces a novel taxonomy of levels of interaction between humans and robots along the lines of SAEs guidelines for autonomous vehicles in response to a need for standard definitions and evolving nature of the field. Research into modes of communication for HRC driven by machine learning are reviewed followed by broad definitions of the types of machine learning. The authors also present a comprehensive review of the machine learning (ML) methodologies and industrial applications of the same in the context of adaptable collaborative robots.

AB Currently, huge amounts of data are produced by edge device. Considering the heavy burden of network bandwidth and the service delay requirements of delay-sensitive applications, processing the data at network edge is a great choice. However, edge devices such as smart wearables, connected and autonomous vehicles usually have several limitations on computational capacity and energy which will influence the quality of service. As an effective and efficient strategy, offloading is widely used to address this issue. But when facing device heterogeneity problem and task complexity increase, service quality degradation and resource utility decrease often occur due to unreasonable task distribution. Since conventional simplex offloading strategies show limited performance in complex environment, we are motivated to design a dynamic regional resource scheduling framework which is able to work effectively taking different indexes into consideration. Thus, in this article we first propose a double offloading framework to simulate the offloading process in real edge scenario which consists of different edge servers and devices. Then we formulate the offloading as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm named asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) as the offloading decision making strategy to balance the workload of edge servers and finally reduce the overhead in terms of energy and time. Comparison experiments for local computing and wide-used DRL algorithm DQN are conducted in a comprehensive benchmark and the results show that our work performs much better on self-adjusting and overhead reduction.

AB Due to the tremendous advancement in interactive multimedia systems and technologies, security has become a major aspect. Advanced technology can be utilized for hacking autonomous systems like Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) in different ways such as spoofing and jamming. It can be spoofed by the injection of fake signals into the sensors. For the protection of the UAVs from the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal spoofing attack, we propose a new methodology by incorporating a machine learning (ML) algorithm such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). A detailed analysis of several learning algorithms is also carried out to choose the suitable learning algorithm for the proposed work. Once the suitable ML algorithm is selected, we perform K-fold analyses to develop other learning models by choosing different values of K-folds thus we called them K-learning models. The purpose of developing K-learning models is to apply voting techniques to the developed K-learning models. Moreover, the signal features used in the proposed work are jitter, jitter (absolute), jitter (local), jitter (RAP), jitter (ppq5), shimmer, shimmer (local), shimmer (dB), shimmer (apq3), shimmer (apq5) and frequency modulation. Based on these features of the signal, we train our proposed model for the detection of counterfeit GPS signals. To gauge the performance of the proposed model, we perform different experimentation analyses such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results and analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed work over existing techniques.

AB Inaccuracy of measurements, associated with most of the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), impede achieving an accurate attitude estimation during autonomous near-hover flight. Moreover, the unmeasured states of the Tip Path Plane (TPP) flapping angles of the main rotor make the estimation and control of unmanned helicopters more challenging. In this paper, an intelligent adaptive fuzzy data fusion algorithm is designed to obtain more accurate estimates of the attitude and flapping angles for a flybarless miniature helicopter. In this algorithm, the filter's measurement noise matrix is continuously adapted using the Innovative-based Adaptive Estimation (IAE) technique. This technique is based on evaluating the discrepancy between the actual and theoretical covariance of the filter's innovation sequence. A well-tuned multi-input, single output Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) takes the value of this evaluated discrepancy and its rate of change as inputs and provides the required adjustment value as an output based on a set of predefined fuzzy rules. Compared to the conventional Kalman Filter (KF) state estimation results, the proposed intelligent estimation results have demonstrated an obvious enhancement in estimating the attitude and the flapping angles. The estimated flapping angles have been also used to estimate the moments and forces of the helicopter rotors under near-hover assumptions. An actual near-hover flight was conducted to validate the performance of the proposed intelligent estimation method. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P>Sistema Zacaton in north-eastern Mexico is host to several deep, water-filled, anoxic, karstic sinkholes (cenotes). These cenotes were explored, mapped, and geochemically and microbiologically sampled by the autonomous underwater vehicle deep phreatic thermal explorer (DEPTHX). The community structure of the filterable fraction of the water column and extensive microbial mats that coat the cenote walls was investigated by comparative analysis of small-subunit (SSU) 16S rRNA gene sequences. Full-length Sanger gene sequence analysis revealed novel microbial diversity that included three putative bacterial candidate phyla and three additional groups that showed high intra-clade distance with poorly characterized bacterial candidate phyla. Limited functional gene sequence analysis in these anoxic environments identified genes associated with methanogenesis, sulfate reduction and anaerobic ammonium oxidation. A directed, barcoded amplicon, multiplex pyrosequencing approach was employed to compare similar to 100 000 bacterial SSU gene sequences from water column and wall microbial mat samples from five cenotes in Sistema Zacaton. A new, high-resolution sequence distribution profile (SDP) method identified changes in specific phylogenetic types (phylotypes) in microbial mats at varied depths; Mantel tests showed a correlation of the genetic distances between mat communities in two cenotes and the geographic location of each cenote. Community structure profiles from the water column of three neighbouring cenotes showed distinct variation; statistically significant differences in the concentration of geochemical constituents suggest that the variation observed in microbial communities between neighbouring cenotes are due to geochemical variation.

AB A novel underwater body geometry inspired from the morphology of Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer) fish is developed, and its hydrodynamic coefficients for different combinations of angle of attack and drift angle are investigated using RANS-based CFD methods. The six degrees of freedom manoeuvring performance is evaluated by the calculation of surge, sway and heave forces and roll, pitch and yaw moments at Reynolds number 3.7 x 106. The numerical model is validated using experimental results for DARPA SUBOFF model. The sea bass sectional geometry has an inherent asymmetry about the horizontal plane, and this is observed in the force and moment coefficients. A detailed study for pressure coefficient and skin friction coefficient is presented, both along the length and circumferentially at specified locations for varying angles of attack and drift angles (-15 degrees to 15 degrees). Due to transverse pressure gradient, cross-flow structures are observed resulting in vortices from the midbody that grow downstream, the strength depending on the angle of manoeuvre. It is observed that the sea bassinspired body generates greater roll and pitch moments and heave force as compared to a symmetric tunainspired body for drift angles greater than 10 degrees. The differences show the influence of asymmetry in underwater vessel geometry on its stability and performance during horizontal and vertical plane manoeuvres. The study of the hydrodynamic characteristics will aid the design of control surfaces and development of estimation of manoeuvring and propulsion performance for fish-inspired autonomous underwater vessels.

AB This paper addresses an artificial intelligence-based platoon control (AIPC) problem of autonomous off-axle hitching tractor-trailer wheeled mobile robots (TTWMRs) in a planar motion. Towards this end, a novel saturated nonlinear interval type-2 neuro-fuzzy reinforcement learning controller is proposed to construct a convoy-like motion of TTWMRs. To overcome the cutting-corner phenomenon in the platoon motion, the curvature of the reference trajectory is estimated and the cutting-corner behaviour is pre-vented. In order to deal with the situation where the velocity and acceleration signals are not measurable or corrupted by the measurement noise, a high-gain observer (HGO) is employed. The prescribed perfor-mance control (PPC) is also engaged in the control design procedure to guarantee inter-vehicular com-munication preservation, collision prevention between each consecutive pair in the platoon, singularity cancellation, and some prespecified desired characteristics of the convoy formation tracking errors such as maximum undershoot/overshoot, convergence rate, and final tracking precision. The Lyapunov-based stability analysis reveals semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) convergence of tracking er-rors for the entire platoon system. With the suggested control framework, simulations and comparisons are conducted in which the control performance is considerably improved compared with the existing literature.

ID POINT
AB Nowadays, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have been increasingly used in robotics, particularly in autonomous vehicles, for localization and mapping tasks. However, the use of LiDAR simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in various scenarios is still limited. In this article, we propose a LiDAR SLAM system that addresses this issue by grouping consistent and stable geometry feature to better express the environmental properties in both odometry and loop closure detection. Specifically, to achieve stable geometry feature extraction in the LiDAR odometry component, we adapt an adaptive feature extraction technique that extracts planar, linear, and point features. In addition, we cluster the extracted geometry features to filter out noise. We also analyze the geometry feature matching error and constraint consistency to ensure that the constraints built from these features are stable and repeatable. For the global optimization component, we construct a three-stage loop closure detection approach based on the distribution of geometry feature groups and their corresponding relationships. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) dataset, MulRan dataset, and a dataset collected on university campus demonstrate the adaptability, accuracy, and repeatability of our method. In conclusion, our proposed LiDAR SLAM system improves the performance in complex and diverse scenarios by implementing stable geometry feature extraction, effective feature constraint classification, and accurate loop closure detection. The source code of our approach is available at https://github.com/qq1962572025/GeometrySLAM.

   RELAMINARIZATION; AIRFOIL; PLATE; LES
AB The flow around a circular arc is governed by the effect of the sharp leading edge and the arc's curvature. There is a range of incidences where a leading-edge separation bubble (LESB) is formed on the convex side of the arc, and the reattached boundary layer separates further downstream. Akin to foils and cylinders, for increasing values of the Reynolds number, the boundary layer turns from laminar to turbulent resulting in a step change in the forces, here termed force crisis. This phenomenon is characterized experimentally for an arc with a camber-to-chord ratio of 0.22 and for a range of the Reynolds number from 53 530 to 218 000. Forces are measured both in a towing tank and in a water tunnel, and particle image velocimetry is undertaken in the water tunnel. In stark contrast to cylinders, where the force crisis is associated with the laminar-to-turbulent transition of the boundary layer, here, it is found to be associated with the suppressed relaminarization of the boundary layer. In fact, the LESB is always turbulent at the tested conditions, and relaminarization occurs up to a combination of critical angles of attack and critical Reynolds numbers. The critical angle of attack varies linearly with the Reynolds number. These results may contribute to the design of thin cambered wings, sails, and blades at a transitional Reynolds number such as the wings of micro aerial vehicles, swept wings in subsonic flight, turbomachinery blades, and the sails of autonomous sailing vessels.

AB Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks have attracted much attention due to various applications. However, routing voids lead performance degradation of UASNs in terms of network connectivity and packet delivery ratio. In this paper, we propose a Routing Void Prediction and Repairing (RVPR) algorithm in AUV-assisted UASNs, which utilizes AUVs to carry sensor nodes to repair the routing voids when foreseeing the occurrence of voids. First, the repair position is calculated based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm by maximizing the connectivity of the void area and minimizing the AUV moving distance. Then, the routing void prediction based on Markov chain model is proposed to ensure that the AUVs come to the repair task before the voids have already formed. Next, we design a task selecting rule to let the AUVs choose the most important and urgent repair task. Lastly, RVPR applies an energy-efficient interaction mechanism among nodes and AUVs, which guarantees reliable operation of the algorithm. In the simulation, the RVPR algorithm is applied in several different types of routing protocols (HHVBF, QELAR, EAVARP). The simulation results show that RVPR algorithm improves the protocol performances in terms of the packet delivery ratio and the link connection. More specifically, when there are 100 nodes deployed in the network, the packet delivery ratio of HHVBF, EAVAPR and QELAR employing RVPR are increased by 29.4%,79% and 65% respectively.

AB A multiagent system is considered, which is tasked with the objective of approaching a predetermined target from a desired region to minimize detection and then simultaneously converge at the target. The considered cooperative timing problem consists of 2 stages: navigation and simultaneous arrival. During the navigation stage, the agents are driven from a distant starting point toward the target while restricting their motion within a desired area. Only a few agents (ie, leaders) are equipped with the desired bearing information to the target, whereas the remaining agents (ie, followers) may only have local feedback with neighboring agents to coordinate their headings. No range information to the target and no absolute or other relative position information among agents are available. The arrival stage begins when agents enter a neighborhood of the target (ie, range information becomes available during the arrival stage), and agents coordinate their motion to perform simultaneous arrival. The agents could experience random loss of communication with immediate neighbors, which results in a stochastic communication network. On the basis of the random communication network, balanced containment control is developed, which almost surely restricts the motion of the group within a desired region while equally spacing the agents. An almost sure consensus algorithm is designed for agents to coordinate the simultaneous arrival time by achieving a consensus on informed agents during the arrival stage. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the developed approach.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Terrain aided navigation (TAN) is a promising approach to bound accumulated errors inherent to inertial navigation system by comparing terrain measurement with a reference map. Due to the non-linear nature of terrain, particle filters (PFs) are extensively studied for TAN because of its strong capability of dealing with non-linear problems. So far, most existing PFs for TAN manually select a fixed number of sampling particles during the entire filtering process. However, it can be highly inefficient, since the probability distribution of the state often varies drastically over time. To improve the efficiency, the Fox's adaptive PF based on Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) is introduced for TAN, referred to as the normal KLD-PF here. In the normal KLD-PF, the number of sampling particles is adjusted online by KLD-sampling according to the size of state space. However, the normal KLD-PF has a fixed bin size, which easily causes the number of particles to surge at the early filtering stage. Thus, an improved KLD-PF with a variable bin size is proposed through limiting the total number of particles below certain value. Using a multi-beam sonar, simulation experiments with real underwater reference map demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB Geoacoustic characterization of wide areas through inversion requires easily deployable configurations including free-drifting platforms, underwater gliders and autonomous vehicles, typically performing repeated transmissions during their course. In this paper, the inverse problem is formulated as sequential Bayesian filtering to take advantage of repeated transmission measurements. Nonlinear Kalman filters implement a random-walk model for geometry and environment and an acoustic propagation code in the measurement model. Data from MREA/BP07 sea trials are tested consisting of multitone and frequency-modulated signals (bands: 0.25-0.8 and 0.8-1.6 kHz) received on a shallow vertical array of four hydrophones 5-m spaced drifting over 0.7-1.6 km range. Space- and time-coherent processing are applied to the respective signal types. Kalman filter outputs are compared to a sequence of global optimizations performed independently on each received signal. For both signal types, the sequential approach is more accurate but also more efficient. Due to frequency diversity, the processing of modulated signals produces a more stable tracking. Although an extended Kalman filter provides comparable estimates of the tracked parameters, the ensemble Kalman filter is necessary to properly assess uncertainty. In spite of mild range dependence and simplified bottom model, all tracked geoacoustic parameters are consistent with high-resolution seismic profiling, core logging P-wave velocity, and previous inversion results with fixed geometries.

DT Article
AB Two mass spectrometers (MS) are tested for the measurement of volatile substances, Such as hydrocarbons and metabolic gases, in natural waters. KOALA is a backpackable MS operated from above the water surface, in which samples are pumped through a flow cell using a syringe. NEREUS is all underwater instrument hosted by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that is linked to a communications network to provide chemical data in real time. The mass analyzers of the two MS are nearly identical cycloids, and both use flat-plate membrane inlets. Testing took place in an eutrophic, thermally stratified lake exhibiting steep chemical gradients and significant levels of methane. KOALA provided rapid multispecies analysis of dissolved gases, with a detection limit for methane of 0.1 ppm (readily extendable to 0.01 ppm) and savings of time of at least a factor of 10 compared to that of conventional analysis. The AUV-mounted NEREUS additionally provided rapid spatial coverage and the capability of performing chemical surveys autonomously. Tests demonstrated the need for temperature control of a membrane inlet when steep thermal gradients are present in a water body, as well as the benefits of co-locating all sensors on the AUV to avoid interference from chemically different waters entering and draining from the free-flooding outer hull. The ability to measure dissolved volatiles provided by MS offers potential for complementarity with ionic sensors in the Study of natural waters, Such as in the case of the carbonate system.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the online localization of mobile (service) robots in real world dynamic environments. Most of the techniques developed so far have been designed for static environments. What is presented here is a novel technique for mobile robot localization in quasi-dynamic environments.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach employs a probability grid map and Baye's filtering techniques. The former is used for representing the possible changes in the surrounding environment which a robot might have to face.
   Findings - Simulation and experimental results show that this approach has a high degree of robustness by taking into account both sensor and world uncertainty. The methodology has been tested under different environment scenarios where diverse complex objects having different sizes and shapes were used to represent movable and non-movable entities.
   Practical implications - The results can be applied to diverse robotic systems that need to move in changing indoor environments such as hospitals and places where people might require assistance from autonomous robotic devices. The methodology is fast, efficient and can be used in fast-moving robots, allowing them to perform complex operations such as path planning and navigation in real time.
   Originality/value - What is proposed here is a novel mobile robot localization approach that enables unmanned vehicles to effectively move in real time and know their current location in dynamic environments. Such an approach consists of two steps: a generation of the probability grid map; and a recursive position estimation methodology employing a variant of the Baye's filter.

AB Over the last 20 years, there have been tremendous intellectual and technological advancements in the fields of muscle biophysics, biomechanics, and musculoskeletal modeling. These advances have fueled a revolution in integrative muscle physiology. Whereas 20 years ago the notion of understanding the function and design of a muscular system from the molecular to the whole animal level was a dream, it is now becoming a reality. Fish represent an exceptional model for understanding the function and design of the muscular system of vertebrates. There are two fundamental reasons for this preeminence. First, the unique anatomical separation of the different muscle fiber types has made fish the most tractable model (i.e., the use and properties of the different muscle fiber types can be most easily studied). Second, fish utilize the broadest range of movement than any vertebrate. This diversity of movement imposes a wide array of challenges on the muscular system of fish and at the same time enables physiologists/biomechanists to observe how these challenges have been met. These features have permitted us to extract a number of general principles of actuation and control that have evolved over millions of years. Rather than summarizing the considerable literature on fish muscle function and fish swimming, this paper will focus narrowly on a relatively few studies that permit us to extract principles of actuation. These principles may in turn provide some insights into the design and construction of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).

AB Since the start of the industrial revolution, human activities have caused a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, which have, in turn, had an impact on climate leading to global warming and ocean acidification. Various approaches have been proposed to reduce atmospheric CO2. The Martin (or iron) hypothesis suggests that ocean iron fertilization (OIF) could be an effective method for stimulating oceanic carbon sequestration through the biological pump in iron-limited, high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions. To test the Martin hypothesis, 13 artificial OIF (aOIF) experiments have been performed since 1990 in HNLC regions. These aOIF field experiments have demonstrated that primary production (PP) can be significantly enhanced by the artificial addition of iron. However, except in the Southern Ocean (SO) European Iron Fertilization Experiment (EIFEX), no significant change in the effectiveness of aOIF (i.e., the amount of iron-induced carbon export flux below the winter mixed layer depth, MLD) has been detected. These results, including possible side effects, have been debated amongst those who support and oppose aOIF experimentation, and many questions concerning the effectiveness of scientific aOIF, environmental side effects, and international aOIF law frameworks remain. In the context of increasing global and political concerns associated with climate change, it is valuable to examine the validity and usefulness of the aOIF experiments. Furthermore, it is logical to carry out such experiments because they allow one to study how plankton-based ecosystems work by providing insight into mechanisms operating in real time and under in situ conditions. To maximize the effectiveness of aOIF experiments under international aOIF regulations in the future, we therefore suggest a design that incorporates several components. (1) Experiments conducted in the center of an eddy structure when grazing pressure is low and silicate levels are high (e.g., in the SO south of the polar front during early summer) (2) Shipboard observations extending over a minimum of similar to 40 days, with multiple iron injections (at least two or three iron infusions of similar to 2000 kg with an interval of similar to 10-15 days to fertilize a patch of 300 km(2) and obtain a similar to 2 nM concentration). (3) Tracing of the iron-fertilized patch using both physical (e.g., a drifting buoy) and biogeochemical (e.g., sulfur hexafluoride, photosynthetic quantum efficiency, and partial pressure of CO2) tracers. (4) Employment of neutrally buoyant sediment traps (NBST) and application of the water-column-derived thorium-234 (Th-234) method at two depths (i.e., just below the in situ MLD and at the winter MLD), with autonomous profilers equipped with an underwater video profiler (UVP) and a transmissometer. (5) Monitoring of side effects on marine/ocean ecosystems, including production of climate-relevant gases (e.g., nitrous oxide, N2O; dimethyl sulfide, DMS; and halogenated volatile organic compounds, HVOCs), decline in oxygen inventory, and development of toxic algae blooms, with optical-sensor-equipped autonomous moored profilers and/or autonomous benthic vehicles. Lastly, we introduce the scientific aOIF experimental design guidelines for a future Korean Iron Fertilization Experiment in the Southern Ocean (KIFES).

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrated systems that combine software and physical components. CPS has experienced rapid growth over the past decade in fields as disparate as telemedicine, smart manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things, industrial control systems, smart power grids, remote laboratory environments, and many more. With the widespread integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in various aspects of contemporary society, the frequency of malicious assaults carried out by adversaries has experienced a substantial surge in recent times. Incidents targeting vital civilian infrastructure, such as electrical power grids and oil pipelines, have become alarmingly common due to the expanded connectivity to the public internet, which significantly expands the vulnerability of CPS. This article presents a comprehensive review of existing literature that examines the latest advancements in anomaly detection techniques for identifying security threats in Cyber-Physical Systems. The primary emphasis is placed on addressing life safety concerns within industrial control networks (ICS). A total of 296 papers are reviewed, with common themes and research gaps identified. This paper makes a novel contribution by identifying the key challenges that remain in the field, which include resource constraints, a lack of standardized communication protocols, extreme heterogeneity that hampers industry consensus, and different information security priorities between Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) networks. Potential solutions and/or opportunities for further research are identified to address these selected challenges.

AB Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) have been a subject undergoing intense study since they provide good potential regarding reducing the cost, increasing safety, reliability, efficiency and sustainability. The complexity of the ASVs needs to be tested to gain trust and to prevent fatal consequences. This paper proposes a method using fuzzy logic for evaluating the compliance of Collision-Avoidance Systems (CAS) with regard to the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG). For the proof-of -concept purpose, the set of rules for open sea and full visibility is considered; but the framework from this paper can be extended to include narrow channels, traffic separation schemes and restricted visibility by added more fuzzy rules. Fuzzy logic allows handling vague terms and represents linguistic variables and values written in COLREG in a quantitative mathematical form without introducing sharp assumptions or specifications to original COLREG. The paper develops four evaluation systems (1) evaluation of all vessels in pairwise encounters, (2) ownship (OS) evaluation in pairwise encounters for the interest of Class societies, (3) evaluation of all vessels in multiple-vessel encounters, and (4) OS evaluation in multiple-vessel encounters for the interest of Class societies. The designed systems were verified on a set of simulated scenarios. The obtained results were validated against visual assessment of the trajectory, heading and speed plots. The results showed that the evaluation systems provided variables that would be challenging or impossible to obtain by visual assessment.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered as a promising solution to assist terrestrial networks in future wireless networks (i.e., beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation (6G)). The convergence of various technologies requires future wireless networks to provide multiple functionalities, including communication, computing, control, and caching (4Cs), necessary for applications such as connected robotics and autonomous systems. The majority of existing works consider the developments in 4Cs individually, which limits the cooperation among 4Cs for potential gains The limited resources at the network edge call for holistic management of the resources, which requires joint optimization. This survey provides a comprehensive review of holistic resources management in UAV-assisted wireless networks. The integrated resource management considers the challenges associated with aerial networks, such as 3D placement of UAV, trajectory planning, channel modelling, backhaul connectivity, and the challenges related to terrestrial networks, such as limited bandwidth, power, and interference. We briefly present architectures (source-UAV-destination and UAV- destination architecture) and 4Cs in UAV-assisted wireless networks. We then provide a detailed discussion on resource management by categorizing the optimization problems into individual or combinations of two (communication and computation) or three (communication, computation and control). Moreover, solution approaches and performance metrics are discussed and analysed for different objectives and problem types. Finally, the insight about the potential future research areas to address the challenges of holistic resource management in UAV-assisted wireless networks are discussed.

AB The safety of automotive Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is of great significance to prevent fatigue driving, improve driving comfort, reduce accident rate and promote the development of intelligent transportation and autonomous driving technology. However, the current safety analysis of ACC lacks consideration of the temporal dynamic property, so it is necessary to establish a set of safety analysis methods to consider the temporal characteristics. This paper proposes a new safety analysis method based on MBSA framework and introduces temporal features. Altarica3.0 is a high-level modeling language for safety analysis, and its basic mathematical form is Guardian Transformation System (GTS). In this paper, we outline an analysis approach that converts failure behavioral models (GTS) to temporal fault trees (TFTs), which can be analyzed using Pandora a recent technique for introducing temporal logic to fault trees. However, like classical fault tree analysis, TFT analysis requires a lot of manual effort, which makes it time consuming and expensive. In order to improve the safety of the system, the proposal extends Bayesian Networks with Pandora and results to dependability analysis with temporal relationships to provide more reliable basis for safety design. As a typical case study, the safety analysis method proposed in this paper is applied to the safety analysis of adaptive cruise system, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, it also provides new technologies for the automation and intelligence of safety analysis for smart internet of vehicle.

AB In this paper, the dynamic behavior of flat faced deformable autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subjected to hydroelastic water entry impact is numerically investigated by using Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method. The experiments on the flat faced AUV head section of 200 mm diameter are carried out in a water tank to validate the numerical model by comparing the impact accelerations and underwater cavity evolution by using accelerometers and high speed cameras. Then, the effect of hydroelasticity is numerically investigated by comparing the impact characteristics of rigid and deformable AUV with different rigidities. It is revealed that the hydroelastic effect increases with the decrease in the rigidity of the structure. Mechanical behavior of deformable AUV of various rigidities under the initial conditions of same velocity, same kinetic energy and same mass is examined. The influence of various initial conditions on the hydrodynamic load, impact pressure and effective strain for deformable AUV are discussed. The influence of the water entry angle and impact velocity on the semirigid and deformable AUVs are also studied. It is found that the effective strain increases exponentially with the increase in impact velocity and entry angle for deformable AUV, however, semi-rigid AUV exhibit linear strain behavior. Numerical conclusions drawn from this study are vital in selecting the rigidity of AUV and highlighted the influence of hydroelasticity for flat faced AUVs. Additionally, the results obtained in this study can be beneficial for the structural design of high speed air launched AUVs.

AB Energy consumption is a critical issue in the design of wireless underwater sensor networks (WUSNs). Data transfer in the harsh underwater channel requires higher transmission powers compared to an equivalent terrestrial-based network to achieve the same range. However, battery-operated underwater sensor nodes are energy-constrained and require that they transmit with low power to conserve power. Clustering is a technique for partitioning wireless networks into groups where a local base station (cluster head) is only one hop away. Due to the proximity to the cluster head, sensor nodes can lower their transmitting power, thereby improving the network energy efficiency. This paper describes the implementation of a new clusteringalgorithm to prolong the lifetime ofWUSNs. We propose a newprotocol called distance- and energy-constrained k-means clustering scheme (DEKCS) for clusterhead selection. A potential clusterhead is selected basedon its position in the cluster and based on its residual battery level. We dynamically update the residual energy thresholds set for potential cluster heads to ensure that the network fully runs out of energy before it becomes disconnected. Also, we leverage the elbow method to dynamically select the optimal number of clusters according to the network size, thereby making the network scalable. Our evaluations show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) protocol by over 90% and an optimised version of LEACH based on k- means clustering by 42%.

AB The risk toward human lives in situations involving chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats can be mitigated or even neutralized by deploying carrying a suite of suitable sensors. Furthermore, mobile robots open up the possibility for automated radiological field surveys and monitoring operations, which have important applications in scenarios with CBRN threats. A path planner is one of the essential tools required for these robots to perform their tasks autonomously. Moreover, sophisticated path planners can greatly increase the efficiency of monitoring tasks by maximizing the information gathered in the minimum amount of time. This work proposes an informative path planner as an instrument to efficiently estimate maps of scalar quantities (e.g., radiation intensity, chemical concentration), motivated by applications in radiological inspection. The proposed path planner models the path with B-splines, enabling planning in continuous space. A Gaussian Process with a squared exponential kernel is used to model the underlying field. A modified form of mutual information, estimated from the Gaussian Process, is maximized to determine the most informative path, additionally rewarding observations made in regions where the field magnitude is large (e.g., near a radioactive source). A maximum likelihood estimator for source parameters is used to demonstrate that the proposed solution increases the accuracy of the estimated source positions. Simulation results show that the informative path planner adapts to non-convex environments and increases the number of observations made close to radioactive sources while avoiding obstacles.

ID BURDEN
AB Background: Road traffic injuries (RTIs) have become a considerable issue for children. In China, RTIs are among the top 3 contributors to injury-related mortality and disability-adjusted life years. The present study aimed to evaluate social and environmental factors that may contribute to RTIs among children under 5 in rural areas of China. Methods: The study was based on 1 year of data (October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016) from the National Maternal and Child Health Surveillance System (NMCHSS) from all districts in 334 National Maternal and Child Health Surveillance Districts in 30 Chinese provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. Data were analyzed to identify environmental, social, and primary caregiver factors related to RTIs among children under 5. Results: Based on data for the 279 children registered in the NMCHSS during the study period, incidence of RTIs increased with increasing age and was higher for boys than girls. Risk of RTIs depended on distances from the child's home to roads and playgrounds. Enrollment in kindergarten and characteristics of primary caregivers affected risky road behaviors by children. Most primary caregivers (67.4%) reported never using child car seats, and 70.6% reported never using a child helmet. Among primary caregivers without a driver's license, 24.8% reported having driven motor vehicles or motorcycles. Conclusions: The living environment and behaviors of primary caregivers can affect risk of RTIs in children younger than 5 years in rural China. Road safety awareness should be strengthened at the community and kindergarten levels.

AB This paper presents a method to determine the performance of shuttle-based storage and retrieval systems (SBS/RS) with tier-captive single-aisle shuttles and class-based storage policy. The use of this approach takes place both in the design process of SBS/RS and in the redesign process of SBS/RS. With this approach, it is possible to evaluate performance improvement by applying a class-based storage policy. Another beneficial scope of application of this approach is the evaluation of the placement of different classes throughout the rack to achieve the maximum throughput. The basis of this calculation method was a continuous-time open-queueing model with limited capacity. The cycle times of lifts and shuttles, as determined by a spatial value approach combined with a probability-based approach to mention the storage policy, could be directly used in the presented method with their time distributions. The data used herein were provided by a European material handling provider. An example was presented to outline how this calculation model can be used for optimizing the already existing SBS/RS via the application of a class-based storage policy. Through the example, depending on the configuration of the policy, applying the class-based storage to an existing SBS/RS would increase the throughput by up to twice the throughput without class-based storage policy.

AB Visual tracking of multiple objects is an essential component for a perception system in autonomous driving vehicles. One of the favorable approaches is the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which links current detection hypotheses to previously estimated object trajectories (also known as tracks) by searching appearance or motion similarities between them. As this search operation is usually based on a very limited spatial or temporal locality, the association can fail in cases of motion noise or long-term occlusion. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking method that solves this problem by putting together information from both enlarged structural and temporal domain. For efficiency without loss of optimality, this approach is decomposed in to three stages, with each dealing with only one constrained association task, and thus, it follows the alternating optimization fashion. In our approach, detections are first assembled into small tracklets based on meta-measurements of object affinity. The association task for tracklets-to-tracks is solved by structural information based on a motion pattern between them. Here, we propose new rules to decouple the processing time from the tracklet length. Furthermore, constraints from temporal domain are introduced to recover objects, which are long-time disappearing due to failed detection or long-term occlusion. By putting together the heterogeneous domain information, our approach exhibits an improved state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. With relatively little processing time, an online and real-time tracking is also permitted in our approach.

AB Underwater surveillance has traditionally been carried out by means of surface and undersea manned vessels equipped with advanced sensor systems. This approach is often costly and manpower intensive. Marine robotics is an emerging technological area that enables the development of advanced networks for underwater surveillance applications. In contrast with the use of standard assets, these advanced networks are typically composed of small, low-power, and possibly mobile robots, which have limited endurance, processing and wireless communication capabilities. When deployed in a region of interest, these robots can cooperatively form an intelligent network achieving high performance with significant features of scalability, adaptability, robustness, persistence and reliability. Such networks of robots can be the enabling technology for a wide range of applications in the maritime domain. However, they also introduce new challenges for underwater distributed sensing, data processing and analysis, autonomy and communications. The main thrust of this study is to review the underwater surveillance scenario within a framework of four research areas: (i) underwater robotics, (ii) acoustic signal processing, (iii) tracking and distributed information fusion, and (iv) underwater communications networks. Progress in each of these areas as well as future challenges is presented.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Following De Grauwe (2016), this research advances the idea according to which economies that are part of a monetary union issue debt in a medium of exchange they cannot control: financial markets develop the capacity to impose default on such economies. We are interested in how previous research analyzed the notion that, when economies are autonomous and they employ the exchange rate as a vehicle to handle asymmetric shocks, they confront comparable constraints on the performance of exchange rate strategies. When a monetary union is affected by significant asymmetric shocks, the member economies have to deal with tough adjustment issues. Empirical and secondary data are used to back the assertion that, in a monetary union, economies that are affected by long-lasting asymmetric demand shocks demand wage elasticity and labor flexibility to rectify for them, and if the latter generate substantial budget deficits, financial markets tend to intensify the consequences of the asymmetric shocks, boosting the demand for severe regulation of wages and labor flexibility. Our article makes conceptual and methodological contributions to the view that member economies of a monetary union are exposed to varying market reactions, generating more volatility in the business cycle: an economy undergoing a recession and a rise in the budget deficit might be affected by wide-ranging transactions of its government bonds, causing a liquidity crisis and superior interest rates, and possibly coercing the government of that economy to adopt budgetary austerity measures, thus intensifying the recession.

AB The benefits of piloting a glider during a 6-day period via an adaptive sampling procedure in a 80 x 60 km(2) marine area are assessed under a fully operational framework. The glider trajectory was adapted to reduce the ocean temperature uncertainties predicted by the operational 3-D super-ensemble model in the Ligurian Sea in August 2010. Two sets of real time model predictions are compared, which assimilate observations from (1) the adaptive-sampling-driven glider and (2) an independent glider flying in the same area. The piloting algorithm was able to successfully guide the glider along the planned trajectories. These were nevertheless not fully completed due to un-predicted adverse currents faced along the transects. Despite operational constraints and model prediction errors, the adaptive sampling procedure is shown to meet the proposed objective, i.e. a reduction of the 48-h model temperature uncertainty predicted in the upper 200 m. Moreover, measurements collected during the last 48-h forecast cycle from (i) an ocean mooring, (ii) a repeated ScanFish transect and (iii) more irregularly distributed platforms, all indicate that the actual prediction error is lower in the simulation assimilating the data from the adaptive sampling. Quantitatively, the total root-mean-square error is reduced by 18% at the end of the field experiment in comparison with the control simulation. (c) 2012 NATO Undersea Research Centre.

AB In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for design and analysis of distributed flocking algorithms. Two cases of flocking in free-space and presence of multiple obstacles are considered. We present three flocking algorithms: two for free-flocking and one for constrained flocking. A comprehensive analysis of the first two algorithms is provided. We demonstrate the first algorithm embodies all three rules of Reynolds. This is a formal approach to extraction of interaction rules that lead to the emergence of collective behavior. We show that the first algorithm generically leads to regular fragmentation, whereas the second and third algorithms both lead to flocking. A systematic method is provided for construction of cost functions (or collective potentials) for flocking. These collective potentials penalize deviation from a class of lattice-shape objects called alpha-lattices. We use a multi-species framework for construction of collective potentials that consist of flock-members, or alpha-agents, and virtual agents associated with alpha-agents called beta- and gamma-agents. We show that migration of flocks can be performed using a peer-to-peer network of agents, i.e., "flocks need no leaders." A "universal" definition of flocking for particle systems with similarities to Lyapunov stability is given. Several simulation results are provided that demonstrate performing 2-D and 3-D flocking, split/rejoin maneuver, and squeezing maneuver for hundreds of agents using the proposed algorithms.

AB This paper proposes a novel Blockchain-based indoor navigation system that combines a foot-mounted dual-inertial measurement unit (IMU) setup and a zero-velocity update (ZUPT) algorithm for secure and accurate indoor navigation in GNSS-denied environments. The system estimates the user's position and orientation by fusing the data from two IMUs using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The ZUPT algorithm is employed to detect and correct the error introduced by sensor drift during zero-velocity intervals, thus enhancing the accuracy of the position estimate. The proposed Low SWaP-C blockchain-based decentralized architecture ensures the security and trustworthiness of the system by providing an immutable and distributed ledger to store and verify the sensor data and navigation solutions. The proposed system is suitable for various indoor navigation applications, including autonomous vehicles, robots, and human tracking. The experimental results provide clear and compelling evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed system in ensuring the integrity, privacy, and security of navigation data through the utilization of blockchain technology. The system exhibits an impressive ability to process more than 680 transactions per second within the Hyperledger-Fabric framework. Furthermore, it demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness, with a mean RMSE error of 1.2 m and a peak RMSE of 3.2 during a 20 min test. By eliminating the reliance on external signals or infrastructure, the system offers an innovative, practical, and secure solution for indoor navigation in environments where GNSS signals are unavailable.

AB Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is at the core of System on Chip (SoC) design across various Industry 5.0 digital systems-healthcare devices, farming equipment, autonomous vehicles and aerospace gear to name a few. Given that pre-silicon verification using Computer Aided Design (CAD) accounts for about 70% of the time and money spent on the design of modern digital systems, this paper summarizes the machine learning (ML)-oriented efforts in different FPGA CAD design steps. With the recent breakthrough of machine learning, FPGA CAD tasks-high-level synthesis (HLS), logic synthesis, placement and routing-are seeing a renewed interest in their respective decision-making steps. We focus on machine learning-based CAD tasks to suggest some pertinent research areas requiring more focus in CAD design. The development of open-source benchmarks optimized for an end-to-end machine learning experience, intra-FPGA optimization, domain-specific accelerators, lack of explainability and federated learning are the issues reviewed to identify important research spots requiring significant focus. The potential of the new cloud-based architectures to understand the application of the right ML algorithms in FPGA CAD decision-making steps is discussed, together with visualizing the scenario of incorporating more intelligence in the cloud platform, with the help of relatively newer technologies such as CAD as Adaptive OpenPlatform Service (CAOS). Altogether, this research explores several research opportunities linked with modern FPGA CAD flow design, which will serve as a single point of reference for modern FPGA CAD flow design.

AB The design factors of anchor boxes, such as shape, placement, and target assignment policy, greatly influence the performance and latency of the 3D object detectors. Unlike image-based 2D anchors, 3D anchors must be placed in a 3D space and determined differently for each class of different sizes. This imposes a significant burden on the design complexity. To tackle this issue, various studies have been conducted on how to set the anchor form. However, for practical reasons, anchor-based methods select the anchor design by compromising between performance and latency. Consequently, only objects that are similar in shape and size to an anchor can obtain high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Mixture-Density-based 3D Object Detection (MD3D) in point clouds to predict the distribution of 3D bounding boxes using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). With an anchor-free detection head, MD3D requires few hand-crafted design factors and eliminates the inefficiency of separating the regression channel for each class, and thus offering both latency and memory benefits. MD3D is designed to utilize various types of feature encoding; therfore, it can be applied flexibly by replacing only the detection head of the existing detectors. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo open datasets show that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts that are based on the conventional anchor-based detection head in its overall performance, latency, and memory.

TI Specular Detection on Glossy Surface Using Geometric Characteristics of
   Specularity in Top-View Images
SO SENSORS

ID MODEL
AB In an autonomous driving assistance system (ADAS), top views effectively represent objects around the vehicle on a 2D plane. Top-view images are therefore widely used to detect lines in ADAS applications such as lane-keeping assistance and parking assistance. Because line detection is a crucial step for these applications, the false positive detection of lines can lead to failure of the system. Specular reflections from a glossy surface are often the cause of false positives, and since certain specular patterns resemble actual lines in the top-view image, their presence induces false positive lines. Incorrect positions of the lines or parking stalls can thus be obtained. To alleviate this problem, we propose two methods to estimate specular pixels in the top-view image. The methods use a geometric property of the specular region: the shape of the specular region is stretched long in the direction of the camera as the distance between the camera and the light source becomes distant, resulting in a straight line. This property can be used to distinguish the specular region in images. One estimates the pixel-wise probability of the specularity using gradient vectors obtained from an edge detector and the other estimates specularity using the line equation of each line segment obtained by line detection. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we added our methods as a pre-processing step to existing parking stall detection methods and investigated changes in their performance. The proposed methods improved line detection performance by accurately estimating specular components in the top-view images.

AB A group of individual truckers can be regarded as a swarm intelligence system without central management. With the development of autonomous driving technology, trucker groups will be replaced by driverless vehicles. At that point, a swarm of truckers will become a swarm robotics system. Therefore, considering the design and control of an efficient swarm robotics system, it is essential to investigate the properties and model the behaviors of a swarm of truckers in advance. In this study, we probe the characteristics of both individual truckers and a swarm of truckers using trajectory data of truckers. First, the trajectory data were map matched based on the geographic scale of cities and administrative regions. Then, the properties of the division of labor, pattern formation, and swarm synchronization were obtained through an analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of radius of gyration, travel distance, and the number of visited places. Because predicting the next visit locations of individuals of a swarm is a measure for modeling swarm behaviors, the prediction model can be used to predict future swarm robotics (driverless trucks) behaviors. Thus, we apply several machine learning models to predict the next locations of truckers. The results show that there are common characteristics and routines embodied in the behavior of the truckers; the swarm shows consistency and regularity. Moreover, the peak predictability of the entire group reached 94%, indicating that our model can predict the behavior of groups and individuals. Our findings provide basis supporting to the future efficient swarm robotics system.

AB A traffic driving environment is a complex and dynamically changing scene. When driving, drivers always allocate their attention to the most important and salient areas or targets. Traffic saliency detection, which computes the salient and prior areas or targets in a specific driving environment, is an indispensable part of intelligent transportation systems and could be useful in supporting autonomous driving, traffic sign detection, driving training, car collision warning, and other tasks. Recently, advances in visual attention models have provided substantial progress in describing eye movements over simple stimuli and tasks such as free viewing or visual search. However, to date, there exists no computational framework that can accurately mimic a driver's gaze behavior and saliency detection in a complex traffic driving environment. In this paper, we analyzed the eye-tracking data of 40 subjects consisted of nondrivers and experienced drivers when viewing 100 traffic images. We found that a driver's attention was mostly concentrated on the end of the road in front of the vehicle. We proposed that the vanishing point of the road can be regarded as valuable top-down guidance in a traffic saliency detection model. Subsequently, we build a framework of a classic bottom-up and top-down combined traffic saliency detection model. The results show that our proposed vanishing-point-based top-down model can effectively simulate a driver's attention areas in a driving environment.

AB Accurate and fast motion prediction such as pedestrian motion prediction (PMP) is crucial for safe autonomous driving. Much research effort has been devoted to studying the reactive behaviors of pedestrians, such as the interaction between pedestrians or the interaction between pedestrians and the environment. However, compared with behavioral logic, the current motion state of pedestrians has a greater influence on the future trajectory. In this work, we propose a motion logic network (MLN) to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of pedestrian motion prediction. Compared with the traditional data-driven neural networks, the concept of motion logic is directly introduced into the network so that the training of the network is not required. In particular, instead of fitting the network based on inputs and target outputs, the proposed method directly adopts motion logic to predict the future trajectory. To illustrate the performance of the proposed MLN, several experiments have been performed. For acceleration and deceleration motion in practical experiment, the average displacement error (ADE) of MLN has an improvement of as high as 6.25% than CVM's, while the final displacement error (FDE) of MLN has an improvement of 11.1%. In terms of efficiency, MLN is a hundred times faster than LSTM. It indicates that motion logic plays an important role in the development of prediction algorithms for pedestrian motion. Note to Practitioners-This article is motivated by the effects of pedestrians' different motion states on the future trajectory. For example, the pedestrians' state may also change drastically in some situations such as dashing across the road or stopping in anticipation of a bicycle crossing the path. This work explores the use of pedestrians' physical motion states to develop a network that emphasizes the logical features of pedestrian motion so as to directly estimate the future motion trajectory and trend based on the motion logic. For the first time, the concept of motion logic and the resultant training-free motion logic network (MLN) is proposed, which takes into account the accuracy and efficiency performance of the algorithm. Compared with the state-of-the-art pedestrian prediction methods, the proposed method can better predict the trajectory of pedestrians in more complex motion states. Moreover, a series of simulations and practical experiments with pseudo-constant velocity motion and acceleration/deceleration motion was taken to verify the performance of the proposed MLN.

AB Today, the applications of AI/ML techniques are so pervasive and numerous that they cannot be easily listed. However, some of the most successful and well-known applications include search engines, targeted advertisements, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, language translation, image recognition, and large language models. Although introduced more recently, AI/ML applications for mobile systems have already shown potential in improving performance and user experience, automating network management and optimization, reducing overhead and cost, among others. This paper looks into the standardization activities in 3GPP and O-RAN for AI/ML applications, and future technology trends of AI/ML. Though still in its early stages, 3GPP has started to incorporate intelligence into the core network, RAN, and the air-interface. Meanwhile, O-RAN has introduced SMO and RIC for RAN automation and intelligence. Even for the air-interface, where near real-time operation is required, 3GPP is exploring AI/ML use cases in areas such as beam management, CSI feedback enhancements, and positioning, to improve performance and reduce overhead. Federated learning, E2E learning, and explainable AI/ML are emerging as important technology trends in the field of AI/ML for the future. When these future AI/ML technologies are integrated with mobile systems, it is expected that a series of cross-layer protocol stacks for communication could be replaced by an appropriate AI/ML model that can provide more automated, reliable, and accurate inference and actions compared to traditional methods.

DE Multi-dimensional control allocation; weighted pseudo-inverse with
   dynamic weight adaptation; actuator prioritisation
AB The Dynamic Weighting Control Allocator (DWCA) was introduced by Sadien et al. (Control Engineering Practice, 2019) to solve the allocation problem raised by the yaw control of an on-ground aircraft. It handles the classical tradeoff between virtual reference inputs realisation and control power minimisation. But it also offers three specific features. First, the actuators reach saturation almost simultaneously, which allows an efficient recovery in case of failure. Then, several industrial requirements are taken into account, such as implementation ease, low computational cost and compatibility with certification constraints. And finally, the actuators can be prioritised, the last ones being used sparingly (to avoid overheating, fatigue, maintenance cost horizontal ellipsis ) only when the virtual reference inputs cannot be realised by the first ones only. But despite its attractiveness, the DWCA is limited to the 1-dimensional case, which means that only one degree of freedom can be controlled. This is not sufficient to deal with today's challenges in the aeronautical and automotive fields, for example, where certain control problems are inherently multi-dimensional. With the progressive advent of autonomous cars, new concepts of light hybrid or electric vehicles are, for example, emerging, where both hydraulic and electric actuators are mounted on each wheel to improve the combined management of speed and steering. In this context, this paper introduces a non-trivial generalisation of the DWCA, which retains the various characteristics and advantages of the initial version and can be used in the multi-dimensional case.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) deployment will radically reshape the relationship between Americans and their cars. A society which has long prized private car ownership will see riders transition to dramatically cheaper robotaxi services. Cities will regulate AVs in real time, using a sophisticated new regulatory technology called Mobility Data Specification (MDS). The widespread use of AVs owned by impersonal operators and regulated by municipal governments will bring to the fore privacy questions which were more easily ignored when cities were using MDS to regulate more niche modes of transportation like e-scooters. Mass adoption of AVs will elevate the stakes of Fourth Amendment concerns about the collection and analysis of anonymous geolocation data. This Note aims to answer the important question of whether commercially deployed AVs can constitutionally be subjected to regulatory programs that mirror MDS as currently applied to the regulation of e -scooters. Robust scholarship is emerging about the scope of the concept of inescapability, first introduced in Carpenter v. United States, the Supreme Court's most meaningful effort to erect guardrails around location data. Scholars are also exploring how the third-party doctrine undermines Fourth Amendment values, and the breadth of modern administrative search doctrine. This Note builds on these critiques and proposals to argue that the Fourth Amendment will impose limits on cities seeking to track real-time location data from AVs. AVs are likely to become inescapable, and the data collected from the public will be uniquely sensitive. If cities want the power to demand real-time data from AVs, they will need to rigorously justify their collection of such data and take concrete steps to anonymize it.

   sonar; profiling sonar; underwater sensing; acoustic images; sonars
AB Three-dimensional reconstruction is a crucial technique for mapping and object-search tasks, but it is challenging in sonar imaging because of the nature of acoustics. In underwater sensing, many advanced studies have introduced approaches that have included feature-based methods and multiple imaging at different locations. However, most existing methods are prone to environmental conditions, and they are not adequate for continuous data acquisition on moving autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This paper proposes a sensor fusion method for 3D reconstruction using acoustic sonar data with two sonar devices that provide complementary features. The forward-looking multibeam sonar (FLS) is an imaging sonar capable of short-range scanning with a high horizontal resolution, and the profiling sonar (PS) is capable of middle-range scanning with high reliability in vertical information. Using both sonars, which have different data acquisition planes and times, we propose a probabilistic sensor fusion method. First, we extract the region of interest from the background and develop a sonar measurement model. Thereafter, we utilize the likelihood field generated by the PS and estimate the elevation ambiguity using importance sampling. We also present the evaluation of our method in a ray-tracing-based sonar simulation environment and the generation of the pointclouds. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can provide a better accuracy than that of the conventional method. Because of the improved accuracy of the generated pointclouds, this method can be expanded for pointcloud-based mapping and classification methods.

AB Predicting the outcomes of integrating Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) is a complex problem, which is required to be addressed by simulation studies before allowing the routine access of UAS into the NAS. This paper focuses on providing a 3dimensional (3D) simulation framework using a game-theoretical methodology to evaluate integration concepts using scenarios where manned and unmanned air vehicles co-exist. In the proposed method, the human pilot interactive decision-making process is incorporated into airspace models which can fill the gap in the literature where the pilot behavior is generally assumed to be known a priori. The proposed human pilot behavior is modeled using a dynamic level-k reasoning concept and approximate reinforcement learning. The level-k reasoning concept is a notion in game theory and is based on the assumption that humans have various levels of decision making. In the conventional "static" approach, each agent makes assumptions about his or her opponents and chooses his or her actions accordingly. On the other hand, in the dynamic level-k reasoning, agents can update their beliefs about their opponents and revise their level-k rule. In this study, Neural Fitted Q Iteration, which is an approximate reinforcement learning method, is used to model time-extended decisions of pilots with 3D maneuvers. An analysis of UAS integration is conducted using an Example 3D scenario in the presence of manned aircraft and fully autonomous UAS equipped with sense and avoid algorithms.

DE side-scan sonar (SSS); semantic segmentation; dilated convolutions;

AB In ocean explorations, side-scan sonar (SSS) plays a very important role and can quickly depict seabed topography. Assembling the SSS to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and performing semantic segmentation of an SSS image in real time can realize online submarine geomorphology or target recognition, which is conducive to submarine detection. However, because of the complexity of the marine environment, various noises in the ocean pollute the sonar image, which also encounters the intensity inhomogeneity problem. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture named dilated convolutional neural network (DcNet) that can run in real time while addressing the above-mentioned issues and providing accurate semantic segmentation. The proposed architecture presents an encoder-decoder network to gradually reduce the spatial dimension of the input image and recover the details of the target, respectively. The core of our network is a novel block connection named DCblock, which mainly uses dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution between the encoder and decoder to attain more context while still retaining high accuracy. Furthermore, our proposed method performs a super-resolution reconstruction to enlarge the dataset with high-quality images. We compared our network to other common semantic segmentation networks performed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 using our sonar image datasets. Experimental results show that while the inference speed of the proposed network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, the accuracy of our method is still comparable, which indicates its potential applications not only in AUVs equipped with SSS but also in marine exploration.

ID PROBABILISTIC LOCALIZATION
AB A key challenge in visual place recognition (VPR) is recognizing places despite drastic visual appearance changes due to factors such as time of day, season, weather or lighting conditions. Numerous approaches based on deep-learnt image descriptors, sequence matching, domain translation, and probabilistic localization have had success in addressing this challenge, but most rely on the availability of carefully curated representative reference images of the possible places. In this letter, we propose a novel approach, dubbed Bayesian Selective Fusion, for actively selecting and fusing informative reference images to determine the best place match for a given query image. The selective element of our approach avoids the counterproductive fusion of every reference image and enables the dynamic selection of informative reference images in environments with changing visual conditions (such as indoors with flickering lights, outdoors during sunshowers or over the day-night cycle). The probabilistic element of our approach provides a means of fusing multiple reference images that accounts for their varying uncertainty via a novel training-free likelihood function for VPR. On difficult query images from two benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach matches and exceeds the performance of several alternative fusion approaches along with state-of-the-art techniques that are provided with prior (unfair) knowledge of the best reference images. Our approach is well suited for long-term robot autonomy where dynamic visual environments are commonplace since it is training-free, descriptor-agnostic, and complements existing techniques such as sequence matching.

ID REGISTRATION; VIEWS
AB In this study, we propose an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based multi-directional scanning method of underwater objects using forward scan sonar (FSS). Recently, a method was developed that can generate a 3-D point cloud of an underwater object using FSS. However, the data comprised sparse and noisy characteristics that made it difficult for 3-D recognition. Another limitation was the absence of back and side surface information of an object. These limitations degraded the results of the 3-D reconstruction. We propose a multi-directional scanning strategy to improve the 3-D point cloud and reconstruction results where the AUV determines the direction of the next scan by analyzing the 3-D data of the object until the scanning is complete. This enables adaptive scanning based on the shape of the target object while reducing the amount of scanning time. Based on the scanning strategy, a polygonal approximation method for real-time 3-D reconstruction is developed to process scanned data groups of the 3-D point cloud. This process can efficiently handle multiple 3-D point cloud data for real-time operation and reduce its uncertainty. To verify the performance of our proposed method, simulations were performed with various objects and conditions. In addition, experiments were conducted in an indoor water tank, and the results were compared with the simulation results. Field experiments were conducted to verify the proposed method for more diverse environments and objects.

AB This paper presents a real-time and low-cost 3D perception and reconstruction system which is suitable for autonomous navigation and large-scale environment reconstruction. The 3D mapping system is based on a rotating 2D planar laser scanner driven by a step motor, which is suitable for continuous mapping. However, for such a continuous mapping system, the challenge is that the range measurements are received at different times when the 3D LiDAR is moving, which will result in big distortion of the local 3D point cloud. As a result, the errors in motion estimation can cause misregistration of the resulting point cloud. In order to continuously estimate the trajectory of the sensor, we first extract feature points from the local point cloud and then estimate the transformation between current frame to local map to get the LiDAR odometry. After that, we use the estimated motion to remove the distortion of the local point cloud and then register the undistorted local point cloud to the global point cloud to get accurate global map. Finally, we propose a coarse-to-fine graph optimization method to minimize the global drift. The proposed 3D sensor system is advantageous due to its mechanical simplicity, mobility, low weight, low cost, and real-time estimation. To validate the performance of the proposed system, we carried out several experiments to verify its accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. The experimental results show that our system can accurately estimate the trajectory of the sensor and build a quality 3D point cloud map simultaneously.

AB High-resolution Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) multibeam bathymetry and chirp subsurface profiles from a portion of the Lucia Chica channel system, offshore central California, provide imaging of small-scale morphologies associated with deep-water channel migration. From similar to 950 m to similar to 1250 m water depth, the Lucia Chica channel system contains a complicated pattern of channels and scours. The quality and resolution of the subsurface chirp profiles reveals sediment packages on the same scale as geometries from outcrop strata. Detailed mapping and measurements along channels, here numbered from oldest (1) to youngest (4), indicate that the sinuous Channel 2 shifted position in discrete lateral steps, typically associated with erosion and new channel incision. Where channel fill was not removed by incision, a bench, morphologically defined as a relatively flat, higher area adjacent to the axial channel, resulted from each lateral shift. Inner-bend levees were deposited on each bench and draped over the previous levees as flows travelled through the new channel position. Using the dense grid of high-resolution AUV-collected images from Channel 2 as an example, we propose a conceptual model of punctuated lateral migration, associated with inner-bend benches formed during axial-channel and outer-bend erosion, instead of point bars, associated with gradual lateral accretion. Greater erosion during punctuated migration as compared to lateral accretion has important implications for reservoir distribution and connectivity.

AB We study geometric reconstruction problems in one-dimensional retina vision. In such problems, the scene is modeled as a two-dimensional plane, and the camera sensor produces one-dimensional images of the scene. Our main contribution is an efficient method for computing the global optimum to the structure and motion problem with respect to the L-infinity norm of the reprojection errors. One-dimensional cameras have proven useful in several applications, most prominently for autonomous vehicles, where they are used to provide inexpensive and reliable navigational systems. Previous results on one-dimensional vision are limited to the classification and solving of minimal cases, bundle adjustment for finding local optima, and linear algorithms for algebraic cost functions. In contrast, we present an approach for finding globally optimal solutions with respect to the L-infinity norm of the angular reprojection errors. We show how to solve intersection and resection problems as well as the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The algorithm is robust to use when there are missing data, which means that all points are not necessarily seen in all images. Our approach has been tested on a variety of different scenarios, both real and synthetic. The algorithm shows good performance for intersection and resection and for SLAM with up to five views. For more views the high dimension of the search space tends to give long running times. The experimental section also gives interesting examples showing that for one-dimensional cameras with limited field of view the SLAM problem is often inherently ill-conditioned.

AB Cross-spectrum depth estimation aims to provide a reliable depth map under variant-illumination conditions with a pair of dual-spectrum images. It is valuable for autonomous driving applications when vehicles are equipped with two cameras of different modalities. However, images captured by different-modality cameras can be photometrically quite different, which makes cross-spectrum depth estimation a very challenging problem. Moreover, the shortage of large-scale open-source datasets also retards further research in this field. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised visible light(VIS)-image-guided cross-spectrum (i.e., thermal and visible-light, TIR-VIS in short) depth-estimation framework. The input of the framework consists of a cross-spectrum stereo pair (one VIS image and one thermal image). First, we train a depth-estimation base network using VIS-image stereo pairs. To adapt the trained depth-estimation network to the cross-spectrum images, we propose a multi-scale feature-transfer network to transfer features from the TIR domain to the VIS domain at the feature level. Furthermore, we introduce a mechanism of cross-spectrum depth cycle-consistency to improve the depth estimation result of dual-spectrum image pairs. Meanwhile, we release to society a large cross-spectrum dataset with visible-light and thermal stereo images captured in different scenes. The experiment result shows that our method achieves better depth-estimation results than the compared existing methods. Our code and dataset are available on https://github.com/whitecrow1027/CrossSP_Depth.

AB The purpose of this article was to examine the level of awareness and usage of automation techniques in developing countries through the lens of the Nigerian construction industry. A quantitative research approach was conducted with close-ended questionnaires developed and disseminated to construction professionals such as architects, builders, engineers and quantity surveyors based in Nigeria. Retrieved data were analyzed using several statistical tools such as percentages, frequencies and mean scores. Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used to examine the sig-nificant difference in opinions of the respondents for this study. Findings from this study revealed that construction professionals generally have limited knowledge of several automation tech-niques. More so, the implementation of these groundbreaking technologies in the construction industry remains very low which is a major cause for concern. This article explains a compre-hensive roadmap for developing economies such as Nigeria, on how the knowledge of automation techniques can be enhanced among construction professionals. This study also details how the interrelated efforts of key players such as higher education institutions, government, policy -makers, lawmakers, financial institutions, and professional bodies can work together to foster awareness of these innovative technologies. Although past studies have extensively discussed the advent of automation techniques in the construction sector of developing nations, very few studies have examined the level of awareness and usage of these technologies in the context of Nigeria. This study addresses this gap in existing knowledge.

AB Telepresence robots are gaining more popularity as a means of remote communication and human-robot interaction, allowing users to control and operate a physical robot remotely. However, controlling these robots can be challenging due to the inherent delays and latency in the communication systems. In this research paper, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm exploiting deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a dueling double-deep Q-network (DDQN) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to assist and maneuver the telepresence robot during the delayed operating signals from the operator. The DDQN is used to learn the optimal control policy for the telepresence robot in a remote healthcare environment during delayed communication signals. In contrast, the GRU is employed to model the control signals' temporal dependencies and handle the variable time delays in the communication system. The proposed hybrid approach is evaluated analytically and experimentally. The results demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in improving telepresence robots' tracking accuracy and stability performance. Multiple experiments show that the proposed technique depicts improved controlling efficiency with no guidance from the teleoperator. It can control and manage the operations of the telepresence robot during the delayed communication of 15 seconds by itself, which is 2.4% better than the existing approaches. Overall, the proposed hybrid approach demonstrates the potential implementation of RL and deep learning techniques in improving the control and stability of the telepresence robot during delayed operating signals from the operator.

AB Sustainable power supply to flexible electronics is currently of high interest due to the transition to autonomous and self-driving vehicles. Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters (PEH) can be used as sustainable energy sources by harvesting the electrical power through the material deformation occurring in a tire. In this work, an analytical setup was developed to experimentally validate the energy harvesters for their use in tires. It was designed to measure the harvested electrical energy under simulated driving conditions. The setup includes a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) as foundation to simulate the vibrations and dynamic responses occurring in a rolling tire. The dynamic properties and the output voltage from the harvesters were monitored under these sinusoidal conditions. For this, a PEH for tire applications was prepared in a sandwich configuration. It consists of a piezoelectric material, i.e. PolyVinyliDene diFluoride (PVDF) film, inserted in between two layers of elec-trodes, i.e. elastomers filled with conductive carbon black fillers. The electrical conductivity of elastomeric compounds was measured under dynamic conditions varying dynamic strain, frequencies, and temperatures. Dynamic strain and temperature resulted to be the most significant factors influencing the electrical conductivity of elastomers. Output power from the piezoelectric energy harvester was also measured at varied frequencies and temperatures. Both properties increase considerably the piezoelectric power. This development gives a promising method for analyzing the electro-mechanical properties of conductive and piezoelectric materials and optimizing their performance according to simulated tire-rolling conditions.

AB The wave-driven catamaran is a small surface vehicle driven by ocean waves. It consists of a hull and hydrofoils, and has a multi-body dynamic structure. The process of moving from static state to autonomous navigation driven by ocean waves is called "self-propulsion ", and reflects the ability of the wave-driven catamaran to absorb oceanic wave energy. Considering the importance of the design of the wave-driven catamaran, its self-propulsion performance should be comprehensively analysed. However, the wave-driven catamaran's multi-body dynamic structure, unpredictable dynamic and kinematic responses driven by waves make it difficult to analyse its self-propulsion performance. In this paper, firstly, a multi-body dynamic model is established for wave-driven catamaran. Secondly, a two-phase numerical flow field containing water and air is established. Thirdly, a numerical simulation method for the self-propulsion process of the wave-driven catamaran is proposed by combining the multi-body dynamic model with a numerical flow field. Through numerical simulation, the hydrodynamic response, including the thrust of the hydrofoils, the resistance of the hull and the sailing velocity of the wave-driven catamaran are identified and comprehensively analysed. Lastly, the accuracy of the numerical simulation results is verified through a self-propulsion test in a towing tank. In contrast with previous research, this method combines multi-body dynamics with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to avoid errors caused by artificially setting the motion mode of the catamaran, and calculates the real velocity of the catamaran.

AB Time delay control (TDC) is a type of disturbance observer (DO)-based control, where the disturbance estimation is performed by using the past information of control input and measurement signals. Despite its capability, there are concerns about its practical implementation. First, it requires acceleration measurements which are generally not available in many industrial systems. Second, input delays are introduced into the closed-loop system, but the relation between the size of the delay and the performance of TDC has not been studied. Finally, there is a lack of tools to analyze its performance in disturbance estimation and robust stability for a given set of control parameters. We construct Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals for a class of nonlinear systems which leads to delay-dependent conditions in linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for the ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system. This provides a means for analyzing the trade-off between the accuracy of disturbance estimation and robust stability. To circumvent acceleration measurements, we construct a sliding mode (SM) observer where the resulting error dynamics turns into a neutral type delay system. The existence conditions of both the SM control and SM observer are provided via a single LMI. A simulation example considering the tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle at constant and varying speed with a comparison to a non-TDC shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The study investigated object detection and classification based on both Doppler radar spectrograms and vision images using two deep convolutional neural networks. The kinematic models for a walking human and a bird flapping its wings were incorporated into MATLAB simulations to create data sets. The dynamic simulator identified the final position of each ellipsoidal body segment taking its rotational motion into consideration in addition to its bulk motion at each sampling point to describe its specific motion naturally. The total motion induced a micro-Doppler effect and created a micro-Doppler signature that varied in response to changes in the input parameters, such as varying body segment size, velocity, and radar location. Micro-Doppler signature identification of the radar signals returned from the target objects that were animated by the simulator required kinematic modeling based on a short-time Fourier transform analysis of the signals. Both You Only Look Once V3 and Inception V3 were used for the detection and classification of the objects with different red, green, blue colors on black or white backgrounds. The results suggested that clear micro-Doppler signature image-based object recognition could be achieved in low-visibility conditions. This feasibility study demonstrated the application possibility of Doppler radar to autonomous vehicle driving as a backup sensor for cameras in darkness. In this study, the first successful attempt of animated kinematic models and their synchronized radar spectrograms to object recognition was made.

AB The oceans sustain the global environment and diverse ecosystems through a variety of biogeochemical processes and their complex interactions. In order to understand the dynamism of the local or global marine environments, multimodal combined observations must be carried out in situ. On the other hand, instrumentation of in situ measurement techniques enabling biological and/or biochemical combined observations is challenging in aquatic environments, including the ocean, because biochemical flow analyses require a more complex configuration than physicochemical electrode sensors. Despite this technical hurdle, in situ analyzers have been developed to measure the concentrations of seawater contents such as nutrients, trace metals, and biological components. These technologies have been used for cutting-edge ocean observations to elucidate the biogeochemical properties of water mass with a high spatiotemporal resolution. In this context, the contribution of lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technology toward the miniaturization and functional integration of in situ analyzers has been gaining momentum. Due to their mountability, in situ LoC technologies provide ideal instrumentation for underwater analyzers, especially for miniaturized underwater observation platforms. Consequently, the appropriate combination of reliable LoC and underwater technologies is essential to realize practical in situ LoC analyzers suitable for underwater environments, including the deep sea. Moreover, the development of fundamental LoC technologies for underwater analyzers, which operate stably in extreme environments, should also contribute to in situ measurements for public or industrial purposes in harsh environments as well as the exploration of the extraterrestrial frontier.

TI Optimal Placement of Reservation-Based Intersections in Urban Networks
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; IMPACT
AB Reservation-based traffic control is a revolutionary intersection management system which involves the communication of autonomous vehicles and an intersection to request space-time trajectories through the intersection. Although previous studies have found congestion and throughput benefits of reservation-based control that surpass signalized control, other studies have found negative impacts at peak travel times. The main purpose of this paper is to find and characterize favorable mixed configurations of reservation-based controls and signalized controls in a large city network which minimize total system travel times. As this optimization problem is bi-level and challenging, three different methods are proposed to heuristically find effective mixed configurations. The first method is an intersection ranking method that uses simulation to assign a score to each intersection in a network based on localized potential benefit to system travel time under reservation control and then ranks all intersections accordingly. The second is another ranking method; however, it uses linear regression to predict an intersection's localized score. Finally, a genetic algorithm is presented that iteratively approaches high-performing network configurations yielding minimal system travel times. The methods were tested on the downtown Austin network and configurations found that are less than half controlled by reservation intersections that improve travel times beyond an all-reservation controlled network. Overall, the results show that the genetic algorithm finds the best performing configurations, with the initial score-assigning ranking method performing similarly but much more efficiently. It was finally find that favorable reservation placement is in consecutive chains along highly trafficked corridors.

AB State estimation is the most critical capability for MAV (Micro-Aerial Vehicle) localization, autonomous obstacle avoidance, robust flight control and 3D environmental mapping. There are three main challenges for MAV state estimation: (1) it can deal with aggressive 6 DOF (Degree Of Freedom) motion; (2) it should be robust to intermittent GPS (Global Positioning System) (even GPS-denied) situations; (3) it should work well both for low-and high-altitude flight. In this paper, we present a state estimation technique by fusing long-range stereo visual odometry, GPS, barometric and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measurements. The new estimation system has two main parts, a stochastic cloning EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) estimator that loosely fuses both absolute state measurements (GPS, barometer) and the relative state measurements (IMU, visual odometry), and is derived and discussed in detail. A long-range stereo visual odometry is proposed for high-altitude MAV odometry calculation by using both multi-view stereo triangulation and a multi-view stereo inverse depth filter. The odometry takes the EKF information (IMU integral) for robust camera pose tracking and image feature matching, and the stereo odometry output serves as the relative measurements for the update of the state estimation. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset and our real flight dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation system, especially for the aggressive, intermittent GPS and high-altitude MAV flight.

AB Wireless sensor network localization is an essential problem that has attracted increasing attention due to wide demands such as in-door navigation, autonomous vehicle, intrusion detection, and so on. With the a priori knowledge of the positions of sensor nodes and their measurements to targets in the wireless sensor networks (WSNs), i.e. posterior knowledge, such as distance and angle measurements, it is possible to estimate the position of targets through different algorithms. In this contribution, two commonly-used approaches based on least-squares and Kalman filter are described and analyzed for localization of one static target in the WSNs with distance, angle, or both distance and angle measurements, respectively. Noting that the measurements of these sensors are generally noisy of certain degree, it is crucial and interesting to analyze how the accuracy of localization is affected by the sensor errors and the sensor network, which may help to provide guideline on choosing the specification of sensors and designing the sensor network. In addition, the problem of optimal sensor placement is also addressed to minimize the localization error. To this end, theoretical analysis have been made for the different methods based on three typical types of measurement noise: bounded noise, uniformly distributed noise, and Gaussian white noise. Simulation results illustrate the performance comparison of these different methods, the theoretical analysis and simulations and the optimal sensor geometry which may be meaningful and guideful in practice.

AB We report observations of the structure of the front that surrounds the plume of the Connecticut River in Long Island Sound (LIS). Salinity, temperature, and velocity in the near-surface waters were measured by both towed and ship-mounted sensors and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We find that the plume front extends south from the mouth of the river, normal to the direction of the tidal flow in LIS and then curves to the east to parallel the tidal current. The layer depth at the front and the cross-front jumps in salinity and near-surface velocity all tend to decrease as distance from the source increases. This is qualitatively consistent with the prediction of layer models. In the across-front direction, the plume layer depth increases from zero to the asymptotic value within a few times the plume depth (similar to 5 m). Vertical motion is generated in this zone, and there is evidence of overturning. Farther from the front, the high-frequency salinity standard deviation decays exponentially with a length scale of 30 m. Assuming that the salinity fluctuations are a consequence of turbulence, we find that the rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation decreases exponentially in the across-front direction with a decay scale L-G approximate to 15 m. Estimates based on AUV-mounted shear probes are consistent with this estimate. We present an explanation of the physics that determines LG and provide a simple formula to guide the choice of resolution in models that are designed to resolve the frontal structure.

AB An ocean surface current radar (OSCR) in the very high frequency (VHF) mode was deployed in South Florida Ocean Measurement Center (SFOMC) during the summer of 1999. During this period, a 29-d continuous time series of vector surface currents was acquired starting on 9 July 1999 and ending 7 August 1999. Over a 20-min sample interval, the VHF radar mapped coastal ocean currents over a 7.5 km x 8 km domain with a horizontal resolution of 250 m at 700 grid points. A total of 2078 snapshots of the two-dimensional current vectors were acquired during this time series and of these samples, only 69 samples (3.3%) were missing from the time series. During this period, complex surface circulation patterns were observed that included coherent, submesoscale vortices with diameters of 2 to 3 km inshore of the Florida Current. Comparisons to subsurface measurements from moored and ship-board acoustic Doppler current profiles revealed regression slopes of close to unity with biases ranging from 4 to 8 cm s(-1) between surface and subsurface measurements at 3 to 4 in beneath the surface. Correlation coefficients were 0.8 or above with phases of -10 to -20degrees suggestive of an anticylconic veering of current with depth relative to the surface current. The radar-derived surface current field provided spatial context for an observational network using mooring-, ship- and autonomous underwater vehicle-sensor packages that were deployed at the SFOMC.

AB Starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly, as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport. Elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour. Driver assistance systems, just available or soon on the market, are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers. An expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are: emergency systems, enhanced vision systems and parking aids. Emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver's request, and direct them to the emergency location. Self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve lightning and automatic dipping. parking aids, using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with movability problems. The group of helpful, but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car, comprising autonomous cruise control, antilock systems and electronic stability programmes. The value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory. Reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems, helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without orientational problems. The article demonstrates the particular importance of specific layouts of the man-machine-interface for elderly, to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic.

AB Technologies in the smart city, such as autonomous vehicles and delivery robots, promise to increase the mobility and freedom of people with disabilities. These technologies have also failed to "see" or comprehend wheelchair riders, people walking with service animals, and people walking with bicycles-all outliers to machine learning models. Big data and algorithms have been amply critiqued for their biases-harmful and systematic errors-but the harms that arise from AI's inherent inability to handle nuance, context, and exception have been largely overlooked. In this paper, I run two machine learning models across nine cities in the United States to attempt to fill a gap in data about the location of curb ramps. I find that while curb ramp prediction models may achieve up to 88% accuracy, the rate of accuracy varied in context in ways both predictable and unpredictable. I look closely at cases of unpredictable error (outlier bias), by triangulating with aerial and street view imagery. The sampling of cases shows that while it may be possible to conjecture about patterns in these errors, there is nothing clearly systematic. While more data and bigger models might improve the accuracy somewhat, I propose that a bias toward outliers is something fundamental to machine learning models which gravitate to the mean and require unbiased and not missing data. I conclude by arguing that universal design or design for the outliers is imperative for justice in the smart city where algorithms and data are increasingly embedded as infrastructure.

AB A novel dual-function radar communication (DFRC) system is proposed, that achieves high communication rate, and can flexibly trade-off rate for improved sensing performance. The proposed system is a monostatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar and transmits wideband, precoded, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms from its antennas. The system subcarriers are divided into two groups, i.e., shared and private. On a shared subcarrier, all antennas can transmit simultaneously, while on a private one only one antenna can transmit at a time. The shared use of subcarriers by the transmit antennas results in coupling of transmitted symbols and radar target parameters in the target echoes. A novel, low complexity target estimation approach is proposed to overcome the coupling and recover the radar parameters. The proposed method first operates on all (shared and private) subcarriers to obtain coarse angle estimates, and then by fine-tunes those estimates based on the signal received on the private subcarriers. The resolution of the coarse angle estimates is limited by the aperture of the physical receive array, while the fine-tuning is enabled by effectively constructing a virtual array that has larger aperture than the receive array. The precoding matrix is optimally designed to optimize a weighted combination of the beampattern error with respect to a desired beampattern, and the signal-to-noise ratio at the communication receiver.

AB The integrated navigation system for strap-down inertial navigation system and ultrashort baseline (SINS/USBL) is one of the main approaches to realize the high-precision navigation and positioning of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The relatively low frequency with seconds and the noise caused by the complex environment for USBL measurements have an obviously influence on the accuracy of positioning system. To solve the above problems, a correct method for USBL range measurement and a robust filter based on maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) are proposed in this article. First, the influence of motion effect on the range calculation results in the process of USBL transmission and reception is analyzed. Then, a simple correction method based on short-term high-precision characteristics of SINS is proposed. The short-term high-precision attitude, velocity, and position information of SINS in the process of USBL transmission and reception is used to correct the range error caused by motion effect. Finally, an adaptive filter based on MCC and dynamic model error adaptive factor is proposed to suppress the influence of outliers on positioning accuracy. The simulation and Yangzi River experiments are conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The results shows that the proposed range correction method has a good correction effect on range error between sending and receiving epoch, and the proposed algorithm has better ability to suppress outliers.

AB The paper is concerned with containment maneuvering of nonlinear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strict-feedback multi-agent systems under the distributed directed communication. Followers are driven into a convex hull spanned by all virtual leaders guided by desired parameterized paths. Multi-agent systems are driven to achieve the desired behavior. A containment maneuvering controller is developed based on an event-triggered modular-ISS neural network control method to decouple estimation and control. Specifically, in the estimation loop, an RBF-network-based predictor module is constructed to design the adaptation law, where an RBF network is employed to identify the uncertain nonlinear dynamics. An event-triggered communication mechanism is introduced to decrease the burden of followers communication. In the control loop, a control module is constructed by using the output of predictor module and a third-order linear tracking differentiator. An event-triggered actuation mechanism is introduced to reduce the actuator burden of followers. A path update law is constructed to achieve coordination among leaders. An event-triggered communication scheme is introduced for leaders to decrease the communication burden of leaders. The input-to-state stability of the total cascade system is demonstrated by using the cascade stability theorem. Simulation results are provided to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed containment maneuvering controller for nonlinear MIMO strict-feedback multi-agent systems. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The development of automotive technologies requires quite a significant amount of time and money. To accelerate this procedure, the technology of now is strongly based on computer simulations, where the whole vehicle or its parts can be analyzed in a virtual environment. The behavior of cars, especially equipped with new sensors or assistants, requires long testing, where the automotive simulators can play a cardinal role. The precise vehicular tests request accurate environmental models. These new kinds of models are still standardized; one of the pioneer de facto standards is OpenDRIVE. This standard was initially defined to be able to express all elements with all potential parameters required in high precision simulations. The actual research focused on creating a compliant virtual model based on mobile mapping measurements. A Leica Pegasus Two mobile mapping system was applied to capture field data about the selected pilot area, which is the campus of Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME). The obtained Lidar point cloud was georeferenced; the merged point cloud is tailored to the driven trajectory, and then it has been evaluated manually. The acquired land use map is converted - similarly manually - into basic road geometry elements: straight lane and bended lane segments. These objects are finally compiled into an XML format, which is compliant with the OpenDRIVE standard. The achieved virtual model has been tested in Driving Scenario Designer of Mathworks Matlab; however, it is promptly ready for use in other widely applied automotive simulators.

AB This work studies online learning-based trajectory planning for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to estimate a water parameter field of interest in the under-ice environment. A centralized system is considered, where several fixed access points on the ice layer are introduced as gateways for communications between the AUVs and a remote data fusion center. We model the water parameter field of interest as a Gaussian process with unknown hyper-parameters. The AUV trajectories for sampling are determined on an epoch-by-epoch basis. At the end of each epoch, the access points relay the observed field samples from all the AUVs to the fusion center, which computes the posterior distribution of the field based on the Gaussian process regression and estimates the field hyper-parameters. The optimal trajectories of all the AUVs in the next epoch are determined to maximize a long-term reward that is defined based on the field uncertainty reduction and the AUV mobility cost, subject to the kinematics constraint, the communication constraint and the sensing area constraint. We formulate the adaptive trajectory planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). A reinforcement learning-based online learning algorithm is designed to determine the optimal AUV trajectories in a constrained continuous space. Simulation results show that the proposed learning-based trajectory planning algorithm has performance similar to a benchmark method that assumes perfect knowledge of the field hyper-parameters.

AB On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout occurred, releasing more oil than any accidental spill in history. Oil release continued for 87 d and much of the oil and gas remained in, or returned to, the deep sea. A coral community significantly impacted by the spill was discovered in late 2010 at 1,370 m depth. Here we describe the discovery of five previously unknown coral communities near the Macondo wellhead and show that at least two additional coral communities were impacted by the spill. Although the oil-containing flocullent material that was present on corals when the first impacted community was discovered was largely gone, a characteristic patchy covering of hydrozoans on dead portions of the skeleton allowed recognition of impacted colonies at the more recently discovered sites. One of these communities was 6 km south of the Macondo wellhead and over 90% of the corals present showed the characteristic signs of recent impact. The other community, 22 km southeast of the wellhead between 1,850 and 1,950 m depth, was more lightly impacted. However, the discovery of this site considerably extends the distance from Macondo and depth range of significant impact to benthic macro-faunal communities. We also show that most known deep-water coral communities in the Gulf of Mexico do not appear to have been acutely impacted by the spill, although two of the newly discovered communities near the wellhead apparently not impacted by the spill have been impacted by deep-sea fishing operations.

AB A large bloom of Salpa spp. in the northeastern Pacific during the spring of 2012 resulted in a major deposition of tunics and fecal pellets on the seafloor at similar to 4000 m depth (Sta. M) over a period of 6 months. Continuous monitoring of this food pulse was recorded using autonomous instruments: sequencing sediment traps, a time-lapse camera on the seafloor, and a bottom-transiting vehicle measuring sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC). These deep-sea measurements were complemented by sampling of salps in the epipelagic zone by California Cooperative Ocean Fisheries Investigations. The particulate organic carbon (POC) flux increased sharply beginning in early March, reaching a peak of 38 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in mid-April at 3400 m depth. Salp detritus started appearing in images of the seafloor taken in March and covered a daily maximum of 98% of the seafloor from late June to early July. Concurrently, the SCOC rose with increased salp deposition, reaching a high of 31 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in late June. A dominant megafauna species, Peniagone sp. A, increased 7-fold in density beginning 7 weeks after the peak in salp deposition. Estimated food supply from salp detritus was 97-327% of the SCOC demand integrated over the 6-month period starting in March 2012. Such large episodic pulses of food sustain abyssal communities over extended periods of time.

AB Weed management has become a highly labor-intensive activity, which is the reason for decreased yields and high costs. Moreover, the lack of skilled labor and weed-resistant herbicides severely impact the agriculture sector and food production, hence increasing the need for automation in agriculture. The use of agricultural robots will help in the assurance of higher yields and proactive control of the crops. This study proposes a laser-based weeding vehicle with a unique mechanical body that is adjustable relative to the field structure, called the Robot Operating System (ROS) based robust control system, and is customizable, cost-effective and easily replicable. Hence, an autonomous-mobile-agricultural robot with a 20 watt laser has been developed for the precise removal of weed plants. The assembled robot's testing was conducted in the agro living lab. The field trials have demonstrated that the robot takes approximately 23.7 h at the linear velocity of 0.07 m/s for the weeding of one acre plot. It includes 5 s of laser to kill one weed plant. Comparatively, the primitive weeding technique is highly labor intensive and takes several days to complete an acre plot area. The data presented herein reflects that implementing this technology could become an excellent approach to removing unwanted plants from agricultural fields. This solution is relatively cost-efficient and provides an alternative to expensive human labor initiatives to deal with the increased labor wages.

AB In recent decades, wireless power transfer (WPT) has gained significant interest from both academic and industrial experts. It possesses natural electrical isolation between transmitter and receiver components, ensuring a secure charging mechanism in an underwater scenario. This ground-breaking technology has also enabled power transmission in the deep-sea environment. However, the stochastic nature of the ocean highly influences underwater wireless power transmission and transfer efficiency is not up to that of terrestrial WPT systems. Recently, the research fraternity has focused on WPT in the air medium, while underwater wireless power transfer (UWPT) is challenging and yet to be explored. The major concerns are ocean current disturbance, bio-fouling, extreme pressure and temperature, seawater conductivity and attenuation. Thus, it is essential to address these challenges, which cause a substantial energy loss in UWPT. This study presents a comparison between various WPT techniques and highlights the research contributions in UWPT in recent years. Research and engineering challenges, practical considerations, and applications are analyzed in this review. We have also addressed influencing factors such as coil orientation, coil misalignment and seawater effects in order to realize an efficient and flexible UWPT system. In addition, this study proposes multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transmission, which can significantly improve the endurance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVS). This idea can be applied to the design of an underwater wireless power station for self-charging of AUVs.

ID ROUTING PROTOCOLS; DATA-COLLECTION
AB In underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), most of the mobile sink data gathering scheme assumes that sensor nodes are static. Also, very limited set of works aim to eliminate the data redundancy during data gathering. Moreover, the data collection latency, error rate and load have to be considered in addition to the buffer space and energy level of the nodes. Here, a mobile sink data gathering technique is designed where rendezvous points (RPs) and sojourn times are selected. The RPs, where the mobile sinks stop to gather the data, are selected based on the node density, current traffic load and energy level of nodes. The proposed scheme, that is, adaptive distributed mobile sink data gathering (ADMSDG), eliminates data redundancy even by considering mobility of all the nodes including sink node. Here, multihop data gathering is also considered to address the energy hole problem near the sink based on similarity index. To examine the result, proposed scheme and other state-of-the-art schemes are implemented in NS2.30 having the same environment. Obtained results show that when proposed scheme is experimented with respect to number of nodes, the proposed ADMSDG technique achieves 18% high data collection accuracy with 5% reduced data collection delay and 5% less energy consumption. Similarly, when proposed scheme is experimented with respect to transmission range, the proposed ADMSDG technique achieves 18% high data collection accuracy with 12% reduced data collection delay and 8% less energy consumption.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID RAIL PASSENGERS; TIME USE
AB As research on travel-based multitasking-doing other things while traveling-becomes more common, some studies also investigate the quality or value of activity participation during travel. This idea of travel usefulness is a component of the positive utility of travel concept; understanding the benefits of travel-based multitasking is important for calculating accurate economic values trading-off travel time and other variables. This study analyzed travel usefulness and its potential determinants using a 2016 survey of about 650 commuters in the Portland, Oregon, area. Ordered logit models identified factors associated with subjective assessments of the overall usefulness of activity participation while on a recent commute trip. Around 90% of walk and bicycle commuters reported useful commutes, as did about half of transit commuters and auto passengers; however, half of auto drivers viewed their commutes as wasted time. Younger travelers, those with less frequent commutes, and people who reported "doing nothing" or more passive activities (window-gazing, daydreaming) on the trip were more likely to consider their commuting time to be a waste. Traveler perceptions were more closely associated with travel usefulness than sociodemographic characteristics. Results suggested that exercise and the physical activity benefits of walking and bicycling may be considered a useful form of travel-based multitasking. Overall, few common and traditionally productive multitasked activities appeared to be useful. Instead, commuters may be doing things more to pass the time than to make productive use of it. These findings offer implications for understanding travel behavior interventions and the potential use of autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper presents a biomimetic turtle flipper actuator consisting of a shape memory alloy composite structure for implementation in a turtle-inspired autonomous underwater vehicle. Based on the analysis of the Chelonia mydas, the flipper actuator was divided into three segments containing a scaffold structure fabricated using a 3D printer. According to the filament stacking sequence of the scaffold structure in the actuator, different actuating motions can be realized and three different types of scaffold structures were proposed to replicate the motion of the different segments of the flipper of the Chelonia mydas. This flipper actuator can mimic the continuous deformation of the forelimb of Chelonia mydas which could not be realized in previous motor based robot. This actuator can also produce two distinct motions that correspond to the two different swimming gaits of the Chelonia mydas, which are the routine and vigorous swimming gaits, by changing the applied current sequence of the SMA wires embedded in the flipper actuator. The generated thrust and the swimming efficiency in each swimming gait of the flipper actuator were measured and the results show that the vigorous gait has a higher thrust but a relatively lower swimming efficiency than the routine gait. The flipper actuator was implemented in a biomimetic turtle robot, and its average swimming speed in the routine and vigorous gaits were measured with the vigorous gait being capable of reaching a maximum speed of 11.5 mm s(-1).

AB The great success of the Sojourner rover in the Mars Pathfinder mission set off a global upsurge of planetary exploration with autonomous wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), or rovers. Planetary WMRs are among the most intelligent space systems that combine robotic intelligence (robint), virtual intelligence (virtint), and human intelligence (humint) synergetically. This article extends the architecture of the three-layer intelligence stemming from successful Mars rovers and related technologies in order to support the R&D of future tele-operated robotic systems. Double-layer human-machine interfaces are suggested to support the integration of humint from scientists and engineers through supervisory (Mars rovers) or three-dimensional (3D) predictive direct tele-operation (lunar rovers). The concept of multilevel autonomy to realize robint, in particular, the Coupled-Layer Architecture for Robotic Autonomy developed for Mars rovers, is introduced. The challenging issues of intelligent perception (proprioception and exteroception), navigation, and motion control of rovers are discussed, where the terrains' mechanical properties and wheel-terrain interaction mechanics are considered to be key. Double-level virtual simulation architecture to realize virtint is proposed. Key technologies of virtint are summarized: virtual planetary terrain modeling, virtual intelligent rover, and wheel-terrain interaction mechanics. This generalized three-layer intelligence framework is also applicable to other systems that require human intervention, such as space robotic arms, robonauts, unmanned deep-sea vehicles, and rescue robots, particularly when there is considerable time delay.

AB This article proposes a novel barrier-based adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) three-dimensional (3-D) path-following system for an underactuated multijoint robotic fish. The framework of the developed path-following system is established based on a detailed dynamic model, including a barrier-based ALOS guidance strategy, three integrated inner-loop controllers, and a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB)-based sideslip angle compensation, which is employed to preserve a reliable tracking under a frequently varying sideslip angle of the robotic fish. First, a barrier-based convergence strategy is proposed to deal with probable along-track error disruption and suppress the error within a manageable range. Meanwhile, an improved adaptive guidance scheme is adopted with an appropriate look-ahead distance. Afterward, a novel NDOB-based sideslip angle compensation is put forward to identify the varying sideslip angle independent of speed estimation. Subsequently, inner-loop controllers are intended for regulation about the controlled references, including a super-twisting sliding-mode control (STSMC)-based speed controller, a global fast terminal sliding-mode control (GFTSMC)-based heading controller, and a GFTSMC-based depth controller. Finally, simulations and experiments with quantitative comparison in 3-D linear and helical path following are presented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system. This path-following system provides a solid foundation for future marine autonomous cruising of the underwater multijoint robot.

AB Cellular and X2U-enabled UAV networks are a promising network paradigm to support constantly growing Internet of Things (IoT) applications in 5G and beyond wireless networks, wherein X2U includes the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) and ground IoT device-to-UAV (G2U) communications. However, such networks pose a significant challenge to secure wireless communications due to the open and broadcasting features of wireless channels. Covert communication is an attractive technique to hinder adversaries (i.e., wardens) from detecting the existence of data transmission for guaranteeing secure IoT communications. This article investigates the covert communication issue for a promising network scenario consisting of a BS, UAV swarm, multiple ground IoT devices and wardens. Especially, each UAV/ground IoT device can select cellular or X2U communication mode according to a flexible mode selection scheme which can cover the cellular network and ad hoc network as special cases by setting a bias factor. We design two types of wardens: active wardens who not only detect the legitimate transmission but also jet noise to interfere with legitimate signals, and passive wardens who only detect the legitimate transmission. Cooperative jamming technique is further employed to resist the attacks of wardens. Then, numerical results are provided to explore the effects of the flexible mode selection and the number of wardens on the covert performances like covert capacity and detection error probability. We finally present a vision for future research in the cellular and X2U-enabled UAV networks.

AB Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is one of the most important components to realizing intelligent connected vehicles, which is a high-commercial-value vertical application of the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication system and beyond communications. VANET requires both ultrareliable low latency and high-data rate communications. In order to evolve towards the reconfigurable wireless networks (RWNs), the 5G mobile communication system is expected to adapt the key parameters of its radio nodes rapidly. However, the current propagation prediction approaches are difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency, which makes the current network unable to perform autonomous optimization agilely. In order to break through this bottleneck, an accurate and efficient propagation prediction and optimization method empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed in this paper. Initially, a path loss model based on a multilayer perception neural network is established at 2.6 GHz for three base stations in an urban environment. Not like empirical models using environment types or deterministic models employing three-dimensional environment models, this AI-empowered model explores the environment feature by introducing interference clutters. This critical innovation makes the proposed model so accurate as ray tracing but much more efficient. Then, this validated model is utilized to realize a coverage prediction for 20 base stations only within 1 minute. Afterward, key parameters of these base stations, such as transmission power, elevation, and azimuth angles of antennas, are optimized using simulated annealing. This whole methodology paves the way for evolving the current 5G network to RWNs.

AB Underwater pipelines are the channels for oil transportation in the sea. In the course of pipeline operation, leakage accidents occur from time to time for natural and man-made reasons which result in economic losses and environmental pollution. To avoid economic losses and environmental pollution, damage detection of underwater pipelines must be carried out. In this paper, based on the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) and support vector machine (SVM), a non-contact ultrasonic imaging method is proposed to detect the shedding damage of the metal underwater pipeline external anti-corrosion layer. Firstly, the principle of acoustic scattering characteristics for detecting the metal underwater pipelines is introduced. Following this, a HOG+SVM image-extracting algorithm is used to extract the pipeline area from the underwater ultrasonic image. According to the difference of mean gray value in the horizontal direction of the pipeline project area, the shedding damage parts are identified. Subsequently, taking the metal underwater pipelines with three layers of polyethylene outer anti-corrosive coatings as the detection object, an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) for underwater pipelines defect detection is developed to verify the detection effect of the method. Finally, the underwater ultrasonic image which used to detect the metal underwater pipeline shedding damage is obtained by acoustic sensor. The results show that the shedding damage can be detected by the proposed method. With the increase of shedding damage width, the effect of pipeline defect location detection is better.

AB The efficiency and accuracy of the image semantic segmentation algorithm represent a trade-off relationship, and the loss of accuracy tends to increase as the model structure simplifies to improve efficiency. Developing more efficient and accurate algorithms requires methods to complement them. In this study, we applied the logarithmic-exponential mixture (LEM) function for gamma correction of images to improve the accuracy of image semantic segmentation. The basic model used in this work was produced by constructing a full convolution neural network based on MobileNetV2. To avoid the noise of input compression, we corrected training and validation images with gamma from 1/8 to 8 (7 different levels) before doing convolution. We evaluated models using Tensorflow deep-learning library based on Python. We compared models using LEM function to models using conventional gamma function. The prediction masks of the proposed model using the LEM function had relatively small fluctuations of accuracy upon gamma change. For images that have shadows overlapped on the object, the object was better distinguished in small gamma values. For dark images, the increase in accuracy was more effective. The results indicated that the proposed gamma correction could improve image segmentation accuracy in images with unclear edges. We believe that the presented results will guide further studies for accuracy improvement of image recognition algorithms applicable to future devices, such as autonomous vehicles and mobile robots.

AB The future evolution of autonomous mobility and road transportation will require substantial improvements in tyre adherence optimization. As new technologies being deployed in tyre manufacturing reduce total vehicle energy consumption, the contribution of tyre friction for safety and performance enhancement continues to increase. For this reason, the tyre's grip is starting to drive the focus of many tyre developments nowadays. This is because the tread compound attitude to maximize the interaction forces with the ground is the result of a mix of effects, involving polymer viscoelastic characteristics, road roughness profiles and the conditions under which each tyre works during its lifespan. In such a context, mainly concerning the automotive market, the testing, analysis and objectivation of the friction arising at the tread interface is performed by means of specific test benches called friction testers. This paper reviews the state of the art in such devices' development and use, with a global overview of the measurement methodologies and with a classification based on the working and specimen motion principle. Most tyre friction testers allow one to manage the relative sliding speed and the contact pressure between the specimen and the counter-surface, while just some of them are able to let the user vary the testing temperature. Few devices can really take into account the road real roughness, carrying out outdoor measurements, useful because they involve actual contact phenomena, but very complex to control outside the laboratory environment.

AB Drones have become prevalent for the delivery of goods by many retail companies such as Amazon and Dominos. Amazon has an issued patent that describes how drones scan and collect data on their fly-overs while dropping off packages. In this context, we propose a path optimization algorithm for a drone multi-hop communications network that can carry and forward data in addition to its primary function of parcel deliveries. We argue that traditional Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) based protocols may not be efficient for this purpose. Therefore, this paper proposes a new DTN-based algorithm that optimizes drone flight paths in conjunction with optimized routing to deliver both parcels and data in a power efficient way and within the shortest possible time. We propose a heuristic algorithm called Weighted Flight Path Planning (WFPP) that priorities the data packets in an exchange pool in order to create an optimized path for the drones. Our approach is to determine a weight for each packet based on the packet & x2019;s remaining time to live, priority, size, and location of the packet & x2019;s destination. When two drones meet each other, they exchange the high weighted packets. Simulation studies show that WFPP delivers up to 25 & x0025; more packets compared with EBR, EPIDEMIC, and a similar path planning method. Also, WFPP reduces the data delivery delays by up to 66 & x0025; while the overhead ratio is low.

AB Pedestrian detection, a key technology in computer vision, plays a paramount role in the applications of advanced driver assistant systems (ADASs) and autonomous vehicles. The objective of pedestrian detection is to identify and locate people in a dynamic environment so that accidents can be avoided. With significant variations introduced by illumination, occlusion, articulated pose, and complex background, pedestrian detection is a challenging task for visual perception. Different from visible images, thermal images are captured and presented with intensity maps based objects' emissivity, and thus have an enhanced spectral range to make human beings perceptible from the cool background. In this study, a sparse representation based approach is proposed for pedestrian detection from thermal images. We first adopted the histogram of sparse code to represent image features and then detect pedestrian with the extracted features in an unimodal and a multimodal framework respectively. In the unimodal framework, two types of dictionaries, i.e. joint dictionary and individual dictionary, are built by learning from prepared training samples. In the multimodal framework, a weighted fusion scheme is proposed to further highlight the contributions from features with higher separability. To validate the proposed approach, experiments were conducted to compare with three widely used features: Haar wavelets (HWs), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and histogram of phase congruency (HPC) as well as two classification methods, i.e. AdaBoost and support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results on a publicly available data set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INJURIES
AB Objective: To identify strengths and weaknesses in community based child passenger safety programs by developing a scoring instrument and conducting observations of child restraint use in three Native American communities.
   Setting: The three communities are autonomous Tribal reservations in the Pacific Northwest. Their per capita incomes and rates of unemployment are comparable.
   Methods: In each community, 100 children under 5 years old were observed for car seat use. A six item community assessment tool (100 points maximum) awarded points for such items as the type (primary or secondary) and enforcement of child restraint laws; availability of car seats from distribution programs; extent of educational programs; and access to data on vehicle injuries.
   Results: For children from birth to 4 years, the car seat use rate ranged from 12%-21%. Rates for infants (71%-80%) far exceeded rates for 1-4 year old children (5%-14%). Community scores ranged from 0 to 31.5 points. There was no correlation between scores and observed car seat use. One reason was the total lack of enforcement of restraint laws.
   Conclusions: A community assessment tool can highlight weaknesses in child passenger efforts. Linking such a tool with an objective measure of impact can be applied to other injury problems, such as fire safety or domestic violence. The very process of creating and implementing a community assessment can enhance agency collaboration and publicize evidence based "best practices" for injury prevention. Further study is needed to address methodologic issues and to examine crash and medical data in relation to community child passenger safety scores.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively used in a wide variety of domains in recent years. Owing to their power in analyzing graph-structured data, they have become broadly popular in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications as well. Despite their widespread applications in different transportation domains, there is no comprehensive review of recent advancements and future research directions that covers all transportation areas. Accordingly, in this survey, for the first time, we provide an overview of GNN studies in the general domain of ITS. Unlike previous surveys, which have been limited to traffic forecasting problems, we explore how GNN frameworks have evolved for different ITS applications, including traffic forecasting, demand prediction, autonomous vehicles, intersection management, parking management, urban planning, and transportation safety. Also, we micro-categorize the studies based on their transportation application to identify domain-specific research directions, opportunities, and challenges, which have been missing in previous surveys. Moreover, we identify unique and undiscussed research opportunities and directions, which is the result of reviewing a wide range of transportation applications. The neglected role of edge and graph learning in ITS applications, developing multi-modal models, and exploiting the power of unsupervised and reinforcement learning methods for developing more powerful GNNs are some examples of such new discussions in this survey. Finally, we have identified popular baseline models and datasets in each transportation domain, which facilitate the development and evaluation of future GNN-based frameworks.

DE Integration navigation; Factor graph; Optimization
ID MULTISENSOR FUSION; INFORMATION FUSION; ENVIRONMENTS
AB We propose a low-cost integrated navigation system to enhance navigation accuracy using multiple sensors such as the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS). Due to the heterogeneity of the employed sensors, the suggested navigation system is equipped with a graph-based optimizer formulated as a maximum a posteriori estimator. As already known, graphic optimization methods are computationally more complex. To reduce this complexity, high-frequency IMU measurements are pre-integrated between lower-frequency GPS measurements. These pre-integrated measurements can be utilized in conjunction with the magnetometer and barometer sensor measurements to carry out navigation in case of GPS weak signal reception. The resulting optimization graph will be solved using the marginalization technique to attain a less computationally intensive optimization favorable in real-time applications. Incorporating internal sensors in navigation will come with problems like the initialization phase. This problem is tackled by integrating the inertial measurements between the required states in the body frame of the last state and then transforming them into the world frame. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed method in real-time situations, a dataset collected by a SkywalkerX8 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is utilized. This dataset includes all the necessary maneuvers, including climb, descent, turn and cruise during the flight time. The results confirm that our proposed integrated system has superior statistical measures and temporal performance compared to the extended Kalman filter (EKF); it outperforms the conventional Factor Graph Optimization and EKF by approximately 45%.

AB Collision detection is critical for autonomous vehicles or robots to serve human society safely. Detecting looming objects robustly and timely plays an important role in collision avoidance systems. The locust lobula giant movement detector (LGMD1) is specifically selective to looming objects which are on a direct collision course. However, the existing LGMD1 models cannot distinguish a looming object from a near and fast translatory moving object, because the latter can evoke a large amount of excitation that can lead to false LGMD1 spikes. This article presents a new visual neural system model (LGMD1) that applies a neural competition mechanism within a framework of separated ON and OFF pathways to shut off the translating response. The competition-based approach responds vigorously to monotonous ON/OFF responses resulting from a looming object. However, it does not respond to paired ON-OFF responses that result from a translating object, thereby enhancing collision selectivity. Moreover, a complementary denoising mechanism ensures reliable collision detection. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we have conducted systematic comparative experiments on synthetic and real datasets. The results show that our method exhibits more accurate discrimination between looming and translational events--the looming motion can be correctly detected. It also demonstrates that the proposed model is more robust than comparative models.

AB The exponential growth of diverse smart mobile applications such as smart monitoring, holograms, and autonomous vehicles are driving mobile technologies toward a more intelligent and software-defined communication system. This growing demand has led to the next giant leap in next-generation wireless communication technology, i.e., sixth-generation (6G) mobile technology, which anticipates providing 1 Tbps data rates and ultralow latency over ubiquitous 3D coverage areas. However, the transport network, which connects hundreds of thousands of cell sites and the network core to enable intelligence, virtualization, and other key features of 6G, has not advanced enough to cater the dense cell deployment expected in future 6G networks. Because many aspects of 6G remain undefined, this provides us with the opportunity to take optical transport networks into design consideration to realize the benefits that 6G has to offer. To this end, in this paper, we present a comprehensive view on the role of optical access networks in supporting fourth-generation (4G), fifth-generation (5G), and beyond wireless technologies. In particular, we discuss design and deployment strategies and their challenges when using optical access as a transport solution during the evolution of wireless access technologies. For this purpose, we first identify how an optical access network is used to support high-capacity transport networks in 4G, followed by the challenges that 5G brought into optical transport networks and its diverse solutions. We conclude the paper by providing insights into how an optical transport network can be designed to support 6G. (C) 2022 Optical Society of America

AB Wireless communication systems play an essential role in everyday life situations and enable a wide range of location-based services to their users. The imminent adoption of 5G networks worldwide and the future establishment of next-generation wireless networks will allow various applications, such as autonomous vehicles, connected robotics, and most recently, crowd monitoring for fighting infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. In this context, radio localization techniques have become an essential tool to provide solid performance for mobile positioning systems, through increased accuracy or less computational time. With this in mind, we propose a trilateration-based approach using machine learning (ML) and sequential least-square programming (SLSQP) optimization to estimate the outdoor position of mobile terminals in cellular networks. The ML technique employed is the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). The optimization methods analyzed are Nelder- Mead (NM), genetic algorithms (GA), and SLSQP. Different environments (noise-free and noisy) and network scenarios (different numbers of base stations) are considered to evaluate the approaches. Numerical results indicate that the k-NN/SLSQP technique has similar accuracy compared to the k-NN/GA with eight generations. Both perform better than k-NN/NM in all scenarios and environments. When comparing computational times, our proposal is considerably more time-efficient. Aside from that, SLSQP computational time is less affected by network scenarios with more base stations in comparison with GA. That feature is significant considering the ultra-dense base station deployment forecasted for the next-generation cellular networks.

AB The accuracy and stability of relative pose estimation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a target depend on whether the characteristics of the underwater image can be accurately and quickly extracted. In this paper, a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) based on lateral inhibition (LI) is proposed to solve the image matching and vision-guided AUV docking problem. The proposed method is named the LI-WOA. The WOA is motivated by the behavior of humpback whales, and it mainly imitates encircling prey, bubble-net attacking and searching for prey to obtain the globally optimal solution in the search space. The WOA not only balances exploration and exploitation but also has a faster convergence speed, higher calculation accuracy and stronger robustness than other approaches. The lateral inhibition mechanism can effectively perform image enhancement and image edge extraction to improve the accuracy and stability of image matching. The LI-WOA combines the optimization efficiency of theWOA and the matching accuracy of the LI mechanism to improve convergence accuracy and the correct matching rate. To verify its effectiveness and feasibility, the WOA is compared with other algorithms by maximizing the similarity between the original image and the template image. The experimental results show that the LI-WOA has a better average value, a higher correct rate, less execution time and stronger robustness than other algorithms. The LI-WOA is an effective and stable method for solving the image matching and vision-guided AUV docking problem.

AB Recently, the trend of public transportation has evolved from traditional vehicles to intelligent transportation systems. Among many innovative systems, the development of group rapid transit (GRT) has become increasingly important. This study aims to explore the key acceptance factors for users to adopt GRT through three dimensions: technology, sharing, and experiential marketing (TSE). First, this study identifies variables under each construct of the TSE model through a literature review and interviews with experts, so as to understand what factors of the model impact users' usage intention and continuous usage intention. Subsequently, through a questionnaire survey, the theoretical model is verified. The participants of the survey were users of GRT, and a total of 306 valid questionnaires were collected. Through structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, the results indicate that technology does not significantly impact usage intention, as users may not fully understand GRT's future developments; technology only affects continuous usage intention. Sharing also only influences continuous usage intention. These results show that the adoption of GRT may be gradual and long-term rather than short-term.

AB Ocean worlds are numerous in our solar system. Here, we present an overview of how passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and signal detection systems, developed for acoustic sensing in Earth's ocean, might be used to explore an ocean and/or surface sea world in the outer solar system. Three potential seagoing mobile platforms for a PAM system are considered: a saildrone or surface buoy for exploring Saturn's largest moon, Titan, and an autonomous underwater vehicle for exploring the sub-ice oceans of Enceladus, one of Saturn's smaller moons, or Europa, one of Jupiter's larger moons. We also evaluate preparation of an acoustic system and electronics for the rigors of spaceflight and the challenging environments of outer solar system planetary bodies. The relatively benign Europa/Enceladus ocean thermal environment (-40 degrees to 40 degrees C) suggests a standard commercial acoustic product may meet system design needs. In comparison, a PAM system for Titan's hydrocarbon seas must function at -180 degrees C temperatures, necessitating testing in liquid nitrogen. We also discuss adapting for outer ocean world exploration, acoustic signal detection, and classification algorithms used widely in ocean research on Earth, as well as data compression methods for interplanetary transmission. The characteristics of geophysical, cryogenic, and meteorological acoustic signals expected in an ocean or surface sea world, including signals from seafloor cold seeps and/or hydrothermal vents, are considered because of their potential to harbor chemosynthetic life.

ID VISION
AB Ego-motion estimation, as one of the core technologies of unmanned systems, is widely used in autonomous robot navigation, unmanned driving, augmented reality and other fields. With the development of computer vision, there has been considerable interest in ego-motion estimation with visual navigation. One of the core technologies in Visual navigation is using the matching feature points between consecutive image frames to estimate pose. Since the feature-based method performed under the assumption of a static environment, it susceptive to the dynamic targets. Visual navigation in the dynamic environment has become an important research issue. This paper proposed a practical and robust features selection algorithm of visual navigation which avoids using the feature points on dynamic objects. Firstly, according to the instance segmentation of deep neural network, the objects are classified into potential dynamic and static categories. Subsequently, the matching features on the potential moving objects are used to update vehicle state respectively, meanwhile, the relevant reprojection error of other feature points on the background could be calculated. Eventually, the result of whether the target is moving or not will be judged by the reprojection error, and the features on dynamic targets are removed. To illustrate the effectiveness of the features selection method in the dynamic environment, the proposed algorithm is merged into an MSCKF based on tri-focal tensor geometry, and it has been evaluated in a public dataset. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB One camera and one low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) form a monocular visual-inertial system (VINS), which is the minimum sensor suite (in size, weight, and power) for the metric six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) state estimation. In this paper, we present VINS-Mono: a robust and versatile monocular visual-inertial state estimator. Our approach starts with a robust procedure for estimator initialization. A tightly coupled, nonlinear optimization-based method is used to obtain highly accurate visual-inertial odometry by fusing preintegrated IMU measurements and feature observations. A loop detection module, in combination with our tightly coupled formulation, enables relocalization with minimum computation. We additionally perform 4-DOF pose graph optimization to enforce the global consistency. Furthermore, the proposed system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way. The current and previous maps can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization. We validate the performance of our system on public datasets and real-world experiments and compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also perform an onboard closed-loop autonomous flight on the microaerial-vehicle platform and port the algorithm to an iOS-based demonstration. We highlight that the proposed work is a reliable, complete, and versatile system that is applicable for different applications that require high accuracy in localization. We open source our implementations for both PCs (https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINSMono) and iOS mobile devices (https://github.com/HKUST-AerialRobotics/VINS-Mobile).

AB Ground or aerial robots equipped with advanced sensing technologies, such as three-dimensional laser scanners and advanced mapping algorithms, are deemed useful as a supporting technology for first responders. A great deal of excellent research in the field exists, but practical applications at real disaster sites are scarce. Many projects concentrate on equipping robots with advanced capabilities, such as autonomous exploration or object manipulation. In spite of this, realistic application areas for such robots are limited to teleoperated reconnaissance or search. In this paper, we investigate how well state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf components and algorithms are suited for reconnaissance in current disaster-relief scenarios. The basic idea is to make use of some of the most common sensors and deploy some widely used algorithms in a disaster situation, and to evaluate how well the components work for these scenarios. We acquired the sensor data from two field experiments, one from a disaster-relief operation in a motorway tunnel, and one from a mapping experiment in a partly closed down motorway tunnel. Based on these data, which we make publicly available, we evaluate state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf mapping approaches. In our analysis, we integrate opinions and replies from first responders as well as from some algorithm developers on the usefulness of the data and the limitations of the deployed approaches, respectively. We discuss the lessons we learned during the two missions. These lessons are interesting for the community working in similar areas of urban search and rescue, particularly reconnaissance and search.

AB Evaluating the organic carbon flux from the surface ocean to the interior (the marine biological pump) is essential for predictions of ocean carbon cycle feedback to climate change. One approach for determining these fluxes is to measure the concentration of oxygen in the upper ocean over a seasonal cycle, calculate the net O-2 flux using an upper ocean model, and then use a stoichiometric relationship between oxygen evolved and organic carbon produced. Applying this tracer in a variety of ocean areas over seasonal cycles requires accurate O-2 measurements on autonomous vehicles. Here we demonstrate this approach using an O-2 sensor on a profiling float that is periodically calibrated against atmospheric pO(2). Using accurate data and a model that includes all physical and biological processes influencing oxygen, we determine an annual net community production of 0.7 +/- 0.5 mol Cm-2 yr(-1) in the northeast Pacific Ocean (50 degrees N, 145 degrees W) from June 2012 to June 2013. There is a strong seasonal cycle in net biological oxygen production with wintertime fluxes caused by bubble processes critical to determining the annual flux. Approximately 50% of net autotrophic production during summer months is consumed by net respiration during the winter. The result is a biological pump in the subarctic Pacific Ocean that is less than that determined by similar methods in the subtropics to the south. This estimate is significantly lower than that predicted by satellite remote sensing and global circulation models.

AB The present study investigated the effects of low cognitive workload and the absence of arousal induced via external physical stimulation (motion) on practice-related improvements in executive (inhibitory) control, short-term memory, metacognitive monitoring and decision making. A total of 70 office workers performed low and moderately engaging passenger tasks in two successive 20-minute simulated drives and repeated a battery of decision making and inhibitory control tests three times before, between and after these drives. For half the participants, visual simulation was synchronised with (moderately arousing) motion generated through LAnd Motion Platform, with vibration levels corresponding to a well-maintained unsealed road. The other half performed the same simulated drive without motion. Participants' performance significantly improved over the three test blocks, which is indicative of typical practice effects. The magnitude of these improvements was the highest when both motion and moderate cognitive load were present. The same effects declined either in the absence of motion (low arousal) or following a low cognitive workload task, thus suggesting two distinct pathways through which practice-related improvements in cognitive performance may be hampered. Practice, however, degraded certain aspects of metacognitive performance, as participants became less likely to detect incorrect decisions in the decision-making test with each subsequent test block. Implications include consideration of low cognitive load and arousal as factors responsible for performance decline and targets for the development of interventions/strategies in low load/arousal conditions such as autonomous vehicle operations and highway driving.

   APPLICATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Navigation; Multi-sensor systems; Sensor fusion
ID KALMAN FILTER; ORIENTATION
AB Purpose - This paper presents the results of a heading estimation method for a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The output rate of commercially available underwater compasses is typically in the order of a few Hz. Heading frequencies of at least 1 KHz are desirable for navigation and control purposes.
   Design/methodology/approach - The estimation was performed by fusioning the signals of three inertial sensors: the ROV's own underwater compass (which operates roughly at 10 Hz or less), the ROV's embedded gyro and an additional angular rate sensor that provides readings from 1 to 3 KHz. The output signal of the additional angular rate sensor is not part of the proposed Kalman filter. Nonetheless a five-point Newton-Cotes closed integration of such signal is fed into the Kalman filter implementation that performs the required heading estimation at 1 KHz or more.
   Findings - The proposed Kalman filter implementation is a suitable approach to estimate heading position even though the original compass signal rate is significantly slower than the signal required for both assisted and autonomous control.
   Research limitations/implications - The estimated heading yield good results in both simulation and experimental environments.
   Originality/value - The method was embedded in a dedicated 16-bit DSP that handles both the acquisition of the three signals and the heading estimation, hence resulting in a very low-cost solution. The embedded solution was tested in the developed submarine and the obtained high-rate heading parameter is now used by the control system of the ROV.

TI Extracting geometric and semantic point cloud features with gateway
   attention for accurate 3D object detection
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

AB 3D object detection using point clouds has received a lot of attention in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and virtual reality. However, feature learning for 3D object detection from point cloud is very challenging due to the irregularity and sparsity of 3D point cloud data. Grid-based methods convert irregular point clouds into regular 2D views or 3D voxels and then use 2D CNN or 3D CNN for feature learning, but the point cloud transformation process will inevitably cause quantization loss. Point-based methods use the PointNet network to directly learn the features of the point cloud, but the semantic information obtained by PointNet may be incomplete. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Gateway Attention-based Point Set Abstraction 3D object detector (GAPSA) to learn geometric and semantic point cloud features. Specifically, the framework utilizes set abstraction downsampling points and performs local feature extraction on the sampling points through the proposed gateway attention pooling module to learn more discriminative point cloud features. Given the high-quality 3D proposals generated by attention-based backbone networks, we design a RoI multi -pooling head to adaptively learn features for sparse points of interest within proposals, so as to encode richer contextual information and obtain fine-grained features to accurately estimate object confidence and location. Compared with advanced point-based 3D object detectors, experimental results demonstrate that our attention -based point set abstraction 3D object detector has the best detection performance on KITTI and NuScenes datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/liuhuaijjin/GAPSA.

AB Navigation/positioning systems have become critical to many applications, such as autonomous driving, Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and smart cities. However, it is difficult to provide a robust, accurate, and seamless solution with single navigation/positioning technology. For example, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) cannot perform satisfactorily indoors; consequently, multi-sensor integrated systems provide the solution, as they compensate for the limitations of single technology by using the complementary characteristics of different sensors. This article describes a thorough investigation into multi-sensor data fusion, which over the last ten years has been used for integrated positioning/navigation systems. In this article, different navigation/positioning systems are classified and elaborated upon from three aspects: (1) sources, (2) algorithms and architectures, and (3) scenarios, which we further divide into two categories: (i) analytics-based fusion and (ii) learning-based fusion. For analytics-based fusion, we discuss the Kalman filter and its variants, graph optimization methods, and integrated schemes. For learning-based fusion, several supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, and deep learning techniques are illustrated in multi -sensor integrated positioning/navigation systems. Design consideration of these integrated systems is discussed in detail from several aspects and their application scenarios are categorized. Finally, future directions for their research and implementation are discussed.

AB This paper develops a cooperative federated reinforcement learning (RL) strategy that enables two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to cooperate in learning and predicting the movements of an intelligent deceptive target in a given search area. The proposed strategy allows the UAVs to autonomously cooperate, through information exchange of the gained experience to maximize the target detection performance and accelerate the learning speed while maintaining privacy. Specifically, we consider a monitoring model that includes a search area, a charging station, two cooperative UAVs, an intelligent deceptive uncertain moving target, and a fake (false) target. Each UAV is equipped with a limited-capacity rechargeable battery and a communication unit for exchanging the gained experience. The problem of maximizing the detection probability of the uncertain deceptive target using cooperative UAVs is mathematically modeled as a search -benefit maximization problem, which is then reformulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) due to the uncertainty nature of the problem. Because there is no prior information on the targets' movement, a cooperative RL, is utilized to tackle the problem. The proposed cooperative RL-based algorithm is a distributed collaborative mechanism that enables the two UAVs, i.e., agents, to individually interact with the operating environment and maximize their cumulative rewards by converging to a shared policy while achieving privacy. Simulation results indicate that a cooperative RL-based dual UAV system can noticeably improve the target detection probability, reduce the detection performance, and accelerate the learning speed.

AB Ocean robots have important application value in both military and civil fields. However, ocean robots powered by batteries need to be launched and recovered frequently during mission due to the lack of continuous power supply. Capturing wave energy is a promising method to provide sustainable energy for ocean robots, despite that the existed wave energy converters (WECs) designed for ocean robots have limited power generation ca-pacity. In this paper, we propose a deployable WEC for ocean robots to increase the wave energy capture per-formance in power generation mode and reduce the drag force in motion mode. The structure design and the power generation principle of deployable WEC are firstly introduced. Then, we establish the frequency domain and time domain dynamics models of wave energy harvesting. After that, a simulation platform based on the time-domain model is established to reveal the influence of wave amplitude, wave period, generator damping and the location of robot center of gravity (COG) on the dynamic response characteristics and wave energy capture performance. The results show that the highest capture width ratio of WEC can reach about 0.5 under the excitation of regular wave (T = 1.6 s, A = 0.02 m). The WEC proposed in this paper uses the deployable mechanism for on-board wave energy generation and overcomes the constraint of the size of the ocean robot on the power generation performance of WEC, which provides a new solution to the energy supply problem of ocean robots in the future.

DE lane detection; autonomous driving; deep learning
AB Lane detection, as a basic environmental perception task, plays a significant role in the safety of automatic driving. Modern lane detection methods have obtained a better performance in most scenarios, but many are unsatisfactory in various scenarios, with a weak appearance (e.g., serious vehicle occlusion, dark shadows, ambiguous markings, etc.), and have issues in simplifying model predictions and flexibly detecting lanes of a non-fixed structure and number. In this work, we abstracted the lane lines as a series of discrete key points and proposed a lane detection method of parallel multi-scale feature aggregation based on key points, FPLane. The main task of FPLane is to focus on the precise location of key points in the global lanes and aggregate the global detection results into the local geometric modeling of lane lines by using the idea of association embedding. Furthermore, this work proposes the parallel Multi-scale Feature Aggregation network (MFANet) in FPLane integrating the context information of multi-scale feature mappings to take full advantage of the prior information of adjacent positions. In addition, MFANet incorporates the Double-headed Attention Feature Fusion Up-sampling module, which can facilitate the network to accurately recognize and detect objects under extreme scale variation. Finally, our method is tested on Tusimple and CULane lane detection datasets; the results show that the proposed method outperforms the current mainstream methods: the accuracy and F1-score of the model are 96.82% and 75.6%, respectively, and the real-time detection efficiency of the model can maintain 28 ms.

AB Increasingly, the task of detecting and recognizing the actions of a human has been delegated to some form of neural network processing camera or wearable sensor data. Due to the degree to which the camera can be affected by lighting and wearable sensors scantiness, neither one modality can capture the required data to perform the task confidently. That being the case, range sensors, like light detection and ranging (LiDAR), can complement the process to perceive the environment more robustly. Most recently, researchers have been exploring ways to apply convolutional neural networks to 3-D data. These methods typically rely on a single modality and cannot draw on information from complementing sensor streams to improve accuracy. This article proposes a framework to tackle human activity recognition by leveraging the benefits of sensor fusion and multimodal machine learning. Given both RGB and point cloud data, our method describes the activities being performed by subjects using regions with a convolutional neural network (R-CNN) and a 3-D modified Fisher vector network. Evaluated on a custom captured multimodal dataset demonstrates that the model outputs remarkably accurate human activity classification (90%). Furthermore, this framework can be used for sports analytics, understanding social behavior, surveillance, and perhaps most notably by autonomous vehicles (AVs) to data-driven decision-making policies in urban areas and indoor environments.

AB Glider observations from the Northwestern Iberian Margin during the exceptionally strong 2010 summer upwelling season resolved the evolution of physical and biogeochemical variables during two upwelling events. Upwelling brought low-oxygen Eastern North Atlantic Central Water from 190m depth onto the shelf up to a depth of 50m. During the two observed periods of upwelling, a poleward jet developed over the shelf break. The persistent upwelling favorable winds maintained equatorward flow on the outer shelf for 2months with no reversals during relaxation periods, a phenomenon not previously observed. During upwelling, near-surface chlorophyll a concentration increased by more than 6mgm(-3). Oxygen supersaturation in the near surface increased by more than 20%, 6 days after the chlorophyll a maximum.
   Plain Language Summary In summer 2010, an autonomous underwater vehicle was used to measure changing water properties in the ocean offshore of Vigo, NW Spain. During summer, winds blowing southward along the Iberian coast push surface waters offshore, causing deep, cold, nutrient-rich water to rise to the surface. The nutrients brought up with this cold water enable growth of phytoplankton, impacting higher trophic levels and local fisheries. During June and July 2010 we observed two episodes of deep water rising and the subsequent increases in phytoplankton. Increases in dissolved oxygen concentration and ocean current speed were also observed. Using a robotic underwater glider allowed us to obtain high-resolution observations over a longer time period at a fraction of the cost of a research vessel cruise.

AB Embedded systems are being aggressively integrated in every aspect of modern life, with uses ranging from personal devices to devices deployed in critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, aircrafts, and industrial control systems. Embedded systems handle sensitive information, which can be potentially exposed leveraging their poor security posture. In this paper, we present a novel attack vector that automates stealthy information leakage from modern embedded systems. Specifically, we leverage the Device Tree, a data structure that describes the hardware profile of a system, to extract detailed information about the target system. Utilizing this information, we introduce a stealthy attack that attempts to bridge the air-gap by transferring data from memory directly to analog peripherals. The attack resides solely in the peripherals, completely transparent to the main CPU, by judiciously short-circuiting specific components. We implement this attack on a commercial Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), leaking information over the available LEDs. We evaluate the presented attack vector in terms of stealthiness, and we demonstrate no observable overhead on both CPU performance and DMA transfer speed. Furthermore, we propose a generalized defense scheme for peripheral exploitation attacks by establishing a hardware root of trust through JTAG debugging. Our methodology keeps track of peripheral traffic through JTAG-enabled monitoring, alerts the system for possible malicious behavior and handles the threat removal. We test our defense in terms of imposed performance overhead and overall potency, achieving solid detection of the underlying attack at a low performance cost.

AB In order to study the security of Internet of drones (IoD), convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was compared with autonomous IoD. Moreover, wireless communication technology was used to analyze and design a more optimized model for system security performance. The model constructed was simulated, and relevant data were collected to verify its security performance. The results show that the clustering algorithm based on node energy has the best performance in the performance analysis of IoD. When the number of nodes is appropriate, it can avoid wasting bandwidth resources and overloading, and the number of switching between clusters is less than other algorithms. Therefore, EWCA algorithm can be used to improve the lifetime of the whole network and enhances the availability of IoD. When analyzing the security performance based on the system security interruption probability, it is found that the lower the security interruption rate is when the energy acquisition coefficient alpha is close to 0.5, the longer the IoD is used for information transmission, and the better the security performance is. The greater the signal-to-noise ratio is, the better the network security performance is, and the network performance is the best when the number of nodes tends to be 10. Therefore, through the research, it is found that the model built increases the security of IoD. Although there are some shortcomings in the experimental process, it still provides experimental basis for the later development of IoD.

ID DESIGN; ACCELEROMETER; FABRICATION
AB The design, simulation, fabrication, and experiments of a novel flow sensor based on resonant sensing with a two-stage microleverage mechanism are presented in this paper. Different from the conventional detection methods for flow sensors, two differential resonators are adopted to implement air flow rate transformation through two-stage leverage magnification. The proposed flow sensor has a high sensitivity since the adopted two-stage microleverage mechanism possesses a higher amplification factor than a single-stage microleverage mechanism. The modal distribution and geometric dimension of the two-stage leverage mechanism and hair are analyzed and optimized by Ansys simulation. A digital closed-loop driving technique with a phase frequency detector-based coordinate rotation digital computer algorithm is implemented for the detection and locking of resonance frequency. The sensor fabricated by the standard deep dry silicon on a glass process has a device dimension of 5100 mu m (length) x 5100 mu m (width) x 100 mu m (height) with a hair diameter of 1000 mu m. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate that the maximal mechanical sensitivity of the flow sensor is approximately 7.41 Hz/(m/s)(2) at a resonant frequency of 22 kHz for the hair height of 9 mm and increases by 2.42 times as hair height extends from 3mm to 9mm. Simultaneously, a detection-limit of 3.23 mm/s air flow amplitude at 60 Hz is confirmed. The proposed flow sensor has great application prospects in the micro-autonomous system and technology, self-stabilizing micro-air vehicles, and environmental monitoring. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB The Tactile Internet (TI) is a recently emerging field that has been developing and evolving to date, since its communications parallel the sense of human touch. Lately, the revolutionized concept, Metaverse, draws attention due to the evolved immersive experience of human perception of the surrounding environment. This technology supports the ultimate union between the physical and virtual world, facilitated by 5G and beyond communication networks. Users are capable of interacting with machines and devices in real-time, remotely, resembling the actions of their physical counterparts. The particular approaches are still in their infancy and expected to produce spectacular results in various sectors such as industry, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, etc. This immersion is further assisted by the Internet of Things, while expecting full wireless support by 5G networks. In this article, a systematic review studies the domains of TI, 5G and beyond networks, as well as their relations with the Metaverse, rendering the respective schemes Key Enabling Technologies for the future Metaverse. A thorough analysis is conducted on the underpinning schemes, relative architectures, structures, and operation modes. In addition, a comprehensive list is presented, focusing on related application fields and their benefits, considering the strengths and weaknesses of the involved technologies. Finally, challenges and issues arising are discussed, both from the perspective of technical requirements and the psychosomatic aspect of human experience.

AB The applications requiring three-dimensional information have been growing rapidly, including facial recognition, gesture recognition, auto-focus for 2D camera, self-driving autonomous vehicles, etc. Indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) technique has been adopted widely for 3D depth imaging due to its high spatial resolution and excellent depth accuracy performance. In this brief, a 200 MHz pulsed optical Illuminator for iToF applications is reported. A 940 nm GaAs-based triple-junction VCSEL array is adopted and an integrated pulsed VCSEL driver ASIC in 180 nm BCD process is realized. Optical pulses with peak power up to 14 W can be transmitted by the laser illuminator with a maximum driving current of 6.5 A by the driver ASIC. The modulation frequency can be up to 200 MHz. Automatic optical power control (AOPC) is realized for stable optical power output and laser eye safety protection. An on-chip DLL-based time interpolator is proposed to eliminate the mechanical moving components used during system calibration. The measured absolute accuracy of the time interpolator is +/-50 ps with a resolution of 800 ps and tuning range of 49.6 ns. This brief effectively extends the measurement distance of the iToF system. The calibration efficiency is also improved with the proposed method.

AB Driven by the rapid development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing and other emerging technologies, the connotation of cyberspace is constantly expanding and becoming the fifth dimension of human activities. How-ever, security problems in cyberspace are becoming serious, and traditional defense measures (e.g., firewall, intrusion detection systems, and security audits) often fall into a passive situation of being prone to attacks and difficult to take effect when responding to new types of network attacks with a higher and higher degree of coordination and intelligence. By constructing and implementing the diverse strategy of dynamic transformation, the configuration characteristics of systems are constantly changing, and the probability of vulnerability exposure is increasing. Therefore, the difficulty and cost of attack are increasing, which provides new ideas for reversing the asymmetric situation of defense and attack in cyberspace. Nonetheless, few related works systematically introduce dynamic defense mechanisms for cyber security. The related concepts and development strategies of dynamic defense are rarely analyzed and summarized. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive and concrete survey of recent research efforts on dynamic defense in cyber security. Specifically, we firstly introduce basic concepts and define dynamic defense in cyber security. Next, we review the architectures, enabling techniques and methods for moving target defense and mimic defense. This is followed by taxonomically summarizing the implementation and evaluation of dynamic defense. Finally, we discuss some open challenges and opportunities for dynamic defense in cyber security.

AB As oceans cover the majority of the earth's surface, it becomes inevitable in extending the concepts of Internet of Things (IoT) to ocean bodies, thereby tiling the way for a new drift in the digital world, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). The primary objective of IoUT is the creation of a network of several smart interconnected undersea things, to digitally link water bodies by using devices such as autonomous underwater vehicles. Since the traditional ideas of IoT cannot be merely expanded to underwater, due to the difference in environmental characteristics, this puts forward a variety of challenges for scientists to work with IoUT, and one such challenge is the network management with IoUT. This paper gives an overview on (1) underwater network management systems (U-NMS) using acoustic communication in IoUT; (2) the challenges and benefits and use cases of U-NMS; (3) fault, configuration, accounting, performance, security and constrained management (FCAPSC) functionalities of U-NMS and (4) a comparison between network management system in IoT and U-NMS system in IoUT. Additionally, this paper shows the prototype design and implementation setup of U-NMS in a laboratory environment, using lightweight machine to machine (LWM2M) and acoustic communication technology for IoUT. This paper will contribute much to the profit of researchers and industry players in uncovering the critical areas of the Internet of Underwater Things.

TI Is There a Limit to Adoption of Dynamic Ridesharing Systems? Evidence
   from Analysis of Uber Demand Data from New York City
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID BUS RIDERSHIP; TAXI; TRAVEL
AB Recent technological advances have paved the way for new mobility alternatives within established transportation networks, including on-demand ride hailing/sharing (e.g., Uber, Lyft) and citywide bike sharing. Common across these innovative modes is a lack of direct ownership by the user; in each of these mobility offerings, a resource not owned by the end users' is shared for fulfilling travel needs. This concept has flourished and is being hailed as a potential option for autonomous vehicle operation moving forward. However, substantial investigation into how new shared modes affect travel behaviors and integrate into existing transportation networks is lacking. This paper explores whether the growth in the adoption and usage of these modes is unbounded, or if there is a limit to their uptake. Recent trends and shifts in Uber demand usage from New York City were investigated to explore the hypothesis. Using publicly available data about Uber trips, temporal trends in the weekly demand for Uber were explored in the borough of Manhattan. A panel-based random effects model accounting for both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation effects was estimated wherein weekly demand was expressed as a function of a variety of demographic, land use, and environmental factors. It was observed that demand appeared to initially increase after the introduction of Uber, but seemed to have stagnated and waned over time in heavily residential portions of the island, contradicting the observed macroscopic unbounded growth. The implications extend beyond already existing fully shared systems and also affect the planning of future mobility offerings.

AB The lava flows produced by eruptions at Axial Seamount in 1998, 2011, and 2015 were mapped at 1 m resolution from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) developed at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). A portion of the flows erupted in 2011 and 2015 are defined by pre-and post-eruption AUV surveys. Data processing software, also developed at MBARI, precisely coregisters pre-and post-eruption surveys to allow construction of difference maps by subtracting a pre-eruption grid from a post-eruption grid. Such difference maps are key to extracting detailed information about eruptive processes and emplacement of the lava flows. All three eruptions began on the east side of the caldera, and each produced similar to 25 x 10(6) m(3) of thin channelized flows (with sheet lava channels, lobate lava interiors with pillars, and distal inflated pillow lobes) in the caldera and on the upper south or north rifts. The 1998 and 2011 eruptions propagated down the south rift, and the 2015 eruption propagated down the north rift. The 2011 and 2015 eruptions formed shallow grabens surrounding new non-eruptive open fissures on the east rim of the caldera and produced thick hummocky flows on upper to mid rifts, and the 2011 eruption also produced a thick hummocky flow on the lower south rift. Future eruptions at Axial Seamount will likely follow this pattern, regardless of which rift is the locus of the eruption.

TI Routed roads: Probabilistic vision-based place recognition for changing
   conditions, split streets and varied viewpoints
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Robotic vision; place recognition; localization
AB Vision-based place recognition is becoming an increasingly viable component of navigation systems for autonomous robots and personal aids. However, attaining robustness to variations in environmental conditionssuch as time of day, weather and seasonand camera viewpoint remains a major challenge. Featureless, sequence-based place recognition techniques have demonstrated promise, but often rely on long image sequences, manually-tuned parameters and exhaustive sequence match searching through multiple locations and image scales. In this paper, we address these deficiencies by implementing a condition-invariant, sequence-based place recognition algorithm suitable for networked environments, such as city streets, and routes with lateral platform shift, such as multiple-lane roads. We achieve this capability by augmenting the traditional 1D image database with a directed graph to describe the branching of contiguous sections of imagery at intersections. A particle filter is then used to efficiently explore these paths, as well as various lateral positions synthesized by rescaling imagery. Our proposed approach eliminates manual tuning of sequence length parameters, improves localization on branched routes, improves overall place recognition accuracy and coverage, and reduces computational requirements. We evaluated the new method against the original SeqSLAM and SMART algorithms on two day-night, road-based datasets and a summer-winter train dataset, where it attained superior precision-recall performance and coverage in all environments. Together, these contributions represent a significant step towards the provision of a robust, near parameter-free condition- and viewpoint-invariant visual place recognition capability for vehicles and robots.

AB The integration of shared, autonomous, electric, and on-demand mobility services introduces urban air mobility (UAM) as an emerging intra-city transportation service operated by vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Despite the potential benefits of UAM limited literature exists on the end user's perception and the challenges to its societal acceptance, especially in developing economies. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by investigating the factors influencing UAM usage intention in Tehran, a developing country capital. Within the framework of the extended technology acceptance model, the study collected 828 valid questionnaires through a face-to-face survey. Structural equation modeling is employed to highlight the effects of a wide range of factors associated with individual differences, system characteristics, and social influence. The findings indicate that attitude, subjective norms, trust, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, personal innovativeness, ecological awareness, and price evaluation are positively associated with UAM usage intention, while perceived safety correlates with the attitude toward UAM negatively. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders, fostering a deeper understanding of end-user perspectives in developing countries, and prudently promising the potential for its targeted implementation. The study suggests that although its widespread adoption in developing countries is unlikely to occur in the near future, UAM should be regarded as a viable early and timely solution to persistent issues such as chronic congestion in metropolitan areas of the global south.

AB The navigation and positioning of multi-autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the complex and variable marine environment is a significant and much-needed area of attention, especially considering the fact that cooperative navigation technology is the essential method for multiple AUVs to solve positioning problems. When the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied for underwater cooperative localization, the outliers in the sensor observations cause unknown errors in the measurement system due to deep-sea environmental factors, which are difficult to calibrate and cause a significant reduction in the co-location accuracy of AUVs, and can even cause problems with a divergence of estimation error. In this paper, we proposed a cooperative navigation method of the EKF algorithm based on the combined observation of multiple AUVs. Firstly, the corresponding cooperative navigation model is established, and the corresponding measurement model is designed. Then, the EKF model based on combined observation is designed and constructed, and the unknown error is eliminated by introducing a previously measured value. Finally, simulation tests and lake experiments are designed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. The results indicate that the EKF algorithm based on combined observation can approximately eliminate errors and improve the accuracy of cooperative localization when the unknown measurement error cannot be calibrated by common EKF methods. The effect of state estimation is improved, and the accuracy of co-location can be effectively improved to avoid serious declines in-and divergence of-estimation accuracy.

AB The inbound process is of great importance in enhancing the efficiency of automated warehouse operations. This study investigates an optimization problem on the inbound warehouse process by coordinating multiple resources in a type of automated warehouse system, i.e., Shuttle-Based Storage and Retrieval System (SBS/RS). A mixed-integer programming model is formulated to determine the assignment decisions of the pallets towards three types of the resources in the SBS/RS (i.e., forklifts, lifts and shuttles), the sequencing & timing decisions of these three types of resources for transporting the pallets. Then, a novel solution method, called Adaptive Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (AQPSO) algorithm, is designed to solve the proposed model. The introduction of the quantum mechanism prevents the algorithm from falling into a local minimum. The integration of the adaptive adjustment strategy improves the efficiency of the algorithm by dynamically adjusting the search scale. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparative experiments that use the CPLEX solver and the basic particle swarm optimization algorithm as rivals. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm have an advantage in the solution quality and the computing time. A series of sensitivity analyses are also conducted to bring out some managerial insights. For example, it is beneficial to reduce energy consumption by adjusting the relative velocity and power of the three types of equipment, and setting the best ratios of shuttles to forklifts.

TI Optimal Path Planning using Informed Probabilistic Road Map Algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB This study aims to propose a new path planning algorithm that can guarantee the optimal path solution. The method used is to hybridize the Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) algorithm with the Information Search Algorithm. This hybridization algorithm is called the Informed-PRM algorithm. There are two informed search methods used. The first method is the informed sampling through an ellipsoid subset whose eccentricity is dependent on the length of the shortest current solution that is successfully planned in that iteration. The second method is to use a local search algorithm. The basic PRM algorithm will be run in the first iteration. Since the second iteration, the generation of sample points in the PRM algorithm will be carried out based on information. The informed sampling method will be used to generate 50% of the sampling points. Meanwhile, the remaining number of sample points will be generated using a local search algorithm. Using several benchmark cases, we compared the performance of the Informed- PRM algorithm with the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree* (RRT*) and informed RRT* algorithm. The test results show that the Informed-PRM algorithm successfully constructs the nearly optimal path for all given cases. In producing the path, the time and path cost of the Informed-PRM algorithm is better than the RRT* and Informed RRT* algorithm. The Friedman test was then performed to check for the significant difference in performance between Informed-PRM with RRT* and Informed RRT*. Thus, the Informed-PRM algorithm can be implemented in various systems that require an optimal path planning algorithm, such as in the case of medical robotic surgery or autonomous vehicle systems.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Pedestrian detection and tracking is necessary for autonomous vehicles and traffic management. This paper presents a novel solution to pedestrian detection and tracking for urban scenarios based on Doppler LiDAR that records both the position and velocity of the targets. The workflow consists of two stages. In the detection stage, the input point cloud is first segmented to form clusters, frame by frame. A subsequent multiple pedestrian separation process is introduced to further segment pedestrians close to each other. While a simple speed classifier is capable of extracting most of the moving pedestrians, a supervised machine learning-based classifier is adopted to detect pedestrians with insignificant radial velocity. In the tracking stage, the pedestrian's state is estimated by a Kalman filter, which uses the speed information to estimate the pedestrian's dynamics. Based on the similarity between the predicted and detected states of pedestrians, a greedy algorithm is adopted to associate the trajectories with the detection results. The presented detection and tracking methods are tested on two data sets collected in San Francisco, California by a mobile Doppler LiDAR system. The results of the pedestrian detection demonstrate that the proposed two-step classifier can improve the detection performance, particularly for detecting pedestrians far from the sensor. For both data sets, the use of Doppler speed information improves the F1-score and the recall by 15% to 20%. The subsequent tracking from the Kalman filter can achieve 83.9-55.3% for the multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), where the contribution of the speed measurements is secondary and insignificant.

AB This work is about mission planning in teams of mobile autonomous agents. We consider tasks that are spatially distributed, non-atomic, and provide an utility for integral and also partial task completion. Agents are heterogeneous, therefore showing different efficiency when dealing with the tasks. The goal is to define a system-level plan that assigns tasks to agents to maximize mission performance. We define the mission planning problem through a model including multiple sub-problems that are addressed jointly: task selection and allocation, task scheduling, task routing, control of agent proximity over time. The problem is proven to be NP-hard and is formalized as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Two solution approaches are proposed: one heuristic and one exact method. Both combine a generic MILP solver and a genetic algorithm, resulting in efficient anytime algorithms. To support performance scalability and to allow the effective use of the model when online continual replanning is required, a decentralized and fully distributed architecture is defined top-down from the MILP model. Decentralization drastically reduces computational requirements and shows good scalability at the expenses of only moderate losses in performance. Lastly, we illustrate the application of the mission planning framework in two demonstrators. These implementations show how the framework can be successfully integrated with different platforms, including mobile robots (ground and aerial), wearable computers, and smart-phone devices.

AB The navigation function (NF) is widely used for motion planning of autonomous vehicles. Such a function is bounded, analytic, and guarantees convergence due to its Morse nature, while having a single minimum value at the target point. This results in a safe path to the target. Originally, the NF was developed for deterministic scenarios where the positions of the robot and the obstacles are known. Here we extend the concept of NF for static stochastic scenarios. We assume the robot, the obstacles and the workspace geometries are known, while their positions are random variables. We define a new Probability NF that we call PNF by introducing an additional permitted collision probability, which limits the risks (to a set value) during the robot's motion. The Minkowski sum is generalized for the geometries of the robot and the obstacles with their respective Probability Density Functions (PDF), that represent their locations' uncertainties. The probability for a collision is therefore the convolution of the robot's geometry, the obstacles' geometries and the PDFs of their locations The novelty of the proposed algorithm is in its ability to provide a converging trajectory in stochastic environment without inflating the ambient space dimension. We demonstrate our algorithm performances using a simulator, and compare its results with the conventional NF algorithm and with a version of the well known RRT* and Voronoi Uncertainty Fields methods for uncertain scenarios. Finally, we show simulation results of the PNF in disc-shaped world, as well as in star-shaped world.

AB Motion along curved paths (curvilinear self-motion) introduces a rotation component to the radial expanding patterns of visual motion generated in the eyes of moving animals with forward-facing eyes. The resultant image motion (vector flow field) is no longer purely radial, and it is difficult to infer the heading direction from such combined translation-plus-rotation flow fields. The eye need not rotate relative to the head or body during curvilinear self-motion, and so there is an absence of efference signals directing and indicating the rotation. Yet the eye's rotation relative to the world needs to be measured accurately and its effect removed from the combined translation-rotation image motion in order for successful navigation to occur. I demonstrate that to be able to account for human heading-estimation performance, the precision of the eye-in-world rotation velocity signal needs to be at least 0.2 degrees/s. I show that an accurate estimate of the eye's curvilinear motion path through the world can be achieved by combining relatively imprecise vestibular estimates of the rotation rate and direction with visual image-motion velocities distributed across the retina. Combined visual-vestibular signals produce greater accuracy than each on its own. The model can account for a wide range of existing human heading-and curvilinear-estimation psychophysical data.

ID HOUGH TRANSFORM
AB In this study, image processing-based real-time lane detection, which is one of the significant problems in autonomous vehicle control, is explored. A mobile robot platform is developed for that purpose. The motion of the mobile robot is provided by 4 direct current motors, which are independently controlled. An image processing code is developed in a Visual DSP 5.0 environment and run on a BF-561 processor embedded in the ADSP BF-561 EZ-KIT LITE evaluation board (Analog Devices). In the image processing algorithm, Hough lines obtained from the Hough transform of the captured images are called candidate lane marks. Various elimination methods are implemented on these candidate lane marks to detect the actual lane marks. Once the actual lane marks are determined, the real-world coordinates of these lane marks are computed using inverse perspective mapping. The heading angle of the mobile robot is then determined based on the position of the lane marks and the center of the mobile robot. The developed mobile robot platform and the lane detection algorithm are tested under various conditions, including dashed lane marks, varying lightening conditions, and the presence of one lane mark only. It is observed that the algorithm performs successfully and detects the lane marks even in the presence of various disturbance effects under these conditions. After the optimization of the developed image processing code, the number of frames processed by the algorithm increases from 3/s to 30/s, which should be satisfactory for real-time applications.

AB The removal of drivers' active engagement in driving tasks can lead to erratic gaze patterns in SAE Level 2 (L2) and Level 3 (L3) automation, which has been linked to their subsequential degraded take-over performance. To further address how changes in gaze patterns evolve during the take-over phase, and whether they are influenced by the take-over urgency and the location of the human-machine interface, this driving simulator study used a head-up display (HUD) to relay information about the automation status and conducted take-over driving experiments where the ego car was about to exit the highway with variations in the automation level (L2, L3) and time budget (2 s, 6 s). In L2 automation, drivers were required to monitor the environment, while in L3, they were engaged with a visual non-driving related task. Manual driving was also embodied in the experiments as the baseline. Results showed that, compared to manual driving, drivers in L2 automation focused more on the HUD and Far Road (roadway beyond 2 s time headway ahead), and less on the Near Road (roadway within 2 s time headway ahead); while in L3, drivers' attention was predominantly allocated on the non-driving related task. After receiving take-over requests (TORs), there was a gradual diversion of attention from the Far Road to the Near Road in L2 take-overs. This trend changed nearly in proportion to the time within the time budget and it exaggerated given a shorter time budget of 2 s. While in L3, drivers' gaze distribution was similar in the early stage of take-overs for both time budget conditions (2 s vs. 6 s), where they prioritized their early glances to Near Road with a gradual increase in attention towards Far Road. The HUD used in the present study showed the potential to maintain drivers' attention around the road center during automation and to encourage drivers to glance the road earlier after TORs by reducing glances to the instrument cluster, which might be of significance to take-over safety. These findings were discussed based on an extended conceptual gaze control model, which advances our understanding of gaze patterns around control transitions and their underlying gaze control causations. Implications can be contributed to the design of autonomous vehicles to facilitate the transition of control by guiding drivers' attention appropriately according to drivers' attentional state and the take-over urgency.

AB Hydrographic surveys, in accordance with the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S-44 standard, can be carried out in the following five orders: Exclusive, Special, 1a, 1b and 2, for which minimum accuracy requirements for the applied positioning system have been set out. They are as follows, respectively: 1, 2, 5, 5 and 20 m, with a confidence level of 95% in two-dimensional space. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network solutions (accuracy: 2-3 cm (p = 0.95)) and the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) (accuracy: 1-2 m (p = 0.95)) are now commonly used positioning methods in hydrography. Due to the fact that a new order of hydrographic surveys has appeared in the IHO S-44 standard from 2020-Exclusive, looking at the current positioning accuracy of the DGPS system, it is not known whether it can be used in it. The aim of this article is to determine the usefulness of GNSS/Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) for hydrographic surveys. During the research, the following two INSs were used: Ekinox2-U and Ellipse-D by the SBG Systems, which were supported by DGPS and Real Time Kinematic (RTK) receivers. GNSS/INS measurements were carried out during the manoeuvring of the Autonomous/Unmanned Surface Vehicle (ASV/USV) named "HydroDron " on Klodno lake in Zawory. The acquired data were processed using the mathematical model that allows us to assess whether any positioning system at a given point in time meets (or not) the accuracy requirements for each IHO order. The model was verified taking into account the historical and current test results of the DGPS and RTK systems. Tests have confirmed that the RTK system meets the requirements of all the IHO orders, even in situations where it is not functioning 100% properly. Moreover, it was proven that the DGPS system does not only meet the requirements provided for the most stringent IHO order, i.e., the Exclusive Order (horizontal position error <= 1 m (p = 0.95)). Statistical analyses showed that it was only a few centimetres away from meeting this criterion. Therefore, it can be expected that soon it will be used in all the IHO orders.

AB We highlight three emerging NASA optical technologies that enhance our ability to remotely sense, analyze, and explore ocean worlds-FluidCam and fluid lensing, MiDAR, and NeMO-Net. Fluid lensing is the first remote sensing technology capable of imaging through ocean waves without distortions in 3D at sub-cm resolutions. Fluid lensing and the purpose-built FluidCam CubeSat instruments have been used to provide refraction-corrected 3D multispectral imagery of shallow marine systems from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Results from repeat 2013 and 2016 airborne fluid lensing campaigns over coral reefs in American Samoa present a promising new tool for monitoring fine-scale ecological dynamics in shallow aquatic systems tens of square kilometers in area. MiDAR is a recently-patented active multispectral remote sensing and optical communications instrument which evolved from FluidCam. MiDAR is being tested on UAVs and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to remotely sense living and non-living structures in light-limited and analog planetary science environments. MiDAR illuminates targets with high-intensity narrowband structured optical radiation to measure an object's spectral reflectance while simultaneously transmitting data. MiDAR is capable of remotely sensing reflectance at fine spatial and temporal scales, with a signal-to-noise ratio 10-10(3) times higher than passive airborne and spaceborne remote sensing systems, enabling high-frame rate multispectral sensing across the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectrum. Preliminary results from a 2018 mission to Guam show encouraging applications of MiDAR to imaging coral from airborne and underwater platforms whilst transmitting data across the air-water interface. Finally, we share NeMO-Net, the Neural Multi-Modal Observation & Training Network for Global Coral Reef Assessment. NeMO-Net is a machine learning technology under development that exploits high-resolution data from FluidCam and MiDAR for augmentation of low-resolution airborne and satellite remote sensing. NeMO-Net is intended to harmonize the growing diversity of 2D and 3D remote sensing with in situ data into a single open-source platform for assessing shallow marine ecosystems globally using active learning for citizen-science based training. Preliminary results from four-class coral classification have an accuracy of 94.4%. Together, these maturing technologies present promising scalable, practical, and cost-efficient innovations that address current observational and technological challenges in optical sensing of marine systems.

TI Pedestrian Headform Testing: Inferring Performance at Impact Speeds and
   for Headform Masses Not Tested, and Estimating Average Performance in a
   Range of Real-World Conditions
SO TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
DE Pedestrian; Vehicle design; Euro NCAP; Crashworthiness; Impact responses
AB Objective: Tests are routinely conducted where instrumented headforms are projected at the fronts of cars to assess pedestrian safety. Better information would be obtained by accounting for performance over the range of expected impact conditions in the field. Moreover, methods will be required to integrate the assessment of secondary safety performance with primary safety systems that reduce the speeds of impacts. Thus, we discuss how to estimate performance over a range of impact conditions from performance in one test and how this information can be combined with information on the probability of different impact speeds to provide a balanced assessment of pedestrian safety.
   Method: Theoretical consideration is given to 2 distinct aspects to impact safety performance: the test impact severity (measured by the head injury criterion, HIC) at a speed at which a structure does not bottom out and the speed at which bottoming out occurs. Further considerations are given to an injury risk function, the distribution of impact speeds likely in the field, and the effect of primary safety systems on impact speeds. These are used to calculate curves that estimate injuriousness for combinations of test HIC, bottoming out speed, and alternative distributions of impact speeds.
   Results: The injuriousness of a structure that may be struck by the head of a pedestrian depends not only on the result of the impact test but also the bottoming out speed and the distribution of impact speeds. Example calculations indicate that the relationship between the test HIC and injuriousness extends over a larger range than is presently used by the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP), that bottoming out at speeds only slightly higher than the test speed can significantly increase the injuriousness of an impact location and that effective primary safety systems that reduce impact speeds significantly modify the relationship between the test HIC and injuriousness.
   Conclusions: Present testing regimes do not take fully into account the relationship between impact severity and variations in impact conditions. Instead, they assess injury risk at a single impact speed. Hence, they may fail to differentiate risks due to the effects of bottoming out under different impact conditions. Because the level of injuriousness changes across a wide range of HIC values, even slight improvements to very stiff structures need to be encouraged through testing. Indications are that the potential of autonomous braking systems is substantial and needs to be weighted highly in vehicle safety assessments.

TI FAPDRP: a flooding attacks prevention and detection routing protocol in
   vehicular ad hoc network using behavior history and nonlinear median
   filter transformation

DT Article; Early Access

AB Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is one of the challenging research areas in recent times with applications to intelligent traffic systems. In VANET, the link between vehicles going in opposite directions only lasts for a very short time when they are within range of each other, otherwise lost, hindering the complete exchange of meaningful information. Most valuable applications on VANET are related to safety-related applications that require real-time response. If the safety and the real-time requirements are not met, serious consequences may result in the form of traffic accidents or failed rescue operations. Flooding attacks on route request packet (RREQ) disrupt the communication between parties, reduce the successful packet delivery rate, and introduce excessive packet transmission delays. This type of attacks, when executed over VANET, may result in disastrous consequences for critical applications such as collision warning or autonomous vehicle assistance. Many security solutions have been proposed; however, they all have several limitations: either they fail to recognise malicious nodes when they attack with low frequency rates, or they suffer performance degradation because of the burden of add-on security measures by the solutions even when malicious nodes are not present in the environment. This paper proposes a Median Filter based flooding attacks detection algorithm (MFFDA) that enables efficient and reliable operation on VANET. The MFFDA solution is novel in three aspects: (1) it uses a route discovery frequency vector (V) to capture a node's behavioral history; (2) it uses a nonlinear mapping to transform the representational space V into a new space V-MF through the use of a Median Filter; (3) it utilises a robust statistic-the median value (mv)-of the data sample V and a suitable separating hyperplane to detect malicious nodes. The paper also proposes the Flooding Attacks Prevention and Detection Routing Protocol (FAPDRP), that incorporates the proposed MFFDA for routing protection. Using NS2, the paper simulated the FAPDRP and related protocols in both attacked and normal network scenarios. The results show that the proposed solution has an accuracy over 98.5% under the minimal flooding attacks 10 pkt/s, outperforms those of previous studies. In addition, the performance of FAPDRP approaches that of the AODV in both attacked and normal network scenarios. This confirms that the proposed MFFDA satisfies the delay, efficiency, and reliability constraints for VANET environment.

AB Major technological and infrastructural changes over the next decades, such as the introduction of autonomous vehicles, implementation of mileage-based fees, carsharing and ridesharing are expected to have a profound impact on lifestyles and travel behavior. Current travel demand models are unable to predict long-range trends in travel behavior as they do not entail a mechanism that projects membership and market share of new modes of transport (Uber, Lyft, etc.). We propose integrating discrete choice and technology adoption models to address the aforementioned issue. In order to do so, we build on the formulation of discrete mixture models and specifically Latent Class Choice Models (LCCMs), which were integrated with a network effect model. The network effect model quantifies the impact of the spatial/network effect of the new technology on the utility of adoption. We adopted a confirmatory approach to estimating our dynamic LCCM based on findings from the technology diffusion literature that focus on defining two distinct types of adopters: innovator/early adopters and imitators. LCCMs allow for heterogeneity in the utility of adoption for the various market segments i.e. innovators/early adopters, imitators and non-adopters. We make use of revealed preference (RP) time series data from a one-way carsharing system in a major city in the United States to estimate model parameters. The data entails a complete set of member enrollment for the carsharing service for a time period of 2.5 years after being launched. Consistent with the technology diffusion literature, our model identifies three latent classes whose utility of adoption have a well-defined set of preferences that are significant and behaviorally consistent. The technology adoption model predicts the probability that a certain individual will adopt the service at a certain time period, and is explained by social influences, network effect, sociodemographics and level-of-service attributes. Finally, the model was calibrated and then used to forecast adoption of the carsharing system for potential investment strategy scenarios. A couple of takeaways from the adoption forecasts were: (1) placing a new station/pod for the carsharing system outside a major technology firm induces the highest expected increase in the monthly number of adopters; and (2) no significant difference in the expected number of monthly adopters for the downtown region will exist between having a station or on-street parking.

TI An Unpaired Thermal Infrared Image Translation Method Using GMA-CycleGAN

AB Automatically translating chromaticity-free thermal infrared (TIR) images into realistic color visible (CV) images is of great significance for autonomous vehicles, emergency rescue, robot navigation, nighttime video surveillance, and many other fields. Most recent designs use end-to-end neural networks to translate TIR directly to CV; however, compared to these networks, TIR has low contrast and an unclear texture for CV translation. Thus, directly translating the TIR temperature value of only one channel to the RGB color value of three channels without adding additional constraints or semantic information does not handle the one-to-three mapping problem between different domains in a good way, causing the translated CV images not only to have blurred edges but also color confusion. As for the methodology of the work, considering that in the translation from TIR to CV the most important process is to map information from the temperature domain into the color domain, an improved CycleGAN (GMA-CycleGAN) is proposed in this work in order to translate TIR images to grayscale visible (GV) images. Although the two domains have different properties, the numerical mapping is one-to-one, which reduces the color confusion caused by one-to-three mapping when translating TIR to CV. Then, a GV-CV translation network is applied to obtain CV images. Since the process of decomposing GV images into CV images is carried out in the same domain, edge blurring can be avoided. To enhance the boundary gradient between the object (pedestrian and vehicle) and the background, a mask attention module based on the TIR temperature mask and the CV semantic mask is designed without increasing the network parameters, and it is added to the feature encoding and decoding convolution layers of the CycleGAN generator. Moreover, a perceptual loss term is applied to the original CycleGAN loss function to bring the translated images closer to the real images regarding the space feature. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the FLIR dataset is used for experiments, and the obtained results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art model, the subjective quality of the translated CV images obtained by the proposed method is better, as the objective evaluation metric FID (Frechet inception distance) is reduced by 2.42 and the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) is improved by 1.43.

AB Objective: The amount of collected field data from naturalistic driving studies is quickly increasing. The data are used for, among others, developing automated driving technologies (such as crash avoidance systems), studying driver interaction with such technologies, and gaining insights into the variety of scenarios in real-world traffic. Because data collection is time consuming and requires high investments and resources, questions like "Do we have enough data?," "How much more information can we gain when obtaining more data?," and "How far are we from obtaining completeness?" are highly relevant. In fact, deducing safety claims based on collected data-for example, through testing scenarios based on collected data-requires knowledge about the degree of completeness of the data used. We propose a method for quantifying the completeness of the so-called activities in a data set. This enables us to partly answer the aforementioned questions. Method: In this article, the (traffic) data are interpreted as a sequence of different so-called scenarios that can be grouped into a finite set of scenario classes. The building blocks of scenarios are the activities. For every activity, there exists a parameterization that encodes all information in the data of each recorded activity. For each type of activity, we estimate a probability density function (pdf) of the associated parameters. Our proposed method quantifies the degree of completeness of a data set using the estimated pdfs. Results: To illustrate the proposed method, 2 different case studies are presented. First, a case study with an artificial data set, of which the underlying pdfs are known, is carried out to illustrate that the proposed method correctly quantifies the completeness of the activities. Next, a case study with real-world data is performed to quantify the degree of completeness of the acquired data for which the true pdfs are unknown. Conclusion: The presented case studies illustrate that the proposed method is able to quantify the degree of completeness of a small set of field data and can be used to deduce whether sufficient data have been collected for the purpose of the field study. Future work will focus on applying the proposed method to larger data sets. The proposed method will be used to evaluate the level of completeness of the data collection on Singaporean roads, aimed at defining relevant test cases for the autonomous vehicle road approval procedure that is being developed in Singapore.

AB Farming today is more complex than it has ever been. Operators are increasingly reliant on technology to aid and improve harvest performance. New harvest technology is under development that will advise harvest operators on the proper adjustment of machine harvest settings, as well as automatically adjust these machine settings without operator intervention, improving the harvest performance of the machine, and reducing the cognitive load of the operator. In this work a high-fidelity, interactive harvest combine simulator is used to understand how harvest operators currently use existing harvest technology, and to evaluate the performance improvements provided by new prototype machine control algorithms and human control interface designs. The interactive harvest simulator is used to assess an intermediate advising step for machine controls adjustment compared with a path using fully autonomous machine adjustment. Testing novel harvest technologies using the virtual environment of the combine simulator introduces a specific set of constraints and challenges that are not found in most other vehicle simulation applications, including the need for accurate physical and visual crop flow representations and a requirement for realistic machine responses to a wide variety of operator input commands. Using a high-fidelity combine simulator for testing allows unique harvest scenarios to be repeated by experienced operators in a controlled virtual environment.
   This study evaluates operator acceptance, performance, and feedback for two novel pieces of harvest technology, Advisor and Director. Advisor is an operator-in-the-loop system providing feedback on proper machine control adjustments during normal harvest operations. Director is designed to continuously monitor the overall harvest health and autonomously adjust the combine harvest settings. In this study, operators harvested the same virtual field twice, first using Advisor, and a second time using Director. Operators overwhelmingly perceived both the Advisor and Director systems as optimizing the harvest performance of the combine and recommended both Advisor and Director. The results presented in this work show that both systems improved the perceived harvest performance, although the Advisor was not as highly rated. Participants recommended the automated nature of Director, and both operator feedback and physiological measures indicates that this harvest technology reduced the cognitive load of the operator. This work demonstrates two main points. First, the interactive combine simulator can be used for evaluating novel harvest technology in the lab. Second, that operators can quickly acclimate to automation within the combine and were able to harvest in a more productive manner when using higher levels of automation.

AB Industrial IoT-enabled critical infrastructures are susceptible to cyber attacks due to their mission-critical deployment. To ensure security by design, radio frequency (RF)-based security is considered an effective way for wirelessly monitored or actuated critical infrastructures. For this purpose, this paper presents a novel augmentation-driven deep learning approach to analyze unique transmitter fingerprints and determine the legitimacy of a user device or transmitter. An RF fingerprinting model is susceptible to various channel and environmental conditions that impact the learning performance of a machine/deep learning model. As data gathering cannot always be considered a feasible alternative, efficient solutions that can tackle the impact of varying propagation channels on learning performance are emergent. This work aims to shed light on the RF fingerprinting problem from a different angle when 4G, 5G, and WiFi data samples are collected from different transmitters by proposing a fine-grained augmentation approach to improve the learning performance of a deep learning model. This work also proposes an enhanced classifier structure following the fine-grained augmentation approach. Results of experiments, conducted on the POWDER dataset, demonstrate promising RF fingerprinting performance when training data are augmented in a waveform-specific fine-grained manner. Thus, the RF identification accuracy can be boosted to 97.84% on unseen RF data instances from our previously published work where we had achieved an accuracy of 87.94% using tapped delay line (TDL)/clustered delay line (CDL)-based augmentation approach. The paper also presents a sensitivity analysis of the fine-grained approach concerning different signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) levels (20 dB and 30 dB), and signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) levels (15 dB, 25 dB). The sensitivity analysis exhibits that it achieves 85.78% accuracy at 20 dB SIR on both Day 1 (train) and Day 2 (test) data. In addition, it achieves 92.37% accuracy even at 20 dB SNR on Day 2 data from POWDER dataset. Furthermore, it achieves 84.95% accuracy at 15 dB SINR on Day 2 data. Hence, these results exhibit the resiliency of the fine-grained augmentation approach against interference and noise.

ID STATISTICS
AB Subwavelength motion estimation is vital for the production of focused synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imagery. The required precision is obtainable from the sonar data itself through a process termed micronavigation. Along-track micronavigation is achieved by a similar technique to that used in correlation velocity logs (CVLs), where sparse estimates of the spatial coherence function are interpolated to estimate the location of the peak coherence and hence estimate the interping vehicle motion. However, along-track micronavigation estimates made using this technique are biased, which limits the utility of these measurements for long-term navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Three sources of along-track motion estimation bias are considered in this article. First, imperfect temporal registration between the signals results in coherence estimates that are negatively biased as a function of the temporal offset. Second, the sparse estimates of the spatial coherence function are obtained by cross-correlation of complex baseband signals, a process which is known to result in positively biased coherence estimates, especially when the true coherence is low. Finally, mismatches between the underlying spatial coherence function and the interpolation kernel used to estimate the peak coherence location also result in along-track micronavigation bias. In this article, we describe and evaluate three methods for reducing along-track micronavigation bias. We introduce a temporal registration of the signals before coherence estimation, which reduces the impact of negative coherence bias due to temporal offsets. The remaining coherence estimation bias is reduced by combining multiple coherence estimates in a Bayesian coherence estimator. Additionally, an improved interpolation kernel is derived with a significantly improved fit compared to the current gold standard Gaussian interpolation kernel. The improvements in along-track micronavigation accuracy are demonstrated using two simulated data sets, which both allow comparison with ground truth. The first involves direct simulation of the spatial coherence from a given interping geometry using the pulse-echo formulation of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem, while the second involves simulation of raw sonar echo data using a point-scatterer model. Using these simulations, a reduction in along-track micronavigation bias of 48.5%-99.5% is demonstrated, with reductions in along-track micronavigation error standard deviation of up to 34%. This improvement expands the potential for SAS-equipped AUVs to reduce their long-term navigation drift, facilitating longer underwater transits, improved target localization, and reduced track misalignment in repeat-pass operations.

AB Anthropogenic activities and greater demands for marine natural resources has led to increases in the spatial extent and duration of pressures onmarine ecosystems. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) offer a robust survey tool for quantifying these pressures and tracking the success of management intervention while at a range of depths, including those inaccessible to most SCUBA diver-based survey methods (similar to>30 m). As the strengths, limitations, and biases of ROVs for visually monitoring fish assemblages remain unclear, this review aims to evaluate ROVs as a survey technique and to suggest optimal sampling strategies for use in typical ROV-based studies. Using the search engines Scopus (TM) and Google Scholar (TM), 119 publications were identified that used ROVs for visual surveys of fish assemblages. While the sampling strategies and sampling metrics used to annotate the imagery in these publications varied considerably, the total abundance of fish recorded over strip transects of varying dimensions was the most common sampling design. The choice of ROV system appears to be a strong indicator of both the types of surveys available to studies and the success of ROV deployments. For instance, larger, more powerful working-class systems can complete longer and more complex designs (e.g., swath, cloverleaf, and polygonal transects) at greater depths, whereas observation-class systems are less expensive and easier to deploy, but are more susceptible to delays or cancelations of deployments. In more severe sea state conditions, radial transects, or strip transects that employ live-boating or a weight to anchor the tether to the seafloor, can be used to improve the performance of observation-class systems. As these systems often employ shorter tethers, radial transects can also be used to maximize sampling area at greater depths and on large vessels that may rotate substantially while anchored. For highly mobile species, and in survey designs where individuals are likely to be recounted (e.g., transects along oil and gas pipelines), relative abundance (MaxN) may be a more robust sampling metric. By identifying subtle, yet important, differences in the application of ROVs as a tool for visually surveying deep-water marine ecosystems, we identified key areas for improvement for best practice for future studies.

ID DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; EFFICIENT
AB This paper proposes the use of a real-time progressive image compression and region of interest algorithm for the ARM processor architecture. This algorithm is used for the design of an underwater image sensor for an autonomous underwater vehicle for intervention, under a highly constrained available bandwidth scenario, allowing for a more agile data exchange between the vehicle and a human operator supervising the underwater intervention. For high compression ratios (smaller output size), execution time is dominated by the transformation algorithm, which plays a progressively smaller role as the compression ratio gets smaller (larger output size). A novel progressive rate distortion-optimized image compression algorithm based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is presented, with special emphasis on a novel minimal time parallel DWT algorithm, which allows full memory bandwidth saturation using only a few cores of a modern multicore embedded processor. The paper focuses in a novel efficient inplace, multithreaded, and cache-friendly parallel 2-D wavelet transform algorithm, based on the lifting transform using the ARM Architecture. In order to maximize the cache utilization and consequently minimize the memory bus bandwidth use, the threads compete to work on a small memory area, maximizing the chances of finding the data in the cache. Their synchronization is done with very low overhead, without the use of any locks and relying solely on the basic compare-and-swap atomic primitive. An implementation in C programming language with and without the use of vector instructions (single instruction multiple data) is provided for both, single (serial) and multi-(parallel) threaded single-loop DWT implementations, as well as serial and parallel naive implementations using linear (row order) and strided (column order) memory access patterns for comparison. Results show a significant improvement over the single-threaded optimized implementation and a much greater improvement over both, the single- and multi-threaded naive implementations, reaching minimal running time depending on the memory access pattern, the number of processor cores, and the available memory bus bandwidth, i.e., it becomes memory bound using the minimum number of memory accesses. Due to memory saturation, the inplace 2-D DWT transform can be executed in the same time as a 1-D DWT transform or as an inplace memory block copy.

AB The paper proposes an approach to assessing the allowed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) of unmanned autonomous vehicles based on the predetermined probability of false alarms under various intentional and unintentional influencing factors. The focus of this study is on the relevant issue of the safe use of LiDAR data and measurement systems within the "smart city" infrastructure. The research team analyzed and systematized various external impacts on the LiDAR systems, as well as the state-of-the-art approaches to improving their security and resilience. It has been established that the current works on the analysis of external influences on the LiDARs and methods for their mitigation focus mainly on physical (hardware) approaches (proposing most often other types of modulation and optical signal frequencies), and less often software approaches, through the use of additional anomaly detection techniques and data integrity verification systems, as well as improving the efficiency of data filtering in the cloud point. In addition, the sources analyzed in this paper do not offer methodological support for the design of the LiDAR in the very early stages of their creation, taking into account a priori assessment of the allowed SNR threshold and probability of detecting a reflected pulse and the requirements to minimize the probability of "missing" an object when scanning with no a priori assessments of the detection probability characteristics of the LiDAR. The authors propose a synthetic approach as a mathematical tool for designing a resilient LiDAR system. The approach is based on the physics of infrared radiation, the Bayesian theory, and the Neyman-Pearson criterion. It features the use of a predetermined threshold for false alarms, the probability of interference in the analytics, and the characteristics of the LiDAR's receivers. The result is the analytical solution to the problem of calculating the allowed SNR while stabilizing the level of "false alarms" in terms of background noise caused by a given type of interference. The work presents modelling results for the "false alarm" probability values depending on the selected optimality criterion. The efficiency of the proposed approach has been proven by the simulation results of the received optical power of the LiDAR's signal based on the calculated SNR threshold and noise values.

AB With the advent of autonomous vehicle applications, the importance of LiDAR point cloud 3D object detection cannot be overstated. Recent studies have demonstrated that methods for aggregating features from voxels can accurately and efficiently detect objects in large, complex 3D detection scenes. Nevertheless, most of these methods do not filter background points well and have inferior detection performance for small objects. To ameliorate this issue, this paper proposes an Attention-based and Multiscale Feature Fusion Network (AMFF-Net), which utilizes a Dual-Attention Voxel Feature Extractor (DA-VFE) and a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) Module to improve the precision and efficiency of 3D object detection. The DA-VFE considers pointwise and channelwise attention and integrates them into the Voxel Feature Extractor (VFE) to enhance key point cloud information in voxels and refine more-representative voxel features. The MFF Module consists of self-calibrated convolutions, a residual structure, and a coordinate attention mechanism, which acts as a 2D Backbone to expand the receptive domain and capture more contextual information, thus better capturing small object locations, enhancing the feature-extraction capability of the network and reducing the computational overhead. We performed evaluations of the proposed model on the nuScenes dataset with a large number of driving scenarios. The experimental results showed that the AMFF-Net achieved 62.8% in the mAP, which significantly boosted the performance of small object detection compared to the baseline network and significantly reduced the computational overhead, while the inference speed remained essentially the same. AMFF-Net also achieved advanced performance on the KITTI dataset.

AB Shared mobility services are slowly penetrating European cities. Hence, transport models that are capable of modeling them are fundamental, to support policy-makers for making informed decisions. Many European cities, especially the small- and the medium-sized ones, continue to use the traditional four-step modeling approach. This approach does not have the necessary capacity to model the shared mobility services and there is a need to extend them. Hence, this research proposes an extended framework, which includes modules for synthetic population generation and fleet management. Furthermore, modules are also suggested for the estimation of emissions, car-ownership and induced demand, as such measures are increasingly expected by cities. Multiple equilibrium checks between the aforementioned modules are avoided in the design of this development, to reduce model complexity and convergence issues. The models and the algorithms used for the additional modules in this study can be replaced with alternative equivalent models, provided the inputs and outputs are consistent with the framework. As such, the framework is software agnostic. Based on a case study on the city of Thessaloniki, a proof of concept is provided. The intermediate modeling framework, proposed in this study, provides an opportunity for cities to evaluate and integrate shared mobility systems and form long term planning strategies. Besides, it acts as a bridge between the worlds of simple and complex modeling approaches and pave the way for reducing the reservations of the cities toward complex approaches, while preparing them for a smoother transition in future.

AB Stereo matching depth estimation based on rectified image pairs is of great importance to many computer vision tasks such as vehicle navigation and autonomous driving. Confidence measures are typically used to refine stereo matching results, which provides robustness and efficiency for disparity estimation. However, previous learning-based confidence methods for stereo matching usually use the middle results or composition as a post-processing step to refine the stereo matching results. This cannot be optimized end-to-end and the performance is limited by the quality of the tri-modal output. To handle this issue, in this paper, we pursue an end-to-end hierarchical architecture and propose a differentiable confidence propagation (DCP) model of a cost aggregation network for stereo matching. The DCP model is integrated into an end-to-end neural network hierarchical architecture to guide matching cost volume aggregation. More specifically, to better represent the similarity of left and right feature maps, we extract unary context feature maps with an effective attention mechanism for matching cost construction. Moreover, we aggregate the cost volume with the multiple stacked DCP cost aggregation (DCPCA) networks to generate a more reliable and finer cost volume. This network suppresses multi-level disparity maps. Each output disparity is supervised with different training weights to learn in a coarse-to-fine way. Our method outperforms previous methods on the Sceneflow dataset by achieving the $0.6735px$ EPE error, achieving 1.53% D1-all metric of Non-occluded pixels regions and 0.72% Non-occluded pixels of $5px$ metric on KITTI 2015 and 2012 dataset. Extensive experiments carried out on the KITTI Stereo benchmarks demonstrate that our DCPCA-Net can significantly minimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for stereo matching.

AB It is widely acknowledged that navigation is a significant source of between sites. The Global Positioning System (GPS) has numerous navigational advancements, and hence it is used widely. GPS navigation can be compromised at any level between position, location, and estimation, to the detriment of the user. Consequently, a navigation system requires the precise location and underpinning tracking of an object without signal loss. The objective of a hybrid environment prediction system is to foresee the location of the user and their territory by employing a variety of sensors for position estimation and monitoring navigation. This article presents a state estimation of the relative position for indoor and outdoor activity solved with a state estimation algorithm utilizing Kalman filter. Also, a comparative study of variants of the Kalman filter, where linearizing current mean and covariance with nonlinear state estimation as an approach of Extended Kalman Filter (EFK) is applied to the collected data. The third comparative aspect uses probability distribution for the selected points with a Sigma Point Kalman Filter (SPKF) for evaluating an accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS data in hybrid environments for various activities for different data collection scenarios from users. The findings of the presented model demonstrate the robust performance of all forms of the Kalman filter algorithm for diverse userperformed activities in totally contaminated indoor and outdoor environments. Experimental findings with various patterns and data, conducted by different subjects using multiple modes of navigation, show that the approach can indeed lead to the intelligent development of sensor-based navigation and monitoring. State estimation and prediction is extraordinarily beneficial for mining applications, autonomous vehicle localization/tracking, and locationbased services. This research work demonstrates both EKF-based and SPKFbased sensor fusion to provide an appropriate estimation.

AB As a power source for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), lithium-ion batteries play an important role in ensuring AUVs' electric power propulsion performance. An accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation method is the key to achieving energy optimization for lithium-ion batteries. Due to the complicated ocean environments, traditional filtering methods cannot effectively estimate the SOC of lithium-ion batteries in an AUV. Based on the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF), an adaptive iterative extended Kalman filter (AIEKF) method for the SOC in an AUV is proposed to address the traditional filter's problems, such as low accuracy and large errors. In this method, the adaptive update is introduced to deal with the uncertain noise from the lithium-ion battery. The iteration is used to improve the convergence speed and to reduce the computational burden. Compared with the EKF, iterative extended Kalman filter (IEKF) and adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), the proposed AIEKF has a higher estimation accuracy and anti-interference capability, which is suitable for the AUV's SOC estimation. In addition, based on the second-order equivalent circuit model of the lithium-ion battery, a forgetting factor recursive least squares (FFRLS) method is proposed to deal with the multi-variability problem. In the end, four different methods, including EKF, IEKF, AEKF, and the proposed AIEKF, are compared in computational time. The experiment results show that the proposed method has high accuracy and fast estimation speed, meaning that it has good application potential in AUVs.

AB The auto-follow row technology is the basic technology to realize the uncrewed operation of corn harvesters, which helps to improve the quality and efficiency of corn harvest. A deviation detection sensor and an auto-follow row system are designed to address the difficulty for corn harvesters to harvest the corn sowing with different row spacing. The auto-follow row system is comprised of the auto-follow row controller, two deviation detection sensors, sensors for acquiring the state of the corn harvester, and the hydraulic steering system. The deviation detection sensor uses the touch rod to detect the lateral deviation and sends it to the auto-follow row controller through the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. The auto-follow row controller obtained the lateral deviation, calculated the target steering angle according to the pure pursuit method based on the yaw angle estimation model and fuzzy control model, and adjusted the posture of the harvester by controlling the steering actuator. Two types of corn harvesters were reformed and mounted the auto-follow row system for simulation and field tests. The average errors of the auto-follow row system in the simulation tests and the field tests were 0.040 m and 0.046 m, respectively. The relative deviations within +/- 0.075 m were 98.33% and 97.22%, respectively, which met the operating requirements of corn harvesters. The test results show that the auto-follow row system can be applied to many kinds of corn harvesters and provide a reference for designing a completely unmanned system for corn harvesters.

AB Power line extraction is useful for low aircraft altitude obstacle avoidance, and it also plays an important role in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based power autonomous inspection. However, the current power line detection algorithms have the disadvantages of slow detection speed and poor detection performance because the scale of objects varies greatly in UAV images. We proposed an efficient power line extraction method named power line extraction network (PLENet) to achieve high accuracy (ACC) and speed of power line detection in complex scenes. The proposed method overcomes the imbalance of the positive and negative samples, detects the power lines in images with different scales, and achieves good ACC and speed performance at the same time. For this method, we introduced convolution kernels of various sizes in the input layer and concatenated the extracted features to obtain more robust feature maps. Then, we implemented the class-balanced cross-entropy loss function to overcome the problem of the imbalance between positive and negative samples. Finally, we proposed a bilinear interpolation upsampling module in the output layer to replace the deconvolution to solve the gridding effect. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a series of experiments on our collected aerial imagery dataset with complex scenes. The ACC and intersection over union of the proposed method are up to 86.22% and 71.7% on the server, respectively, whereas 86.61% and 70.58% on the mobile terminals, respectively. The experimental results show that our PLENet has apparent advantages in multiple indicators compared with other networks. The multiscene experiment results also demonstrate that PLENet has strong robustness, overcoming the influence of complex scenes and accurately extracting power lines.

AB Internet of things (IoT) and 5G network are fundamental building blocks for industrial IoT (IIoT). IoT has enabled real-time monitoring and actuation in industrial floors and machinery, aimed at improving the efficiency and safety of industrial activities and processes. On the other hand, 5G networks will provide ultra-reliable and low-latency communication for the wireless integration of autonomous industrial machinery, mobile vehicles, and robots, and management systems, aimed at the real-time control and management of industrial machinery toward smart factories. In IIoT, machine learning (ML) will also play a fundamental role in handling complex tasks at industrial machinery and 5G networks management, configuration, and control. However, ML suffers from the cold-start problem and needs a large amount of highly accurate data samples for model training, which is costly and difficult to obtain in IIoT applications. In this article, we shed light on the design of transfer learning (TL)-based systems for IIoT. We discuss how TL can overcome the demand for high-quality large data samples required to training ML models in IIoT. We also highlight the work principles and daunting challenges faced during the TL systems for IIoT. Furthermore, we categorize the TL systems for IIoT into TL for IIoT machinery level and for IIoT networking level and provide an in-depth discussion of the design building blocks and challenges of TL systems in each proposed class. Finally, we point out some future research directions for the design of novel TL-based systems for envisioned 5G-enabled IIoT applications.

AB In this study, an approach for generating the shortest-distance passage plan for a ship is proposed considering the navigable area obtained based on automatic identification system data. The navigable area is designated based on the information from the electronic navigational chart and by considering the ship traffic density using Jenks natural breaks classification. The shortest-path algorithms used in our experiment are the Dijkstra, A*, and improved A*. Then, the Douglas-Peucker algorithm is applied to generate an optimal result by supplementing the passage plan generated by the best-performing shortest-path algorithm. The experiment was divided into two cases depending on whether or not the passage plan covered the target area of this study, namely, the vessel traffic service system control area of Busan Port between Busan New Port and Ulsan Port. The improved A* performed better than Dijkstra and A* in these two cases. Subsequently, the distance of the final passage plan was 98.649 km in the case of passing through the control area and 105.365 km in the case of bypassing, which were less than the distances in the passage plan of the actual ship by approximately 13.18% and 7.27%, respectively. The experimental results of the proposed approach show the possibility of automatically establishing the shortest-distance passage plan for a ship considering the navigable area. In addition, this study suggests an effective approach for coastal navigation, which is more complex than ocean navigation. Further, this study can serve as a basis for generating passage plans for maritime autonomous surface ships.

TI Can Offline Testing of Deep Neural Networks Replace Their Online
   Testing? A Case Study of Automated Driving Systems
SO EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

AB We distinguish two general modes of testing for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test datasets obtained without involving the DNNs under test, and online testing where DNNs are embedded into a specific application environment and tested in a closed-loop mode in interaction with the application environment. Typically, DNNs are subjected to both types of testing during their development life cycle where offline testing is applied immediately after DNN training and online testing follows after offline testing and once a DNN is deployed within a specific application environment. In this paper, we study the relationship between offline and online testing. Our goal is to determine how offline testing and online testing differ or complement one another and if offline testing results can be used to help reduce the cost of online testing? Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end controls of steering functions of self-driving vehicles. Our results show that offline testing is less effective than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing. Further, we cannot exploit offline testing results to reduce the cost of online testing in practice since we are not able to identify specific situations where offline testing could be as accurate as online testing in identifying safety requirement violations.

AB Based on historical records, driving in hazardous weather conditions is one of the most serious causes that lead to fatal accidents on roads in general and in United Arab Emirates (UAE) highways in particular. One solution for improving road safety is to equip the vehicles and infrastructure with connected and smart devices. Before deploying a concrete solution to the field, it must be validated by simulation, and more specifically agent based simulation. Several key features are expected for the simulation framework, such as the reproduction of different and detailed behaviors for the components of the road infrastructure and for the drivers, simulate specific weather conditions and forecast their impacts on the global system behavior. Additionally, several technological features are related to recent advancements in agent software engineering and simulation. This paper proposes an agent-based model for the modeling and simulation of traffic in foggy weather conditions that covers the above features and technological requirements. The architecture is used and validated on two scenarios of traffic on UAE highways in foggy weather conditions. The first scenario does not include an intelligent transport system, and the second considers smart speed limit panels. From the experiments, the proposed model supports the expected key features, i.e., microscopic simulation of intelligent transport systems, including infrastructure and connected cars, and of different driving behaviors (human or autonomous car). Even if the included weather condition model is basic, a proof of concept is provided regarding the connection of an agent model and a weather condition model.

AB Verification and validation of automated driving functions impose large challenges. Currently, scenario-based approaches are investigated in research and industry, aiming at a reduction of testing efforts by specifying safety relevant scenarios. To define those scenarios and operate in a complex real-world design domain, a structured description of the environment is needed. Within the PEGASUS research project, the 6-Layer Model (6LM) was introduced for the description of highway scenarios. This paper refines the 6LM and extends it to urban traffic and environment. As defined in PEGASUS, the 6LM provides the possibility to categorize the environment and, therefore, functions as a structured basis for subsequent scenario description. The model enables a structured description and categorization of the general environment, without incorporating any knowledge or anticipating any functions of actors. Beyond that, there is a variety of other applications of the 6LM, which are elaborated in this paper. The 6LM includes a description of the road network and traffic guidance objects, roadside structures, temporary modifications of the former, dynamic objects, environmental conditions and digital information. The work at hand specifies each layer by categorizing its items. Guidelines are formulated and explanatory examples are given to standardize the application of the model for an objective environment description. In contrast to previous publications, the model and its design are described in far more detail. Finally, the holistic description of the 6LM presented includes remarks on possible future work when expanding the concept to machine perception aspects.

AB Ever since the invention of Bitcoin by the pseudonymous Satashi Nakamoto, cryptocurrency has provoked debate in banking and finance sectors, and is sometimes considered a potential successor to fiat currency. Blockchain, the new technology underpinning decentralised and immutable databases, has seen much discussion as a potentially game-changing development. Although many industries are exploring its value, the technology has thus far made only minor impacts. A rapidly expanding base of research has emerged on blockchain & x2019;s role as a potential disruptor in the electrical energy industry. However, it may be difficult to distinguish hype from more imminently plausible impacts. This paper attempts to serve as a guide for engineering managers wishing to make sense of blockchain & x2019;s potential in electricity. This is accomplished by formulating a novel blockchain industry disruption framework, which exists across three tiers. These tiers extend from ideas with the least effect on an industry to total revolutionary concepts that could completely transform an industry. This taxonomy is constructed by examining existing research into disruption hierarchies and blockchain classification methods. Through the lens of this taxonomy, a literature review is performed on blockchain & x2019;s role in energy to draw out themes and ideas characterising each tier. The potential likelihood of real-world application of various ideas are discussed, considering how established industries may be affected or disrupted. The authors provide some conjecture here. Finally, courses of action are suggested for those whose sector may be affected by blockchain.

AB In underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), the sensors are deployed at different areas of the ocean, which perform information collection and delay-sensitive routing to the data center for further processing or industrial computing. However, inUASNs, the network states have spatiotemporal characteristics due to tides or autonomous underwater vehicles. To steadily route the traffic especially when the spatiotemporal characteristics of the UASNs are considered, a network architecture with intelligent traffic engineering or routing policies is indispensable. In this paper, we employ software-defined networking (SDN) technology and propose an SDN-enabled distributed architecture for UASNs. Based on the proposed architecture, we propose a scheme DSR-SDN for delay-sensitive spatiotemporal routing in SDN-enabled UASNs. The DSR-SDN includes three phases: First, topology awareness; second, spatiotemporal characteristics estimation; and third, routing computation. Particularly, with SDN features, DSR-SDN provides topology awareness based on a proposed software-defined beaconing scheme. Based on the detected topology, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the network states are estimated based on a proposed SDN-based hierarchical node localizing approach SDN-HL. Lead by the SDN controllers, SDN-HL makes use of the proposed "minimum weighted gap" formulation and Adam algorithm to optimize the localization and builds the indirect links to increase the localization rate. To route the traffic through the network with spatiotemporal characteristics, we adopt the time-expanded network approach, based on which a spatiotemporal routedecisioncanbemadebefore the routing starts. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme, i.e., DSR-SDN, can conduct accurate spatiotemporal characteristic estimation for the network states and provide delay-sensitive spatiotemporal routing for the sensed data.

AB The article discusses the results of experiments conducted in September 2017 to prove the applicability of positioning underwater objects during their operation at depths substantially exceeding the depth of the underwater sound channel axis. The authors present results of experimental studies and numerical analysis of the effect of focusing of the acoustic energy in the near-bottom layer on the shelf and its transition into deep-water (up to 500 m) layers of the Sea of Japan for summer-autumn hydrological conditions. Experiments on reception of broadband pulsed signals with a center frequency of 400 Hz were carried out at various distances (20, 68, 86, 90, and 198 km) from a source of navigation signals moored at a depth of 35 m at the shoreline near Cape Schulz. The receiving of acoustic signals was performed by a system of distributed over depth up to 500 meters hydrophones, with the possibility of long-term signal recording at fixed depths and during submergence. The experimental results allowed to study the impulse responses of acoustic waveguides, and estimate the effective propagation velocities of navigation signals received at different depths, and to draw conclusions about the possibility of solving positioning problems for autonomous underwater vehicles at depths up to 500 m and distances up to 200 km from the source of navigation signals. Mathematical modeling of acoustic wave propagation in a waveguide reproducing the experimental conditions by the normal mode technique was also carried out.

AB Connected autonomous vehicles and industry 4.0 production scenarios require ultrareliable low-latency communication links. The varying positions of transmitter, reflecting objects, and receiver cause a nonstationary time-and frequency-selective fading process. In this paper, we present the necessary hardware architecture and signal processing algorithms for a real-time geometry-based channel emulator, that is needed for testing of wireless control systems. We partition the nonstationary fading process into a sequence of local stationarity regions and model the channel impulse response as sum of propagation paths with time-varying attenuation, delay, and Doppler shift. We implement a subspace projection of the propagation path parameters, to compress the time-variant channel impulse response. This enables a low data-rate link from the host computer, which computes the geometry-based propagation paths, to the software defined radio unit, that implements the convolution on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). With our new architecture, the complexity of the FPGA implementation becomes independent of the number of propagation paths. Our channel emulator can be parametrized by all known channel models. Without loss of generality, we use a parameterization by a geometry-based stochastic channel model, due to its nonstationary nature. We provide channel impulse response measurements of the channel emulator, using the RUSK Lund channel sounder for a vehicular scenario with 617 propagation paths. A comparison of the time-variant power delay profile and Doppler spectral density of simulated and emulated channel impulse response showed a close match with an error smaller than -35 dB. The results demonstrate that our channel emulator is able to accurately emulate nonstationary fading channels with continuously changing path delays and Doppler shifts.

AB Accurately assessing the diversity and abundance of marine zooplankton is greatly confounded by the interactions of biological and physical processes that vary in space and time. This study simultaneously assessed biological and physical sources of zooplankton assemblage variation with multidisciplinary methods. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and shipboard plankton net sampling were used to document a seasonal shift that occurred during a typical fall transition period in northern Monterey Bay, California. Intrusion of low salinity offshore waters into our study region was associated with decreased stratification of the water column. Morphological taxonomy and high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS), involving mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit-I (COI) and large subunit (28S) nuclear ribosomal RNA, were used to document zooplankton communities in 36 vertical plankton tows collected during the fall transition. Increased copepod diversity and delivery of species associated with warmer southern waters corresponded with the intrusion of offshore waters. Echinoderms and barnacles also increased in abundance. Conversely, species of polychaetes and gastropods decreased in diversity and abundance. Onshore-offshore spatial shifts also occurred between August and October sampling periods. Primary insights contributed by newer methods included high resolution documentation of environmental variation (i.e. AUV data) and increased taxonomic resolution for some zooplankton groups (e.g. polychaetes and gastropods; HTS data) compared to the morphological assessment. Together, the AUV environmental data, morphological assessments and HTS zooplankton identifications provided a compelling picture of how water mass variation typical of the fall season can affect zooplankton assemblages in northern Monterey Bay, California.

AB Scientific studies on species composition and abundance distribution of fishes have considerable importance to the fishery industry, biodiversity protection, and marine ecosystem. In these studies, fish images are typically collected with the help of scuba divers or autonomous underwater vehicles. These images are then annotated manually by marine biologists. Such a process is certainly a tremendous waste of manpower and material resources. In recent years, the introduction of deep learning has helped making remarkable progress in this area. However, fish image classification can be considered as finegrained problem, which is more challenging than common image classification, especially with low-quality and small-scale data. Meanwhile, well-known effective convolutional neural networks (CNNs) consistently require a large quantity of high-quality data. This paper presents a new method by improving transfer learning and squeeze-and-excitation networks for fine-grained fish image classification on low-quality and small-scale datasets. Our method enhances data augmentation through super-resolution reconstruction to enlarge the dataset with high-quality images, pre-pretrains, and pretrains to learn common and domain knowledge simultaneously while fine-tuning with professional skill. In addition, refined squeeze-and-excitation blocks are designed to improve bilinear CNNs for a fine-grained classification. Unlike well-known CNNs for image classification, our method can classify images with insufficient low-quality training data. Moreover, we compare the performance of our method with commonly used CNNs on small-scale fine-grained datasets, namely, Croatian and QUT fish datasets. The experimental results show that our method outperforms popular CNNs with higher fish classification accuracy, which indicates its potential applications in combination with other newly updated CNNs.

AB The deployment and recovery of autonomous or remotely piloted platforms from research vessels have become a way of significantly extending the capabilities and reach of the research fleet. This paper describes the use of ship-launched and ship-recovered Boeing-Insitu ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs were instrumented to characterize the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) structure and dynamics, and to measure ocean surface processes during the October 2012 Equatorial Mixing (EquatorMix) experiment in the central Pacific and during the July 2013 Trident Warrior experiment off the Virginia coast. The UAV measurements, including atmospheric momentum and radiative, sensible, and latent heat fluxes, are complemented by measurements from ship-based instrumentation, including a foremast MABL eddy-covariance system, lidar altimeters, and a digitized X-band radar system. During EquatorMix, UAV measurements reveal longitudinal atmospheric roll structures not sampled by ship measurements, which contribute significantly to vertical fluxes of heat and momentum. With the nadir-looking UAV lidar, surface signatures of internal waves are observed, consistent and coherent with measurements from ship-based X-band radar, a Hydrographic Doppler Sonar System, and a theoretical model. In the Trident Warrior experiment, the instrumented UAVs were used to demonstrate real-time data assimilation of meteorological data from UAVs into regional coupled ocean-atmosphere models. The instrumented UAVs have provided unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution in atmospheric and oceanographic measurements in remote ocean locations, demonstrating the capabilities of these platforms to extend the range and capabilities of the research fleet for oceanographic and atmospheric studies.

AB If we aim for autonomous navigation of a mobile robot, it is crucial and essential to have proper state estimation of its position and orientation. We already designed a multi-modal data fusion algorithm that combines visual, laser-based, inertial, and odometric modalities in order to achieve robust solution to a general localization problem in challenging Urban Search and Rescue environment. Since different sensory modalities are prone to different nature of errors, and their reliability varies vastly as the environment changes dynamically, we investigated further means of improving the localization. The common practice related to the EKF-based solutions such as ours is a standard statistical test of the observations-or of its corresponding filter residuals-performed to reject anomalous data that deteriorate the filter performance. In this paper we show how important it is to treat well visual and laser anomalous residuals, especially in multi-modal data fusion systems where the frequency of incoming observations varies significantly across the modalities. In practice, the most complicated part is to correctly identify the actual anomalies, which are to be rejected, and therefore here lies our major contribution. We go beyond the standard statistical tests by exploring different state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and exploiting our rich dataset that we share with the robotics community. We demonstrate the implications of our research both indoor (with precise reference from a Vicon system) as well as in challenging outdoor environment. In the final, we prove that monitoring the health of the observations in Kalman filtering is something, that is often overlooked, however, it definitively should not be.

AB In this paper, we formulate a coupled factorial hidden Markov model-based (CFHMM) framework to diagnose dependent faults occurring over time (dynamic case). In our previous research, the problem of diagnosing multiple faults over time (dynamic multiple fault diagnosis (DMFD)) is solved based on a sequence of test outcomes by assuming that the faults and their time evolution are independent. This problem is NP-hard, and, consequently, we developed a polynomial approximation algorithm using Lagrangian relaxation within a FHMM framework. Here, we extend this formulation to a mixed memory Markov coupling model, termed dynamic coupled fault diagnosis (DCFD) problem, to determine the most likely sequence of (dependent) fault states, the one that best explains the observed test outcomes over time. An iterative Gauss-Seidel coordinate ascent optimization method is proposed for solving the DCFD problem. A soft Viterbi algorithm is also implemented within the framework for decoding-dependent fault states over time. We demonstrate the algorithm on simulated systems with coupled faults and the results show that this approach improves the correct isolation rate (CI) as compared to the formulation where independent fault states (DMFD) are assumed. As a by-product, we show empirically that, while diagnosing for independent faults, the DMFD algorithm based on block coordinate ascent method, although it does not provide a measure of suboptimality, provides better primal cost and higher CI than the Lagrangian relaxation method for independent fault case. Two real-world examples (a hybrid electric vehicle, and a mobile autonomous robot) with coupled faults are also used to evaluate the proposed framework.

AB In this article is presented a dynamical systems framework for analysing multiagent rendezvous problems and characterize the dynamical behaviour of the collective system. Recently, the problem of rendezvous has been addressed considerably in the graph theoretic framework, which is strongly based on the communication aspects of the problem. The proposed approach is based on the set invariance theory and focusses on how to generate feedback between the vehicles, a key part of the rendezvous problem. The rendezvous problem is defined on the positions of the agents and the dynamics is modelled as linear first-order systems. These algorithms have also been applied to non-linear first-order systems.
   The rendezvous problem in the framework of cooperative and competitive dynamical systems is analysed that has had some remarkable applications to biological sciences. Cooperative and competitive dynamical systems are shown to generate monotone flows by the classical Muller-Kamke theorem, which is analysed using the set invariance theory. In this article, equivalence between the rendezvous problem and invariance of an appropriately defined cone is established. The problem of rendezvous is cast as a stabilization problem, with a the set of constraints on the trajectories of the agents defined on the phase plane. The n-agent rendezvous problem is formulated as an ellipsoidal cone invariance problem in the n-dimensional phase space. Theoretical results based on set invariance theory and monotone dynamical systems are developed. The necessary and sufficient conditions for rendezvous of linear systems are presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities. These conditions are also interpreted in the Lyapunov framework using multiple Lyapunov functions. Numerical examples that demonstrate application are also presented.

AB The emergence of new wireless technologies, such as the Internet of Things, allows digitalizing new and diverse urban activities. Thus, wireless traffic grows in volume and complexity, making prediction, investment planning, and regulation increasingly difficult. This article characterizes urban wireless traffic evolution, supporting operators to drive mobile network evolution and policymakers to increase national and local competitiveness. We propose a holistic method that widens previous research scope, including new devices and the effect of policy from multiple government levels. We provide an analytical formulation that combines existing complementary methods on traffic evolution research and diverse data sources. Results for a centric area of Helsinki during 2020-2030 indicate that daily volumes increase, albeit a surprisingly large part of the traffic continues to be generated by smartphones. Machine traffic gains importance, driven by surveillance video cameras and connected cars. While camera traffic is sensitive to law enforcement policies and data regulation, car traffic is less affected by transport electrification policy. High-priority traffic remains small, even under encouraging autonomous vehicle policies. Based on peak hour results, we suggest that 5G small cells might be needed around 2025, albeit the utilization of novel radio technology and additional mid-band spectrum could delay this need until 2029. We argue that mobile network operators inevitably need to cooperate in constructing a single, shared small cell network to mitigate the high deployment costs of massively deploying small cells. We also provide guidance to local and national policymakers for IoT-enabled competitive gains via the mitigation of five bottlenecks. For example, local monopolies for mmWave connectivity should be facilitated on space-limited urban furniture or risk an eventual capacity crunch, slowing down digitalization.

AB Microservices is an architectural style for service-oriented distributed computing, and is being widely adopted in several domains, including autonomous vehicles, sensor networks, IoT systems, energy systems, telecommunications networks and telemedicine systems. When migrating a monolithic system to a microservices architecture, one of the key design problems is the "microservice granularity definition", i.e., deciding how many microservices are needed and allocating computations among them. This article describes a semantic grouping algorithm (SEMGROMI), a technique that takes user stories, a well-known functional requirements specification technique, and identifies number and scope of candidate microservices using semantic similarity of the user stories' textual description, while optimizing for low coupling, high cohesion, and high semantic similarity. Using the technique in four validation projects (two state-of-the-art projects and two industry projects), the proposed technique was compared with domain-driven design (DDD), the most frequent method used to identify microservices, and with a genetic algorithm previously proposed as part of the Microservices Backlog model. We found that SEMGROMI yields decompositions of user stories to microservices with high cohesion (from the semantic point of view) and low coupling, the complexity was reduced, also the communication between microservices and the estimated development time was decreased. Therefore, SEMGROMI is a viable option for the design and evaluation of microservices-based applications. The proposed semantic similarity-based technique (SEMGROMI) is part of the Microservices Backlog model, which allows to evaluate candidate microservices graphically and based on metrics to make design-time decisions about the architecture of the microservicesbased application.

AB Low latency computation is vital to meet real-time constraints in many Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based applications such as autonomous vehicles. To enable low latency and high throughput computation of the inner product in CNNs, due to providing digit-level pipelining and inherent variable precision, Most Significant Digits First (MSDF) arithmetic is a favorable candidate. With the MSDF approach, unlike conventional bit parallel and bit serial arithmetic which necessitates the completion of an operation before continuing with the dependent subsequent operations, successive operations can execute in an overlapping manner via chaining with additional cycles of online delay. In the online inner product unit, accumulation of online delay in a network of online adders bottlenecks latency and consequently throughput of the computation system. This paper introduces a pipeline architecture for the online inner product so that the pipelined online adder (POA) can work simultaneously with a pipelined online multiplier. We show the superiority of the proposed online inner product unit in CNNs, comprehensively analyzing various filter sizes with different precisions. Based on the evaluations, for the addition of sixteen streaming inner products, up to 58.8% reduction in execution cycles is achieved with a POA as compared with a state-of-the-art conventional online adder. When it comes to CNNs, the latency of the 3 x 3 filter equipped with the suggested inner product unit is 57.40% lower than the previous designs, on average. The throughput of this design, on average, is 4.04x of the fastest inner product unit design for a filter size of 3 x 3, with the cost of more hardware usage.

AB Due to the high reliance of daily activities on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), its security is one of the major concerns for research and industry. Most navigation and mobile-driven location-based services use GNSS to render services. Due to the low power and easy access of GNSS signals, these signals are vulnerable to spoofing and other types of attacks. Recently many GNSS spoofing attacks have been identified in road- and maritime-based environments. This study provides a technique to detect and counter the GNSS spoofing attack in the maritime environment. This technique uses the Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) model with Least Square Estimation (LSE) and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Control to detect the spoofing attack. The proposed technique is based on the concept of a genetic algorithm and navigation devices, such as inertial sensors and pilot options for the ship. A case study using the AIS dataset and simulation using MATLAB and NS3 is provided to validate the performance of the proposed approach. Nine different voyages from the AIS dataset were considered to check the accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithm. The accuracy of the proposed technique was analyzed using the correctly identified attack. The result shows that the proposed technique identifies spoofing attacks with an average value of 90 percent. For result analysis the considered nine routes were traversed multiple times. Root mean square error is used to calculate the positional mismatch (error rate). Based on the combined results analysis, the average value of RMSE is 0.28. In a best-case scenario, the proposed approach provides an RMSE value of 0.009.

AB This paper proposes a novel robust saturated actor-critic multi-layer neural network controller for electrically-driven tractors with n-trailer with unmeasurable linear and angular velocities, uncertain complex dynamics and actuator saturation while guaranteeing a prescribed performance with em-ploying the motor dynamics. The proposed controller consists of four control loops. In the first loop, tracking errors are transformed into constraint errors via prescribed performance bounds. Then, a kinematic controller is designed. In the second loop, an output feedback robust dynamic controller is proposed via multi-layer actor-critic neural networks to approximate model uncertainties, a high-gain observer (HGO) to estimate velocities, and an adaptive robust controller to compensate external dynamic disturbances. Afterwards, a robust actuator controller is designed in third loop by employing multi-layer actor-critic neural networks to deeply diminish unknown nonlinear functions effects, and an adaptive robust controller to handle the bounded actuator disturbances. An auxiliary subsystem is considered in the final loop to reduce the danger of actuator saturation by designing an auxiliary intermediate controller. The stability under the proposed controller is studied by the Lyapunov stability synthesis, and it is proven that tracking errors remain uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the validity, reliability, and effectiveness of the proposed reinforcement learning-based controller is shown by means of multiple simulations and some comparisons with a quantitative study.

AB UAV route planning is the key issue for application of UAV in real-world scenarios. Compared with the traditional route planning methods, although the intelligent optimization algorithm has stronger applicability and optimization performance, it also has the problem of poor convergence accuracy and easy to fall into local optimization. Therefore, an intelligent route planning method for UAV based on chaotic random opposition-based learning and cauchy mutation improved Moth-flame optimization algorithm (OLTC-MFO) is proposed. First, the terrain environment is constructed by digital elevation map, and the threat model is established to realize the equivalent three-dimensional (3D) environment. Then, the opposite population is introduced to increase the diversity of solutions and improve the search speed of the algorithm. Then, the Logistic-Tent chaos map is introduced to realize random perturbation of flame position, which improves the global search capability of the algorithm. Finally, the probability operator and Cauchy mutation operator are introduced, which makes the algorithm not only accept the current solution with a certain probability, but also jump out of the current sub-optimal solution, thus enhancing the global search capability of the algorithm. The simulation results show that when the number of iterations is 1000, the length of route planning based on OLTC-MFO algorithm is 45.3716km shorter than MFO algorithm, and the convergence result of this method is stable and more accurate, which achieves the purpose of assisting UAV combat decision-making.

TI Adaptive Pulse Compression for Sidelobes Reduction in Stretch Processing

AB Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radars provide various advantages as compared to conventional radars. Among these advantages, improved angular diversity feature is being explored for future fully autonomous vehicles. Improved angular diversity requires use of orthogonal waveforms at transmit as well as receive sides. This orthogonality between waveforms is critical as the cross-correlation between signals can inhibit the detection of weaker targets due to sidelobes of stronger targets. This paper investigates the Reiterative Minimum Mean Squared Error (RMMSE) mismatch filter design for range sidelobes reduction for a Slow-Time Phase-Coded (ST-PC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) MIMO radar. Initially, the performance degradation of RMMSE filter is analyzed for improperly decoded received pulses. It is then shown mathematically that proper decoding of received pulses requires phase compensation related to any phase distortions caused due to doppler and spatial locations of targets. To cater for these phase distortions, it is proposed to re-adjust the traditional order of operations in radar signal processing to doppler, angle and range. Additionally, it is also proposed to incorporate sidelobes decoherence for further suppression of sidelobes. This is achieved by modification of the structured covariance matrix of baseline single-input RMMSE mismatch filter. The modified structured covariance matrix is proposed to include the range estimates corresponding to each transmitter. These proposed modifications provide additional sidelobes suppression while it also provides additional fidelity for target peaks. The proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations as well as field experiments. Superior performance in terms of range sidelobes suppression is observed when compared with baseline RMMSE and traditional Hanning windowed range response.

AB Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can execute aggressive (i.e., high-speed and high-acceleration) maneuvers have attracted significant attention in the past few years. This article focuses on accurate tracking of aggressive quadcopter trajectories. We propose a novel control law for tracking of position and yaw angle and their derivatives of up to fourth order, specifically velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap along with yaw rate and yaw acceleration. Jerk and snap are tracked using feedforward inputs for angular rate and angular acceleration based on the differential flatness of the quadcopter dynamics. Snap tracking requires direct control of body torque, which we achieve using closed-loop motor speed control based on measurements from optical encoders attached to the motors. The controller utilizes incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) for robust tracking of linear and angular accelerations despite external disturbances, such as aerodynamic drag forces. Hence, prior modeling of aerodynamic effects is not required. We rigorously analyze the proposed control law through response analysis and demonstrate it in experiments. The controller enables a quadcopter UAV to track complex 3-D trajectories, reaching speeds up to 12.9 m/s and accelerations up to 2.1 g, while keeping the root-mean-square tracking error down to 6.6 cm, in a flight volume that is roughly 18 m x 7 m and 3-m tall. We also demonstrate the robustness of the controller by attaching a drag plate to the UAV in flight tests and by pulling on the UAV with a rope during hover.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral remote sensing is an important monitoring technology for the soil moisture content (SMC) of agroecological systems in arid regions. This technology develops precision farming and agricultural informatization. However, hyperspectral data are generally used in data mining. In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral imaging data with a resolution o 4 cm and totaling 70 soil samples (0-10 cm) were collected from farmland (2.5 x 10(4) m(2)) near Fukang City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Four estimation strategies were tested: the original image (strategy I), first- and second-order derivative methods (strategy II), the fractional-order derivative (FOD) technique (strategy III), and the optimal fractional order combined with the optimal multiband indices (strategy IV). These strategies were based on the eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) algorithm, with the aim of building the best estimation model for agricultural SMC in arid regions. The results demonstrated that FOD technology could effectively mine information (with an absolute maximum correlation coefficient of 0.768). By comparison, strategy IV yielded the best estimates out of the methods tested (R-val(2) = 0.921, RMSEP = 1.943, and RPD = 2.736) for the SMC. The model derived from the order of 0.4 within strategy IV worked relatively well among the different derivative methods (strategy I, II, and III). In conclusion, the combination of FOD technology and the optimal multiband indices generated a highly accurate model within the XGBoost algorithm for SMC estimation. This research provided a promising data mining approach for UAV-based hyperspectral imaging data.

AB The use of robotics in executing agricultural tasks has significantly improved productivity over the years as a result of automation in performing such activities as spray, harvesting, planting etc. In order to optimize both crop yield and quality while minimizing costs, there will be need for the application of navigation strategies. These will provide optimal as well as autonomous navigation capability which is built entirely upon field coverage plan thereby making robot navigation approach a paramount scheme. In this paper, the autonomy of an agricultural mobile robot is enhanced in a structured environment (greenhouse farm) to locate an optimum route such that the robot performs a selective and variable spray of pesticides to the plants. To realize this, a robust vehicle routing problem (VRP) scheme is designed to navigate the robot autonomously while making intelligent decisions to fulfil the pesticide demands at each node (infected plants). The improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (INSGA-III) is adopted to solve this fully integer problem based on three (3) test cases carried out with 8, 32 and 56 infected plants respectively for validation. The results obtained show a trade-off solution as the Optimal INSGA-III is significantly lower than NSGA-III in terms of solution quality. On the other hand, a significant reduction in run times of between 66% and 76% and 76-93% was obtained for all test case scenarios for population sizes of 100 and 1500 respectively.

AB Automatic lane detection is a classical task in autonomous vehicles that traditional computer vision techniques can perform. However, such techniques lack reliability for achieving high accuracy while maintaining adequate time complexity in the context of real-time detection in complex and dynamic road scenes. Deep neural networks have proved their ability to achieve competing accuracy and time complexity while training them on manually labeled data. Yet, the unavailability of segmentation masks for host lanes in harsh road environments hinders fully supervised methods' operability on such a problem. This work proposes integrating traditional computer vision techniques and deep learning methods to develop a reliable benchmarking framework for lane detection tasks in complex and dynamic road scenes. Firstly, an automatic segmentation algorithm based on a sequence of traditional computer vision techniques has been experimented. This algorithm precisely segments the semantic region of the host lane in the complex urban images of nuScenes dataset used in this framework; hence corresponding weak labels are generated. After that, the developed data is qualitatively evaluated to be used in training and benchmarking five state-of-the-art FCN-based architectures: SegNet, Modified SegNet, U-Net, ResUNet, and ResUNet++. The performance evaluation of the trained models is done visually and quantitatively by considering lane detection a binary semantic segmentation task. The output results show robust performance, especially ResUNet++, which outperforms all the other models while testing them in different complex road scenes with dynamic scenarios and various lighting conditions.

AB Decision making for self-driving cars is usually tackled by manually encoding rules from drivers' behaviours or imitating drivers' manipulation using supervised learning techniques. Both of them rely on mass driving data to cover all possible driving scenarios. This study presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning method for decision making of self-driving cars, which does not depend on a large amount of labelled driving data. This method comprehensively considers both high-level manoeuvre selection and low-level motion control in both lateral and longitudinal directions. The authors firstly decompose the driving tasks into three manoeuvres, including driving in lane, right lane change and left lane change, and learn the sub-policy for each manoeuvre. Then, a master policy is learned to choose the manoeuvre policy to be executed in the current state. All policies, including master policy and manoeuvre policies, are represented by fully-connected neural networks and trained by using asynchronous parallel reinforcement learners, which builds a mapping from the sensory outputs to driving decisions. Different state spaces and reward functions are designed for each manoeuvre. They apply this method to a highway driving scenario, which demonstrates that it can realise smooth and safe decision making for self-driving cars.

AB As a candidate trust management scheme, trust models based on the cloud theory are always taken into account when detecting malicious attacks in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs). To evaluate the trust values of nodes accurately, the evidence of trust ought to be collected frequently. As a result, continual trust update results in excessive energy consumption or premature death of some sensor nodes that are close to the trust cloud node. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose an Energy-balanced Trust Cloud Migration scheme (ETCM) for UASNs, which consists of Destination Node Determination (DND), trust cloud migration and trust cloud update. Particularly, DND is performed hierarchically to obtain the destination node for trust cloud migration by selecting the candidate destination clusters, determining the destination cluster and the destination node, respectively. First, the candidate destination clusters are selected based on the distribution for the overall residual energy in UASNs using the simulated annealing algorithm. Then, an indicator of Cluster Ability (CA) is proposed to seek the destination cluster. Particularly, to calculate CA, the improved standardized Euclidean distance formula is employed to evaluate the connectivity between clusters and their neighboring clusters. Finally, on the basis of the defined node density reachability and the residual energy, the Node Ability (NA) is presented to indicate the capacity of nodes for trust cloud storage, calculation and update. The destination node in the destination cluster can be determined as the new trust cloud node using the NA. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ETCM scheme can balance energy consumption, increase node survival ratio and prolong lifetime effectively.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The emerging time-critical Internet-of-Things (IoT) use cases, e.g., augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), autonomous vehicle etc., on the one hand, involve computation intensive computer vision (CV) components in the services, on the other hand, the computation task should be completed within the stringent latency constraint, otherwise, the service reliability will deteriorate. The state-of-the-art work has shown that it is promising to tackle this challenge by offloading the computation tasks to the edge servers (ESs) using mobile edge computing (MEC). However, offloading tasks from local IoT devices to remote ESs could cause communication errors, thereby resulting in transmission failure even service timeout. The existing work mainly requires perfect transmission during task offloading at physical layer or transport layer. In fact, CV algorithms for, e.g., image classification and recognition, are able to tolerate certain level distortion of the input image to maintain the required inference accuracy. In this paper, we focus on the service reliability at application layer and study how feasible it is to improve the service reliability of the time-critical CV services in MEC system by allowing imperfect transmission. The service reliability is modeled by the transmission failure probability, service timeout probability and inference accuracy. The optimization goal is to maximize the service reliability, subject to the latency constraint. Due to the non-convexity, we solve this problem by the semi-definite relaxation based algorithm for a multi-user scenario. We evaluate the algorithm considering the practical scenarios, i.e., object detection with SSD and YOLOv2. The proposed algorithm achieves the performance closed to the exhaustive method but at a much lower complexity.

AB PurposeAdvanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been among the key innovations in the automotive market for over a decade, since they promote traffic safety. This tendency is strengthened even more lately, with the introduction of the autonomous vehicles. A plethora of ADAS exist in the market today, using common warning thresholds for all drivers. However, since we are not all driving the same way, by offering common systems for all the drivers, neither the acceptance nor the effectiveness levels of ADAS are optimal. This manuscript attempts to optimize the Collision Avoidance System (CAS) warning, through intelligent personalized algorithms.MethodsStarting with the identification of the dynamic parameters for driving behaviour modeling on the longitudinal road axis, the personalization parameters for ADAS are derived that form the basis for the algorithms developed. Also, based on literature studies, the safety boundaries for warning provision by the CAS are set and implemented in the algorithms.ResultsSpecific personalized algorithms for the longitudinal road axis behaviour are developed, based on Time to Collision and Time Headway. The proposed algorithms based on Time Headway were assessed on-road with 10 drivers and were positively evaluated by the majority of the participants, with a varying degree of reliability and usability.ConclusionsBased on the results obtained, it can be concluded that with the proposed algorithms, the initial hypothesis of the paper is verified, i.e. personalised warnings would get a greater acceptance by the drivers, of course without braking the safety limits. Further improvements of the algorithm could be achieved, possibly through a better determination of the car following event, since its definition includes a few assumptions.

AB Purpose - Nowadays, various methods of observation from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are being widely developed. There are many ways of increasing the amount of information retrieved from captured material. Unfortunately, hardware solutions consume a lot of energy, which is unacceptable in UAV applications, as it can have direct impact on the observing time on UAV. Those kinds of problems have been identified during the development phase of stabilizing platform in Polish Research Space Centre in Warsaw. As a result of that fact, energy saving control methods have been implemented, which estimates quality of stabilization process for the observation-tracking device (OTD).
   Design/methodology/approach - Mathematical model has been designed and validated with real-life experiments for the purpose of optimization of stabilization and control process. Two types of controlling algorithms have been implemented: linear quadratic regulator and proportional derivative method for driving the mechanism. Based on numerical simulations of the mechanical model being controlled by the mentioned driver, it was possible to define membership functions. After the process of defuzzification, the controller predicts quality of stabilization under defined environmental working conditions.
   Findings - An autonomous energy saving system has been created that can be implemented in many applications, where environmental conditions may change significantly.
   Practical implications - To test the proposed fuzzy controller, OTD has been chosen as an example object of application. It is a mechanical platform which houses the optical observation system. It is designed to provide the best working conditions during flight.
   Originality/value - That kind of decision-making unit has never been implemented before during observations which were carried out during flying of an object. That innovative controller should bring significant energy consumption savings.

DT Article
DE paramedic; internship; training
AB Introduction: Ireland introduced paramedic services to its ambulance services in 2005 and an accredited training programme has begun to train candidates. The training programme is 11 months tong and includes distance learning, taught and internship phases. The internship involves six weeks of supervised paramedic practice in the setting of a rapid response vehicle crewed by two candidates, principally in urban and suburban settings. Internationally, little information has been published on the educational opportunities or impact of paramedic training and particularly on the clinical practice components of that training.
   Methods: A detailed audit was carried out of clinical care activity completed by the initial 30 candidates to undertake the internship. Data were collected on patient descriptors, types of clinical problem, basic and advanced interventions undertaken and the Clinical Practice Guidetine-Advanced (CPG-A) under which the advanced intervention was undertaken. Data were compiled using SPSS V11.
   Results: Thirty candidates completed the 6-week internship, caring for a total of 1237 patients, of whom 46.3% had an advanced intervention. Intravenous cannulation was the most common advanced procedure undertaken, in one fifth of all patients seen. Twenty-two candidates inserted a total of 42 tracheal tubes or laryngeal mask airways and 55 cardiac arrests were managed. Smaller numbers of glycaemic, epilepsy and fluid resuscitation cases were dealt with.
   Discussion: Well supervised clinical training facilitates the transition from student to autonomous practitioner. Candidates in this programme accomplished a range of clinical assessments, decisions and interventions with the support of a senior supervisor, but in a situation where they carried responsibility for safe practice.

AB Urban transport systems play a major role in the development of today's societies, but they require technological changes to reduce their environmental impact. The problem lies in their level of autonomy, which is why electrical energy production systems are proposed for self-consumption, efficiently feeding their accumulators. As the energy provided by photovoltaic installations has lower recharge speeds, conventional systems with high transfer amperage and higher voltage are required. For this reason, solar installations are used for additional services and to support their autonomy. The present work tries to find the best solution for both constant voltage and peak current systems. Once found, these solutions will be applied in real time for the dynamic recharging of battery packs, trying to achieve vehicles that are progressively more energetically autonomous. To solve these situations, a new computational method for calculating voltage and amperage has been developed in this work, based on Dijkstra's minimum path search algorithm on graph theory, adapted to electrical circuits. Once this algorithm has been established, the panel performance analysis sensors, developed at the University of Malaga, are combined with different electronic solutions described in this article (Wi-Fi relay devices using esp8266 chips or feeding these relays through panels and establishing the voltage drop to switch the connection), achieving precise and sufficiently fast solutions at very low cost. Both series and parallel transitions are possible, depending on the type of energy generation required. The theoretical solutions using Minkowski paths, analyzed in the past, have been simulated and subsequently constructed in this paper, indicating the diagrams necessary for their realization.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Multi object tracking; 3D point clouds; feature fusion; computer vision;
   deep learning
AB Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a significant task in autonomous driving. Nonetheless, relying on one single sensor is not robust enough, because one modality tends to fail in some challenging situations. Texture information from RGB cameras and 3D structure information from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have respective advantages under different circumstances. Therefore, feature fusion from multiple modalities contributes to the learning of discriminative features. However, it is nontrivial to achieve effective feature fusion due to the completely distinct information modality. Previous fusion methods usually fuse the top-level features after the backbones extract the features from different modalities. The feature fusion happens solely once, which limits the information interaction between different modalities. In this paper, we propose multiscale interactive query and fusion between pixel-wise and point-wise features to obtain more discriminative features. In addition, an attention mechanism is utilized to conduct soft feature fusion between multiple pixels and points to avoid inaccurate match problems of previous single pixel-point fusion methods. We introduce PointNet++ to obtain multi-scale deep representations of point clouds and make it adaptive to our proposed interactive feature fusion between multi-scale features of images and point clouds. Through the interaction module, each modality can integrate more complementary information from the other modality. Besides, we explore the effectiveness of pre-training on each single modality and fine-tuning on the fusion-based model. Our method can achieve 90.32% MOTA and 72.44% HOTA on the KITTI benchmark and outperform other approaches without using multi-scale soft feature fusion.

AB Machine learning (ML) algorithms are nowadays widely adopted in different contexts to perform autonomous decisions and predictions. Due to the high volume of data shared in the recent years, ML algorithms are more accurate and reliable since training and testing phases are more precise. An important concept to analyze when defining ML algorithms concerns adversarial machine learning attacks. These attacks aim to create manipulated datasets to mislead ML algorithm decisions. In this work, we propose new approaches able to detect and mitigate malicious adversarial machine learning attacks against a ML system. In particular, we investigate the Carlini-Wagner (CW), the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and the Jacobian based saliency map (JSMA) attacks. The aim of this work is to exploit detection algorithms as countermeasures to these attacks. Initially, we performed some tests by using canonical ML algorithms with a hyperparameters optimization to improve metrics. Then, we adopt original reliable AI algorithms, either based on eXplainable AI (Logic Learning Machine) or Support Vector Data Description (SVDD). The obtained results show how the classical algorithms may fail to identify an adversarial attack, while the reliable AI methodologies are more prone to correctly detect a possible adversarial machine learning attack. The evaluation of the proposed methodology was carried out in terms of good balance between FPR and FNR on real world application datasets: Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling, Vehicle Platooning and Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In addition, a statistical analysis was performed to improve the robustness of the trained models, including evaluating their performance in terms of runtime and memory consumption.

ID VISION
AB Nowadays, the autonomous vehicle has undergone an impressive development, in which one of the most challenging tasks is to pursue high-precision and continuous navigation in complex scenarios. However, GNSS signals are very likely to be blocked and the inertial system suffers from error drift over time. To achieve centimeter-level positioning accuracy, a tightly-coupled model is built via fusing visual, GNSS, and INS measurements, based on a priori visual feature map. The visual map is first generated by a visual mobile surveying system, and the quality of the map is improved by outlier elimination and road lane tracking. This visual feature map consists of two layers that involve 3D coordinates of robust visual features and road lane markings, then two GNSS/INS/Vision fusion models are developed. The first one fuses visual 2D-3D feature matching, GNSS, and INS measurement. The proposed system is effective even when satellites are all out of lock. The second one fuses lane line constraints with GNSS, INS, and distance measurement indicator (DMI). In the experiment part, we show how a visual feature map is generated and refined, then, the performance of the positioning algorithm is evaluated. For the first fusion model, we achieve 10 cm RMS accuracy when only one feature point was matched and all GNSS signals are blocked for 20 minutes. For the other fusion model, the system maintained 10 cm RMS accuracy or even better when a few GNSS satellites are out of lock for 300 seconds.

AB Cities that are adopting innovative and technology-driven solutions to improve the city's efficiency are considered smart cities. With the increased attention on smart cities with self-driving vehicles, drones, and robots, designing smart infrastructure is only a natural extension. Smart infrastructures aim to self-diagnose, self-power, self-adapt, and self-heal during normal and extreme operating conditions. Structural vibration control (SVC) and structural health monitoring (SHM) technologies, in particular, are expected to play pivotal roles in the development of modern smart and resilient structures. SVC methodologies intend to provide supplemental damping and reduce the structural dynamic responses during normal and extreme events. SHM methodologies offer valuable information about the structure's condition that is useful for maintenance purposes and rapid damage detection in post-hazard events. The collapse of the 12-story Champlain Towers South, a beachfront condominium in the Miami suburb of Surfside, Florida, could have been known in advance with an embedded SHM technology. More recently, the integrated structural control and health monitoring (ISCHM) systems have shown promise in the development of smart cities of the future. The integrated architecture incorporates the control and health monitoring components as complementary technologies and simultaneously takes advantage of both technologies. This article provides a state-of-the-art review of ISCHM ideas and systems. It presents recent significant developments in structural control, SHM, and energy harvesting that are paving the way towards the advent of integrated ISCHM systems, including damage-tolerant control systems. This article also identifies future promising research areas for designing the next generation of autonomous ISCHM systems for smart cities.

AB Lane detection algorithms require extremely low computational costs as an important part of autonomous driving. Due to heavy backbone networks, algorithms based on pixel-wise segmentation is struggling to handle the problem of runtime consumption in the recognition of lanes. In this paper, a novel and practical methodology based on lightweight Segmentation Network is proposed, which aims to achieve accurate and efficient lane detection. Different with traditional convolutional layers, the proposed Shadow module can reduce the computational cost of the backbone network by performing linear transformations on intrinsic feature maps. Thus a lightweight backbone network Shadow-VGG-16 is built. After that, a tailored pyramid parsing module is introduced to collect different sub-domain features, which is composed of both a strip pool module based on Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (PSPNet) and a convolution attention module. Finally, a lane structural loss is proposed to explicitly model the lane structure and reduce the influence of noise, so that the pixels can fit the lane better. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our method is significantly better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms such as Pointlanenet and Line-CNN et al. 95.28% and 90.06% accuracy and 62.5 frames per second (fps) inference speed can be achieved on the CULane and Tusimple test dataset. Compared with the latest ERFNet, Line-CNN, SAD, F-1 scores have respectively increased by 3.51%, 2.84%, and 3.82%. Meanwhile, the result from our dataset exceeds the top performances of the other by 8.6% with an 87.09 F-1 score, which demonstrates the superiority of our method.

ID DESIGN
AB Modern control systems in the maritime domain are increasingly controlled by software systems and become subject to updates and configuration changes during operation. Moreover, with the shift to autonomous vessels and cars, these software-based systems are taking on more and more safety-critical tasks, so the risks associated with system failures are increasing. Unlike before, it becomes necessary to verify the continuously adapting modules of a vehicle not only before deployment, but to establish continuous verification capabilities during all phases of the product lifecycle, from the design to the system in operation. Hence, in case of an update, deviations from the expected behavior can be automatically detected and relevant measures can be initiated. In this work, a contract-based verification framework is presented that includes automatable and formally analyzable behavioral descriptors in form of assumption-guarantee contracts for all phases of the software lifecycle to provide static and dynamic verification capabilities alongside a dynamically changing system composition. By utilizing contractually defined behavior descriptions, classic test procedures, such as simulations, are supplemented by a formally testable level that is applied to all phases of the update process. A conceptual-deductive methodology was chosen, building on the identified requirements to develop an overarching update framework that adds contractual descriptions to the traditional development case. Based on the presented framework, the verifiable modification of a safety-critical software system is demonstrated. The approach is evaluated using a maritime collision-avoidance system and the verification steps are evaluated along the update process. The framework offers a novel approach to complement existing test procedures by enabling formal impact analysis and incremental verification of updates.

AB With the advancement in the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, as well as the industrial IoT, various applications and services are benefiting from this emerging technology such as smart healthcare systems, virtual realities applications, connected and autonomous vehicles, to name a few. However, IoT devices are known for being limited computation capacities which is crucial to the device's availability time. Traditional approaches used to offload the applications to the cloud to ease the burden on the end user's devices, however, greater latency and network traffic issues still persist. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology has emerged to address these issues and enhance the survivability of cloud infrastructure. While a lot of attempts have been made to manage an efficient process of applications offload, many of which either focus on the allocation of computational or communication protocols without considering a cooperative solution. In addition, a single-user scenario was considered. Therefore, we study multi-user IoT applications offloading for a MEC system, which cooperatively considers to allocate both the resources of computation and communication. The proposed system focuses on minimizing the weighted overhead of local IoT devices, and minimize the offload measured by the delay and energy consumption. The mathematical formulation is a typical mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP), and this is an NP-hard problem. We obtain the solution to the objective function by splitting the objective problem into three sub-problems. Extensive set of evaluations have been performed so as to get the evaluation of the proposed model. The collected results indicate that offloading decisions, energy consumption, latency, and the impact of the number of IoT devices have shown superior improvement over traditional models.

AB In the context of multi-robot system and more generally for Technological System-of-Systems, this paper proposes a multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) framework for SLAM-based cooperative exploration under limited communication bandwidth. The exploration strategy, based on RGB-D grid mapping and group leader decision making, uses a new utility function that takes into account each robot distance in the group from the unexplored set of targets, and allows to simultaneously explore the environment and to get a detailed grid map of specific areas in an optimized manner. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the main novelty is to exchange only the frontier points of the computed local grid map to reduce the shared data volume, and consequently the memory consumption. Moreover, communications constraints are taken into account within a SLAM-based multi-robot collective exploration. In that way, the proposed strategy is also designed to cope with communications drop-out or failures. The multi-UAV system is implemented into ROS and GAZEBO simulators on multiple computers provided with network facilities. Results show that the proposed cooperative exploration strategy minimizes the global exploration time by 25% for 2 UAVs and by 30% for 3 UAVs, while outperforming state-of-the-art exploration strategies based on both random and closest frontiers, and minimizing the average travelled distance by each UAV by 55% for 2 UAVs and by 62% for 3 UAVs. Furthermore, the system performance is also evaluated in a realistic test-bed comprising an infrastructure-less network, which is used to support limited communications. The results of the test-bed show that the proposed exploration strategy uses 10 times less data than a strategy that makes the robots exchanging their whole local maps.

AB In the context of Industry 4.0, the matrix production concept represents revolutionary solutions from a technological and logistics point of view. In a matrix production system, flexible, configurable production and assembly cells are arranged in a grid layout, and the in-plant supply is based on autonomous vehicles. Adaptable and flexible material handling solutions are required to perform the dynamically changing supply-demands of standardized and categorized manufacturing and assembly cells. Within the frame of this paper, the authors describe the in-plant supply process of matrix production and the optimization potential in these processes. After a systematic literature review, this paper introduces the structure of matrix production as a cyber-physical system focusing on logistics aspects. A mathematical model of this in-plant supply process is described including extended and real-time optimization from routing, assignment, and scheduling points of view. The optimization problem described in the model is an NP-hard problem. There are no known efficient analytical methods to find the best solution for this kind of problem; therefore, we use heuristics to find a suitable solution for the above-described problem. Next, a sequential black hole-floral pollination heuristic algorithm is described. The scenario analysis, which focuses on the clustering and routing aspects of supply demands in a matrix production system, validates the model and evaluates its performance to increase cost-efficiency and warrants environmental awareness of the in-plant supply in matrix production.

AB Single-photon detection at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths is critical for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems used in imaging technologies such as autonomous vehicle trackers and atmospheric remote sensing. Portable, high-performance LiDAR relies on silicon-based single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) because of their extremely low dark count rate (DCR) and afterpulsing probability, but their operation wavelengths are typically limited up to 905 nm. Although InGaAs-InP SPADs offer an alternative platform to extend the operation wavelengths to eye-safe ranges, their high DCR and afterpulsing severely limit their commercial applications. Here we propose a new separate absorption and multiplication avalanche photodiode (SAM-APD) platform composed of vertical InGaAs-GaAs nanowire arrays for single-photon detection. Among a total of 4400 nanowires constituting one photodiode, each avalanche event is confined in a single nanowire, which means that the avalanche volume and the number of filled traps can be drastically reduced in our approach. This leads to an extremely small afterpulsing probability compared with conventional InGaAs-based SPADs and enables operation in free-running mode. We show a DCR below 10 Hz, due to reduced fill factor, with photon count rates of 7.8 MHz and timing jitter less than 113 ps, which suggest that nanowire-based NIR focal plane arrays for single-photon detection can be designed without active quenching circuitry that severely restricts pixel density and portability in NIR commercial SPADs. Therefore, the proposed work based on vertical nanowires provides a new degree of freedom in designing avalanche photodetectors and could be a stepping stone for high-performance InGaAs SPADs.

ID WHEELED MOBILE MANIPULATORS; MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE LOAD
AB The aerial manipulators (AMs) are a new class of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) that are created in response to the ever-increasing demand for autonomous object transportation and manipulation. Because of power supply restrictions, the load carrying capacity is limited and therefore it is necessary to reduce the overall weight of these UASs. The past works in the field of AMs consider the multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as the base and manipulators with rigid links as the interactive elements with the environment which are bulky and heavy. To overcome the issue, this paper introduces the AMs endowed with flexible manipulators, their dynamic modeling, a new method for trajectory planning and control algorithm such that the unfavorable effects of using flexible elements like vibrations are minimized. Due to lack of kinematic constraints and the presence of flexibility conditions, conventional methods of trajectory planning for ground wheeled-mobile manipulators (GWMMs) such as extended and augmented Jacobian matrix cannot be applied to AMs. The addition of flexibility to the manipulator increases underactuation degrees (UADs), the complexity of trajectory planning and control synthesis. Considering large deformation assumption for flexible links, the dynamic equations and their induced nonholonomic constraints are derived applying Lagrangian formulation. Then, these constraints with that part of equations of motion corresponding to the links flexibility are solved simultaneously in the context of an optimization algorithm resulting in optimized trajectories. Through simulation results, the proposed method of trajectory planning and vibration control of underactuated flexible AMs has been shown to be effective.

AB This paper presents a model-based multiobjective control strategy to reduce bus bunching and hence improve public transport reliability. Our goal is twofold. First, we define a proper model, consisting of multiple static and dynamic components. Bus-following model captures the longitudinal dynamics taking into account the interaction with the surrounding traffic. Furthermore, bus stop operations are modeled to estimate dwell time. Second, a shrinking horizon model predictive controller (MPG) is proposed for solving bus bunching problems. The model is able to predict short time-space behavior of public transport buses enabling constrained, finite horizon, optimal control solution to ensure homogeneity of service both in time and space. In this line, the goal with the selected rolling horizon control scheme is to choose a proper velocity profile for the public transport bus such that it keeps both timetable schedule and a desired headway from the bus in front of it (leading bus). The control strategy predicts the arrival time at a bus stop using a passenger arrival and dwell time model. In this vein, the receding horizon model predictive controller calculates an optimal velocity profile based on its current position and desired arrival time. Four different weighting strategies are proposed to test (i) timetable only, (ii) headway only, (iii) balanced timetable - headway tracking and (iv) adaptive control with varying weights. The controller is tested in a high fidelity traffic simulator with realistic scenarios. The behavior of the system is analyzed by considering extreme disturbances. Finally, the existence of a Pareto front between these two objectives is also demonstrated.

AB The mechanisms by which heat is delivered to Antarctic ice shelves are a major source of uncertainty when assessing the response of the Antarctic ice sheet to climate change. Direct observations of the ice shelf-ocean interaction are extremely scarce and in many regions melt rates from ice shelf-ocean models are not constrained by measurements. Our two years of data (2010 and 2011) from three oceanic moorings below the Fimbul Ice Shelf in the Eastern Weddell Sea show cold cavity waters, with average temperatures of less than 0.1 degrees C above the surface freezing point. This suggests low basal melt rates, consistent with remote sensing-based, steady-state mass balance estimates for this sector of the Antarctic coast. Oceanic heat for basal melting is found to be supplied by two sources of warm water entering below the ice: (i) eddy-like bursts of Modified Warm Deep Water that access the cavity at depth for eight months of the record; and (ii) fresh surface water that flushes parts of the ice base with temperatures above freezing during late summer and fall. This interplay of processes implies that basal melting at the Fimbul Ice Shelf cannot simply be parameterized by coastal deep ocean temperatures, but instead appears directly linked to both solar forcing at the surface as well as to the dynamics of the coastal current system.

AB Color cognizant capability has a significant impact in service robots for object detection based on color, traffic signal interpretation for autonomous vehicles, etc. Conventional clustering algorithms such as K-means and mean shift can be used for predicting the dominant color of an image by mapping the pixels from RGB to HSV and clustering them based on HSV values, thereby picking the cluster with the most pixels as the dominant color of the image, but these approaches are not solely dedicated to the same outcome. This research's goal is to introduce novel techniques for predicting the dominant color of objects in images, as well as pixel extraction concepts, which allow these algorithms to be more time and efficiency optimized. This investigation appraises propriety of integrating object detection and color prediction algorithms. We introduce a dominant color prediction color map model and two new algorithms: average windowing and pixel skip. To predict objects in an image prior to color prediction, we combined the Mask R-CNN framework with our proposed techniques. Verification of our approach is done by creating a benchmark dataset of 200 images and comparing color predicted by algorithms with actual color. The accuracy and runtime of existing techniques are compared with those of the proposed algorithms to prove the superiority of our algorithms. The viability of the proposed algorithms was demonstrated by scores of 95.4% accuracy and color prediction time of 9.2 s for the PXS algorithm and corresponding values of 93.6% and 6.5 s for the AVW algorithm.

AB Command and Control (C2) is a broad concept that encompasses the coordination of individuals and organizations towards achieving a goal. However, dynamic and uncertain scenarios, such as military and disaster relief operations, present an inherent challenge to C2 activities. In such situations, plans often need to be changed in the face of unforeseen problems, and even coordination processes may be subject to variation. This dynamism increases the complexity of resource management and requires C2 Agility-i.e., the ability to respond to change in a timely and suitable fashion. Nonetheless, there is a lack of solutions to provide C2 Agility to cope with dynamic contexts. To address this problem, this work proposes a computational model of C2 Agility for a team of autonomous agents. This model describes how to combine reconfiguration of individual team members and of coordination approaches to adapt to context changes. The proposed approach leverages a typed-parameterized extension of a channel system to define the coordinating roles and responsibilities of team members. Each member is modeled as a dynamic software product line, with the inherent ability to reconfigure itself. To assess this model, a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) performing a reconnaissance mission was simulated. The simulation showed that the proposed model was suitable for dealing with dynamic contexts. Particularly, metrics for the agile approach suggest improved system resilience in the face of induced perturbations, compared to non-agile C2. The obtained results with the proposed software-based simulations showed that the proposed model is useful in providing C2 Agility to the studied scenarios, making the behavior of the entities specified in the model capable of dealing with context changes.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices are currently being deployed in systems such as autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring devices. The introduction of IoT devices into these systems enables network connectivity for data transfer, cloud support, and more, but can also lead to malware injection. Since many IoT devices operate in remote environments, it is also difficult to protect them from physical tampering. Conventional protection approaches rely on software. However, these can be circumvented by the moving target nature of malware or through hardware attacks. Alternatively, insertion of the internal monitoring circuits into IoT chips requires a design trade-off, balancing the requirements of the monitoring circuit and the main circuit. A very promising approach to detecting anomalous behavior in the IoT and other embedded systems is side-channel analysis. To date, however, this can be performed only before deployment due to the cost and size of side-channel setups (e.g., and oscilloscopes, probes) or by internal performance counters. Here, we introduce an external monitoring printed circuit board (PCB) named RASC to provide remote access to side-channels. RASC reduces the complete side-channel analysis system into two small PCBs (2 x 2 cm), providing the ability to monitor power and electromagnetic (EM) traces of the target device. Additionally, RASC can transmit data and/or alerts of anomalous activities detected to a remote host through Bluetooth. To demonstrate RASCs capabilities, we extract keys from encryption modules such as AES implemented on Arduino and FPGA boards. To illustrate RASC's defensive capabilities, we also use it to perform malware detection. RASC's success in power analysis is comparable to an oscilloscope/probe setup but is lightweight and two orders of magnitude cheaper.

AB Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have become one of the enabling technologies for the development of future ocean monitoring systems, where autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) provide a very attractive way for the data collection of sensor nodes. The data obtained by nodes may have different importance and time sensitivity, which is recorded as the value of information (VoI). The VoI often decays with time. The obtained VoI based on AUV is closely related to the path length of AUV. A longer AUV path lead to more time to collect data, along which less VoI could be obtained finally. Moreover, as sensor nodes are battery-powered and therefore energy-constrained, selecting the nodes with larger residual energy as the AUV path nodes helps to prolong the network lifetime. Therefore, we focus on AUV path planing with the objective of maximizing the lifetime of network while satisfying the constraint on VoI. In this paper, considering the node energy and VoI, we provide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to find an optimal path of AUV. Then, a joint optimized data collection algorithm (JODA) that taking in account the influence of residual energy of nodes and VoI is proposed, which reduces the computational complexity. In our experiments the effectiveness of JODA has been proved by comparing its performance with the theoretical value determined by the ILP model. We also compare the performance of JODA with that of other data collection algorithms, namely TSP, GAAP and EEDA. The simulation results demonstrate that the JODA always outperforms all other algorithms in terms of the total VoI and network lifetime.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Semantic segmentation for accurate visual perception is a critical task in computer vision. In principle, the automatic classification of dynamic visual scenes using predefined object classes remains unresolved. The challenging problems of learning deep convolution neural networks, specifically ResNet-based DeepLabV3+ (the most recent version), are threefold. The problems arise due to (1) biased centric exploitations of filter masks, (2) lower representational power of residual networks due to identity shortcuts, and (3) a loss of spatial relationship by using per-pixel primitives. To solve these problems, we present a proficient approach based on DeepLabV3+, along with an added evaluation metric, namely, Unified DeepLabV3+ and S(3)core, respectively. The presented unified version reduced the effect of biased exploitations via additional dilated convolution layers with customized dilation rates. We further tackled the problem of representational power by introducing non-linear group normalization shortcuts to solve the focused problem of semi-dark images. Meanwhile, to keep track of the spatial relationships in terms of the global and local contexts, geometrically bunched pixel cues were used. We accumulated all the proposed variants of DeepLabV3+ to propose Unified DeepLabV3+ for accurate visual decisions. Finally, the proposed S(3)core evaluation metric was based on the weighted combination of three different accuracy measures, i.e., the pixel accuracy, IoU (intersection over union), and Mean BFScore, as robust identification criteria. Extensive experimental analysis performed over a CamVid dataset confirmed the applicability of the proposed solution for autonomous vehicles and robotics for outdoor settings. The experimental analysis showed that the proposed Unified DeepLabV3+ outperformed DeepLabV3+ by a margin of 3% in terms of the class-wise pixel accuracy, along with a higher S(3)core, depicting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB An accurate ego-motion estimation solution is vital for autonomous vehicles. LiDAR is widely adopted in self-driving systems to obtain depth information directly and eliminate the influence of changing illumination in the environment. In LiDAR odometry, the lack of descriptions of feature points as well as the failure of the assumption of uniform motion may cause mismatches or dilution of precision in navigation. In this study, a method to perform LiDAR odometry utilizing a bird's eye view of LiDAR data combined with a deep learning-based feature point is proposed. Orthographic projection is applied to generate a bird's eye view image of a 3D point cloud. Thereafter, an R2D2 neural network is employed to extract keypoints and compute their descriptors. Based on those keypoints and descriptors, a two-step matching and pose estimation is designed to keep these feature points tracked over a long distance with a lower mismatch ratio compared to the conventional strategy. In the experiment, the evaluation of the proposed algorithm on the KITTI training dataset demonstrates that the proposed LiDAR odometry can provide more accurate trajectories compared with the handcrafted feature-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm. In detail, a comparison of the handcrafted descriptors is demonstrated. The difference between the RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm and the two-step pose estimation is also demonstrated experimentally. In addition, the data collected by Velodyne VLP-16 is also evaluated by the proposed solution. The low-drift positioning RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 4.70 m from approximately 5 km mileage shown in the result indicates that the proposed algorithm has generalization performance on low-resolution LiDAR.

AB In this study, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) detection technique was used as the background to investigate the target classification method for underwater visual images. The target classification method is based on the bag-of-words model, with reduced classification accuracy when the edges of underwater objects are blurred, and when there are many noise points. To solve this problem, an improved visual dictionary generation method was proposed based on the bag-of-words model. The proposed method includes a step on decomposing the complete contour of the target before extracting the features. The DCE (discrete contour evolution) algorithm was used to decompose the complete contour into segments of different lengths, and the SC (shape context) method was applied to extract the features of the contour segments. The FCM (Fuzzy C-Means) algorithm was then used to generate a visual dictionary. To address the classification accuracy problem that causes the underwater targets to decrease after adding spatial location information to the bag-of-words model instead of increasing, an improved spatial location information description method was proposed. The contour segments with the nearest-neighbor relationship were represented as visual phrases, constituting the spatial information of the bag-of-words model. Additionally, for the problem of the shape information of contour segments with different shapes, and the relative position information between the contour segments having different contributions to the target classification, a method was developed to balance the contributions of the two using the optimal weight selected from the experiments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively improve the classification accuracy of underwater target images.

AB In this study, the robust H-infinity fuzzy observer-based fault-tolerant tracking control strategy is proposed for the stochastic polynomial fuzzy system (SPFS) under the effect of external disturbance, measurement noise, system/sensor fault signals and continuous/discontinuous internal random fluctuations. At first, the smoothed models of fault signals are constructed to describe their dynamic behavior. Then, by integrating the SPFS with the smoothed models of fault signals as one augmented system, the state/fault signal estimation problem can be transformed to a state estimation problem of augmented system by the proposed polynomial fuzzy observer. With the utilization of estimated state/fault signals and reference trajectory, a fuzzy polynomial fault-tolerant tracking controller can be implemented. To attenuate the effect of undesired external disturbance and measurement noise on the state/fault signal estimation and tracking control performance, the robust H-infinity fuzzy observer-based fault-tolerant tracking control strategy is proposed in this study. By utilizing the homogeneous Lyapunov function and Lipschiz condition, the Ito-Levy formula is reformulated to relax the compensation terms of stochastic processes during the design. Then, the design conditions are derived in terms of interpolation function-dependent matrix inequality and consequently transformed to a two-step sum of square (SOS) condition design problem for the robust H-infinity fuzzy observer based fault-tolerant tracking control strategy. A simulation example of double lane maneuvering task for autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

AB This study addresses a view-path-planning problem during 3-D scanning of a large-scale structure based on multiview stereo (MVS) for unmanned aerial platforms. Recently, most studies have adopted an explore-then-exploit strategy for 3-D scanning. The strategy first generates a coarse model from a simple overhead scanning and then plans an inspection path to cover the entire surface of the coarse model. However, even though the inspection path may be optimal, it is difficult to guarantee a complete and accurate reconstruction result due to defective factors of MVS such as occlusions, textureless surfaces, and insufficient parallaxes. Furthermore, the entire procedure of this strategy is inefficiently slow because of path redundancies and long MVS processing time. Therefore, we propose a novel view-path-planning method for 3-D scanning based on an online MVS reconstruction algorithm. The suggested method incrementally reconstructs the target model online and iteratively plans view paths by analyzing the current partial reconstructions. The method continuously analyzes the quality of the model and detects inaccurately reconstructed surfaces. It then plans an inspection path that provides a complete coverage of the detected surfaces while maximizing the performance of MVS. This method can construct a complete 3-D model in a single scanning trial without the need for rescanning. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of the model completeness of complex structures.

TI Explanatory hierarchy of causal structures in molecular biology

   Mechanisms; Genes; Transcriptional noise
ID MECHANISMS; THINKING; SELECTION; GENES
AB In the debate on causal explanation in biology, in the past two decades largely influenced by the new mechanist (NM) approach, the concept of a pathway has recently reemerged as a promising research agenda (see, in particular, Ross Philosophy of Science,85(4), 551-572, 2018; The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science,72(1), 131-158, 2021). Ross' account of biological explanation differentiates several autonomous types of causal structures that play explanatory and other roles across the life sciences. NM, however, prioritizes mechanisms as vehicles of biological explanations. According to this program, the causal architecture of biological pathways and other causal structures, such as cascades and processes, can be interpreted with at least one of the NM's mechanism concepts. In other words, these alternative causal structures are not sufficiently distinctive to merit the explanatory autonomy with regard to the NM corresponding concepts. We examine the explanatory practice of molecular biology and concur with Ross that there are indeed distinct types of causal structures, not all falling under the concept of a mechanism. Nonetheless, we show that the concept of mechanism is referring to a privileged causal structure, at the center of explanatory efforts in molecular biology. Pathways and other causal concepts, while somewhat distinct from mechanisms themselves, are explanatorily relevant to the degree in which they exhibit mechanistic features, are parts of a mechanistic architecture, or may lead to a mechanistic arrangement. What emerges in that manner is a hierarchy of causal structures with mechanisms at the explanatory top, and lower levels differing in the degree in which they contribute to mechanistic arrangements.

ID LATERAL-LINE
AB In nature, the lateral line system (LLS) is a critical sensor organ of fish for rheotaxis in complex environments. Inspired by the LLS, numbers of artificial lateral line systems (ALLSs) have been designed to the fish-like robots for flow field perception, assisting the robots to be stable in the face of flow disturbances. However, almost all pressure sensor based ALLSs face the challenge of the low signal to noise ratio (SNR), resulting in inaccurate perception information. To solve this problem, this paper describes a dual-sensor fusion method by integrating the ALLSs with the inertial measurement unit (IMU), and shows the excellent performance by a higher precision and lower latency attitude holding of robotic fish. First, low-pass filtering is performed on ALLS data with low-SNR. Second, the ALLS data is mapped to the angle of attack based on an artificial neural network. Finally, a fusion perception method is established based on the time correlation between ALLS and IMU. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method, we compare the result of attitude holding by three methods (dual-sensor fusion method, IMU based method, and ALLS based method). Furthermore, dual-sensor fusion method is tested at varied flow velocities and varied desired angles of attack, indicating that the algorithm can enable the robotic fish to perform dynamic movements in the incoming flow. This work provides a method for the attitude control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) by fusing the sensory data of ALLS and IMU, which is also applicable to other flow sensors and IMU.

AB Spines and rhizopodia play an important role in the feeding behavior, symbiont ecology, shell geochemistry, and density and drag of planktonic foraminifera. However, there are few empirical data on planktonic foraminifera in situ, and these delicate structures are disturbed on capture. Here, we report spine and rhizopod measurements from underwater images obtained in the California Current System near La Jolla, California by Zooglider, a new autonomous zooplankton-sensing glider. Across all observed species, we find that spine length and flexibility correlate with test size and that spines increase the effective prey encounter volume of spinose foraminifera by two to three orders of magnitude. Our data also yielded several novel observations regarding hastigerinid foraminifera (Hastigerinella digitata and Hastigerina pelagica), a group of unusually large planktonic foraminifera that are abundant in our dataset below 250 m. First, the effective encounter volume of hastigerinid foraminifera can be very large: our largest specimen occupies almost 40 cm(3) (about the size of a golf ball), while the median specimen occupies 5.3 cm(3) (about the size of a cherry). Second, the majority of hastigerinid foraminifera in our dataset have asymmetric bubble capsules, which are most frequently oriented with their bubbles on the upward side of the test, consistent with the hypothesis that the bubble capsule is positively buoyant. Third, 16% of hastigerinid foraminifera in our dataset have dispersed bubble capsules with detached bubbles distributed along the spines and rhizopodia, consistent with a regular source of natural disturbance. Taken together, our observations suggest that hastigerinid foraminifera play a larger role as mesopelagic predators in the California Current System than previously recognized.

AB In recent years, visual object tracking has become a very active research area. An increasing number of tracking algorithms are being proposed each year. It is because tracking has wide applications in various real-world problems such as human-computer interaction, autonomous vehicles, robotics, surveillance, and security just to name a few. In the current study, we review latest trends and advances in the tracking area and evaluate the robustness of different trackers based on the feature extraction methods. The first part of this work includes a comprehensive survey of the recently proposed trackers. We broadly categorize trackers into Correlation Filter based Trackers (CFTs) and Non-CFTs. Each category is further classified into various types based on the architecture and the tracking mechanism. In the second part of this work, we experimentally evaluated 24 recent trackers for robustness and compared handcrafted and deep feature based trackers. We observe that trackers using deep features performed better, though in some cases a fusion of both increased performance significantly. To overcome the drawbacks of the existing benchmarks, a new benchmark Object Tracking and Temple Color (OTTC) has also been proposed and used in the evaluation of different algorithms. We analyze the performance of trackers over 11 different challenges in OTTC and 3 other benchmarks. Our study concludes that Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) based trackers perform better than the others. Our study also reveals that inclusion of different types of regularizations over DCF often results in boosted tracking performance. Finally, we sum up our study by pointing out some insights and indicating future trends in the visual object tracking field.

AB With the development of unmanned equipment technology, new types of intelligent weapons such as loitering missile and unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) are widely used. The combat system of systems (SoS) presents the characteristics of multifunctional combat equipment and hybrid manned and unmanned force units. At present, the research of mission planning is mostly oriented to a single factor, does not consider a variety of operational activities. Therefore, how to describe the hybrid operational organization of multiple functions and force units and to accomplish mission planning for various operational activities has very practical significance. In this paper, the FINC(Force, Intelligence, Networking, C2) model is extended, a new model framework of unmanned combat force with the function of integrated observe and attack is proposed, which is called Force Intelligent Network Command and Control Model with autonomous platform (FINCA). Four types and eight different function chains are proposed for the hybrid Combat SoS. Through the capability requirements and resource constraints, the operational tasks are mapped to the types and quantities of function chains that needed to accomplish this task, and the multi-priority list dynamic reconstruction scheme (MPLDCS) method is used to generate the function chain planning scheme. The many-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-III is improved, let mission execution time, connection change induced consumption, and the real-time remaining number of UAV composed the objective function to find all possible Pareto front. Finally, the method proposed in this paper was validated by the case of the modular and reconfigurable fire brigade proposed by the US.Army to participate in the border operations.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE STORAGE; AUTOMATED STORAGE; CYCLE TIME; MODEL; DESIGN
AB Shuttle-based storage and retrieval systems (SBS/RSes) - a type of automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) - have recently been developed to increase throughput capacity. An SBS/RS can increase throughput by using multiple shuttles as storage and retrieval machines (SRMs), while traditional AS/RSes are limited because they use a single stacker crane as an SRM to handle multiple jobs. However, when setting up an SBS/RS, a significant investment is required to integrate a shuttle for each tier in the storage construction. To lower costs, a reduction in the number of shuttles is an adequate solution if the SBS/RS can maintain the designated throughput. However, this could also lead to operational problems. Namely collision prevention and workload balances could be affected because each shuttle would be able to travel to any tier for pickups and drop-offs. Thus, shuttle position control is important when the system operates with a mismatch between the number of shuttles and tiers. Ideally, free balancing should be achieved. When free balanced, each shuttle's position is monitored to prevent collisions or blockages, as well as to make sure jobs are evenly assigned and the required throughput is maintained. This paper suggests system controls to prove the effectiveness of free balancing, and it runs a simulation analysis to verify the system with the suggested controls. As a result, free balancing shows better performances in terms of throughput and utilization compared to a basic system control. Specifically, in our case, free balancing can achieve targeted throughput with less number of shuttles. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ocean tides are the main source of high-frequency variability in the vertical and horizontal motion of ice sheets near their marine margins. Floating ice shelves, which occupy about three quarters of the perimeter of Antarctica and the termini of four outlet glaciers in northern Greenland, rise and fall in synchrony with the ocean tide. Lateral motion of floating and grounded portions of ice sheets near their marine margins can also include a tidal component. These tide-induced signals provide insight into the processes by which the oceans can affect ice sheet mass balance and dynamics. In this review, we summarize in situ and satellite-based measurements of the tidal response of ice shelves and grounded ice, and spatial variability of ocean tide heights and currents around the ice sheets. We review sensitivity of tide heights and currents as ocean geometry responds to variations in sea level, ice shelf thickness, and ice sheet mass and extent. We then describe coupled ice-ocean models and analytical glacier models that quantify the effect of ocean tides on lower-frequency ice sheet mass loss and motion. We suggest new observations and model developments to improve the representation of tides in coupled models that are used to predict future ice sheet mass loss and the associated contribution to sea level change. The most critical need is for new data to improve maps of bathymetry, ice shelf draft, spatial variability of the drag coefficient at the ice-ocean interface, and higher-resolution models with improved representation of tidal energy sinks.

TI Magnetic anomalies associated with abundant production of pyrrhotite in

AB We report here results from a deep-sea magnetic survey using an autonomous underwater vehicle over the Hakurei hydrothermal site, in the middle Okinawa Trough. Magnetic inversion revealed that the Hakurei site is associated with well-defined high-magnetization zones distributed within a broad low-magnetization zone. Results from rock magnetic measurements, performed on sulfide ore samples obtained by drilling, showed that some samples possessed extremely high natural remanent magnetization (NRM) (as much as 6.8-953.0 A/m), although most of the measured samples had much lower NRM. These high-NRM samples were characterized by high Konigsberger ratios (10(1)-10(3)), indicating much larger NRM than induced magnetization, and contained pyrrhotite as the only magnetic mineral. This suggests that NRM carried by pyrrhotite is the source of the observed magnetic anomalies. The wide range of NRM intensity was considered to be due to a highly heterogeneous distribution of pyrrhotite, because pyrrhotite was commonly identified in both the high-NRM and low-NRM samples. Pyrrhotite production may have been occasionally drastically increased, with highly magnetic ores formed as a result. Rapid burial of active vents may result in the creation of an extensive reducing environment under the seafloor, which is favorable to pyrrhotite production, and may also prevent oxidation of pyrrhotite by isolating it from seawater. Because the magnetization intensity of sulfide ores was highly variable, it would not be straightforward to estimate the quantity of ore deposits from the magnetic anomalies. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates the usefulness of magnetic surveys in detecting hydrothermal deposits.

AB Seawater inherent optical properties (IOPs) are key parameters in a wide range of applications in environmental studies and oceanographic research. In particular, the absorption coefficient (a) is the typical IOP used to obtain the concentration of chlorophyll-a in the water-a critical parameter in biological oceanography studies and the backscattering coefficient (b(b)) is used as a measure of turbidity. In this study, we test a novel instrument concept designed to obtain both the absorption and backscattering coefficients. The instrument would emit a collimated monochromatic light beam into the water retrieving the backscattered light intensity as a function of distance from the center of illumination. We use Monte Carlo modeling of light propagation to create an inversion algorithm that translates the signal from such an instrument into values of a and b(b). Our results, based on simulations spanning the bulk of natural values of seawater IOP combinations, indicate that a 6.2 cm diameter instrument with a radial resolution of 1 cm would be capable of predicting b(b) within less than 13.4% relative difference and a within less than 57% relative difference (for 90% of the inverted a values, the relative errors fall below 29.7%). Additionally, these errors could be further reduced by constraining the inversion algorithm with information from concurrent measurements of other IOPs. Such a compact and relatively simple device could have multiple applications for in situ optical measurements, including a and b(b) retrievals from instrumentation mounted on autonomous underwater vehicles. Furthermore, the same methodology could possibly be used for an out-of-water sensor. (C) 2011 Optical Society of America

AB Real-time object detection based on UAV remote sensing is widely required in different scenarios. In the past 20 years, with the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), remote sensing technology, deep learning technology, and edge computing technology, research on UAV real-time object detection in different fields has become increasingly important. However, since real-time UAV object detection is a comprehensive task involving hardware, algorithms, and other components, the complete implementation of real-time object detection is often overlooked. Although there is a large amount of literature on real-time object detection based on UAV remote sensing, little attention has been given to its workflow. This paper aims to systematically review previous studies about UAV real-time object detection from application scenarios, hardware selection, real-time detection paradigms, detection algorithms and their optimization technologies, and evaluation metrics. Through visual and narrative analyses, the conclusions cover all proposed research questions. Real-time object detection is more in demand in scenarios such as emergency rescue and precision agriculture. Multi-rotor UAVs and RGB images are of more interest in applications, and real-time detection mainly uses edge computing with documented processing strategies. GPU-based edge computing platforms are widely used, and deep learning algorithms is preferred for real-time detection. Meanwhile, optimization algorithms need to be focused on resource-limited computing platform deployment, such as lightweight convolutional layers, etc. In addition to accuracy, speed, latency, and energy are equally important evaluation metrics. Finally, this paper thoroughly discusses the challenges of sensor-, edge computing-, and algorithm-related lightweight technologies in real-time object detection. It also discusses the prospective impact of future developments in autonomous UAVs and communications on UAV real-time target detection.

AB The traffic environment and driving behaviors are of great complexity and uncertainty in our physical world. Therefore, training in the digital world with low cost and diverse complexities become popular for autonomous driving in recent years. However, the current training methods tend to be limited to static data sets and deterministic models that do not sufficiently take into account the uncertainty and diversity prevalent in real traffic scenarios. These approaches also limit more possibilities for the comprehensive development and optimization of vision systems. In this paper, we develop a parallel training method based on artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) for the intelligent optimization and learning of the aforementioned agents in uncertain driving spaces. Parallel training creates a virtual driving space following the instruction of the ACP approach and conducts large-scale rehearsal experiments for possible scenarios. By enhancing the diversity of virtual scenarios, intelligent vehicles are trained to respond and adapt to the diverse uncertainties in the physical real-world driving space. Specifically, parallel training first proposes a standard operating procedure for intelligent driving systems, namely the projection-emergence-convergence-operation (PECO) loop. Digital quadruplets for parallel training, i.e., physical, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive coaches, are also proposed. With the guidance of parallel training, virtual and real-world driving spaces are set up in parallel and interact frequently. They are closely linked and unified in opposition to each other, ultimately building a parallel driving system that fulfills safety, security, sustainability, sensitivity, service, and smartness (6S).

AB Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface. For various reasons, almost 95% of these areas remain unexplored. Underwater wireless communication (UWC) has widespread applications, including real-time aquatic data collection, naval surveillance, natural disaster prevention, archaeological expeditions, oil and gas exploration, shipwreck exploration, maritime security, and the monitoring of aquatic species and water contamination. The promising concept of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is having a great influence in several areas, for example, in small research facilities and average-sized harbors, as well as in huge unexplored areas of ocean. The IoUT has emerged as an innovative technology with the potential to develop a smart ocean. The IoUT framework integrates different underwater communication techniques such as optical, magnetic induction, and acoustic signals. It is capable of revolutionizing industrial projects, scientific research, and business. The key enabler technology for the IoUT is the underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN); however, at present, this is characterized by limitations in reliability, long propagation delays, high energy consumption, a dynamic topology, and limited bandwidth. This study examines the literature to identify potential challenges and risks, as well as mitigating solutions, associated with the IoUT. Our findings reveal that the key contributing elements to the challenges facing the IoUT are underwater communications, energy storage, latency, mobility, a lack of standardization, transmission media, transmission range, and energy constraints. Furthermore, we discuss several IoUT applications while highlighting potential future research directions.

TI YOLOv5s FMG: An Improved Small Target Detection Algorithm Based on
   YOLOv5 in Low Visibility
SO IEEE ACCESS

DE Small target detection; YOLOv5; SAHI; MCA; ghost bottleneck; low
   visibility
AB Accurate and real-time detection of small targets of pedestrians and cars in video images is indeed crucial for various applications such as autonomous driving and urban management. Existing detection algorithms face challenges related to small targets and low visibility, resulting in issues such as low accuracy, missed detection and reduced detection efficiency. This paper proposes an improved YOLOv5s FMG (Fine-tuning Slice, Multi-spectral Channel Attention, Ghost Bottleneck) detection method based on YOLOv5, which firstly introduces fine-tuning slicing aided hyper inference (SAHI) to generate small target objects by slicing the pictures into the network. Secondly, the multi-spectral channel attention (MCA) module is integrated into the feature extraction network, which enhances the information dissemination among features and strengthens the network's ability to distinguish between foreground and background. Then, the network uses the convolution network to extract features instead of the full connection layer and uses the lightweight Ghost Bottleneck instead of the bottleneck structure. Finally, the prediction part adopts the complete intersection over union (CIoU) loss function to achieve accurate bounding box regression. Based on the experimental results conducted on the self-made dataset, compared to YOLOv5s, the mAP (0.5) of YOLOv5s FMG on the dataset is improved by 9.3%, and the mAP (0.5:0.95) is improved by 2%. At the same time, the frames per second (FPS) is increased by 41.8%, and the number of parameters has been reduced by 18.5%. The proposed method demonstrates successful detection of small targets of pedestrians and vehicles, ensuring its effective applicability under conditions of low visibility.

AB Hydroacoustic surveys at the accretionary wedge southwest of Taiwan reveal a confined active hydrocarbon seepage area of similar to 49,000 m(2) in similar to 1350 m water depth on the northern crest of the Four-Way Closure Ridge, which we call Yam Seep. In this study, multibeam and side-scan sonar data acquired during surveys with an autonomous underwater vehicle during an expedition with R/V Ocean Researcher I in 2017 showed that the area is characterized by rough topography and high seafloor backscatter. Seafloor observations with a video sled and sediment sampling with gravity corers and the MeBo seafloor drill rig during an expedition with R/V SONNE in 2018 revealed that the area is almost entirely covered by intensely fractured methane-derived carbonates, which indicate that seepage has been ongoing for thousands of years. Hydroacoustic anomalies ('flares') in the water column indicated the presence of several gas bubble emission sites mostly at the center and eastern flank of the area in 2019. Drilling through massive carbonates in the northwestern part of Yam Seep induced free gas escape from a depth of similar to 5.1 m. This suggests the presence of gas hydrates in the subsurface as the seep area is located well within the gas hydrate stability zone. The inter-disciplinary investigations of the Yam Seep demonstrate that upward migration of light hydrocarbons and seafloor discharge has a considerable influence on the seabed properties.

AB As the most important part of a smart city and long-standing challenging issue, a highly efficient smart logistic system has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In particular, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are ideal solutions for last-mile delivery scenarios in recent years due to their fast speed and easy deployment. However, because of the highly automatic delivery process, UAVs are still constrained by the limited payload, battery, and computing capacity for complex computational tasks. With the aid of the mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, UAVs can offload computational tasks to the MEC computational resources in various types of IoT environments. In spite of the task offloading which can enhance their task process capability, it also brings extra overhead, such as data transfer time and energy consumption. These extra overheads may significantly impact the efficiency and payload of UAV-based delivery systems. Therefore, taking the UAV last-mile delivery system with MEC as an example, this article investigates the energy-aware multi-UAV task computation management problem according to a realistic autonomous delivery network (ADNET). Specifically, we propose a computation management strategy, namely, the MEC-based task offloading and scheduling strategy (TOSS), to provide an integral approach covering both the static task offloading and scheduling algorithm, as well as the dynamic resource conflict resolution algorithm. Grounded on real-world scenarios, our experimental results show that TOSS can achieve a higher payload for UAVs by using minimum energy consumption and task makespan within the given constraints of the deadline compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests that migrating animals store navigational "maps" in their brains, decoding location information from geomagnetic information based on their perception of the magnetic field. Inspired by this phenomenon, a novel geomagnetic inversion navigation framework was proposed to address the error constraint of a long-distance inertial navigation system. In the first part of the framework, the current paper proposed a geomagnetic bi-coordinate inversion localization approach which enables an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to estimate its current position from geomagnetic information like migrating animals. This paper suggests that the combination of geomagnetic total intensity (F) and geomagnetic inclination (I) can determine a unique geographical location, and that there is a non-unique mapping relationship between the geomagnetic parameters and the geographical coordination (longitude and latitude). Then the cumulative error of the inertial navigation system is corrected, according to the roughly estimated position information. In the second part of the framework, a cantilever beam model is proposed to realize the optimal correction of the INS historical trajectory. Finally, the correctness of the geomagnetic bi-coordinate inversion localization model we proposed was verified by outdoor physical experiments. In addition, we also completed a geomagnetic/inertial navigation integrated long-distance semi-physical test based on the real navigation information of the AUV. The results show that the geomagnetic inversion navigation framework proposed in this paper can constrain long-distance inertial navigation errors and improve the navigation accuracy by 73.28% compared with the pure inertial navigation mode. This implies that the geomagnetic inversion localization will play a key role in long-distance AUV navigation correction.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), which applies light in the formation of a pulsed laser to estimate the distance between the LiDAR sensor and objects, is an effective remote sensing technology. Many applications use LiDAR including autonomous vehicles, robotics, and virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR). The 3D point cloud classification is now a hot research topic with the evolution of LiDAR technology. This research aims to provide a high performance and compatible real-world data method for 3D point cloud classification. More specifically, we introduce a novel framework for 3D point cloud classification, namely, GSV-NET, which uses Gaussian Supervector and enhancing region representation. GSV-NET extracts and combines both global and regional features of the 3D point cloud to further enhance the information of the point cloud features for the 3D point cloud classification. Firstly, we input the Gaussian Supervector description into a 3D wide-inception convolution neural network (CNN) structure to define the global feature. Secondly, we convert the regions of the 3D point cloud into color representation and capture region features with a 2D wide-inception network. These extracted features are inputs of a 1D CNN architecture. We evaluate the proposed framework on the point cloud dataset: ModelNet and the LiDAR dataset: Sydney. The ModelNet dataset was developed by Princeton University (New Jersey, United States), while the Sydney dataset was created by the University of Sydney (Sydney, Australia). Based on our numerical results, our framework achieves more accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB This paper presents a method to build a semantic map to assist an underwater vehicle-manipulator system in performing intervention tasks autonomously in a submerged man-made pipe structure. The method is based on the integration of feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and 3D object recognition using a database of a priori known objects. The robot uses Doppler velocity log (DVL), pressure, and attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) sensors for navigation and is equipped with a laser scanner providing non-coloured 3D point clouds of the inspected structure in real time. The object recognition module recognises the pipes and objects within the scan and passes them to the SLAM, which adds them to the map if not yet observed. Otherwise, it uses them to correct the map and the robot navigation if they were already mapped. The SLAM provides a consistent map and a drift-less navigation. Moreover, it provides a global identifier for every observed object instance and its pipe connectivity. This information is fed back to the object recognition module, where it is used to estimate the object classes using Bayesian techniques over the set of those object classes which are compatible in terms of pipe connectivity. This allows fusing of all the already available object observations to improve recognition. The outcome of the process is a semantic map made of pipes connected through valves, elbows and tees conforming to the real structure. Knowing the class and the position of objects will enable high-level manipulation commands in the near future.</p>

AB Currently, researchers have motivated a vision of 6G for empowering the new generation of the Internet of Everything (IoE) services that are not supported by 5G. In the context of 6G, more computing resources are required, a problem that is dealt with by Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, due to the dynamic change of service demands from various locations, the limitation of available computing resources of MEC, and the increase in the number and complexity of IoE services, intelligent resource provisioning for multiple applications is vital. To address this challenging issue, we propose in this paper IScaler, a novel intelligent and proactive IoE resource scaling and service placement solution. IScaler is tailored for MEC and benefits from the new advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Multiple requirements are considered in the design of IScaler's Markov Decision Process. These requirements include the prediction of the resource usage of scaled applications, the prediction of available resources by hosting servers, performing combined horizontal and vertical scaling, as well as making service placement decisions. The use of DRL to solve this problem raises several challenges that prevent the realization of IScaler's full potential, including exploration errors and long learning time. These challenges are tackled by proposing an architecture that embeds an Intelligent Scaling and Placement module (ISP). ISP utilizes IScaler and an optimizer based on heuristics as a bootstrapper and backup. Finally, we use the Google Cluster Usage Trace dataset to perform real-life simulations and illustrate the effectiveness of IScaler's multi-application autonomous resource provisioning.

TI LDNet: End-to-End Lane Marking Detection Approach Using a Dynamic Vision
   Sensor
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

DE Lane marking detection; event camera; attention network
ID TRACKING; SYSTEM
AB Modern vehicles are equipped with various driver-assistance systems, including automatic lane keeping, which prevents unintended lane departures. Traditional lane detection methods incorporate handcrafted or deep learning-based features followed by postprocessing techniques for lane extraction using frame-based RGB cameras. The utilization of frame-based RGB cameras for lane detection tasks is prone to illumination variations, sun glare, and motion blur, which limits the performance of lane detection methods. Incorporating an event camera for lane detection tasks in the perception stack of autonomous driving is one of the most promising solutions for mitigating challenges encountered by frame-based RGB cameras. The main contribution of this work is the design of the lane marking detection model, which employs the dynamic vision sensor. This paper explores the novel application of lane marking detection using an event camera by designing a convolutional encoder followed by the attention-guided decoder. The spatial resolution of the encoded features is retained by a dense atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) block. The additive attention mechanism in the decoder improves performance for high dimensional input encoded features that promote lane localization and relieve postprocessing computation. The efficacy of the proposed work is evaluated using the DVS dataset for lane extraction (DET). The experimental results show a significant improvement of 5.54% and 5.03% in F1 scores in multiclass and binary-class lane marking detection tasks. Additionally, the intersection over union (IoU) scores of the proposed method surpass those of the best-performing state-of-the-art method by 6.50% and 9.37% in multiclass and binary-class tasks, respectively.

AB The proliferation of low-cost GNSS hardware smartphones providing multi-constellation, multi-frequency carrier-phase and pseudorange measurements for the Android platform offer an avenue for Precise Point Positioning (PPP) GNSS use in recent years. However, smartphone PPP is restricted due to high multipath effects and signal loss leading to metre-level accuracy and longer convergence time compared against professional-grade GNSS receivers. Proven by previous research, the combination of ionospheric constraints and receiver differential code bias (DCB) estimation is an efficient approach to improve PPP solution initialization. Therefore, this study analyzes the performance improvements by applying ionospheric constraints (IC) to PPP in comparison to conventional PPP solutions for different grades of GNSS receivers (geodetic, low-cost, and smartphone hardware) in open-sky and suburban environments. The results reveal that smartphone PPP enjoys more beneficial effects from ionospheric constraints (IC) than low-cost and geodetic hardware, as a significant 30% improvement in horizontal rms is observed in the first epoch of examined datasets, and a 57% improvement in the first 20 min of data collection. For low-cost and geodetic equipment, the first epoch improvement is only 21% and 18%, respectively. Furthermore, a 44% convergence time reduction for smartphone PPP-IC is observed to attain 1 m level of horizontal accuracy. Based on these investigations, PPP-IC can provide greater impact for those lowquality measurements before convergence, showing potential in achieving fast initialization and accurate positioning within a short time for autonomous vehicles, precision agriculture, and smartphone location-based services.

AB This article proposes an optimal-distributed control protocol for multivehicle systems with an unknown switching communication graph. The optimal-distributed control problem is formulated to differential graphical games, and the Pareto optimum to multiplayer games is sought based on the viability theory and reinforcement learning techniques. The viability theory characterizes the controllability of a wide range of constrained nonlinear systems; and the viability kernel and the capture basin are the pillars of the viability theory. The capture basin is the set of all initial states, in which there exist control strategies that enable the states to reach the target in finite time while remaining inside a set before reaching the target. In this regard, the feasible learning region is characterized by the reinforcement learner. In addition, the approximation of the capture basin provides the learner with prior knowledge. Unlike the existing works that employ the viability theory to solve control problems with only one agent and differential games with only two players, the viability theory, in this article, is utilized to solve multiagent control problems and multiplayer differential games. The distributed control law is composed of two parts: 1) the approximation of the capture basin and 2) reinforcement learning, which are computed offline and online, respectively. The convergence properties of the parameters' estimation errors in reinforcement learning are proved, and the convergence of the control policy to the Pareto optimum of the differential graphical game is discussed. The guaranteed approximation results of the capture basin are provided and the simulation results of the differential graphical game are provided for multivehicle systems with the proposed distributed control policy.

AB Robust traffic sign detection and recognition (TSDR) is of paramount importance for the successful realization of autonomous vehicle technology. The importance of this task has led to vast amount of research efforts and many promising methods have been proposed in the existing literature. However, most of these methods have been evaluated on clean and challenge-free datasets and overlooked the performance deterioration associated with different challenging conditions (CCs) that obscure the traffic-sign images captured in the wild. In this paper, we look at the TSDR problem under CCs and focus on the performance degradation associated with them. To this end, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based prior enhancement focused TSDR framework. Our modular approach consists of a CNN-based challenge classifier, Enhance-Net-an encoder-decoder CNN architecture for image enhancement, and two separate CNN architectures for sign-detection and classification. We propose a novel training pipeline for Enhance-Net that focuses on the enhancement of the traffic sign regions (instead of the whole image) in the challenging images subject to their accurate detection. We used CURE-TSD dataset consisting of traffic videos captured under different CCs to evaluate the efficacy of our approach. We experimentally show that our method obtains an overall precision and recall of 91.1% and 70.71% that is 7.58% and 35.90% improvement in precision and recall, respectively, compared to the current benchmark. Furthermore, we compare our approach with different CNN-based TSDR methods and show that our approach outperforms them by a large margin.

AB In this tutorial paper, we systematically present the fundamental operating principles and analytical details of the discrete Fourier transform based signal processing techniques for the TDM MIMO FMCW millimeter-wave (mmWave) automotive radars. The mmWave radars provide a key sensing capability to support safety features of the conventional and autonomous vehicles. Automotive radar sensors are used to detect presence and location of the objects of interest to derive comprehensive and accurate knowledge of road conditions and surrounding environments. Automotive radars are subjected to an increasing demand to provide high-resolution measurements in the range-Doppler-azimuth-elevation domains. Therefore, the current state-of-the-art automotive radars commonly employ MIMO technologies, resulting in a large block of multidimensional data to process in real time through a long chain of signal processing algorithms. Detailed coverage on the fundamental radar signal processing techniques are scattered in a large body of literature for classical radar systems. Currently, there is no tutorial available that covers the technical details of the latest TDM MIMO FMCW radar technology, making it extremely hard for new researchers in the field of automotive mmWave radars. This paper contains sufficient technical details to serve as a tutorial. It can help lay a solid analytical foundation to facilitate exploration and development of advanced radar signal processing techniques for automotive applications. The algorithmic details and analytical results presented in this paper can be readily applied to both real-time implementation and post-processing. Simulation and experimental results are presented in this paper to validate analytical derivations and to demonstrate the capabilities of the TDM MIMO radar sensor in practical implementations.

AB A multiscale magnetic survey of the northern basin of Yellowstone Lake was undertaken in 2016 as part of the Hydrothermal Dynamics of Yellowstone Lake Project (HD-YLAKE)-a broad research effort to characterize the cause-and-effect relationships between geologic and environmental processes and hydrothermal activity on the lake floor. The magnetic survey includes lake surface, regional aeromagnetic, and near-bottom autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) data. The study reveals a strong contrast between the northeastern lake basin, characterized by a regional magnetic low punctuated by stronger local magnetic lows, many of which host hydrothermal vent activity, and the northwestern lake basin with higher-amplitude magnetic anomalies and no obvious hydrothermal activity or punctuated magnetic lows. The boundary between these two regions is marked by a steep gradient in heat flow and magnetic values, likely reflecting a significant structure within the currently active similar to 20-km-long Eagle Bay-Lake Hotel fault zone that may be related to the similar to 2.08-Ma Huckleberry Ridge caldera rim. Modeling suggests that the broad northeastern magnetic low reflects both a shallower Curie isotherm and widespread hydrothermal activity that has demagnetized the rock. Along the western lake shoreline are sinuous-shaped, high-amplitude magnetic anomaly highs, interpreted as lava flow fronts of upper units of the West Thumb rhyolite. The AUV magnetic survey shows decreased magnetization at the periphery of the active Deep Hole hydrothermal vent. We postulate that lower magnetization in the outer zone results from enhanced hydrothermal alteration of rhyolite by hydrothermal condensates while the vapor-dominated center of the vent is less altered.

AB The world is rapidly changing and the future is uncertain, yet until recently the dominant assumption of the local passenger transport community has been that the existing modal landscape of cars, buses and taxis will remain much as it is now. Such a view is now shifting however, with decision makers now appreciating the need to understand the implications of potentially radical changes in the technological, political, economic, social and environmental spheres. Accordingly, in August 2015 the Public Transport 2045 study was commissioned to consider how different local public transport futures might affect society over the next 30-years, and at how governments might best respond.
   The multi-phase study was based on individual in-depth interviews with 50 senior local passenger transport operators, government officials, lobbyists and experts from New Zealand and around the world; and four validation workshops with 28 sector stakeholders. The data was analysed using mostly pre-determined themes from which four scenarios were constructed and then validated. The implications are that the local passenger transport system is about to transition to a system of 'shared mobility'; public transport will need to evolve to stay relevant but will remain important in any scenario; and the role of Government will be vital in overseeing the transition to the shared mobility era. These lessons are now being used to inform transport and broader policy decisions across New Zealand. Overall, the study is the first to apply such a global and qualitatively rich dataset to view the long-term future local passenger transport system as a whole.

   MISSION
AB Geomagnetic data gathering by micro-rovers is gaining momentum both for future planetary exploration missions and for terrestrial applications in extreme environments. This paper presents research into the integration of a planetary micro-rover with a potassium total-field magnetometer. The 40 kg Kapvik micro-rover is an ideal platform due to an aluminium construction and a rocker-bogie mobility system, which provides good manoeuvrability and terrainability. A light-weight GSMP 35U (uninhabited aerial vehicle) magnetometer, comprised of a 0.65 kg sensor and 0.63 kg electronics module, was mounted to the chassis via a custom 1.21 m composite boom. The boom dimensions were optimized to be an effective compromise between noise mitigation and mechanical practicality. An analysis using the fourth difference method was performed estimating the magnetic noise envelope at +/- 0.03 nT at 10 Hz sampling frequency from the integrated systems during robotic operations. A robotic magnetic survey captured the total magnetic intensity along three parallel 40 m long lines and a perpendicular 15 m long tie line over the course of 3.75 h. The total magnetic intensity data were corrected for diurnal variations, levelled by linear interpolation of tie-line intersection points, corrected for a regional gradient, and then interpolated using Delaunay triangulation to lead a residual magnetic intensity map. This map exhibited an anomalous linear feature corresponding to a magnetic dipole 650 nT in amplitude. This feature coincides with a storm sewer buried approximately 2 m in the subsurface. This work provides benchmark methodologies and data to guide future integration of magnetometers on board planetary micro-rovers.

AB Group formation in animals is a widespread phenomenon driven by food acquisition, reproduction, and defense. Life in the ocean is characteristically aggregated into horizontally extensive layers as a result of strong vertical gradients in the environment. Each day, animals in high biomass aggregations called deep scattering layers migrate vertically, comprising the largest net animal movement on earth. This movement is commonly thought of as a predator avoidance tactic, however, the aggregation of animals into layers has been viewed as an incidental outcome of similar responses by many individuals to the risk of visual predation coupled with the location of resources including food and oxygen rather than active, socially mediated congregation for defense purposes. Here, using a newly adapted autonomous vehicle to measure individual characteristics, we provide the first measures of the internal layer structure, demonstrating that these features are made up of many topologically scaled, mono-specific aggregations, or schools rather than an indiscriminate mix of sizes and species. Schools responded to predators using behavior much like flash compression while neighboring aggregations increased their spacing to maintain coherent layers. Rather than simply an incidental outcome, the formation of layers of life in the sea is a highly organized process driven, at least in part, by biotic pressures for cohesion with broad adaptive significance for the myriad species that inhabit these ubiquitous features. These observations highlight the range of spatial scales we must examine in order to understand the strong impacts these high-biomass layers have on ecological and biogeochemical processes in the sea.

TI Decentralized position verification in geographic <i>ad hoc</i> routing
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE VANET; security; routing; position verification
AB Inter-vehicle communication is regarded as one of the major applications of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Compared to MANETs or wireless sensor networks (WSNs), these so-called vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have unique requirements on network protocols. The requirements result mainly from node mobility and the demands of position-dependent applications. On the routing layer, those requirements are well met by geographic routing protocols. Functional research on geographic routing has already reached a considerable level, whereas security aspects have only been recently taken into account. Position information dissemination has been identified as being crucial for geographic routing since forged position information has severe impact regarding both performance and security.
   In this work, we first summarize the problems that arise from falsified position data. We then propose a framework that contains different detection mechanisms in order to mitigate or lessen these problems. Our developed mechanisms are capable of recognizing nodes cheating about their position in beacons (periodic position dissemination in most single-path geographic routing protocols, e.g., GPSR). Unlike other proposals described in the literature, our detection system does not rely on additional hardware or special nodes, which would contradict the ad hoc approach. Instead, we use a number of different independent sensors to quickly give an estimation of the trustworthiness of other nodes' position claims. The different sensors run either autonomously on every single node, or they require cooperation between neighboring nodes.
   The simulation evaluation proves that the combination of autonomous and cooperative position verification mechanisms successfully discloses most nodes disseminating false position information, and thereby widely prevents attacks using position cheating. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In the deterministic formulation, two problems are considered related to the generation of admissible reference actions for the automatic control of an autonomous mobile robot in the problem of path following stabilization. The first problem is the restoration of the derivatives of the reference vector signal without its analytical description. This signal sets the realizable trajectory for the robot. An easy-to-tune dynamic differentiator with piecewise linear corrective actions is proposed to solve that problem. The differentiator is constructed as a copy of the virtual canonical model with unknown input and provides an estimation of derivatives of any required order with any given accuracy. The second problem is the smoothing of composite spatial trajectories. For solution, a dynamic generator is presented. It is constructed as a copy of the motion equations of a specific robot. A decomposition procedure for the synthesis of S-shaped smooth and bounded corrective actions of the generator is developed. In the generator, a reference non-smooth vector signal is used to describe the path of the robot in the first approximation. For tuning the generator, the constraints on the state variables and controls of a specific robot are taken into account. It produces smooth output signals, as well as their derivatives, realizable by a particular robot. These algorithms can be implemented both at the planning stage and in real time since they do not require large computational costs. Their effectiveness is verified by numerical simulation for the movement of the center of mass of an unmanned aerial vehicle.

AB Weather forecasting plays a fundamental role in the early warning of weather impacts on various aspects of human livelihood. For instance, weather forecasting provides decision making support for autonomous vehicles to reduce traffic accidents and congestions, which completely depend on the sensing and predicting of external environmental factors such as rainfall, air visibility and so on. Accurate and timely weather prediction has always been the goal of meteorological scientists. However, the conventional theory-driven numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods face many challenges, such as incomplete understanding of physical mechanisms, difficulties in obtaining useful knowledge from the deluge of observation data, and the requirement of powerful computing resources. With the successful application of data-driven deep learning method in various fields, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and time series prediction, it has been proven that deep learning method can effectively mine the temporal and spatial features from the spatio-temporal data. Meteorological data is a typical big geospatial data. Deep learning-based weather prediction (DLWP) is expected to be a strong supplement to the conventional method. At present, many researchers have tried to introduce data-driven deep learning into weather forecasting, and have achieved some preliminary results. In this paper, we survey the stateof-the-art studies of deep learning-based weather forecasting, in the aspects of the design of neural network (NN) architectures, spatial and temporal scales, as well as the datasets and benchmarks. Then we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of DLWP by comparing it with the conventional NWP, and summarize the potential future research topics of DLWP. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB In the advent of becoming reality, the era of autonomous vehicles is closer than ever, and with it, the need for faster and reliable wireless connections. The propagation channel determines the performance limits of wireless communications, and with the aid of empirical measurements, channel modeling is the best approach to predict and recreate how signal propagation conditions may perform. To this end, many different approaches and techniques have been implemented, from specific applications to general models, considering the characteristics of the environment (geometry-based or non-geometry-based) as well as seeking high performance algorithms in order to achieve good balance between accuracy and computational cost. This paper provides an updated overview of propagation channel models for vehicular communications, beginning with some specific propagation characteristics of these complex heterogeneous environments in terms of diverse communication scenarios, different combinations of link types, antenna placement/diversity, potentially high Doppler shifts, or non-stationarity, among others. The presented channel models are classified in four categories: empirical, non-geometry-based stochastic, geometry-based stochastic, and deterministic models, following the classical approach. The features and key concepts of the different vehicular communications channel models are presented, from sub 6 GHz to millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands. The advantages and disadvantages of the main works in the area are discussed and compared in a comprehensive way, outlining their contributions. Finally, future critical challenges and research directions for modeling reliable vehicular communications are introduced, such as the effects of vegetation, pedestrians, common scatterers, micro-mobility or spherical wavefront, which in the context of the near future are presented as research opportunities.

AB Small robotic vehicles have been navigating agricultural fields in the pursuit of new possibilities to increase agricultural production and to meet the increasing food and energetic demands. However, a perception system with reliable awareness of the surroundings remains a challenge to achieve autonomous navigation. Camera and single-layer laser scanners have been the primary sources of information, yet the first suffers from outdoor light sensibility and both from occlusion by leaves. This paper describes a three-dimensional system acquisition for corn crops. The sensing core is a single-layer UTM30-LX laser scanner rotating around its axis, while an inertial sensor provides angular measurements. With the rotation, multiple layers are used to compose a 3D point cloud, which is represented by a two-dimensional occupancy grid. Each cell is filled according to the number of readings, and their weights derive from two procedures: firstly, a mask enhances vertical entities (stalks); secondly, two Gaussian functions on the expected position of the immediate neighboring rows weaken readings in the middle of the lane and farther rows. The resulting occupancy grid allows the representation of the cornrows by virtual walls, which are used as references to a wall follower algorithm. According to experimental results, the virtual walls are segmented with reduced influence from straying leaves and sparse weeds when compared to the segmentation done with single-layer laser scanner data. Indeed, 64.02% of 3D outputs are within 0.05 m limit error from expected lane width, while only 11.63% of single-layer laser data are within same limit.

AB Acoustic telemetry, in which transmitters projecting ultrasonic signals carrying unique identification codes are deployed on marine and aquatic animals and detected and logged by acoustic receivers, is becoming a common tool in fisheries science. Collaboration among researchers using this technology has led to the development of telemetry networks that are capable of detecting transmitters at coastwide and even continental scales through the combined coverage of all members' receivers. Two grassroots telemetry networks in the northwest Atlantic and Caribbean, the Atlantic Cooperative Telemetry (ACT) Network and the FACT Network, began as small-scale efforts among neighboring researchers and have expanded to include shared databases of tagged animals along entire coastlines. A third telemetry network, the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), has brought additional capacity to the ACT and FACT networks and has provided a focus for telemetry activities in Canadian waters. It has also improved the power and efficiency of telemetry research globally through collaborative, standardized methods for storing, sharing, and processing data. When used in combination with other data collected by traditional fishery research methods and emerging technologies, such as remote sensing and autonomous vehicles, data collected through acoustic telemetry networks can address fundamental but previously unanswered questions about key habitat areas and data-poor species and can yield new insights into the ecology of species that are thought to be well known. Here, we provide an overview of acoustic telemetry networks, including a history of the ACT Network, FACT Network, and OTN and a review of recent and current research that has been made possible through the connections enabled by these networks.

TI Tracking Air-Sea Exchange and Upper-Ocean Variability in the
   Indonesian-Australian Basin during the Onset of the 2018/19 Australian

AB Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) north of Australia in the Indonesian-Australian Basin are significantly influenced by Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), an eastward-moving atmospheric disturbance that traverses the globe in the tropics. The region also has large-amplitude diurnal SST variations, which may influence the air-sea heat and moisture fluxes, that provide feedback to the MJO evolution. During the 2018/19 austral summer, a field campaign aiming to better understand the influences of air-sea coupling on the MJO was conducted north of Australia in the Indonesian-Australian Basin. Surface meteorology from buoy observations and upper-ocean data from autonomous fast-profiling float observations were collected. Two MJO convective phases propagated eastward across the region in mid-December 2018 and late January 2019 and the second MJO was in conjunction with a tropical cyclone development. Observations showed that SST in the region was rather sensitive to the MJO forcing. Air-sea heat fluxes warmed the SST throughout the 2018/19 austral summer, punctuated by the MJO activities, with a 2 degrees-3 degrees C drop in SST during the two MJO events. Substantial diurnal SST variations during the suppressed phases of the MJOs were observed, and the near-surface thermal stratifications provided positive feedback for the peak diurnal SST amplitude, which may be a mechanism to influence the MJO evolution. Compared to traditionally vessel-based observation programs, we have relied on fast-profiling floats as the main vehicle in measuring the upper-ocean variability from diurnal to the MJO time scales, which may pave the way for using cost-effective technology in similar process studies.

TI UAVid: A semantic segmentation dataset for UAV imagery

DE UAV; Semantic segmentation; Deep learning; Dataset
ID LIDAR
AB Semantic segmentation has been one of the leading research interests in computer vision recently. It serves as a perception foundation for many fields, such as robotics and autonomous driving. The fast development of semantic segmentation attributes enormously to the large scale datasets, especially for the deep learning related methods. There already exist several semantic segmentation datasets for comparison among semantic segmentation methods in complex urban scenes, such as the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, where the side views of the objects are captured with a camera mounted on the driving car. There also exist semantic labeling datasets for the airborne images and the satellite images, where the nadir views of the objects are captured. However, only a few datasets capture urban scenes from an oblique Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective, where both of the top view and the side view of the objects can be observed, providing more information for object recognition. In this paper, we introduce our UAVid dataset, a new high-resolution UAV semantic segmentation dataset as a complement, which brings new challenges, including large scale variation, moving object recognition and temporal consistency preservation. Our UAV dataset consists of 30 video sequences capturing high-resolution images in oblique views. In total, 300 images have been densely labeled with 8 classes for the semantic labeling task. We have provided several deep learning baseline methods with pre-training, among which the proposed Multi-Scale-Dilation net performs the best via multi-scale feature extraction, reaching a mean intersection-over-union (IoU) score around 50%. We have also explored the influence of spatial-temporal regularization for sequence data by leveraging on feature space optimization (FSO) and 3D conditional random field (CRF). Our UAVid website and the labeling tool have been published online (https://uavid.nl/).

TI Densities and drivers of sea turtle populations across Pacific coral
   reef ecosystems
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID MARINE TURTLES; R PACKAGE; CONSERVATION; TEMPERATURE
AB Sea turtle populations are often assessed at the regional to sub-basin scale from discrete indices of nesting abundance. While this may be practical and sometimes effective, widespread in-water surveys may enhance assessments by including additional demographics, locations, and revealing emerging population trends. Here, we describe sea turtle observations from 13 years of towed-diver surveys across 53 coral islands, atolls, and reefs in the Central, West, and South Pacific. These surveys covered more than 7,300 linear km, and observed more than 3,400 green (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) sea turtles. From these data, we estimated sea turtle densities, described trends across space and time, and modelled the influence of environmental and anthropogenic drivers. Both species were patchily distributed across spatial scales, and green turtles were 11 times more abundant than hawksbills. The Pacific Remote Island Areas had the highest densities of greens (3.62 turtles km(-1), Jarvis Island), while American Samoa had the most hawksbills (0.12 turtles km(-1), Ta'u Island). The Hawaiian Islands had the lowest turtle densities (island ave = 0.07 turtles km(-1)) yet the highest annual population growth (mu = 0.08, sigma = 0.22), suggesting extensive management protections can yield positive conservation results. Densities peaked at 27.5 degrees C SST, in areas of high productivity and low human impact, and were consistent with patterns of historic overexploitation. Though such intensive surveys have great value, they are logistically demanding and therefore have an uncertain budget and programmatic future. We hope the methods we described here may be applied to future comparatively low-cost surveys either with autonomous vehicles or with environmental DNA.

AB The integration of the Accelerometer and Magnetometer (AM) provides continuous, stable and accurate attitude information for land-vehicle navigation without magnetic distortion and external acceleration. However, magnetic disturbance and linear acceleration strongly degrade the overall system performance. As an important complement, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) produces the heading estimates, thus it can potentially benefit the AM system. Such a GNSS/AM system for attitude estimation is mathematically converted to a multi-observation vector pairs matching problem in this paper. The optimal and sub-optimal attitude determination and their time-varying recursive variants are all comprehensively investigated and discussed. The developed methods are named as the Optimal Linear Estimator of Quaternion (OLEQ), Suboptimal-OLEQ (SOLEQ) and Recursive-OLEQ (ROLEQ) for different application scenarios. The theory is established based on our previous contributions, and the multi-vector matrix multiplications are decomposed with the eigenvalue factorization. Some analytical results are proven and given, which provides the reader with a brand new viewpoint of the attitude determination and its evolution. With the derivations of the two-vector case, the n-vector case is then naturally formed. Simulations are carried out showing the advantages of the accuracy, robustness and time consumption of the proposed OLEQs, compared with representative methods. The algorithms are then implemented using the C++ programming language on the designed hardware with a GNSS module, three-axis accelerometer and three-axis magnetometer, giving an effective validation of them in real-world applications. The designed schemes have proven their fast speed and good accuracy in these verification scenarios.

AB In many types of space mission there is a constant desire for larger and larger instrument apertures, primarily for the purposes of increased resolution or sensitivity. In the Radio Frequency domain, this is currently addressed by antennas that unfold or deploy on-orbit. However, in the optical and infrared domains, this is a significantly more challenging problem, and has up to now either been addressed by simply having large monolithic mirrors (which are fundamentally limited by the volume and mass lifting capacity of any launch vehicle) or by complex 'semi-folding' designs such as the James Webb Space Telescope. An alternative is to consider a fractionated instrument which is launched as a collection of individual smaller elements which are then assembled (or self-assemble) once in space, to form a much larger overall instrument. SSTL has been performing early concept assessment work on such systems for high resolution science observations from high orbits (potentially also for persistent surveillance of Earth). A point design of a 25 m sparse aperture (annular ring) telescope is presented. Key characteristics of 1) multiple small elements launched separately and 2) on-orbit assembly to form a larger instrument are included in the architecture. However, on-orbit assembly brings its own challenges in terms of guidance navigation and control, robotics, docking mechanisms, system control and data handling, optical alignment and stability, and many other elements. The number and type of launchers used, and the technologies and systems used heavily affect the outcome and general cost of the telescope. The paper describes one of the fractionated architecture concepts currently being studied by SSTL, including the key technologies and operational concepts that may be possible in the future.

AB Electrical and fibre-optic cable connector assemblies are often required to operate under the very harsh environmental conditions experienced in the offshore oil and gas industry and on ships, autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated systems. These assemblies are frequently the source of failure and so must be sealed, mostly at the metal connector-to-cable interface. This is normally achieved using a polyurethane (PU) encapsulant system that bonds at the interface between the metal connector back shell and the cable. In environments where sacrificial anodes are used, however, cable connector assemblies are prone to cathodic delamination (CD, oxygen reduction increasing OH- concentration at the PU/metal interface), which can compromise PU-to-metal bonds causing failure. Materials that are resistant to CD failure are therefore highly desirable. New EC REACH legislation has further regulated the use of hazardous chemicals in the production and use of polymers. New, compliant materials have emerged, although lack well-established performance testing. Hence, in this work, stainless steel 316L, bronze CW451K, titanium Ti6Al4V, PU and commercially available primers (PR24 and PR91) were used to investigate CD failures in cable connector assemblies and galvanic coupling effects. Data obtained from long-term sea raft exposure trials and flowing natural sea water tank tests were used, for the first time, to validate short-term accelerated laboratory salt-spray testing of these materials. The failure rate due to CD was observed to decrease in the order: electrochemical potential>polymeric system>metal substrate, strongly suggesting that electrochemical potential has the most dominant effect on CD failure rates.

AB Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) interferometry can provide very high resolution images and topographic maps of the seafloor over large swaths. Processing of interferometric data to retrieve reliable depth estimates of the seafloor is, however, nontrivial. Traditional narrowband interferometry processing relies on advanced phase unwrapping techniques, constraints, and prior knowledge to resolve phase ambiguities. These methods all have dependencies throughout the dataset, e. g., a small error in the assumption may cause a global error in the final phase estimate. For wideband systems, there are alternative techniques to estimate the absolute (or ambiguity-free) phase difference directly. We consider four different wideband interferometry techniques for direct phase difference estimation: complex cross correlation, split-spectrum algorithm, and the multichromatic approach. In addition, we develop a weighted split-spectrum algorithm, where the weights minimize the variance in the absolute phase estimate. We benchmark these techniques on simulated data and demonstrate the techniques on real data from the HISAS wideband interferometric SAS on a HUGIN autonomous underwater vehicle. We have found the following: the cross correlation technique always outperforms the other techniques in misregistrated areas caused by severe topographic changes. The split spectrum techniques are substantially faster than the cross correlation technique. The multichromatic approach has similar performance as the multiband split spectrum technique for the same choice of bands. We demonstrate that all the wideband interferometry techniques outperform a standard Goldstein's Branch cut phase unwrapping algorithm on real data from a complicated scene containing an elevated target and severe layover.

AB Real-time Kinematic (RTK) positioning provides centimeter-level positioning accuracy within several seconds, but it has to rely on a nearby base station. Although Precise Point Positioning (PPP) supplies precise positions with one receiver, its convergence time takes several tens of minutes, which makes PPP not well suited for real-time kinematic applications where a rapid convergence is required. PPP-RTK integrates the benefits of PPP and RTK, which actually is PPP augmented by a ground GNSS network. The satellite orbit, clock offsets, signal biases, ionospheric and tropospheric corrections are determined based on this GNSS network, modeled as state space information and transmitted to PPP users. By applying these State Space Representation (SSR) corrections, a real-time kinematic PPP-RTK approach is developed and implemented, which can instantly resolve the ambiguities to integers and realize rapid convergence. In a static scenario, it realized an instant ambiguity resolution and a rapid convergence within 2 s in more than 90% of 120 hourly sessions. The PPP-RTK has been applied and evaluated in a kinematic scenario on the highway. The horizontal positioning errors are almost lower than 0.1 m except for the time of passing through bridges. After passing bridges, the PPP-RTK successfully resolved ambiguities within 2 s in 90.6% of the cases and achieved convergence in horizontal within 5 s in more than 90% of the cases. The PPP-RTK with a precision of 0.1 m and rapid convergence of several seconds benefits the precise navigation of automobile on the highway, which will support the development of autonomous driving in future.

AB Site-specific weed management (on the scale of a few meters or less) has the potential to greatly reduce pesticide use and its associated environmental and economic costs. A prerequisite for site-specific weed management is the availability of accurate maps of the weed population that can be generated quickly and cheaply. Improvements and cost reductions in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and camera technology mean these tools are now readily available for agricultural use. We used UAVs to collect aerial images captured in both RGB and multispectral formats of 12 cereal fields (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] and barley [Hordeum vulgare L.]) across eastern England. These data were used to train machine learning models to generate prediction maps of locations of black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.), a prolific weed in UK cereal fields. We tested machine learning and data set resampling methods to obtain the most accurate system for predicting the presence and absence of weeds in new out-of-sample fields. The accuracy of the system in predicting the absence of A. myosuroides is 69% and its presence above 5 g in weight with 77% accuracy in new out-of-sample fields. This system generates prediction maps that can be used by either agricultural machinery or autonomous robotic platforms for precision weed management. Improvements to the accuracy can be made by increasing the number of fields and samples in the data set and the length of time over which data are collected to gather data across the entire growing season.

AB Path planning and obstacle avoidance in 3D terrain have been identified as a monumental challenge for a UAV in a variety of autonomous missions, such as disaster management, and search and rescue operations. In large terrain areas, it is a key problem for traditional approaches to search within the point-cloud maps to find a global path for a UAV considering the flight safety, maneuverability, weather constraints, and fuel cost. Hence, this paper proposes a trajectory planning technique for global and local path planning of a fixed-wing UAV above 3D terrain under static and dynamic constraints. For global path generation, a novel feature selection-based decision model has been proposed to select the features of a point-cloud map and transform them into the feature set. The feature set is utilized by an A* multi-directional planner with an extensive search area to deliver an optimal global path. The global path is assumed as the UAV's reference waypoints. The motion of the UAV on reference waypoints is simplified with two coordinates (R, d), where R is the cumulative distance covered by the UAV along the reference waypoints and d is its offset distance from the reference line segment in time t. For the local path planning, offset trajectories are generated along with reference waypoints to avoid collisions. Cost functions have been added so that the best global and local path can be chosen, taking into account altitude, weather, and fuel constraints. The simulation results and comparison show that the proposed approach outperforms various other 3D UAV path planning techniques in complex terrain.

AB The understanding of roads and lanes incorporates identifying the level of the road, the position and count of lanes, and ending, splitting, and merging roads and lanes in highway, rural, and urban scenarios. Even though a large amount of progress has been made recently, this kind of understanding is ahead of the accomplishments of the present perceptual methods. Nowadays, 3D lane detection has become the trending research in autonomous vehicles, which shows an exact estimation of the 3D position of the drivable lanes. This work mainly aims at proposing a new technique with Phase I (road or non-road classification) and Phase II (lane or non-lane classification) with 3D images. Phase I: Initially, the features, such as the proposed local texton XOR pattern (LTXOR), local Gabor binary pattern histogram sequence (LGBPHS), and median ternary pattern (MTP), are derived. These features are subjected to the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BI-GRU) that detects whether the object is road or non-road. Phase II: Similar features in Phase I are further classified using the optimized BI-GRU, where the weights are chosen optimally via self-improved honey badger optimization (SI-HBO). As a result, the system can be identified, and whether it is lane-related or not. Particularly, the proposed BI-GRU + SI-HBO obtained a higher precision of 0.946 for db 1. Furthermore, the best-case accuracy for the BI-GRU + SI-HBO was 0.928, which was better compared with honey badger optimization. Finally, the development of SI-HBO was proven to be better than the others.

AB The two-wheeler (TW) is a popular means of transportation in China, but TWs often suffer from serious traffic crashes because of their highly flexible trajectory and low detectability. Therefore, they present a challenge for the sensing and decision-making systems in autonomous vehicles (AVs). Collision avoidance systems, such as automatic emergency braking (AEB), have provided an effective way for AVs to avoid collisions with different objects, including TWs. The effectiveness of the AEB system is highly dependent on its parameter configurations, however, which vary among TW crash scenarios. This study, therefore, evaluates the AEB parameters, including time to collision (TTC), deceleration, and detection area (including detection range, field of vision, and trigger width) in two AEB systems: one-stage AEB and three-stage AEB. A total of 243 crashes extracted from the China In-Depth Accident Study database were simulated in Matlab's Simulink. Results show: (i) one-stage AEB crash avoidance rates range from 15.2% to 81.5%, while three-stage AEB has crash avoidance rates as high as 87.2%; (ii) deceleration, TTC, and detection area all have significant main effects on crash rate, but detection area has less influence in longitudinal than in crossing scenarios; (iii) higher crash avoidance rates resulted in lower traffic efficiency for both AEB systems, but resulted in greater speed reduction only for one-stage AEB; and (iv) collisions are less likely to be avoided in scenarios with high initial speed of TW and AV. This study demonstrates the performance of AEB algorithms in multiple actual crash scenarios and provides a reliable basis for the development of AEB systems.

AB Autonomous transportation systems have an immense impact on the way of our day-to-day commute or traveling. Connectedness is an inseparable part of these systems, and it is possible through Intelligent Transportation Systems applications. These applications use a network system known as Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). However, the safety that is provided by VANETs can be easily compromised by malicious users. Hence there is a need for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). We designed an IDS model that can collect network data cooperatively from vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs). For training the core of our proposed IDS we generated synthetic network data with the help of the widely used Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) and Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulation tools. We also generated separate test data that is not just a split part of the training data. This ensures the elimination of the misleading performance result of an overfitted model. We employed a multi-class IDS using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a novel feature extraction method known as Context-Aware Feature Extraction-Based CNN (CAFECNN). The CAFECNN model takes advantage of the collected network flow data to detect both passive and active types of attacks. The results show that the proposed model is stronger in identification of hard-to-detect passive attacks compared to traditional machine learning methods. We also evaluated the model using real-time simulations and observed an immediate improvement in the performance of the network despite the intruders, especially in terms of packet delivery ratio and network throughput.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Although modern object detection AI models have the potential to be widely used in various applications such as autonomous vehicles, these models are very computationally demanding. Using high-resolution image data further increases the computational burden. Hence, we propose an acceleration method called Group of Picture (GoP) mode for object detection in video sequences by removing the temporal redundancy, unlike the existing model compression schemes. A GoP structure is composed of only one key frame and several non-key frames. In GoP-mode, object detection is adopted for key frames only, while object tracking is employed to predict the position of each object in the following non-key frames based on the tracked trajectory and momentum of each object. By using the proposed method, the thrilling latency saving can result in multiple times of execution speed acceleration so that both high detection accuracy and high execution speed can be obtained. In theory, if we adopt a GoP structure of one key frame with N non-key frames, the execution speed of object detection is accelerated to (1+N) times by equipping the GoP-mode. The effect of the number of non-key frames on the accuracy variation of an object detector equipped with GoP-mode has been analyzed. According to the experimental results, the mean average precision (mAP) of adopting GoP mode with four non-key frames in one GoP structure is competitive to that using object detection for all frames. Meanwhile, the execution frame rate is increased from the original 8 frames per second (FPS) to 35.8 FPS on the mobile platform-Jetson Nano, i.e. a speedup of 348%.

   attention technique
AB Marine scene segmentation is a core technology in marine biology and autonomous underwater vehicle research. However, it is challenging from the perspective of having a different environment from that of the conventional traffic segmentation on roads. There are two major challenges. The first is the difficulty of searching for objects under seawater caused by the relatively low-light environment. The second problem is segmenting marine animals with protective colors. To solve such challenges, in previous research, a method of simultaneously segmenting the foreground and the background was proposed based on a simple modification of the conventional model; however, it has limitations in improving the segmentation accuracy. Therefore, we propose a parallel semantic segmentation network to solve the above issues in which a model and a loss are employed to locate the foreground and the background separately. The training task to locate the foreground and the background is reinforced in the proposed method by adding an attention technique in a parallel model. Furthermore, the final segmentation is performed by aggregating two feature maps obtained by separately locating the foreground and the background.The test results using an open dataset for marine animal segmentation reveal that the proposed method achieves performance of 87%, 97.3%, 88%, 95.2%, and 0.029 in the mean intersection of the union, structure similarities, weighted F-measure, enhanced-alignment measure, and mean absolute error, respectively. These findings confirm that the proposed method has higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed model and code are publicly available via Github(1).

AB With recent Industry 4.0 developments, companies tend to automate their industries. Warehousing companies also take part in this trend. A shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) is an automated storage and retrieval system technology experiencing recent drastic market growth. This technology is mostly utilized in large distribution centers processing mini-loads. With the recent increase in e-commerce practices, fast delivery requirements with low volume orders have increased. SBS/RS provides ultrahigh-speed load handling due to having an excess amount of shuttles in the system. However, not only the physical design of an automated warehousing technology but also the design of operational system policies would help with fast handling targets. In this work, in an effort to increase the performance of an SBS/RS, we apply a machine learning (ML) (i.e., Q-learning) approach on a newly proposed tier-to-tier SBS/RS design, redesigned from a traditional tier-captive SBS/RS. The novelty of this paper is twofold: First, we propose a novel SBS/RS design where shuttles can travel between tiers in the system; second, due to the complexity of operation of shuttles in that newly proposed design, we implement an ML-based algorithm for transaction selection in that system. The ML-based solution is compared with traditional scheduling approaches: first-in-first-out and shortest process time (i.e., travel) scheduling rules. The results indicate that in most cases, the Q-learning approach performs better than the two static scheduling approaches.

AB Ride-sourcing services are continuously gaining popularity among urban travelers. Due to their flexibility and responsiveness, transit agencies spot chances of collaborating with Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) in order to improve service quality, promote transit usage, and meanwhile lower their operational cost. In this paper, we studied an integrated transit system where ride-sourcing services complement the transit service as an efficient and economical access mode. The users of the integrated system consist of not only transit riders but also drivers for TNCs. Riders maximize their utilities by choosing whether and how to use the integrated system, and drivers maximize their payoffs by deciding how to serve riders. More importantly, in this twosided system, their decisions are unfolded to each other and mutually influence one another such that an equilibrium is reached where no one can improve their outcome. We modeled the stochastic mode choice of riders and zone choice of drivers and captured the interactive attributes in a fixed-point problem. The existence of such an equilibrium was proved, and an iterative solution algorithm that utilizes network algorithms was proposed to find an equilibrium pattern of the stochastic demand-supply problem. A real-world case study using the Twin Cities' data was carried out, and insights into the mechanism of the integrated transit system were developed. Various aspects of the system including user perception, demand estimation, pricing strategy, and subsidy strategy were investigated through the proposed model. These research outcomes contribute to a better comprehension of this promising mobility system and provide valuable knowledge on the planning and design of such systems.

AB In mobile systems, fog, rain, snow, haze, and sun glare are natural phenomena that can be very dangerous for drivers. In addition to the visibility problem, the driver must face also the choice of speed while driving. The main effects of fog are a decrease in contrast and a fade of color. Rain and snow cause also high perturbation for the driver while glare caused by the sun or by other traffic participants can be very dangerous even for a short period. In the field of autonomous vehicles, visibility is of the utmost importance. To solve this problem, different researchers have approached and offered varied solutions and methods. It is useful to focus on what has been presented in the scientific literature over the past ten years relative to these concerns. This synthesis and technological evolution in the field of sensors, in the field of communications, in data processing, can be the basis of new possibilities for approaching the problems. This paper summarizes the methods and systems found and considered relevant, which estimate or even improve visibility in adverse weather conditions. Searching in the scientific literature, in the last few years, for the preoccupations of the researchers for avoiding the problems of the mobile systems caused by the environmental factors, we found that the fog phenomenon is the most dangerous. Our focus is on the fog phenomenon, and here, we present published research about methods based on image processing, optical power measurement, systems of sensors, etc.

AB Without steering wheel and driver's seat, the self-driving cars will have new interior outlook and spaces that can be used for enhanced infotainment services. For traveling people, self-driving cars will be new places for engaging in infotainment services. Therefore, self-driving cars should determine themselves the infotainment contents that are likely to entertain their passengers. However, the choice of infotainment contents depends on passengers' features such as age, emotion, and gender. Also, retrieving infotainment contents at data center can hinder infotainment services due to high end-to-end delay. To address these challenges, we propose infotainment caching in self-driving cars, where caching decisions are based on passengers' features obtained using deep learning. First, we proposed deep learning models to predict the contents need to be cached in self-driving cars and close proximity of self-driving cars in multi-access edge computing servers attached to roadside units. Second, we proposed a communication model for retrieving infotainment contents to cache. Third, we proposed a caching model for retrieved contents. Fourth, we proposed a computation model for the cached contents, where cached contents can be served in different formats/qualities based on demands. Finally, we proposed an optimization problem whose goal is to link the proposed models into one optimization problem that minimizes the content downloading delay. To solve the formulated problem, a block successive majorization-minimization technique is applied. The simulation results show that the accuracy of prediction for the contents that need to be cached is 97.82% and our approach can minimize the delay.

AB Interest in facial recognition hypotheses and algorithms has grown steadily over the last few decades. Video monitoring, criminal identification, building access control, and unmanned and autonomous vehicles are only a few examples of concrete applications that are becoming increasingly attractive to industry. Various techniques are being developed, including local, holistic, and hybrid approaches, which use only a few face image characteristics or the entire facial features to provide a face image description. Many methods have good results, if there are sufficiently representative training samples per person, in the face recognition system. Facial part finding and extraction show the utmost vital role in face and age recognition. In this research work a new algorithm is proposed for Face and Age Recognition (FAR) by using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine (RBF-SVM) classifier, and Rotational Local Binary Pattern (RLBP). RLBP is utilized for the selection and extraction of features from the face image. In this algorithm, extract the face component like Nose, Mouth, Left and Right eye. In the preprocessing stage median filter is used to remove noises from the face image. By using this, there is an improvement in the feature extraction procedure. In pattern recognition, a basic errand is finding a picture from the picture parts. For the implementation of results FG-NET ((Face and Gesture Recognition Network) and AT&T datasets are used. The detection rate of face recognition has reached up to 92-98% and the detection rate for age recognition is 87%. The proposed algorithm is compared with SVM shows better over previous algorithms and also estimate the value of accuracy.

AB Urban planning is transitioning away from the 'Predict and Provide' approach that accommodates automobility and towards the 'Demand Management' approach that prioritises alternatives that include active, shared, and public transport and restricts the convenience of automobility. While this transition could prove a sustainable solution for urban mobility, individuals already residing within auto-dependent settings may be unwilling or unable to relocate to high urban density where the alternatives are more viable. As such, restricting the automobility of these individuals potentially leaves them stranded throughout the urban form. The 'Multimodalism' approach is a pragmatic alternative that provides Park `n' Rides, Kiss `n' Rides, and feeder transit services that ensure everyone has access to rapid public transport yet the approach receives relatively little research attention. As such, researchers, policy makers, and planners are poorly equipped to influence intended multimodal travel behaviours or discourage the unintended such as 'railheading' towards more distantly located PnR. In this study, the transport planning and social psychology literature is examined to develop a conceptual model of travel behaviour, and for the first time, railheading behaviour is examined at the metropolitan-scale and explained using the conceptual model. The conceptual model and research findings strengthen the theoretical and empirical foundations for understanding travel behaviour, which in turn supports planning authorities and practitioners in promoting more sustainable transport behaviour, and in preparing for an urban future where Mobility-as-a-Service, ride-hailing, ride-sharing, eScooters, and autonomous vehicles become more integrated and commonplace.

AB From Shakey the Robot to self-driving cars, from the personal computer to personal assistants on our phones, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has led the development of integrated artificial intelligence (AI) systems for more than half a century. From the earliest days of AI, it was apparent that a robust, generally intelligent system should include a complete set of capabilities: perception, memory, reasoning, learning, planning, and action; and when DARPA initiated AI research in the 1960s, ambitious projects such as Shakey the Robot went after the complete package. As DARPA realized the challenges, they backed away from the ultimate goal of integrated AI and tried to make progress on the individual problems of image understanding, speech and language understanding, knowledge representation and reasoning, planning and decision aids, machine learning, and robotic manipulation. Yet, even as researchers struggled to make progress in these subdisciplines, DARPA periodically resurrected the challenge of integrated intelligent systems and pushed the community to try again. In the 1980s, DARPA's Strategic Computing Initiative took on challenges of integrated AI projects such as the Autonomous Land Vehicle and the Pilot's Associate. These did not succeed, but instead set the stage for the several decades of more siloed research that followed, until it was time to try again. In the 2000s, DARPA took on the integrated AI problem again with its Grand Challenges, which led to the first self-driving cars, and projects such as the Personalized Assistant that Learns, which produced Apple's Siri. These efforts created complex, richly-integrated systems that represented quantum leaps ahead in machine intelligence. The integration of sophisticated capabilities in a fundamental way is the key to general intelligence. This is the story of DARPA's persistent long-term support for this essential premise of AI.

AB Coastal physical processes are essential for the cross-shore transport of meroplanktonic larvae to their benthic adult habitats. To investigate these processes, we released a swarm of novel, trackable, subsurface vehicles, the Mini-Autonomous Underwater Explorer (M-AUEs), which we programmed to mimic larval depth-keeping behavior. The M-AUE swarm measured a sudden net onshore transport of 30-70 m over 15-20 min, which we investigated in detail. Here, we describe a novel transport mechanism of depth-keeping plankton revealed by these observations. In situ measurements and models showed that, as a weakly nonlinear internal wave propagated through the swarm, it deformed surface-intensified, along-isopycnal background velocities downward, accelerating depth-keeping organisms onshore. These higher velocities increased both the depth-keepers' residence time in the wave and total cross-shore displacement, leading to wave-induced transports twice those of fully Lagrangian organisms and four times those associated with the unperturbed background currents. Our analyses also show that integrating velocity time series from virtual larvae or mimics moving with the flow yields both larger and more accurate transport estimates than integrating velocity time series obtained at a point (Eulerian). The increased cross-shore transport of organisms capable of vertical swimming in this wave/background-current system is mathematically analogous to the increase in onshore transport associated with horizontal swimming in highly nonlinear internal waves. However, the mechanism described here requires much weaker swimming speeds (mm s(-1) vs. cm s(-1)) to achieve significant onshore transports, and meroplanktonic larvae only need to orient themselves vertically, not horizontally.

AB Over the last few decades, multibeam echosounders (MBES) have become the dominant technique to efficiently and accurately map the seafloor. They now allow to collect water column acoustic images along with the bathymetry, which is providing a wealth of new possibilities in oceans exploration. However, water column imagery generates vast amounts of data that poses obvious logistic, economic, and technical challenges. Surprisingly, very few studies have addressed this problem by providing efficient lossless or lossy data compression solutions. Currently, the available options are only lossless, providing low compression ratios at low speeds. In this paper, we adapt a data compression algorithm, the Fully Adaptive Prediction Error Coder (FAPEC), which was created to offer outstanding performance under the strong requirements of space data transmission. We have added to this entropy coder a specific pre-processing stage tailored to theKongsbergMaritime water column file formats. Here, we test it on data acquired withKongsbergMBES models EM302, EM710, andEM2040. With this bespoke pre-processing, FAPEC provides good lossless compression ratios at high speeds, whereas lossy ratios reach water column file sizes even smaller than bathymetry raw files still with good image quality. We show the advantages over other lossless compression solutions, both in terms of compression ratios and speed. We illustrate the quality of water column images after lossy FAPEC compression, as well as its resilience to datagram errors and its potential for automatic detection of water column targets. We also show the successful integration in ARM microprocessors (like those used by smartphones and also by autonomous underwater vehicles), which provides a real-time solution for MBES water column data compression.

AB Traffic light recognition is being intensively researched for the purpose of reducing traffic accidents at intersections and realizing autonomous driving. However, conventional vision-based approaches have several limitations due to full image scanning, always-on operation, various different types of traffic lights, and complex driving environments. In particular, it might be impossible to recognize a relevant traffic light among multiple traffic lights at multiple intersections. To overcome such limitations, we propose an effective architecture that integrates a vision system with an accurate positioning system and an extended digital map. The recognition process is divided into four stages and we suggest an extended methodology for each stage. These stages are: ROI generation, detection, classification, and tracking. The 3D positions of traffic lights and slope information obtained from an extended digital map enable ROIs to be generated accurately, even on slanted roads, while independent design and implementation of individual recognition modules for detection and classification allow for selection according to the type of traffic light face. Such a modular architecture gives the system simplicity, flexibility, and maintainable algorithms. In addition, adaptive tracking that exploits the distance to traffic lights allows for seamless state estimation through smooth data association when measurements change from long to short ranges. Evaluation of the proposed system occurred at six test sites and utilized two different types of traffic lights, seven states, sloped roads, and various environmental complexities. The experimental results show that the proposed system can recognize traffic lights with 98.68% precision, 92.73% recall, and 95.52% accuracy in the 10.02-81.21 m range. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ocean thermal energy is formed by temperature difference between sea surface and deep sea. Underwater glider is a new kind of autonomous underwater vehicle. It ascends and descends between the sea surface and deep sea periodically by adjusting its net buoyancy. Thermal underwater glider can harvest ocean thermal energy through the utilization of phase change material (PCM) and convert it into mechanical energy for buoyancy-driven. In this paper, the fundamental principle of this thermal engine is unveiled. A nonlinear model for relationship between system pressure and phase change rate is established. Based on the established nonlinear model, influencing factors for system pressure and stored energy are analyzed comprehensively. Selected PCM is Hexadecane. Value range for air solubility in liquidus PCM is 0.06-0.1, and for residual air in the system is -0.02 to 0.05. The influence of these two factors on relative energy storage is similar. For typical values of air solubility 0.08 and residual air 0.005, utilization ratio of the thermal engine is less than 50%. Through experiment in the lake, the nonlinear model was verified, maximum system pressure was 12.5 MPa, and average stored energy of each cycle was 2.48 kJ. A prototype of thermal underwater glider has also been tested in the South China Sea. It had worked continuously for 29 days without any failure. Total number of working profile was 121 and total cruising range was 677 km, total stored energy was 300 kJ. High reliability and performance was validated by the sea trial. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper describes how students can be guided to become their own best teachers, able to test their newly acquired skills with only minimum or no direct assistance from an instructor or lecturer. Closed-loop' student-centred learning and problem-based learning approaches are described, involving weekly lectures and hands-on lab activities that keep students highly curious, motivated and engaged in self-regulated learning. Students are required to design and test their own original circuits and software code by modifying, extending or expanding the sample circuits and example code described in the lecture notes, in order to complete and demonstrate specific objectives or requirements for each weekly lab session. These closed-loop' student-centred learning labs ensure that all teams of students achieve a common or minimum acceptable level of practical skills, which adequately prepares them for a design-and-build' competition. This style of learning also helps develop generic life-long learning skills such as investigating and identifying problems (problem definition and analysis), independent research and experimentation, decision making, communication and teamwork. Even without any prior hands-on experience with electronic circuit design, programming and microcontrollers, each team of students was able to apply and demonstrate new knowledge and skills, devise and test original designs for circuits and software without any supervision, solve and fix complex problems successfully and confidently, and build an operational remote-controlled electric vehicle or mobile robot for a final competition. Some went even further and built sensor-guided fully autonomous mobile robots. Three different competitions described in this paper include a timed racing car competition, a multi-player box grabbing contest over a rocky obstacle course and a robot wars' competition that was televised on Channel 10 news in Australia.

AB Autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles equipped with high-definition video and photographic cameras are used to perform benthic surveys. These devices record fine-scale (< 1 m) seafloor features (seafloor complexity) and their local (10-100s m) variability (seafloor heterogeneity). Here, we introduce a methodology to efficiently process this optical imagery using object-based image analysis, which reduces the pixels in high-resolution digital images into a collection of image-objects of homogeneous color and/or luminosity. This approach uses intuitive user-defined parameters and reproducible computer code, which aims to facilitate comparisons between habitats and geographic regions. We test this methodology with 511 images taken on the seafloor of a glaciated continental shelf (Gulf of Maine, northwest Atlantic), and describe three applications: (1) estimating percent cover of conspicuous epibenthic fauna by building a Random Forest binary classifier assigning an identity to image-objects; (2) correlating image complexity (number of image-objects) with mean particle grain size; and (3) estimating seafloor heterogeneity from local variability in image complexity within and between two physiographic regions. Percent cover of epibenthic fauna estimated by the Random Forest binary classifier was in close agreement with the human visual assessment. Mean particle grain size (phi scale) was inversely correlated with image complexity (maximum Spearman's =-0.89, p<0.01) with images dominated by pebbles, cobbles, boulders (low on phi scale) yielding high image complexity. Predictive relationships of sediment composition were established using polynomial regression. Lastly, our approach could differentiate habitats within and between physiographic regions by using mean seafloor complexity and local variability along transects.

AB Persistently poor weather in the Arctic makes traditional marine mammal research from aircraft and ships difficult, yet collecting information on marine mammal distribution and habitat utilization is vital for understanding the impact of climate change on Arctic ecosystems. Moreover, as industrial use of the Arctic increases with the expansion of the open-water summer season, there is an urgent need to monitor the effects of noise from oil and gas exploration and commercial shipping on marine mammals. During September 2013, we deployed a single Slocum glider equipped with a digital acoustic monitoring (DMON) instrument to record and process in situ low-frequency (<5 kHz) audio to characterize marine mammal occurrence and habitat as well as ambient noise in the Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast of Alaska, USA. The DMON was programmed with the low-frequency detection and classification system (LFDCS) to autonomously detect and classify sounds of a variety of Arctic and sub-Arctic marine mammal species. The DMON/LFDCS reported regularly in near real time via Iridium satellite detailed detection data, summary classification information, and spectra of background noise. The spatial distributions of bowhead whale, bearded seal, and walrus call rates were correlated with surface salinity measured by the glider. Bowhead whale and walrus call rates were strongly associated with a warm and salty water mass of Bering Sea origin. With a passive acoustic capability that allows both archival recording and near real-time reporting, we envision ocean gliders will become a standard tool for marine mammal and ocean noise research and monitoring in the Arctic.

AB Oceanographic observations made during the Sound Predictions 2009 field experiment in Prince William Sound, Alaska, have documented rapid changes in the upper water column (0-40 m) circulation. An assortment of drifting buoys, sampling four different depths, and HF radar surface current mapping, revealed three modes of circulation: anticyclonic, open cyclonic, and closed cyclonic. Each mode was observed at least once within an 18-day window, and the transition between them took as little as a day. Time-resolved hydrographic measurements show that the mass field was variable, but generally arranged such that the surface geostrophic flow should be in a closed-core cyclonic eddy configuration. Observations show that the mass field was likely influenced by relatively low salinity water flowing into Prince William Sound from the shelf, and from local freshwater input. We quantitatively examine why a closed-core circulation was not always observed by focusing on the transition between the closed and open cyclonic flow patterns. The western region of the central sound is a key area for this transition. Here, the high-frequency radar revealed that the closed circulation was established when the net flow shifted direction from northward to southward. A detailed comparison of the meridional geostrophic and wind-driven flows, using measured winds and hydrographic data from CTD profiles and two autonomous vehicles, shows that the geostrophic flow was mostly southward while the wind-driven flow was mostly northward. A net southward flow can be caused by a decrease in the northward wind-driven flow or an increase in the southward geostrophic flow. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) from subseafloor aquifers, through muddy sediments, was studied in Eckernforde Bay (western Baltic Sea). The fluid discharge was clearly traced by Rn-222 enrichment in the water column and by the chloride profiles in pore water. At several sites, a considerable decrease in chloride, to levels less than 10% of bottom-water concentrations, was observed within the upper few centimeters of sediment. Studies at 196 sites revealed that >22% of the seafloor of the bay area was affected by freshwater admixture and active fluid venting. A maximal discharge rate of >9 L m(-2) d(-1) was computed by modeling pore water profiles. Based on pore water data, the freshwater flow from subseafloor aquifers to Eckernforde Bay was estimated to range from 4 x 10(6) to 57 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1). Therefore, 0.3-4.1% of the water volume of the bay is replaced each year. Owing to negligible surface runoff by rivers, SGD is a significant pathway within the hydrological cycle of this coastal zone. High-resolution bathymetric data and side-scan sonar surveys of pockmarks, depressions up to 300 m long, were obtained by using an autonomous underwater vehicle. Steep edges, with depths increasing by more than 2 m within 8-10 m in lateral directions, equivalent to slopes with an angle of as much as 11degrees, were observed. The formation of pockmarks within muddy sediments is suggested to be caused by the interaction between sediment fluidization and bottom currents. Fluid discharge from glacial coastal sediments covered by mud deposits is probably a widespread, but easily overlooked, pathway affecting the cycle of methane and dissolved constituents to coastal waters of the Baltic Sea.

Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a real-time intelligent rail recognition algorithm that can be deployed on the onboard computing device to guide the UAV's camera to follow the target rail area and complete the inspection automatically. However, a significant issue is that rails from the perspective of UAVs may appear with changing pixel widths and various inclination angles. Concerning the issue, a general and adaptive rail representation method based on projection length discrimination (RRM-PLD) is proposed. It can always select the optimal representation direction, horizontal or vertical, to represent any kind of rails. With the RRM-PLD, a novel architecture (Real-Time Rail Recognition Network, TriRNet) is proposed. In TriRNet, a designed inter-rail attention (IRA) mechanism is presented to fuse local features of single rails and global features of other rails to accurately discriminate the geometric distribution of all rails in the image in a regressive way and thus improve the final recognition accuracy. Further, one-to-one mapping from anchor points to final feature maps is established. It greatly simplifies the model design process and improves the model's interpretability. Besides, detailed model training strategies are also presented. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed formulation in terms of both network reasoning latency and recognition accuracy.

AB For warehouses to be more sustainable and cost-effective, it is essential to consider energy consumption (EC) and order tardiness (OT) together in evaluating warehouse activities since improving both EC and OT at the same time is very demanding. While existing studies try to improve EC and OT, the current studies consider only either a reserve area or a forward area between the two major warehouse areas. Thus, this study proposes a simulation-based approach to assessing EC and OT when reserve and forward areas are considered together in one framework for different configurations of five important warehousing parameters: (i) number of forklifts, (ii) number of storage/retrieval (S/R) machines, (iii) number of automated storage/retrieval systems (AS/RS) input/output (I/O) points, (iv) order size, and (v) proportions of order flows through a reserve or forward area. In particular, we use real forklift movement and energy data for our simulation models to provide a more realistic analysis. By building the simulation model with the 25 full factorial experimental design, we analyze the results with analysis of variance (ANOVA). The resulting Pareto-optimal solutions show that less traffic flows through a reserve area can help improve both EC and OT while other factors have smaller or limited effects on the two responses. Also, the order flow factor has the largest effect on EC while order size has the largest effect on OT. The results from this study can help warehouse operators make informed decisions in considering and finding a trade-off between sustainability and customer satisfaction.

AB Mobile crowd sensing (MCS) with human participants has been proposed as an efficient way of collecting data for smart cities applications. However, there often exist situations where humans are not able or reluctant to reach the target areas, due to for example traffic jams or bad road conditions. One solution is to complement manual data collection with autonomous data collection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors. In this paper, we focus on the scenarios of UAV-assisted MCS and propose a task allocation method, called "UMA" (UAV-assisted Multi-task Allocation method) to optimize the sensing coverage and data quality. The method incentivizes human participants to contribute sensing data from nearby points of interest (PoIs), with a limited budget. Meanwhile, the method jointly considers the optimization of task assignment and trajectory scheduling. It schedules the trajectories of UAVs, considering the locations of human participants, other UAVs and PoIs which are rarely visited by human participants. In detail, UAVs take care of two tasks in our proposal. One is to calibrate the data collected by the human participants whom the UAVs come across along their trajectories. The other is to collect data from the PoIs which are not covered by other UAVs or human participants. We apply deep reinforcement learning to schedule UAVs moving trajectories and sensing activities in order to minimize the overall energy cost. We evaluate the proposed scheme via simulation using two real data sets. The results show that our proposal outperforms the compared methods, in terms of coverage completed ratio, calibrating ratio, energy efficiency, and task fairness.

   strict latency constraints
AB Neural architecture search (NAS) is an emerging paradigm to automate the design of competitive deep neural networks (DNNs). In practice, DNNs are subject to strict latency constraints and any violation may lead to catastrophic consequences (e.g., autonomous vehicles). However, to obtain the architecture that strictly satisfies the required latency constraint, previous hardware-aware differentiable NAS methods have to repeat a plethora of search runs to tune relevant hyperparameters by trial and error, and as a result, the total design cost increases proportionally (empirically by ten times). To tackle this, we, in this article, introduce a lightweight and scalable hardware-aware NAS framework named LightNAS, which consists of two separate stages. In the first stage, we strive to search for the architecture that strictly satisfies the required latency constraint at the macro level in a differentiable manner, and more importantly, through a one-time search (i.e., you only search once). The architectures searched in the first stage are denoted as LightNets. After that, in the second stage, we introduce an efficient evolutionary scheme to further explore the micro-level channel configuration of each LightNet at low cost. To achieve this, we propose an effective yet computationally cheap proxy, namely, batchwise training estimation (BTE), as a plug-in complement to enable the channel-level exploration of LightNets on the fly such that the accuracy of LightNets can be improved without degrading the runtime latency on target hardware. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on one popular embedded platform (i.e., Nvidia Jetson AGX Xavier) to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach over previous state-of-the-art counterparts.

AB Scene matching navigation system (SMNS) remains challenging in many navigation tasks, which rely heavily on accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness. Due to the different generation conditions of the matching images, it is difficult for traditional methods to cover every aspect of the three navigation performances. This article aims at developing an accurate, fast, and robust SMNS based on vision/inertial fusion to provide complete navigation information for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using the mechanization results of the low-cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS), the proposed system first completes the georeferencing of the real-time aerial images, in which the projection errors are reduced greatly by introducing an optimized factor to the homography matrix. Then, applying a robust noise processing strategy, an improved feature extraction algorithm is designed to eliminate most of the features that vary with climate, time, and season, which lays a solid foundation for the accuracy of the following matching procedure. Under the framework of the SMNS, a novel matching strategy based on logic graphs is designed, which can facilitate the matching procedure. Eventually, by combining the mechanization results of the MEMS and the matching results of the SMNS, the proposed system can provide complete navigation results. Experiments in typical and complex scenarios are carried out, respectively, to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SMNS possesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness, which outperforms the state-of-the-art strategies [i.e., histogram of orientated phase congruency (HOPC), chanel feature of orientated gradient (CFOG), phase congruency (PC)] in terms of matching aerial and satellite images.

AB This paper proposes an Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) system based on the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with side scan sonar for real-time detection and positioning of underwater targets. The system introduces a pre-processing algorithm for the original Side Scan Sonar (SSS) image, which performs pixel-level correction of the image according to the slant range setting of the SSS sensor and the height from the seabed to eliminate the influence of target geometric distortion on the subsequent recognition algorithm and improve the recognition accuracy. At the same time, the attitude angle information of the AUV is obtained to correct the target position, making each pixel of the pre-processed image has underwater positioning (latitude and longitude) information. Since SSS images are seriously disturbed by noise, in order to accurately extract target features in real time, on the basis of selecting the lightweight network MobileNetV3, we introduce attention mechanism and integrated learning to meet the requirements of underwater target recognition accuracy and real-time performance. The multi-classifier ensemble prediction results further reduce the mis-identification rate of submarine targets. The ATR system fuses the prediction results and the submarine target position and sends it to the AUV main control system to guide the AUV how to navigate and plan path at the subsequent. The experimental results show that, we validate that the proposed method matches the state of the art in segmentation accuracy, the ATR system proposed in this paper can be embedded in the underwater unmanned platform, and achieve accurate underwater target detection and positioning, The real-time recognition speed of each picture is about 0.058 s.

AB Transient stability control of power systems is based on actions that are taken automatically following a disturbance to ensure that the system remains in synchronism. Examples of such measures include generator rejection and the insertion of dynamic braking resistors. Methods like these are designed to rapidly absorb excess energy or otherwise alter the generation-demand balance at key points in the system. While these methods are often effective, they lack the ability to inject real power to compensate for a deficit. Utility-scale inverter-based resources, particularly energy storage systems, enable bidirectional modulation of real power with the bandwidth necessary to provide synchronizing torque. These resources, and the control strategies they enable, have garnered substantial research interest. This paper provides a critical review of research on real power modulation strategies for transient stability control. The design of these control strategies is heavily informed by the methods used to assess changes in the transient stability margins. Rigorously assessing these changes is difficult because the dynamics of large-scale power systems are inherently nonlinear. The well-known equal-area criterion is physically intuitive, but conceptual extensions are necessary for multi-machine systems. So-called direct methods of transient stability analysis offer a more general alternative; however, these methods require many simplifying assumptions and have difficulty incorporating detailed system dynamics. In this paper, we discuss data-driven methods for offline stability assessment based on Koopman operator theory.

ID IDENTIFICATION; MODEL
AB Onboard sensors contribute to data-driven understanding of complex and nonlinear ship dynamics in real time. By using sensors, precise ship trajectory prediction plays a key role in intelligent collision avoidance. A hybrid predictor makes prediction based on a mathematical model of which error is compensated by a black-box model. A Multiple-output Hybrid Predictor (MHP), which makes a long-horizon prediction at a time based on onboard sensor data, was developed in the previous study. However, it cannot handle a time series of future command assumption. This limitation hinders an MHP from being applied to the evaluation of future command assumption in the predictive decision making. A novel architecture of MHP presented in this study converts a long time series of future command assumption into a fixed-length model-based-predicted vessel state; then, it is included in inputs of a black-box error compensator. This idea is robust to multidimensionality of commands and long control horizon. Assuming a low-fidelity vessel model and a limited data are available, simulation experiments are conducted. The effect of environmental disturbances and maneuverings on the prediction performance is examined comprehensively for the first time. The present study successfully incorporates a long time series of future command assumption in an MHP. It reduces the mean error by 81.8% compared to a model-based predictor and by 45.6% compared to a data-driven predictor under Beaufort wind force scale 4 wave, wind, and ocean current. Present study expands the application of MHP to the predictive decision making of future autonomous ships.

AB Real-time video defogging has a huge demand in intelligent transportation, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), long-range surveillance, autonomous aerial vehicles and endoscopic surgery. Most of these applications are constrained by stringent frame rate, power and memory budget. Till date, the methods devised for such requirements are very rare. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient method and very-large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture for resource-constrained embedded system targeting real-time video defogging. The method and architecture are co-designed to achieve high throughput while consuming less resources and power. The architecture is divided into four parts namely, atmospheric light estimation unit, airlight adjustment unit, transmission estimation unit, and pixel restoration unit. The atmospheric light estimation unit employs a 3x3 tile based approach that eliminates the requirement of large buffer memory for 15x15 support size. The transmission is estimated using dark channel prior and gradient threshold based Gaussian filtering approach. In order to overcome flickering artifacts, an adaptive airlight updating scheme is employed. From the quantitative and qualitative evaluations, it is observed that the proposed method outperforms the existing hardware approaches. Furthermore, the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations of the architecture achieve a high throughput of 200 MPixels/s and 600 MPixels/s, respectively. The ASIC implementation dissipates 9.03 mW power at 200MHz. Moreover, the proposed design does not require any external memory such as dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), thus making it suitable for on-chip processing that can be closely integrated with an image sensor.

AB Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is growing an attractive zone of the research to explore the underwater scenario for surveillance. The autonomous manner of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or Drone makes search and surveillance of the target underwater region effectively. Drone gather, analyse, and transmit data at the time of flight by consuming battery energy. Underwater search and monitoring are carried out by IoUT. But battery energy is limited in drones, and elongation of the lifetime is an important requirement in IoUT. Energy consumption by being reduced by selecting an efficient cluster head in the Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs). Efficient data transmission makes a network efficient in terms of energy consumption, and delay. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) make UWSN more scalable. An Edge-Drone-based four-layer Software-Defined smart Internet of Underwater Things (EdgeIoUT) for efficient data transmission is proposed in this article. The architecture of the proposed EdgeIoUT model is based on edge computing and the drones act as an edge device in the proposed work. The proposed EdgeIoUT model works in four layers, (i) Underwater sensor and cluster head layer, (ii) Drone layer (iii) SDN switch, and (iv) SDN controller & data storage layer. The comparison of the proposed model with the existing traditional Software-Defined IoUT is performed using QualNet 7.1 simulator. The outcome of simulation shows that the proposed EdgeIoUT superior with regard to mean jitter by 63%, mean total energy consumption by 3%, and packet delivery ratio by 17% than traditional SD-IoUT in maximum data size.

TI GPU-Accelerated Real-Time Stereo Estimation With Binary Neural Network

DT Article
DE GPU acceleration; stereo estimation; binary neural network
AB Depth estimation from stereo images is essential to many applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicles, most of which ask for the real-time response, high energy and storage efficiency. Recent work has shown deep neural networks (DNN) perform extremely well for stereo estimation. However, these state-of-the-art DNN based algorithms are challenging to be deployed into real-world applications due to the high computational complexities of DNNs. Most of them are too slow for real-time inference and require several seconds of GPU computation to process image frames. In this article, we address the problem of fast stereo estimation and propose an efficient and light-weighted stereo matching system, called StereoBit, to produce a disparity map in a real-time manner while achieving close to state-of-the-art accuracy. To achieve this goal, we propose a binary neural network to generate weighted Hamming distance for an efficient similarity join in stereo estimation. In addition, we propose a novel approximation approach to derive StereoBit network directly from the well-trained network with the cosine similarity. Our approximation strategies enable a significant speedup while maintaining almost the same accuracy compared to the network with the cosine similarity. Furthermore, we present an optimization framework for fully exploiting the computing power of StereoBit. The framework provides a significant speedup of stereo estimation routines, and at the same time, reduces the memory usage for storing parameters. The effectiveness of StereoBit is evaluated by comprehensive experiments. StereoBit can achieve 60 frames per second on an NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPU on KITTI 2012 benchmark while achieving 3-pixel non-occluded stereo error 3.56 percent.

AB The Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is one of the best-studied hydrothermal systems to date. However, high-resolution bathymetric data obtained in 2016 by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) reveal new information about the distribution of active and inactive hydrothermal deposits, and their relation to structural features. The discovery of previously undocumented inactive vent sites contributes to a better understanding of the accumulation rates and the resource potential of seafloor massive sulfide deposits at slow-spreading ridges. The interpretation of ship-based and high-resolution AUV-based data sets allowed for the determination of the main tectonic stress regimes that have a first-order control on the location and distribution of past and present hydrothermal activity. The data reveal the importance of cross-cutting lineament populations and temporal variations in the prevalent stress regime. A dozen sulfide mounds contribute to a substantial accumulation of hydrothermal material (similar to 29 Mt). The accumulation rate of similar to 1,500 t/yr is comparable to those of other modern seafloor vent fields. However, our observations suggest that the TAG segment is different from many other slow-spreading ridge segments in its tectonic complexity, which confines sulfide formation into a relatively small area and is responsible for the longevity of the hydrothermal system and substantial mineral accumulation. The inactive and weakly active mounds contain almost 10 times the amount of material as the active high-temperature mound, providing an important indication of the global resource potential for inactive seafloor massive sulfide deposits.

AB Two styles of bird locomotion, hovering and intermittent flight, have great potential to inform future development of autonomous flying vehicles. Hummingbirds are the smallest flying vertebrates, and they are the only birds that can sustain hovering. Their ability to hover is due to their small size, high wingbeat frequency, relatively large margin of mass-specific power available for flight and a suite of anatomical features that include proportionally massive major flight muscles (pectoralis and supracoracoideus) and wing anatomy that enables them to leave their wings extended yet turned over (supinated) during upstroke so that they can generate lift to support their weight. Hummingbirds generate three times more lift during downstroke compared with upstroke, with the disparity due to wing twist during upstroke. Much like insects, hummingbirds exploit unsteady mechanisms during hovering including delayed stall during wing translation that is manifest as a leading-edge vortex (LEV) on the wing and rotational circulation at the end of each half stroke. Intermittent flight is common in small- and medium-sized birds and consists of pauses during which the wings are flexed (bound) or extended (glide). Flap-bounding appears to be an energy-saving style when flying relatively fast, with the production of lift by the body and tail critical to this saving. Flap-gliding is thought to be less costly than continuous flapping during flight at most speeds. Some species are known to shift from flap-gliding at slow speeds to flap-bounding at fast speeds, but there is an upper size limit for the ability to bound (similar to 0.3 kg) and small birds with rounded wings do not use intermittent glides.

AB Exploiting stronger winds at offshore farms leads to a cyclical need for maintenance due to the harsh maritime conditions. While autonomous vehicles are the prone solution for O&M procedures, sub-sea phenomena induce severe data degradation that hinders the vessel's 3D perception. This article demonstrates a hybrid underwater imaging system that is capable of retrieving tri-dimensional information: dense and textured Photogrammetric Stereo (PS) point clouds and multiple accurate sets of points through Light Stripe Ranging (LSR), that are combined into a single dense and accurate representation. Two novel fusion algorithms are introduced in this manuscript. A Joint Masked Regression (JMR) methodology propagates sparse LSR information towards the PS point cloud, exploiting homogeneous regions around each beam projection. Regression curves then correlate depth readings from both inputs to correct the stereo-based information. On the other hand, the learning-based solution (RHEA) follows an early-fusion approach where features are conjointly learned from a coupled representation of both 3D inputs. A synthetic-to-real training scheme is employed to bypass domain-adaptation stages, enabling direct deployment in underwater contexts. Evaluation is conducted through extensive trials in simulation, controlled underwater environments, and within a real application at the ATLANTIS Coastal Testbed. Both methods estimate improved output point clouds, with RHEA achieving an average RMSE of 0.0097 m -a 52.45% improvement when compared to the PS input. Performance with real underwater information proves that RHEA is robust in dealing with degraded input information; JMR is more affected by missing information, excelling when the LSR data provides a complete representation of the scenario, and struggling otherwise.

AB The simulation of rare edge cases such as adverse weather conditions is the enabler for the deployment of the next generation of autonomous drones and vehicles into conditions where human operation is error-prone. Therefore, such settings must be simulated as accurately as possible and be computationally efficient, so to allow the training of deep learning algorithms for scene understanding, which require large-scale datasets disallowing extensive Monte Carlo simulations. One computationally-expensive step is the simulation of light sources in scattering media, which can be tackled by the radiative transfer equation and approximated by analytical solutions in the following. Traditionally, a single scattering event is assumed for fog rendering, since it is the dominant effect for relatively low scattering media. This assumption allows us to present an improved solution to calculate the so called air-light integral that can be evaluated fast and robustly for an isotropic point source in homogeneous media. Additionally, the solution is extended for a cone-shaped source and implemented in a computer vision rendering pipeline fulfilling computational restrictions for deep learning uses. All solutions can handle arbitrary azimuthally symmetric phase functions and were tested with the Henyey-Greenstein phase function and an advection fog phase function calculated from a particle distribution using Mie's theory. The used approximations are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and the solutions are used to augment good weather images towards inclement conditions with focus on visible light sources, so to provide additional data in such hard-to-collect settings.

AB The UAV-assisted energy harvesting cognitive wireless network has the feature of fast layout, remarkable spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), thereby being envisioned as one significant cutting-edge communication technology in the 5G/6G era. In this study, we consider an UAV-assisted energy harvesting cognitive radio network (UAV-EH-CRN), where an UAV is employed as one cognitive user (CU), hovering in the air to perform spectrum sensing and communicating with the dedicated receiver (DR) on the ground. Based on the sensing results of the primary user (PU), the UAV can adaptively adjust power to transmit with the DR. Moreover, by harvesting renewable energy, the UAV can replenish energy actively for transmission. By introducing outage rate (OR) for guaranteeing the UAVs SE requirements, our goal is to maximize the outage energy efficiency (OEE) for the UAV-EH-CRN, subject to constraints of energy, transmission power, and interference power. To make the non-convex OEE maximization problem solvable, one resource allocation policy portrayed as outage related convex approximation strategy (OR-CAS) is presented. Specifically, the OEE problem is firstly converted into a tractable counterpart by the proposed OR-CAS. Then, making use of the Lagrange duality method and one-dimensional linear programming, the optimal resource allocation solution for the OEE maximization is obtained. Simulation results show that our scheme enable the UAV-EH-CRN to adapt to various on-demand outage SE scenarios by setting different OR thresholds. Moreover, our algorithm can obtain significant EE gains and less time expenditure in comparison with the traditional exhaustive search approach.

AB Introduction Increasing numbers of deployment projects of automated shuttles have been taking place worldwide. Safety is one of the main concerns for their successful implementation. Therefore, it is vital to gain the knowledge about interactions between these shuttles and other traffic participants. Method Given the lack of behavioural observational studies under regular traffic conditions, the presented study applies external video recordings to explore encounters between the shuttles approaching a T-intersection and other traffic participants. The encounters of interest included a vulnerable road user in the bicycle lane, a pedestrian on the zebra crossing and a road user overtaking the shuttle. The shuttles were identified from the video by RUBA software. We analysed the encounters using T-Analyst software together with the manual observation of traffic participants' behaviour. Results From 220 h of video, 318 unique manoeuvres of the shuttle were observed and 83 encounters with other traffic participants were identified and explored. Several types of risks and behavioural patterns were identified, such as road users misusing the defensive style of the shuttles or cyclists in the bicycle lane not being sure about the shuttle's intention. Frequent hard stops of the shuttles might be dangerous for the passengers inside and can increase the risk of rear end accidents. Conclusions The findings provide a valuable insight into the interactions between automated shuttles and other traffic participants under regular traffic conditions on one location in Oslo, Norway. The study showed that introducing automated shuttles into regular traffic can lead to the emergence of new types of interactions between the shuttles and other traffic participants.

SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH

DT Article
DE AUV; Jurassic Quiet Zone; marine magnetic anomalies
AB The Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) provides a basis for the geological timescale, quantifies geomagnetic field behavior, and gives a time framework for geologic studies. We build a revised Middle to Late Jurassic GPTS by using a new multiscale magnetic profile, combining sea surface, midwater, and autonomous underwater vehicle near-bottom magnetic anomaly data from the Hawaiian lineation set in the Pacific Jurassic Quiet Zone (JQZ). We correlate the new profile with a previously published contemporaneous magnetic sequence from the Japanese lineation set. We then establish geomagnetic polarity block models as a basis for our interpretation of the origin and nature of JQZ magnetic anomalies and a GPTS. A significant level of coherency between short-wavelength anomalies for both the Japanese and Hawaiian lineation magnetic anomaly sequences suggests the existence of a regionally coherent field during this period of rapid geomagnetic reversals. Our study implies the rapid onset of the Mesozoic Dipole Low from M42 through M39 and then a subsequent gradual recovery in field strength into the Cenozoic. The new GPTS, together with the Japanese sequence, extends the magnetic reversal history from M29 back in time to M44. We identify a zone of varying, difficult-to-correlate anomalies termed the Hawaiian Disturbed Zone, which is similar to the zone of low amplitude, difficult-to-correlate anomalies in the Japanese sequence termed the Low Amplitude Zone (LAZ). We suggest that the LAZ, bounded by M39-M41 isochrons, may in fact represent the core of what is more commonly known as the JQZ crust.

AB This article demonstrates that nonmaximum suppression (NMS), which is commonly used in object detection (OD) tasks to filter redundant detection results, is no longer secure. Considering that NMS has been an integral part of OD systems, thwarting the functionality of NMS can result in unexpected or even lethal consequences for such systems. In this article, an adversarial example attack that triggers malfunctioning of NMS in OD models is proposed. The attack, namely, Daedalus, compresses the dimensions of detection boxes to evade NMS. As a result, the final detection output contains extremely dense false positives. This can be fatal for many OD applications, such as autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems. The attack can be generalized to different OD models, such that the attack cripples various OD applications. Furthermore, a way of crafting robust adversarial examples is developed by using an ensemble of popular detection models as the substitutes. Considering the pervasive nature of model reuse in real-world OD scenarios, Daedalus examples crafted based on an ensemble of substitutes can launch attacks without knowing the parameters of the victim models. The experimental results demonstrate that the attack effectively stops NMS from filtering redundant bounding boxes. As the evaluation results suggest, Daedalus increases the false positive rate in detection results to 99.9% and reduces the mean average precision scores to 0, while maintaining a low cost of distortion on the original inputs. It also demonstrates that the attack can be practically launched against real-world OD systems via printed posters.

AB In this paper, in line with the general framework of value-sensitive design, we aim to operationalize the general concept of "Meaningful Human Control" (MHC) in order to pave the way for its translation into more specific design requirements. In particular, we focus on the operationalization of the first of the two conditions (Santoni de Sio and Van den Hoven 2018) investigated: the so-called 'tracking' condition. Our investigation is led in relation to one specific subcase of automated system: dual-mode driving systems (e.g. Tesla 'autopilot'). First, we connect and compare meaningful human control with a concept of control very popular in engineering and traffic psychology (Michon 1985), and we explain to what extent tracking resembles and differs from it. This will help clarifying the extent to which the idea of meaningful human control is connected to, but also goes beyond, current notions of control in engineering and psychology. Second, we take the systematic analysis of practical reasoning as traditionally presented in the philosophy of human action (Anscombe, Bratman, Mele) and we adapt it to offer a general framework where different types of reasons and agents are identified according to their relation to an automated system's behaviour. This framework is meant to help explaining what reasons and what agents (should) play a role in controlling a given system, thereby enabling policy makers to produce usable guidelines and engineers to design systems that properly respond to selected human reasons. In the final part, we discuss a practical example of how our framework could be employed in designing automated driving systems.

AB The self-localization of mobile robots in the environment is one of the most fundamental problems in the robotics navigation field. It is a complex and challenging problem due to the high requirements of autonomous mobile vehicles, particularly with regard to the algorithms accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency. In this paper, we present a comparison of three of the most used map-matching algorithms applied in localization based on natural landmarks: our implementation of the Perfect Match (PM) and the Point Cloud Library (PCL) implementation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and the Normal Distribution Transform (NDT). For the purpose of this comparison we have considered a set of representative metrics, such as pose estimation accuracy, computational efficiency, convergence speed, maximum admissible initialization error and robustness to the presence of outliers in the robots sensors data. The test results were retrieved using our ROS natural landmark public dataset, containing several tests with simulated and real sensor data. The performance and robustness of the Perfect Match is highlighted throughout this article and is of paramount importance for real-time embedded systems with limited computing power that require accurate pose estimation and fast reaction times for high speed navigation. Moreover, we added to PCL a new algorithm for performing correspondence estimation using lookup tables that was inspired by the PM approach to solve this problem. This new method for computing the closest map point to a given sensor reading proved to be 40 to 60 times faster than the existing k-d tree approach in PCL and allowed the Iterative Closest Point algorithm to perform point cloud registration 5 to 9 times faster.

AB A bio-optical autonomous underwater gliding vehicle, equipped with a conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD) sensor, an oxygen sensor, backscatter meters, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and chlorophyll fluorometers, and upwelling and downwelling radiometers was developed to characterize the biogeochemical response to physical forcing at the submesoscale (1-10 km). Winter data obtained in the northwestern Mediterranean basin in a 50-km transect that crossed the permanent, along-coast Ligurian Current show tight physical-biogeochemical coupling across the Ligurian Current, not observed using other sampling strategies. At the scale of the transect, the various biogeochemical parameters displayed independent behaviors, while at the submesoscale, there was a coherent covariance of these variables, especially in the frontal zone. Near-isopycnal tongues of elevated fluorescence and oxygen concentration were recorded down to a depth of 180 m and are the likely signature of a converging horizontal and downwelled water flow. Local anomalies in a horizontal section well below the mixed-layer depth are likely representative of downwelled waters from the euphotic layer. Intrusions of elevated CDOM concentrations together with signatures of smaller particles are the likely features of a local divergence and upwelled waters from subjacent aphotic layers. These are particularly apparent in the form of local anomalies in a horizontal section within the mixed layer. Similar tongues were observed in data from subsequent glider deployments. Such biogeochemical signatures enable the identification of upward and downward physical motions not observed by other technologies, reinforcing the need for coupled high-resolution physical-biogeochemical studies, not only for investigating biogeochemical processes themselves but also for resolving physical processes at these scales.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB As an attractive transition approach, the altitude-hold transition is a special type of super-maneuvering and the vertical/horizontal flight mode transition that an agile aircraft conducts at fixed altitude. However, it is still challenging to implement an autonomous control of the altitude-hold transition while the existing optimal transition planning methods cannot avoid an evident altitude change during the transition process. This paper proposes a corridor-based flight mode transition strategy and presents a successful flight demonstration of the altitude-hold transition on a small ducted-fan tail-sitter unmanned aerial vehicle. In the proposed corridor-based methodology, we model and analyze the transition corridor, concentrate on the dynamic characteristics of the altitude-hold transition, and emphasize that a valid transition trajectory should be governed by its transition corridor. The identified transition corridor reveals that for a given velocity trajectory, the solution for the corresponding trajectories of pitch angle and thrust is unique. Based on this, the transition trajectory generation problem is addressed simply on the velocity-acceleration plane. Furthermore, a proper flight control scheme is devised to track the generated transition trajectories. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through practical flight tests, in which the altitude change is less than 1.1 m during the entire transition course.

AB 3D point-cloud upsampling, a crucial perceptual module to help us understand the complex scene and object, aims to generate a high-resolution point cloud given a sparse point set. While considerable attention has been paid to single object point-cloud upsampling, literature on upsampling complex scenes has emerged slowly. Remarkably, few related works target LiDAR-based point clouds, which inherently have a density imbalance problem over distance. This paper proposed LiUpNet, a LiDAR-based point cloud upsampling network. Given a sparse and imbalanced point cloud of a natural and complex scene, LiUpNet extracts robust regional features and generates a uniformly distributed dense point cloud that preserves the fine-grained structural architecture. Specifically, in LiUpNet, an attentive and transformer-based feature extractor is applied to learn the detailed regional representation to model the underlying complex local structure. Also, a novel density-invariant feature consistency loss is introduced to improve the robustness of the learned features against the sparsity changes. Finally, given the regional representations, we append a manifold-based upsampler to super-resolve the regional point clouds up to different scales according to the sparsity and implicitly regresses non-linear 3D scene surfaces. A more uniformly distributed and denser scene point cloud is then achieved with the scheme of dynamic regional upsampling rates. The experimental results on single-object and scene point-cloud upsampling show that LiUpNet outperforms related works qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, we demonstrate that the enhanced scene point clouds can efficiently improve the performance of downstream tasks such as point-cloud-based 3D object detection and depth completion.

AB The precise point positioning (PPP)-based real-time-kinematic (RTK) method attracts increasing attention from both academia and industry because of its potential for high accuracy positioning with a shorter convergence time compared to the traditional PPP. Besides high accuracy, integrity monitoring (IM) is indispensable for safety-critical real-time land vehicle and aviation applications. As the traditional advanced receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (ARAIM) method is designed for (smoothed) pseudorange-based positioning, the complexity of multi-frequency multi-constellation PPP-RTK using carrier phase measurements has not been given sufficient consideration. This study proposes an IM scheme for multi-frequency multi-constellation uncombined PPP-RTK applying the ARAIM theory, with a new comprehensive threat model to accommodate not only pseudorange measurements, but also carrier phase measurements, and other fault events arising from the network corrections that support PPP-RTK. Characteristics of different types of faults are analyzed with the aid of numerical experiments. In addition, the impact of ambiguity-fixed solutions on PPP-RTK integrity performance is investigated. The authors have also conducted case studies, including static and real-kinematic positioning experiments. Experiments have demonstrated that fast convergence in accuracy and the position error bounds, or protection levels, with a given integrity risk, in horizontal position components of PPP-RTK could be achieved. For the open sky environments on a highway, the protection levels estimated by PPP-RTK solutions have the potential to meet the alert limit requirement for road transportation using ambiguity-fixed PPP-RTK positioning under the assumption that the risks of wrong ambiguity fixing are very small and can be ignored.

AB It is crucial to extend the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) studies to the new frequency regions where modern telecommunication systems operate, specifically those related to the fifth-generation (5G) technology standard for broadband cellular networks. Electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) are systems that feature 5G technology on board and for which it is essential to ensure the proper management of EMC to prevent malfunctions. Given the considerable development of the EAV-related sector, new materials and solutions for EMI shielding with properties that reduce interference in the frequency regions of 5G technology are being investigated. Today, meatal-based solutions are the most common EMI shielding materials used to mitigate EMC problems. Nevertheless, with the appearance of EAVs, it is needed the design of novel materials that provide a significant balance in terms of shielding effectiveness (SE) and mechanical properties. Thereby, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are an attractive alternative to conventional EMI shielding materials due to their characteristics. The lightweight condition, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, easy processing, and resistance to corrosion made this new type of material perfect to be used in the field of EAVs. This contribution focuses on describing and characterizing three nanocomposite materials manufactured by loading a polymer matrix with 5%, 7%, and 10% CNT concentrations, respectively. The SE measurement is carried out with a coaxial sample holder based on the standard ASTM D4935-18. This measurement setup makes it possible to determine the performance of the three materials under test up to 18 GHz, covering part of the operation frequencies of 5G systems.

One of the crucial topics for such underwater vehicles is recoverability during undesired malfunctions. A Safety Operating Envelope (SOE) must be identified for military submarines. It considers the submersibles' malfunctions, including partial flooding, jam-to-rise, and jam-to-dive. This paper aims to identify the SOE to enclose the safety operation zones of the SST. In this work, a planar SST manoeuvring simulation model considering the combined contributions from hydrodynamic loads, compensation tank blowing, propeller thrust, and control planes is derived based on semi-empirical formulas. Second, standard operating procedures of recovery actions are established to cope with each malfunction. After that, free-running simulations are conducted. Three cases are presented to discuss SST recovery responses during each incident. Finally, the SOE of the SST is identified. This established SOE determines the SST's feasible speed and depth excursion ranges from an operational safety perspective. The safety depth is sufficient for the SST to recover from a jam-to-rise failure. Moreover, the study found that the existing safety factor on the structural design suggested by the Norwegian classification society Det Norske Veritas (DNV) naval submarine code is exceedingly conservative and potentially leads to a heavy and complex SST structure. The SOE helps reduce the designed collapse depth from the operational safety perspective and contributes to reduced material cost and considerable payload capacity. Also, this work fills in the blanks of SOE analysis on commercial submersibles.

AB Forests are the planet's main CO2 filtering agent as well as important economical, environmental and social assets. Climate change is exerting an increased stress, resulting in a need for improved research methodologies to study their health, composition or evolution. Traditionally, information about forests has been collected using expensive and work-intensive field inventories, but in recent years unoccupied autonomous vehicles (UAVs) have become very popular as they represent a simple and inexpensive way to gather high resolution data of large forested areas. In addition to this trend, deep learning (DL) has also been gaining much attention in the field of forestry as a way to include the knowledge of forestry experts into automatic software pipelines tackling problems such as tree detection or tree health/species classification. Among the many sensors that UAVs can carry, RGB cameras are fast, cost-effective and allow for straightforward data interpretation. This has resulted in a large increase in the amount of UAV-acquired RGB data available for forest studies. In this review, we focus on studies that use DL and RGB images gathered by UAVs to solve practical forestry research problems. We summarize the existing studies, provide a detailed analysis of their strengths paired with a critical assessment on common methodological problems and include other information, such as available public data and code resources that we believe can be useful for researchers that want to start working in this area. We structure our discussion using three main families of forestry problems: (1) individual Tree Detection, (2) tree Species Classification, and (3) forest Anomaly Detection (forest fires and insect Infestation).

AB In recent years, the importance of the semantic segmentation field has been increasingly emphasized because autonomous vehicle and artificial intelligence (AI)-based robot technology are being researched extensively; and methods for accurately recognizing objects are required. Previous state-of-the-art segmentation methods have been proven to be effective for databases obtained during daytime. However, in extremely low light or nighttime environments, the shape and color information of objects are very small or disappear due to an insufficient amount of external light, which makes it difficult to train the segmentation network and significantly degrades performance. In our previous work, segmentation performance in a low light environment was improved using the enhancement-based segmentation method. However, low light images could not be restored precisely and segmentation performance improvement was limited because only per-pixel loss functions were used when training the enhancement network. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a low light image segmentation method based on a modified perceptual cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). Perceptual image enhancement was performed using our network, which significantly improved segmentation performance. Unlike the existing perceptual loss, the Euclidean distance of the feature maps extracted from the pretrained segmentation network was used. In our experiments, we used low light databases generated from two famous road scene open databases, which are Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (KITTI), and confirmed that our proposed method shows better segmentation performance in extremely low light environments than the existing state-of-the art methods.

AB Background: Many studies have found that eye movement behavior provides a real-time index of mental activity. Risk management architectures embedded in autonomous vehicles fail to include human cognitive aspects. We set out to evaluate whether eye movements during a risk driving detection task are able to predict risk situations.
   Methods: Thirty-two normally sighted subjects (15 female) saw 20 clips of recorded driving scenes while their gaze was tracked. They reported when they considered the car should brake, anticipating any hazard. We applied both a mixed-effect logistic regression model and feedforward neural networks between hazard reports and eye movement descriptors.
   Results: All subjects reported at least one major collision hazard in each video (average 3.5 reports). We found that hazard situations were predicted by larger saccades, more and longer fixations, fewer blinks, and a smaller gaze dispersion in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. Performance between models incorporating a different combination of descriptors was compared running a test equality of receiver operating characteristic areas. Feedforward neural networks outperformed logistic regressions in accuracies. The model including saccadic magnitude, fixation duration, dispersion in x, and pupil returned the highest ROC area (0.73).
   Conclusion: We evaluated each eye movement descriptor successfully and created separate models that predicted hazard events with an average efficacy of 70% using both logistic regressions and feedforward neural networks. The use of driving simulators and hazard detection videos can be considered a reliable methodology to study risk prediction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In precision agriculture, the development of proximal imaging systems embedded in autonomous vehicles allows to explore new weed management strategies for site-specific plant application. Accurate monitoring of weeds while controlling wheat growth requires indirect measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground dry matter biomass (BM) at early growth stages. This article explores the potential of RGB images to assess crop-weed competition in a wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) crop by generating two new indicators, the weed pressure (WP) and the local wheat biomass production (delta BMc). The fractional vegetation cover (FVC) of the crop and the weeds was automatically determined from the images with a SVM-RBF classifier, using bag of visual word vectors as inputs. It is based on a new vegetation index called MetaIndex, defined as a vote of six indices widely used in the literature. Beyond a simple map of weed infestation, the map of WP describes the crop-weed competition. The map of delta BMc, meanwhile, evaluates the local wheat above-ground biomass production and informs us about a potential stress. It is generated from the wheat FVC because it is highly correlated with LAI (r(2)= 0.99) and BM (r(2)= 0.93) obtained by destructive methods. By combining these two indicators, we aim at determining whether the origin of the wheat stress is due to weeds or not. This approach opens up new perspectives for the monitoring of weeds and the monitoring of their competition during crop growth with non-destructive and proximal sensing technologies in the early stages of development.

AB Recently, polymer-based composites for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials have received considerable attention since the autonomous vehicle market is increasingly growing. However, the strategies for enhancing EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) are limited to the increase of filler loading. Only few studies have been conducted on controlling fillers owing to the technical challenges. In this study, anisotropic EMI shielding properties of polymer-based composites were demonstrated and investigated. In order to control the orientation of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), magnetic responsive RGO (Fe3O4@RGO) was synthesized for filler material. The orientation of Fe3O4@RGO was controlled in in-plane and out-of-plane direction by applying the magnetic field. For comparison with the aligned Fe3O4@RGO/TPU composites, random Fe3O4@RGO/TPU and random RGO/TPU composites were synthesized and characterized. The random Fe3O4@RGO/TPU composites showed 224% increased EMI SE over random RGO/TPU composites. The highest EMI SE, 250% improvement over random RGO/TPU composite, was observed in in-plane aligned Fe3O4@RGO composite among the four different composites. This could be attributed to improved electromagnetic wave (EM) loss by introducing magnetic nanoparticles, as well as enlarged effective reflection area of the aligned Fe3O4@RGO. Our results confirm that the orientation of fillers can play a key role in determining EMI SE in the composites. It can indicate that, if optimized, magnetically-responsive aligned polymer composites could significantly improve EMI SE of the composites by controlling the orientation of fillers, and also be a new solution to create anisotropic composites toward desirable properties.

AB The unique mechanosensory lateral line system of fish inspires a novel and promising sensing scheme in dealing with the challenges that autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) face in underwater localization and navigation. In this paper, the quantitative and method-independent Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) model is established to evaluate the practical performance of a lateral line sensor array (LLSA) for dipole source localization by considering the excitation pattern mismatches and the measurement noises. The effective localization area of the LLSA is studied under varying array lengths and sensor densities. Localizations for the LS (least squares) method and the MUSIC (multiple signal classification) method are compared in simulations. It is shown that the longer and denser the LLSA, the larger the effective localization area. Typically, the too separated sensor-to-sensor spacing deteriorates the near-body localization performance. The effective localization area obtained by employing the LS method matches the CRLB analysis, which also proves the validity of the analytical CRLB model. Besides, the MUSIC method presents smaller effective localization areas than the LS method. Physical experiments are also conducted and agree well with the CRLB analysis. Further study shows that the measurement noises have an equivalent effect on the excitation pattern mismatches, and can be effectively suppressed by choosing a large number of snapshots. In addition, the CRLB gives the perceptual distance that is consistent with the observation. At last, guidance on the design of a simplified LLSA with the least number of sensors and an optimal sensor-to-sensor spacing is provided for AUVs.

AB This study aims at investigating public perceptions towards the safety and security implications that will arise after the future introduction of flying cars in the traffic fleet. In this context, we focus on individuals' opinions about possible safety benefits and concerns as well as about policy measures that can potentially enhance the security of flying car. Due to the emergent nature and lack of public exposure of this technology, individuals' perceptions and opinions regarding flying cars might be subject to several layers of unobserved heterogeneity, such as shared unobserved variations across interrelated perceptions, grouped effects, and interactive effects between various sources of unobserved heterogeneity. To explore individuals' perceptions accounting, at the same time, for such heterogeneity patterns, grouped random parameters bivariate probit and correlated grouped random parameters binary probit models with heterogeneity in means are estimated. In this context, data collected from an online survey of 584 individuals from the United States are statistically analyzed. The estimation results revealed that a number of individual-specific socio-demographic, behavioral and driving attributes affect the perceptions towards the safety aspects of flying cars, along with the attitudes towards potential security interventions. Despite the exploratory nature of the analysis, the findings of this study can provide manufacturers, policy-makers and regulating agencies with valuable information regarding the integration and acceptance challenges that may arise with the introduction of flying cars.

AB Animal-attached GPS loggers are used to monitor the movement of land animals, but obtaining the measurements of aquatic animals remains challenging. Current animal-attached speed sensors are placed close to the body and measure the speed of the disturbed fluid near the skin interface, potentially affecting the accuracy of the measurement. Furthermore, the absolute speed estimates derived from the sensor data are affected by the location on the animal, orientation with respect to flow, and device shape. Here, we evaluate the performance of a microturbine in both the steady and variable flows using particle image velocimetry to visualize and measure the flow field around the tag and sensor. A closed recirculating flume was used to generate a range of both steady and oscillating flows at the sensor. During steady flow, turbine rotation rate was linearly correlated with both the free stream and near-sensor flow speeds. Following the controlled measurements of fluid speed in the flume, a tag with the speed sensor was used to measure both the speed and the total distance traveled by the dolphins in a managed environment. The results compared well with the speed and distance made from the analysis of video collected by an overhead camera system. Finally, the measurement variability of four specially designed tags with speed sensors was tested in the towing tank in the Marine Hydrodynamitx Laboratory at the University of Michigan. These results provide a foundation for interpreting in situ speed measurements from swimming animals, and potentially autonomous underwater vehicles, and will guide the development of the improved algorithms for the localization and energetics estimation.

AB The engineering vision of relying on the "smart sky" for supporting air traffic and the "internet-above-the-clouds" for in-flight entertainment has become imperative for the future aircraft industry. Aeronautical ad hoc networking (AANET) constitutes a compelling concept for providing broadband communications above clouds by extending the coverage of air-to-ground (A2G) networks to oceanic and remote airspace via autonomous and self-configured wireless networking among commercial passenger airplanes. The AANET concept may be viewed as a new member of the family of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) in action above the clouds. However, AANETs have more dynamic topologies, larger and more variable geographical network size, stricter security requirements, and more hostile transmission conditions. These specific characteristics lead to more grave challenges in aircraft mobility modeling, aeronautical channel modeling, and interference mitigation as well as in network scheduling and routing. This paper provides an overview of AANET solutions by characterizing the associated scenarios, requirements, and challenges. Explicitly, the research addressing the key techniques of AANETs, such as their mobility models, network scheduling and routing, security, and interference, is reviewed. Furthermore, we also identify the remaining challenges associated with developing AANETs and present their prospective solutions as well as open issues. The design framework of AANETs and the key technical issues are investigated along with some recent research results. Furthermore, a range of performance metrics optimized in designing AANETs and a number of representative multiobjective optimization algorithms are outlined.

TI INTEGRATED MILLIMETER WAVE AND SUB-6 GHZ WIRELESS NETWORKS: A ROADMAP
   FOR JOINT MOBILE BROADBAND AND ULTRA-RELIABLE LOW-LATENCY COMMUNICATIONS
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Next-generation wireless networks must enable emerging technologies such as augmented reality and connected autonomous vehicles via a wide range of wireless services that span enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Existing wireless systems that solely rely on the scarce sub-6 GHz, mu W frequency bands will be unable to meet such stringent and mixed service requirements for future wireless services due to spectrum scarcity. Meanwhile, operating at high-frequency mmWave bands is seen as an attractive solution, primarily due to the bandwidth availability and possibility of large-scale multi-antenna communication. However, even though leveraging the large bandwidth at mmWave frequencies can potentially boost the wireless capacity for eMBB services and reduce the transmission delay for low-latency applications, mmWave communication is inherently unreliable due to its susceptibility to blockage, high path loss, and channel uncertainty. Hence, to provide URLLC and high-speed wireless access, it is desirable to seamlessly integrate the reliability of mW networks with the high capacity of mmWave networks. To this end, in this article, the first comprehensive tutorial for integrated mmWave-mW communications is introduced. This envisioned integrated design will enable wireless networks to achieve URLLC along with eMBB by leveraging the best of two worlds: reliable, long-range communications at the mW bands and directional high-speed communications at the mmWave frequencies. To achieve this goal, key solution concepts are discussed that include new architectures for the radio interface, URLLC-aware frame structure and resource allocation methods along with mobility management, to realize the potential of integrated mmWave-mW communications. The opportunities and challenges of each proposed scheme are discussed and key results are presented to show the merits of the developed integrated mmWave-mW framework.

AB We present the development process behind AtlantikSolar, a small 6.9 kg hand-launchable lowaltitude solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that recently completed an 81-hour continuous flight and thereby established a new flight endurance world record for all aircraft below 50 kg mass. The goal of our work is to increase the usability of such solar-powered robotic aircraft bymaximizing their perpetual flight robustness to meteorological deteriorations such as clouds or winds. We present energetic system models and a design methodology, implement them in our publicly available conceptual design framework for perpetual flight-capable solar-powered UAVs, and finally apply the framework to the AtlantikSolar UAV. We present the detailed AtlantikSolar characteristics as a practical design example. Airframe, avionics, hardware, state estimation, and control method development for autonomous flight operations are described. Flight data are used to validate the conceptual design framework. Flight results from the continuous 81-hour and 2,338 km covered ground distance flight show that AtlantikSolar achieves 39% minimum state-ofcharge, 6.8 h excess time and 6.2 h charge margin. These performance metrics are a significant improvement over previous solar-powered UAVs. A performance outlook shows that AtlantikSolar allows perpetual flight in a 6-month window around June 21 at mid-European latitudes, and that multi-day flights with small optical-or infrared-camera payloads are possible for the first time. The demonstrated performance represents the current state-of-the-art in solar-powered low-altitude perpetual flight performance. We conclude with lessons learned from the three-year AtlantikSolar UAV development process and with a sensitivity analysis that identifies the most promising technological areas for future solar-powered UAV performance improvements.

AB Imagery collected from Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) provides a novel means of monitoring changes in benthic ecosystems over large spatial scales and depth ranges. However, for many benthic ecosystems there is little baseline data to quantify temporal and spatial variance for key indicator species. This information is crucial for isolating background "noise" from long-term "signals". Here we quantify components of variance for five key deep-water sessile invertebrate species across four long-term benthic monitoring sites in a region undergoing strong climate-driven changes. We use linear mixed models to estimate the contribution of sources of spatial and temporal variance in species covers from empirical data. We then combine this information with projected long-term climate-driven changes in the cover of these groups and test the power of various survey designs to detect change through time. Large short-term temporal and spatial variability in the cover of a gorgonian octocoral results in high components of variance that limit the detectability of the projected long-term trend for this species. Conversely, for three of the sponge species high power is achievable with revisits to the four original sites every two years until 2060. By including more sites in the revisit design, high power can be achieved with less frequent revisits. For the fifth species, we find high power is unachievable due to the small trend predicted. Overall, we highlight how examination of components of variance in a system can aid in the selection of suitable indicators and the establishment of effective monitoring programs.

AB Wildlife-related accidents are a serious problem in different countries and describing their temporal pattern allows for the development of measures to mitigate them. We described the temporal pattern of wild ungulate-related accidents occurring between January 2006 and December 2010 in the Autonomous Region of Galicia, northwest of Spain. We examined the temporal distribution of the accidents according to months, phenological and hunting seasons, days of the week and time of the day. From the 6,255 wild ungulate-related traffic accidents analysed, 36.5% were related to roe deer Capreolus capreolus and 62.8% were related to wild boar Sus scrofa. The monthly distribution of accidents was not random but follows a characteristic pattern for each species. Roe deer-related accidents have their maximum in April and May, coinciding with the breeding season, followed by July, coinciding with the rut. Wild boar-related accidents have their maximum between October and January, coinciding with the hunting season but also with months with the longest nights. Both roe deer- and wild boar-related accidents showed an increase at weekends, specially on Sundays. During the hunting season, the wild boar-related accidents showed a marked peak on the same day. This weekly pattern was explained by drivers' behaviour and by hunting. For roe deer, peaks of accidents occurred between 19:00 and 22:00 (about dusk) and between 05:00 and 08:00 (about dawn). For wild boar, 69% of accidents occurred between 18:00 and 23:00, coinciding with dusk and night. This daily pattern of accidents was explained by the behaviour of the species.

   online coverage method; path width; Hert planar algorithm
AB This paper presents an online coverage method for the exploration of unknown oceanic terrains using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Working from the concept of planar algorithm developed by Hert, this study attempts to develop an improved method. Instead of theoretical research, it focuses on the practical aspects of exploration by considering the equations of motion for AUVs that are actually used in oceanic exploration as well as on the characteristics of complex oceanic topography and other realistic variables, such as sea current. These elements are used to calculate cross track error (CTE) and path width for AUV movement. The validity of the improved algorithm for terrain coverage is first verified mathematically and then by a simulation of the real underwater environment that analyzes the path length and time taken for the coverage as well as the missed areas, which is the key element of efficiency. In order to apply the improved method to the multi-AUV operation, each AUV was assigned a covering or a scanning role by means of a dynamic role-changing mechanism. The results showed that the multi-AUV operation has an advantage over a single-AUV operation in many ways. The method proposed in this study will be useful not only for commercial applications but also for mine counter-measures (MCMs) and rapid environmental assessments (REAs) as part of naval military operations as well. We also believe that it will be ideal for use in variable oceanic environment, particularly in shallow water terrains. For the purposes of this study, we assume that the communication between AUVs is problem-free.

AB Fluorescence spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for characterizing phytoplankton communities in marine environments. Using different fluorescence spectra techniques, it is now possible to discriminate the major phytoplankton groups. However, most of the current techniques are based on fluorescence excitation measurements, which require stimulation at different wavelengths and thus considerable time to obtain the complete spectral profile. This requirement may be an important constraint for several mobile oceanographic platforms, such as vertical profilers or autonomous underwater vehicles, which require rapid-acquisition instruments. This paper presents a novel technique for classifying fluorescence spectra based on self-organizing maps (SOMs), one of the most popular artificial neural network (ANN) methods. The method is able to achieve phytoplankton discrimination using only fluorescence emission spectra (single wavelength excitation), thus reducing the acquisition time. The discrimination capabilities of SOM using excitation and emission spectra are compared. The analysis shows that the SOM has a good performance using excitation spectra, whereas data preprocessing is required in order to obtain similar discrimination capabilities using emission spectra. The final results obtained using emission spectra indicate that the discrimination is properly achieved even between algal groups, such as diatoms and dinoflagellates, which cannot be discriminated with previous methods. We finally point out that although techniques based on excitation spectra can achieve a better taxonomic accuracy, there are some applications that require faster acquisition processes. Acquiring emission spectra is almost instantaneous, and techniques such as SOM can achieve good classification performance using appropriately preprocessed data.

LA English
DT Article
DE Motion-trajectory analysis; Frenet force analysis; Instantaneous motion
   plane; Zero-force axis
AB The two vectors of applied and constraint forces form a plane, which is not directly related to the Frenet geometry. Nonetheless, the resultant of the applied and constraint forces lies in a plane defined by the Frenet geometry when the motion trajectory (MT) of the mass center of a rigid body is considered. This, however, is not the case for non-centroidal-point trajectories. For both centroidal and non-centroidal points, an instantaneous motion plane defined by the Frenet-frame osculating plane can be determined. This plane contains the absolute velocity and acceleration vectors, inertia forces including centrifugal force, and resultant of the applied and constraint forces acting at the body center of mass. It is shown that the component of the resultant of the applied and constraint forces along the Frenet bi-normal vector is zero when mass-center trajectories are considered, and therefore, the Frenet bi-normal vector is an instantaneous zero-force axis. The MT analysis is generalized to the case of non-centroidal points in which the bi-normal vector is not orthogonal to the plane formed by the two vectors of applied and constraint forces only. Complexities that arise in case of points different from the mass center are highlighted. At zero-curvature points, singularities that can lead to software crashing can be avoided by proper definition of the vector normal to the space curve. Consequently, the spatial Newton equations can always be transformed to instantaneous planar equations. Developing real-time onboard-computer MT algorithms for autonomous vehicles and positive-train control can contribute to avoiding linearization and simplifications of the equations of motion that may lead to wrong results, particularly in extreme dynamics that characterizes accidents.

AB This paper proposes a Cooperative-Relay Neighboring-Based Energy-Efficient Routing (CR-NBEER) protocol with advanced relay optimization for MUSN. The utilization of the relay nodes, among all other sensor nodes, makes it possible to achieve node-to-node deployment. The proposed method focuses only on cooperation and relay optimization schemes. Both schemes have previously been implemented, and thus the proposed method represents the extended version of the Neighboring-Based Energy-Efficient Routing (NBEER) protocol. Path loss, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, and energy consumption parameters were considered as part of the performance evaluation. The average performance was revealed based on simulations, where the overall average EED of Co-UWSN was measured to be 35.5 ms, CEER was measured to be 26.7 ms, NBEER was measured to be 27.6 ms, and CR-NBEER was measured to be 19.3 ms. Similarly, the overall EC of Co-UWSN was measured to be 10.759 j, CEER was measured to be 8.694 j, NBEER was measured to be 8.309 j, and CR-NBEER was measured to be 7.644 j. The overall average PDR of Co-UWSN was calculated to be 79.227%, CEER was calculated to be 66.73.464%, NBEER was calculated to be 85.82%, and CR-NBEER was calculated to be 94.831%. The overall average PL of Co-UWSN was calculated at 137.5 dB, CEER was calculated at 230 dB, NBEER was calculated at 173.8 dB, and CR-NBEER was calculated at 79.9 dB. Based on the simulations and evaluations, it was observed that the cooperation and relay optimization scheme outperformed previous schemes.

AB With the development of deep learning technology and the abundance of sensors, machine vision applications that utilize vast amounts of image/video data are rapidly increasing in the autonomous vehicle, video surveillance and smart city fields. However, achieving a more compact image/video representation and lower latency solutions is challenging for such machine-based applications. Therefore, it is essential to develop a more efficient video coding standard for machine vision applications. Currently, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is developing a new standard called video coding for machines (VCM) with two tracks, each mainly dealing with compression of the input image/video (Track 2) and compression of the features extracted from it (Track 1). In this paper, an enhanced multiscale feature compression (E-MSFC) method is proposed to efficiently compress multiscale features generated by a feature pyramid network (FPN), which is the backbone network of machine vision networks specified in the VCM evaluation framework. The proposed E-MSFC reduces the feature channels to be included in a single feature map and compresses the feature map using versatile video coding (VVC), the latest video standard, rather than the single stream feature compression (SSFC) module in the existing MSFC. In addition, the performance of the E-MSFC is further enhanced by adding a bottom-up structure to the multiscale feature fusion (MSFF) module, which performs the channel-wise reduction in the E-MSFC. Experimental results reveal that the proposed E-MSFC significantly outperforms the VCM image anchor with a BD-rate gain of up to 85.94%, which includes an additional gain of 0.96% achieved by the MSFF with the bottom-up structure.

AB An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an autonomous flying robot that has attracted the interest of several communities because of its capacity to increase the safety and productivity of labor. In terms of software engineering, UAV system development is extremely difficult because the focus is not only on functional requirement fulfillment, but also on nonfunctional requirements such as security and safety, which play a crucial role in mission success. Consequently, architecture robustness is very important, and one of the most common architectures developed is based on a centralized pattern in which all UAVs are controlled from a central location. Even though this is a very important problem, many developers must expend a great deal of effort to adapt and improve security. This is because there are few practical perspectives of security development in the context of UAV system development; therefore, the study of attack and defense patterns in centralized architecture is required to fill this knowledge gap. This paper concentrates on enhancing the security aspect of UAV system development by examining attack and defense patterns in centralized architectures. We contribute to the field by identifying 26 attack variations, presenting corresponding countermeasures from a software analyst's standpoint, and supplying a node.js code template for developers to strengthen their systems' security. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the proposed defense strategies in terms of time and space complexity, ensuring their effectiveness. By providing a focused and in-depth perspective on security patterns, our research offers crucial guidance for communities and developers working on UAV-based systems, facilitating the development of more secure and robust solutions.

Command and Control (C2) systems must sustain network-centric operations and guarantee C2 agility in situations in which the dynamics of the operational scenario require new network paradigms to deal with autonomous equipment, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), along with troopers and decision makers that need the right information at the right time. These entities constitute the Internet of Battle Things (IoBT), where the monitoring ability of smart things produces valuable information to be processed by peer-to-peer C2 applications. To address these issues, this work proposes a combination of Software Defined Networks (SDN) with Information Centric Networks (ICN) to meet the high level C2 requirements within deployed military mobile ad hoc networks. ICN provides an efficient data distribution mechanism and SDN controls the patterns of interaction among the IoBT heterogeneous nodes, as well as acts as an enabler for ICN to be integrated with the rest of the IP military cloud. A proof of concept of the architecture was implemented and compared with IP only and SDN-IP networks. The experiments performed to evaluate the implemented solution provided results showing a significant improvement of end-to-end delay and network load of the proposed architecture compared to conventional approaches.

ID VIDEO DESCRIPTION
AB A thorough analysis and comprehension of the entire cue set in visual data are indispensable for an ideal video description model. As outlined in recent algorithm proposals, video descriptions have primarily been generated by learning RGB and optical flow representations rather than exploring and incorporating the media's spectral components referring to the patterns or characteristics in the distribution of colors or intensities across different frequencies or wavelengths of light. These components may enhance the description quality and impact the generated text for accuracy, diversity, and coherence. We propose a novel Fourier-based algorithm for extracting spectral features in 3D visual volume by decomposing the video signal into its frequency components, to fill this research gap. Further, the captured spectral features are fused with learned spatial and temporal representations in recurrent transformer architecture for accurate content understanding and appropriate description generation in natural language. The transformer includes an external memory module that produces summarized memory states based on the history of previously observed video fragments and already-generated sentences. These memory states ensure the establishment of sound semantic and linguistic cues. As a result, our proposed algorithm integrates spatial, temporal, spectral, and semantic representations for precise and grammatically accurate descriptions. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm for the coherent and diverse video description is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experimentation on the DeepRide driving trip description dataset. A comprehensive ablation study validates the efficacy of the spectral features fusion with spatial and temporal visual representations for the rich video-to-textual narration generation.

AB Autonomous vehicles and mobile robotic systems are typically equipped with multiple sensors to provide redundancy. By integrating the observations from different sensors, these mobile agents are able to perceive the environment and estimate system states, e.g., locations and orientations. Although deep learning (DL) approaches for multimodal odometry estimation and localization have gained traction, they rarely focus on the issue of robust sensor fusion--a necessary consideration to deal with noisy or incomplete sensor observations in the real world. Moreover, current deep odometry models suffer from a lack of interpretability. To this extent, we propose SelectFusion, an end-to-end selective sensor fusion module that can be applied to useful pairs of sensor modalities, such as monocular images and inertial measurements, depth images, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) point clouds. Our model is a uniform framework that is not restricted to specific modality or task. During prediction, the network is able to assess the reliability of the latent features from different sensor modalities and to estimate trajectory at both scale and global pose. In particular, we propose two fusion modules--a deterministic soft fusion and a stochastic hard fusion--and offer a comprehensive study of the new strategies compared with trivial direct fusion. We extensively evaluate all fusion strategies both on public datasets and on progressively degraded datasets that present synthetic occlusions, noisy and missing data, and time misalignment between sensors, and we investigate the effectiveness of the different fusion strategies in attending the most reliable features, which in itself provides insights into the operation of the various models.

TI A Robust Detection Method for Multilane Lines in Complex Traffic Scenes
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID LANE DETECTION
AB The robustness and stability of lane detection is vital for advanced driver assistance vehicle technology and even autonomous driving technology. To meet the challenges of real-time lane detection in complex traffic scenes, a simple but robust multilane detection method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method breaks down the lane detection task into two stages, that is, lane line detection algorithm based on instance segmentation and lane modeling algorithm based on adaptive perspective transform. Firstly, the lane line detection algorithm based on instance segmentation is decomposed into two tasks, and a multitask network based on MobileNet is designed. This algorithm includes two parts: lane line semantic segmentation branch and lane line Id embedding branch. The lane line semantic segmentation branch is mainly used to obtain the segmentation results of lane pixels and reconstruct the lane line binary image. The lane line Id embedding branch mainly determines which pixels belong to the same lane line, thereby classifying different lane lines into different categories and then clustering these different categories. Secondly, the adaptive perspective transformation model is adopted. In this model, the motion information is used to accurately convert the original image into a bird's-eye view image, and then the least-squares second-order polynomial fitting is performed on the lane line pixels. Finally, experiments on the CULane dataset show that the proposed method achieved similar or better performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the F-1 score of the proposed method in the normal test set and most challenge test sets is better than other algorithms, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method, and then the field experiments results show that the proposed method has good practical application value in various complex traffic scenes.

AB The application of strap-down inertial navigation system/long baseline system (SINS/LBL) has been proven to be an effective method to solve the accumulated position error of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, height positioning in the SINS/LBL system is generally unstable. Acoustic differential technology uses single- or double-difference mode to weaken the influence of system errors on signal propagation time, but the vertical positioning result of this method is unstable. Moreover, the accumulative errors of inertial navigation will cause the height positioning errors to diverge over time. In view of the situation that the height positioning results are prone to divergence, the SINS/LBL tightly coupled (SLT) system is studied and an adaptive method based on the improved Sage-Husa adaptive filter is proposed. This method adaptively adjusts the system noise matrix and then utilizes depth information of the pressure sensor (PS) to adaptively estimate the vertical direction errors. To verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm, the simulation experiments compare the positioning results of three fusion methods that are centralized Kalman filter (CKF), federated Kalman filter (FKF), and adaptive height-constraint Kalman filter (AHKF). Simulation results show that the AHKF algorithm improves the precision and stability of underwater SLT navigation system significantly. To some extent, the AHKF algorithm addresses the problem of accumulative errors in the vertical direction in the SLT system. Also, the improvement of height positioning accuracy is hugely helpful to AUV complete mission successfully.

AB The implementation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civil engineering has primarily focused on remote sensing using optical cameras, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and communicating with other sensing systems such as wireless sensor networks. However, UAV-enabled methods for subsurface characterization are still at their naissance. In this study, a UAV was used to lift and drop a mass onto the ground surface. The mass's impact on the ground was used as the impulsive source for multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) testing. For this implementation, a hexarotor UAV was modified to lift and drop 4-7 kg masses to generate Rayleigh surface waves. The frequency domain characteristics of the seismic waves generated by UAV-dropped masses were compared to conventional MASW testing using a sledgehammer. The MASW method using a UAV-deployed source developed herein was applied to a soil site and a solid waste site. It was demonstrated that the UAV-dropped mass can generate Rayleigh surface waves below 10 Hz more effectively than the sledgehammer and could therefore support shear wave velocity profiling to greater depths in the subsurface, possibly without the need for signal stacking. Recommendations for drop mass selection and a discussion of observations made by the authors are also provided. Contributions made in this study are intended to contribute toward remote, fully autonomous subsurface mapping coupled with image-based surface mapping that will be critical for remote site characterization in postearthquake geotechnical reconnaissance and will allow the acquisition of more extensive subsurface data than presently feasible.

AB Significant developments have been made in the observation systems and techniques of estimating sea level towards meeting the standard accuracy requirement of Global Climate Observation Systems (GCOS). This study undertakes a systematic review of the current advances in estimating sea level change in the context of the 4th industrial revolution. Trends in the use of main observation systems such as tide gauges, satellite altimetry, and ancillary systems such as GNSS and Autonomous Surface Vehicles were explored. Crucially, we examined the contribution of dedicated waveform retracking strategies, advanced corrections and radar technology such as Kaband altimetry of SARAL/Altika and SAR mode innovations to the progress in coastal altimetry. Further, we show the role of emerging spatial data science concepts and processing workflows in sea level study. Findings suggest that in-situ sea level observation through tide gauges remains the best approach for long-term coastal sea level study despite its limitations while satellite altimetry is suitable for contemporary global and regional scales. Detailed understating of global, regional and local mean sea level change will require an augmentation of tide gauge, satellite altimetry and other ancillary remote sensing and in situ systems. Densification of tide gauges and co-located GNSS networks at sparsely covered regions and improvement in precision of satellite altimetry data for coastal use are also essential for a fully integrated sea level observation system. From the analysis of over 30 trend models that span exploratory, parametric, non-parametric, stochastic and advanced classes in the literature, we conclude that the best model is the one with good statistical foundation and similar assumption with the sea level pattern.

AB Space robots have been proposed to perform several tasks in orbit, such as repairing, refueling, and assembly. All those activities require the robot to interact with external objects in a safe and compliant form to avoid high impact forces that may damage the robot's components or the object to manipulate. Impedance controllers have demonstrated to be a suitable approach to perform similar tasks in ground. Therefore, implementing and analyzing impedance-based techniques in space is also worthy of study. Not only that, but also, methods that can reduce the number of components, weight and complexity should be considered. This article proposes the use of the disturbance observer for the design of an impedance controller to perform a safe capture of a target satellite by a space robot. First, the observer aids in the determination of the contact force between the servicer and the target. Later, once the almost perfect match between the actual and estimated contact force is demonstrated, the estimated force is used as input for an impedance controller with trajectory tracking. The advantages of estimating the contact force instead of measuring it are also discussed in the document. The design of the impedance control is performed such that the capturing process is compliant and safe, and, thus, it can help to advance toward an autonomous capture of space objects. A simulation experiment was set up to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the contact force is bounded and behaves smoothly in a spring-mass-damper-like manner, imposing a stable contact between the robot's end effector and the servicer's capturing spot.

AB Quantifying details of an animal's foraging strategy can provide insight into its energetic requirements, environmental constraints, and other pressures it must balance in behavioral decision-making. Data from ship-based echosounders provided 4888 observations of Risso's dolphins Grampus griseus in the context of heterogeneous prey fields, while an autonomous underwater vehicle carrying similar instruments was used to describe 519 discrete prey patches containing dolphins. We integrated these data with prey net tows, dolphin surface observations, and results from a parallel tagging study that quantified detailed aspects of behavior of 3 individuals. These data provide complementary perspectives on the foraging strategies of Risso's dolphins at a range of time scales from individual prey patch selection to diel cycles. Rather than being solely nocturnal teuthivores as previously suggested, we found that Risso's dolphins dove to depths exceeding 500 m both day and night. Risso's dolphins switched many times daily from being more generalist predators near the surface to specializing on larger squid at depth, commonly within the course of a single 5-10 min dive. Simple energy calculations suggest that shallow prey comprise relatively small contributions to individual energy gains, yet these prey played a strong role in determining the spatio-temporal habitat use of Risso's dolphins. This underscores the importance of examining strategic foraging behavior in light of requirements to access both prey resources and oxygen. The novel integration of multiple complementary sensing methods employed simultaneously on Risso's dolphins provide remarkable insights into the behavioral ecology of individuals and the population.

AB Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated its extraordinary power on various visual tasks like object detection and classification. However, it is still challenging to deploy state-of-the-art models into real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, due to their expensive computation costs. In this paper, to accelerate the network inference, we introduce a novel pruning method named Drop-path to reduce model parameters of 2D deep CNNs. Given a trained deep CNN, pruning paths with different lengths is achieved by ordering the influence of neurons in each layer on the probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayesian boundary of the model. We believe that the invariance of PAC-Bayesian boundary is an important factor to guarantee the generalization ability of deep CNN under the condition of optimizing as much as possible. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to reduce model size based on the generalization error boundary. After pruning, we observe that the convolutional kernels themselves become sparse, rather than some being removed directly. In fact, Drop-path is generic and can be well generalized on multi-layer and multi-branch models, since parameter ranking criterion can be applied to any kind of layer and the importance scores can still be propagated. Finally, Drop-path is evaluated on two image classification benchmark datasets (ImageNet and CIFAR-10) with multiple deep CNN models, including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-34/50/56/110. Experimental results demonstrate that Drop-path achieves significant model compression and acceleration with negligible accuracy loss.

ID UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC NETWORKS; PROTOCOL; DESIGN
AB As valuable as the Internet of Things (IoT) has been to explore and monitor the land surface of the earth, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has been crucial to the investigation of the underwater environment. Due to the unique characteristics of the IoUT, such as long propagation delays, high bit error rates, and limited bandwidth, acoustic sensors that use sound waves are preferred for deployment. Consequently, it is difficult to apply the medium access control (MAC) protocol designed for the IoT sensors that use radio frequencies (RFs) in the IoUT. Particularly for densely populated sensor networks, the challenging and dynamic underwater environment leads to the loss of control and data packets, resulting in energy waste and unreliable connections. In addition to a sensor being constrained by energy, replacing its battery is infeasible. Therefore, packet loss and energy conservation should be handled at the MAC layer in order to improve the throughput and longevity of the network. In this paper, we propose a REceiver-Initiated MAC based on Energy-efficient Duty cycling called REMEDY-MAC. Using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) for data collection, REMEDY allows a group of nodes to conserve energy by announcing the duty cycling schedule until an AUV arrives at a certain location. Once an AUV reaches a location, it receives data according to a pre-established schedule managed by the active sender node and moves to the next set of nodes after completion of its tasks. The simulation results indicate that the proposed REMEDY protocol significantly outperforms other MAC schemes with respect to network parameters such as energy efficiency.

AB We describe and apply a new inversion method for 3-D modeling of magnetic anomalies designed for general application but which is particularly useful for the interpretation of near-seafloor magnetic anomalies. The crust subsurface is modeled by a set of prismatic cells, each with uniform magnetization, that together reproduce the observed magnetic field. This problem is linear with respect to the magnetization, and the number of cells is normally greater than the amount of available data. Thus, the solution is obtained by solving an under-determined linear problem. A focused solution, exhibiting sharp boundaries between different magnetization domains, is obtained by allowing the amplitudes of magnetization to vary between a pre-determined range and by minimizing the region of the 3-D space where the source shows large variations, i.e., large gradients. A regularization functional based on a depth-weighting function is also introduced in order to counter-act the natural decay of the magnetic field intensity with depth. The inversion method has been used to explore the characteristics of the submarine hydrothermal system of Brothers volcano in the Kermadec arc, by inverting near-bottom magnetic data acquired by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Different surface expressions of the hydrothermal vent fields show specific vertical structures in their underlying demagnetization regions that we interpret to represent hydrothermal upflow zones. For example, at focused vent sites the demagnetized conduits are vertical, pipe-like structures extending to depths of similar to 1000 m below the seafloor, whereas at diffuse vent sites the demagnetization regions are characterized by thin and inclined conduits.

AB Predictive models for tides, hydrodynamics, and bio-optical properties affecting the visibility and buoyancy of coastal waters are needed to evaluate the safety of personnel and equipment engaged in maritime operations under potentially hazardous conditions. Predicted currents can be markedly different for two-layer systems affected by terrestrial runoff than for well-mixed conditions because the layering decouples the surface and bottom Ekman layers and rectifies the current response to oscillatory upwelling- and downwelling-favorable winds. Standard ocean models (e.g., Princeton Ocean Model) require initial and boundary data on the physical and optical properties of the multilayered water column to provide accurate simulations of heat budgets and circulation. Two observational systems are designed to measure vertically structured conditions on the West Florida Shelf (WFS): a tethered buoy network and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) observational system. The AUV system is described with a focus on the observational systems that challenge or limit the communications command and control network for various types of measurement programs. These include vertical oscillatory missions on shelf transects to observe the optical and hydrographic properties of the water column, and bottom following missions for measuring the bottom albedo. Models of light propagation, absorption, and conversion to heat as well as determination of the buoyancy terms for physical models require these measurements. High data rates associated with video bottom imagery are the most challenging for the real-time, command and control communications system, but they are met through a combination of lossless and lossy data-compression methods, depending upon the data rate of the radio links.

AB In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence algorithms has promoted the intelligent transformation of the ship industry; unmanned surface vessels (USVs) have become a widely used representative product. The dynamic window approach (DWA) is an effective robotic collision avoidance algorithm; however, there are deficiencies in its application to the ship field. First, the DWA algorithm does not consider International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), which must be met for ship collision avoidance to ensure the navigational safety of the USV and other ships. Second, the DWA algorithm does not consider the influence of wind and waves on the collision avoidance of USVs in actual navigational environments. Reasonable use of windy and wavy environments not only improves navigational safety but also saves navigational time and fuel consumption, thereby improving the economy. Therefore, this paper proposes an improvement algorithm by DWA referred to as utility DWA (UDWA) based on COLREGs considering the sailing environment. The velocity sampling area was improved by dividing the priority, and the velocity function in the objective function was enhanced to convert the effect of wind and waves on the USVs into a change in velocity. The simulation results showed that the UDWA algorithm optimized the distance to the obstacle ship by 43.25%, 31.36%, and 67.81% in a head-on situation, crossing situation, and overtaking situation, respectively, compared to the COLREGs-compliant DWA algorithm, which considers the COLREGs. The improved algorithm not only follows the COLREGs but also has better flexibility in emergency collision avoidance and can safely and economically navigate and complete collision avoidance in windy and wavy environments.

AB Six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) object pose estimation is a critical task for robot manipulation, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. Category-level 6DoF object pose estimation is trending because it can generalize to same-category unknown objects. However, existing mean shape based methods do not consider that predicting adjustment must model shape differences, which makes these methods still suffer from shape variations among same-category objects, limiting their accuracy. Also, existing methods overlook the importance of object segmentation to 6DoF pose estimation and use an RGB-based object segmentation method with low accuracy. To address these problems, we propose difference-aware shape adjustment and RGB-D feature fusion-based object segmentation for category-level 6DoF object pose estimation. The proposed method encodes shape differences, improving mean shape adjustment and alleviating same-category shape variations. Specifically, a difference-aware shape adjustment network (DASAN) is proposed to model shape differences between the object instance and mean shape by feature subtraction with an attention mechanism. We also propose an RGB-D feature fusion-based object segmentation method that uses a coarse-to-fine framework: a 2D detector and a novel RGB-D feature fusion-based binary classification network for coarse and fine segmentation. Experiments on two well-known datasets demonstrate the proposed method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) pose estimation accuracy. In addition, we construct comparative experiments on the latest dataset (Wild6D) and a self-collected dataset (OBJECTS) and achieve high accuracies, demonstrating the strong generalizability of the proposed method. Also, we apply the proposed method to unknown object grasping, thus demonstrating the practicability of the proposed method.

AB In the wake of advancing technology, autonomous vehicles and robotic systems have burgeoned in popularity across a spectrum of applications ranging from mapping and agriculture to reconnaissance missions. These practical implementations have brought to light an array of scientific challenges, a crucial one among them being Coverage Path Planning (CPP). CPP, the strategic planning of a path that ensures comprehensive coverage of a defined area, while being widely examined in the context of a single-robot system, has found its complexity magnified in the multi-robot scenario. A prime hurdle in multi-robot CPP is the division and allocation of the operation area among the robots. Traditional methods, largely reliant on the number of robots and their initial positions to segment the space, often culminate in suboptimal area division. This deficiency can occasionally render the problem unsolvable due to the sensitivity of most area division algorithms to the robots' starting points. Addressing this predicament, our research introduced an innovative methodology that employs Affinity Propagation (AP) for area allocation in multi-robot CPP. In our approach, the area is partitioned into 'n' clusters through AP, with each cluster subsequently assigned to a robot. Although the model operates under the assumption of an unlimited robot count, it offers flexibility during execution, allowing the user to modify the AP algorithm's similarity function factor to regulate the number of generated clusters. Serving as a significant progression in multi-robot CPP, the proposed model provides an innovative approach to area division and path optimization, thereby setting a strong foundation for future exploration and practical enhancements in this field.

AB It is important to estimate the exact depth from 2D images, and many studies have been conducted for a long period of time to solve depth estimation problems. Recently, as research on estimating depth from monocular camera images based on deep learning is progressing, research for estimating accurate depths using various techniques is being conducted. However, depth estimation from 2D images has been a problem in predicting the boundary between objects. In this paper, we aim to predict sophisticated depths by emphasizing the precise boundaries between objects. We propose a depth estimation network with encoder-decoder structures using the Laplacian pyramid and local planar guidance method. In the process of upsampling the learned features using the encoder, the purpose of this step is to obtain a clearer depth map by guiding a more sophisticated boundary of an object using the Laplacian pyramid and local planar guidance techniques. We train and test our models with KITTI and NYU Depth V2 datasets. The proposed network constructs a DNN using only convolution and uses the ConvNext networks as a backbone. A trained model shows the performance of the absolute relative error (Abs_rel) 0.054 and root mean square error (RMSE) 2.252 based on the KITTI dataset and absolute relative error (Abs_rel) 0.102 and root mean square error 0.355 based on the NYU Depth V2 dataset. On the state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation, our network performance shows the fifth-best performance based on the KITTI Eigen split and the eighth-best performance based on the NYU Depth V2.

AB Mangroves, which are vulnerable to natural threats and human activities on small islands in the tropics, play an essential role as carbon sinks, helping to mitigate climate change. In this study, we discussed the effect of natural factors on mangrove sustainability by analyzing the impact of rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), and tidal inundation on the greenness of mangroves in Karimunjawa National Park (KNP), Indonesia. We used Sentinel-2 image data to obtain the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) during the dry season to determine the effect of inundation on mangrove greenness and soil moisture. The tidal inundation area was calculated using topographic data from the KNP and tidal observations from the area adjacent to it. Unmanned autonomous vehicles and topographic data were used to estimate mangrove canopy height. We also calculated mangrove greenness phenology and compared it to rainfall from satellite data from 2019-2021. Results show that the intertidal area is dominated by taller mangroves and has higher NDVI and NDMI values than non-intertidal areas. We also observed that mangroves in intertidal areas are mostly evergreen, and optimum greenness in KNP occurs from February to October, with maximum greenness in July. Cross-correlation analysis suggests that high rainfall affects NDVI, with peak greenness occurring three months after high rainfall. The LST and NDVI cross-correlation showed no time lag. This suggests that LST was not the main factor controlling mangrove greenness, suggesting tides and rainfall influence mangrove greenness. The mangroves are also vulnerable to climate variability and change, which limits rainfall. However, sea-level rise due to climate change might positively impact mangrove greenness.

AB Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates are widely used in vessel side plate, underwater propeller, and submarine oil pipeline because they possess superior specific strength and hydrophobicity compared with metal materials. However, conventional CFRP laminates are limited by insufficient mechanical properties and incompetent water-repellent performance. Herein, a biomimetic double-helicoidal superhydrophobic laminate (BDHSL) was designed and manufactured through a method combining hot press forming and two-step spraying. The BDHSL was composed of double-helicoidal (inspired by coelacanth scale) carbon fiber prepreg and SiO2-based coating with multiscale hierarchical structures (inspired by lotus leaf), which displayed excellent mechanical properties and water-repellency. Besides, mechanical tests were carried out systematically. Remarkably, the peak impact force of the BDHSL at the impact energy of 20 J was 2865.25 N, which increased by 136.88% compared with traditional unidirectional laminate (UL 1209.56 N). Meanwhile, the finite element simulation was conducted using 3D Hashin's failure criteria. The simulation results showed that the predicted stress deflection curve for four types of laminates correlated well with experimental results. Moreover, the water contact angle of BDHSL reached approximately 156.5 degrees, which indicated its superhydrophobicity. What is more, the durability and water-repellency of the SiO2-based coatings were investigated, which further confirmed its potential underwater applicability. The investigations in this work offer a promising way to effectively design and fabricate exquisitely structured CFRP laminates with hierarchically textured coatings that are more suitable for various marine applications under practical conditions, such as offshore oil drilling platform, autonomous underwater vehicle, high-speed ship, and so forth.

AB EM-APEX floats as autonomous vehicles have been used for profiling temperature, salinity, and current velocity for more than a decade. In the traditional method for processing horizontal current velocity from float measurements, signals of surface wave motion are removed as residuals. Here, a new data processing method is proposed for deriving the horizontal velocity of surface waves at the floats. Combined with the vertical acceleration measurements of waves, surface wave directional spectra E(f, theta) can be computed. This method is applied to the float measurements on the right of Typhoon Megi's 2010 track. At 0.6 days before the passage of Megi's eye to the floats, the fast-propagating swell may affect wind waves forced by the local storm wind. When the storm moves closer to the floats, the increasing wind speed and decreasing angle between wind and dominant wave direction may enhance the wind forcing and form a monomodal spectrum E(f). The peak frequency f(p) ~ 0.08 Hz and significant wave height > 10 m are found near the eyewall. After the passage of the eye to the floats, f(p) increases to > 0.1 Hz. Although E(f) still has a single spectral peak at the rear-right quadrant of Megi, E(f, theta) at frequencies from 0.08 to 0.12 Hz has waves propagating in three different directions as a trimodal spectrum, partially due to the swell propagating from the rear-left quadrant. Enhancing the capability of EM-APEX floats to observe wave spectra is critical for exploring the roles of surface waves in the upper ocean dynamics in the future.

AB Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have been widely used for information distribution tasks. The radio communication channels that are established dynamically between the different terminals of these networks, like wireless sensors, ground vehicles, and autonomous assets (e.g. UAVs), allow for a flexible and efficient information distribution process. However, given the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of MANETs, the performance of such systems is often limited by their resiliency against connection interruptions caused by different actors, such as adverse weather conditions, random component breakdowns, physical barriers, and adversarial attacks. Whenever this type of connection interruption occur, the MANET losses its ability to distribute the information efficiently, causing delays that often reduce the value of the information being sent over the network. In this paper, we are interested in analyzing the performance of this type of networks in the presence of such interruptions. To this end, we first transform the information distribution process into a flow problem over a time-expanded directed acyclic graph, setting as the objective function the maximization of the time-discounted value of the distributed data. To analyze the resiliency of the resulting information distribution plans, we take the stance of an adversary and apply network interdiction techniques to estimate the worst possible deterioration that could be inflicted by targeting some connections of the MANET. The interdiction scheme we introduce can be adapted to model various situations and contexts. Finally, we test our framework on instances of different sizes and analyze some interesting properties observed in the experiments.

AB Since deep neural networks may classify out-of-distribution image data into in-distribution classes with high confidence scores, this problem may cause serious or even fatal hazards in certain applications, such as autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis. Therefore, out-of-distribution detection (also called anomaly detection or outlier detection) of image classification has become a critical issue for the successful development of neural networks. In other words, a successful neural network needs to be able to distinguish anomalous data that is significantly different from the data used in training. In this paper, we propose an efficient data augmentation network to detect out-of-distribution image data by introducing a set of common geometric operations into training and testing images. The output predicted probabilities of the augmented data are combined by an aggregation function to provide a confidence score to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution image data. Different from other approaches that use out-of-distribution image data for training networks, we only use in-distribution image data in the proposed data augmentation network. This advantage makes our approach more practical than other approaches, and can be easily applied to various neural networks to improve security in practical applications. The experimental results show that the proposed data augmentation network outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in various datasets. In addition, pre-training techniques can be integrated into the data augmentation network to make substantial improvements to large and complex data sets.

AB Robotic multi-agent systems can efficiently handle spatially distributed tasks in dynamic environments. Problem instances of particular interest, and generality are the dynamic traveling repairman problem, and the dynamic vehicle routing problem. Operational policies for robotic fleets solving these two problems take decisions in an online setting with continuously arriving demands to optimize service level, and efficiency, and can be classified along several lines. First, some require a model of the demand, e.g., based on historical information, while others work model-free. Second, they are designed for different operating conditions from light to heavy system load. Third, they work in a time-invariant or time-varying setting. We present a novel class of model-free operational policies for time-varying demands, which have performance independent of the load factor, a combination of properties not achieved by other operational policies in the literature. The underlying principle of the introduced policies is to send available robots to recent service request locations. In simple terms, they rely on sending more than one robot for every service request arriving to the system. This leads to an advantage in scenarios where demand is non-uniformly distributed, and correlated in space, and time. We provide performance guarantees for both the time-invariant, and the time-varying cases as well as for correlated demand. We verify our theoretical results numerically. Finally, we apply our operational policy to the problem of mobility-on-demand fleet operation, and demonstrate that it outperforms model-based, and complex algorithms across all load ranges, despite its simplicity.

AB We present a vision-based algorithm that identifies the boundary separating water from land in a river environment containing specular reflections. Our approach relies on the law of reflection. Assuming the surface of water behaves like a horizontal mirror, the border separating land from water corresponds to the border separating three-dimensional (3D) data which are either above or below the surface of water. We detect a river by identifying this border in a stereo camera. We start by demonstrating how to robustly estimate the normal and height of the water's surface with respect to a stereo camera. Then, we segment water from land by identifying the boundary separating dense 3D stereo data which are either above or below the water's surface. We explicitly show how to find this boundary by formulating and solving a graph-based optimization problem using dense 3D stereo data near the shoreline and Dijkstra's algorithm. With the border of water identified, we validate the proposed river boundary detection algorithm by applying it to a chronologically sequential video sequence obtained from the visual-inertial canoe data set. The intended purpose of the proposed river segmentation algorithm is to be used as a front-end object recognition module for solving the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem; therefore, using the extracted river boundary, we apply the recently developed visual-inertial Curve SLAM algorithm to localize a canoe and create a sparse map that recovers the outline, shape, and dimensions of the shoreline of a river.

AB Wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of spatially distributed miniature size and autonomous nodes along with batteries as a power source. The major bottleneck of WSN is efficient energy utilization. The energy consumption for transmission of signals increases with the distance. This problem of energy consumption is addressed in this study. This study presents a strategy, namely distance-based dynamic duty-cycle allocation (DBDDCA) algorithm. In DBDDCA, longer distance nodes from cluster head (CH) transmit relatively less time in order to save energy. Conversely, transmit for the higher time when the distance is near to CH. The proposed DBDDCA is compared with the other existing strategies: low-energy adaptive cluster hierarchy (LEACH), modified leach, and stable election protocol and with two existing medium access control (MAC) protocols: sensor (S)-MAC and timeout (T)-MAC. The performance of the proposed and existing strategies is evaluated with the following network parameters: energy consumption, network energy utilization, network lifetime, latency, and packets delivery. These parameters have been evaluated with different network scenarios such as number of nodes increases, number of rounds, and with variation in initial energy of nodes. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed strategy is significantly better than the existing strategies under the investigated network parameters.

AB Automated driving has made considerable progress recently. The multisensor fusion system is a game changer in making self-driving cars possible. In the near future, multisensor fusion will be necessary to meet the high accuracy needs of automated driving systems. This paper proposes a multisensor fusion design, including an inertial navigation system (INS), a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), to implement 3D simultaneous localization and mapping (INS/GNSS/3D LiDAR-SLAM). The proposed fusion structure enhances the conventional INS/GNSS/odometer by compensating for individual drawbacks such as INS-drift and error-contaminated GNSS. First, a highly integrated INS-aiding LiDAR-SLAM is presented to improve the performance and increase the robustness to adjust to varied environments using the reliable initial values from the INS. Second, the proposed fault detection exclusion (FDE) contributes SLAM to eliminate the failure solutions such as local solution or the divergence of algorithm. Third, the SLAM position velocity acceleration (PVA) model is used to deal with the high dynamic movement. Finally, an integrity assessment benefits the central fusion filter to avoid failure measurements into the update process based on the information from INS-aiding SLAM, which increases the reliability and accuracy. Consequently, our proposed multisensor design can deal with various situations such as long-term GNSS outage, deep urban areas, and highways. The results show that the proposed method can achieve an accuracy of under 1 meter in challenging scenarios, which has the potential to contribute the autonomous system.

AB Prospective environmental assessment of emerging technology is necessary in order to inform designers of beneficial changes early in a technology's development, and policy makers looking to fund projects and nudge manufacturers toward the most sustainable application of a technology. Existing analyses often have shortcomings such as failing to consider the environmental impacts in all stages of a product's life cycle; implicitly assuming that the emerging technology will be cost-effective wherever it is technically viable; and assuming optimistic application scenarios that discontinue long-established trends in human behavior. In this article, we propose a new approach, complementary to the prospective and anticipatory life cycle assessment literature, addressing the above concerns and attempting to make sense of the large uncertainties inherent in such analyses by using distributions to model all the inputs. The paper focuses on emerging manufacturing technologies, such as incremental sheet forming (ISF), but the issues examined are also applicable to new end-use products, such as autonomous vehicles. This paper makes use of approaches (such as Bass modeling and product cannibalization considerations) familiar to those in the business community who anticipate market diffusion of a new technology and the effect on existing technology sales. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by estimating the potential environmental impacts in the U.S. car industry by 2030 of an emerging double-sided ISF process. Energy and cost models of ISF and drawing are used to estimate potential mean savings of around 100 TJ(primary) and 60 million U.S. dollars per year by 2030.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB Usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is growing rapidly in a wide range of consumer applications, as they prove to be both autonomous and flexible in a variety of environments and tasks. However, this versatility and ease of use also brings a rapid evolution of threats by malicious actors that can use UAVs for criminal activities, converting them to passive or active threats. The need to protect critical infrastructures and important events from such threats has brought advances in counter UAV (c-UAV) applications. Nowadays, c-UAV applications offer systems that comprise a multi-sensory arsenal often including electro-optical, thermal, acoustic, radar and radio frequency sensors, whose information can be fused to increase the confidence of threat's identification. Nevertheless, real-time surveillance is a cumbersome process, but it is absolutely essential to detect promptly the occurrence of adverse events or conditions. To that end, many challenging tasks arise such as object detection, classification, multi-object tracking and multi-sensor information fusion. In recent years, researchers have utilized deep learning based methodologies to tackle these tasks for generic objects and made noteworthy progress, yet applying deep learning for UAV detection and classification is considered a novel concept. Therefore, the need to present a complete overview of deep learning technologies applied to c-UAV related tasks on multi-sensor data has emerged. The aim of this paper is to describe deep learning advances on c-UAV related tasks when applied to data originating from many different sensors as well as multi-sensor information fusion. This survey may help in making recommendations and improvements of c-UAV applications for the future.

AB This work examines the physical effect of the edge-induced acoustic radiation force and torque on an acoustically radiating infinitely-long circular cylindrical source, located near a rigid corner. Assuming harmonic (linear) radiating waves of the source, vibrating in monopole or dipole radiation modes near a rigid corner-space in a non-viscous fluid, the modal series expansion method in cylindrical coordinates, the classical method of images and the translational addition theorem are applied to obtain the mathematical expressions for the radiation force and torque components in exact partial-wave series. Computational results illustrate the theory, and examine some of the conditions where the radiation force and torque components vanish, which has the potential to achieve total motion suppression (i.e., translation or rotation). Furthermore, depending on the size parameter of the source and the distances from the rigid corner space, these physical observables take positive or negative values, anticipating the prediction of pulling/pushing motions toward the corner space, and possible spinning of the source clockwise or counter-clockwise. The present analysis and its results may be useful in some applications related to underwater acoustical oceanographic engineering of submerged objects, cloaking and stealth technology development and the experimental design of elongated unmanned autonomous vehicles or submarines, as well as the manipulation of an active carrier or ultrasound contrast agents of elongated cylindrical shapes near a corner space or chamber walls at a right angle.

ID AUTOMATED EXTRACTION; APPEARANCE; SHAPE
AB Road markings play a critical role in road traffic safety and are one of the most important elements for guiding autonomous vehicles (AVs). High-Definition (HD) maps with accurate road marking information are very useful for many applications ranging from road maintenance, improving navigation, and prediction of upcoming road situations within AVs. This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for road marking extraction, classification and completion from three-dimensional (3D) mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds. Compared with existing road marking extraction methods, which are mostly based on intensity thresholds, our method is less sensitive to data quality. We added the step of road marking completion to further optimize the results. At the extraction stage, a modified U-net model was used to segment road marking pixels to overcome the intensity variation, low contrast and other issues. At the classification stage, a hierarchical classification method by integrating multi-scale clustering with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) was developed to classify different types of road markings with considerable differences. At the completion stage, a method based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was developed to complete small-size road markings first, then followed by completing broken lane lines and adding missing markings using a context-based method. In addition, we built a point cloud road marking dataset to train the deep network model and evaluate our method. The dataset contains urban road and highway MLS data and underground parking lot data acquired by our own assembled backpacked laser scanning system. Our experimental results obtained using the point clouds of different scenes demonstrated that our method is very promising for road marking extraction, classification and completion.

TI Embedding Structured Contour and Location Prior in Siamesed Fully
   Convolutional Networks for Road Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Road detection; siamesed fully convolutional networks; structured
   contour; location prior
AB Road detection from the perspective of moving vehicles is a challenging issue in autonomous driving. Recently, many deep learning methods spring up for this task, because they can extract high-level local features to find road regions from raw RGB data, such as convolutional neural networks and fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, how to detect the boundary of road accurately is still an intractable problem. In this paper, we propose siamesed FCNs (named "s-FCN-loc"), which is able to consider RGB-channel images, semantic contours, and location priors simultaneously to segment the road region elaborately. To be specific, the s-FCN-loc has two streams to process the original RGB images and contour maps, respectively. At the same time, the location prior is directly appended to the siamesed FCN to promote the final detection performance. Our contributions are threefold: 1) An s-FCN-loc is proposed that learns more discriminative features of road boundaries than the original FCN to detect more accurate road regions. 2) Location prior is viewed as a type of feature map and directly appended to the final feature map in s-FCN-loc to promote the detection performance effectively, which is easier than other traditional methods, namely, different priors for different inputs (image patches). 3) The convergent speed of training s-FCN-loc model is 30% faster than the original FCN because of the guidance of highly structured contours. The proposed approach is evaluated on the KITTI road detection benchmark and one-class road detection data set, and achieves a competitive result with the state of the arts.

AB In power systems, the traditional, non-interactive, andmanually controlled power grid has been transformed to a cyber-dominated smart grid. This cyber-physical integration has provided the smart grid with communication, monitoring, computation, and controlling capabilities to improve its reliability, energy efficiency, and flexibility. A microgrid is a localized and semi-autonomous group of smart energy systems that utilizes the above-mentioned capabilities to drive modern technologies such as electric vehicle charging, home energy management, and smart appliances. Design, upgrading, test, and verification of these microgrids can get too complicated to handle manually. The complexity is due to the wide range of solutions and components that are intended to address the microgrid problems. This article presents a novel Model-Based Design (MBD) methodology to model, co-simulate, design, and optimize microgrid and its multi-level controllers. This methodology helps in the design, optimization, and validation of a microgrid for a specific application. The application rules, requirements, and design-time constraints are met in the designed/optimized microgrid while the implementation cost is minimized. Based on our novel methodology, a design automation, co-simulation, and analysis tool, called GridMAT, is implemented. Our experiments have illustrated that implementing a hierarchical controller reduces the average power consumption by 8% and shifts the peak load for cost saving. Moreover, optimizing the microgrid design using our MBD methodology considering smart controllers has decreased the total implementation cost. Compared to the conventional methodology, the cost decreases by 14% and compared to the MBD methodology where smart controllers are not considered, it decreases by 5%.

AB We present the estimation of a likelihood map for the location of the source of a chemical plume dispersed under atmospheric turbulence under uniform wind conditions. The main contribution of this work is to extend previous proposals based on Bayesian inference with binary detections to the use of concentration information while at the same time being robust against the presence of background chemical noise. For that, the algorithm builds a background model with robust statistics measurements to assess the posterior probability that a given chemical concentration reading comes from the background or from a source emitting at a distance with a specific release rate. In addition, our algorithm allows multiple mobile gas sensors to be used. Ten realistic simulations and ten real data experiments are used for evaluation purposes. For the simulations, we have supposed that sensors are mounted on cars which do not have among its main tasks navigating toward the source. To collect the real dataset, a special arena with induced wind is built, and an autonomous vehicle equipped with several sensors, including a photo ionization detector (PID) for sensing chemical concentration, is used. Simulation results show that our algorithm, provides a better estimation of the source location even for a low background level that benefits the performance of binary version. The improvement is clear for the synthetic data while for real data the estimation is only slightly better, probably because our exploration arena is not able to provide uniform wind conditions. Finally, an estimation of the computational cost of the algorithmic proposal is presented.

DT Article
AB Few research institutions from Mexico work together to finalize the integration of a technological demonstration microsatellite called Satex, aiming the launching of the first ever fully designed and manufactured domestic space vehicle. The project is based on technical knowledge gained in previous space experiences, particularly in developing GASCAN automatic experiments for NASA's space shuttle, and in some support obtained from the local team which assembled the Mexico-OSCAR-30 microsatellites. Satex includes three autonomous payloads and a power subsystem, each one with a local microcomputer to provide intelligent and dedicated control. It also contains a flight computer (FC) with a pair of full redundancies. This enables the remote maintenance of processing boards from the ground station. A fourth communications payload depends on the flight computer for control purposes.
   A fifth payload was decided to be developed for the satellite. It adds value to the available on-board computers and extends the opportunity for a developing country to learn and to generate domestic space technology. Its aim is to provide automatic maintenance capabilities for the most critical on-board computer in order to achieve continuous satellite operations. This paper presents the virtual computer architecture specially developed to provide maintenance capabilities to the flight computer. The architecture is periodically implemented by software with a small amount of physical processors (FC processors) and virtual redundancies (payload processors) to emulate a hybrid redundancy computer. Communications among processors are accomplished over a fault-tolerant LAN. This allows a versatile operating behavior in terms of data communication as well as in terms of distributed fault tolerance. Obtained results, payload validation and reliability results are also presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Millimeter-wave radar and optical cameras are one of the primary sensing combinations for autonomous platforms such as self-driving vehicles and disaster monitoring robots. The millimeter-wave radar odometry can perform self-pose estimation and environmental mapping. However, cumulative errors can arise during extended measurement periods. In particular scenes where loop closure conditions are absent and visual geometric features are discontinuous, existing loop detection methods based on back-end optimization face challenges. To address this issue, this study introduces a correlative scan matching (CSM) pose estimation method that integrates visual and radar line features (VRL-SLAM). By making use of the pose output and the occupied grid map generated by the front end of the millimeter-wave radar's simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), it compensates for accumulated errors by matching discontinuous visual line features and radar line features. Firstly, a pose estimation framework that integrates visual and radar line features was proposed to reduce the accumulated errors generated by the odometer. Secondly, an adaptive Hough transform line detection method (A-Hough) based on the projection of the prior radar grid map was introduced, eliminating interference from non-matching lines, enhancing the accuracy of line feature matching, and establishing a collection of visual line features. Furthermore, a Gaussian mixture model clustering method based on radar cross-section (RCS) was proposed, reducing the impact of radar clutter points online feature matching. Lastly, actual data from two scenes were collected to compare the algorithm proposed in this study with the CSM algorithm and RI-SLAM.. The results demonstrated a reduction in long-term accumulated errors, verifying the effectiveness of the method.

AB Dynamic positioning (DP) system is an advanced positioning system widely used in various special operation ships, and the design of control strategies to cope with different constraint conditions is the core technology of DP system research. In this study, a novel dual-loop control law is proposed to effectively tackle the control challenges encountered by DP ships, particularly in the presence of input saturation and error constraints. Firstly, a saturation handling model is designed to avoid input saturation in the system. Subsequently, a dual-loop DP control scheme is developed. The outer-loop is responsible for the ship's position and heading control, while concurrently providing the command velocity signal essential for the inner-loop. Specifically, a prescribed performance control strategy is designed in the outer-loop to ensure precise control over positioning errors within predefined ranges and achieve desirable transient and steady-state performance. The inner-loop controls the ship's velocity signal, in which a feedback control law is designed based on Hamilton-Jacobi-Issacs (HJI) inequality to estimate generalized faults of the DP system. Finally, the proposed control law is validated through numerical simulations on a 76.2 m supply ship, demonstrating superior transient and steady-state performance compared to existing methods.

AB In recent times, research in the field of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has primarily concentrated on Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs), which involve networks of numerous UAVs with applications spanning both military and civilian domains. FANETs represent a novel paradigm in aerial autonomous networking. The development of routing protocols for FANETs presents challenges in ensuring data transmission quality and enhancing communication efficiency. A three-dimensional Improvised Trajectory Algorithm (3DITA) is presented in this manuscript, based on a novel adaptive routing technology that influences trajectory modelling. Particularly, the 3DITA addresses the concern of node contact unpredictability in opportunistic communication by predicting the node positions in 3D space. Furthermore, it calculates relevant node trajectory parameters to assess the trajectory characteristics of UAV nodes and prevent the excessive utilization of all UAV nodes. Additionally, it establishes a power-efficient data transmission approach for selecting relay nodes, considering the limited power and memory capacity of UAVs. The results obtained from the simulation confirm that the proposed 3DITA technique considerably enhances the speed of transmission and reduces the latency and overhead of transmission. The novel routing proposal in this paper is also contrasted with three different routing protocols namely-Link Stability Prediction-Based Adaptive Routing (LAPR), Energy-Efficient Opportunistic Routing Protocol Based on Trajectory Prediction (EORBTP), and Routing Algorithm based on Trajectory Prediction (RATP) by using different performance metrics. The practical implementation of the trajectory algorithm proposed here aims to be applied to forest research that includes disease mapping, inventorying supplies, classification of species, monitoring, and assessment of fire, estimation of soil migration post its harvest, and quantification of a regional gap.

AB This work considers the three-dimensional descent path of a space vehicle, from periselenium of its operational orbit to the lunar surface. The trajectory is split in two arcs: (1) descent path, up to an altitude of 50 m, and (2) terminal approach and soft touchdown. For phase 1, a new, three-dimensional locally-flat near-optimal guidance is introduced that is based on the local projection of the position and velocity variables. A minimum-time problem is defined using the locally flat coordinates of position and velocity. This leads to identifying closedform functions of time for the two thrust angles, which identify the commanded thrust direction. During terminal approach (phase 2), correct vertical alignment, modest velocity, and negligible angular rate at touchdown are pursued. With this intent, a predictive bang-off-bang guidance algorithm is proposed that is capable of guaranteeing the desired final conditions. In both phases, the attitude control system has the objective of aligning the actual thrust direction with the commanded one, provided by the guidance algorithm. The resulting reducedattitude control problem is addressed through the use of a new quaternion-based nonlinear control algorithm, which is proven to enjoy asymptotic stability properties. The attitude actuation system is composed of 12 monopropellant thrusters, ignited using pulse width modulation. Monte Carlo simulations are run, assuming significant displacements from the nominal initial conditions and including several harmonics of the selenopotential. The numerical results unequivocally prove that the guidance and control architecture proposed in this study is effective to achieve lunar descent and safe touchdown in nonnominal flight conditions.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving and heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNets), vehicles can collect data and generate valuable information to obtain profits, thus forming a new vehicular self-media paradigm. However, with potential security risks, the current data trading schemes in the HetVNets lack the comprehensive consideration of the requirements of the participants including media data producers (MDPs), media data sellers (MDSs), and media data buyers (MDBs) to design a trading framework that integrates data caching services and data selling services. To this end, we propose an on-demand self-media data trading scheme in HetVNets. Specifically, based on blockchain and smart contracts, we first design an on-demand self-media trading architecture that jointly considers the data caching services and the data selling services to provide the participants with a secure transaction environment. In the data caching phase, by considering the value of media data generated by the MDPs and the sales capabilities of different MDSs, we model the requirements of the MDPs and the MDSs as utility functions and formulate the interactions between them as a Stackelberg game, where an iterative algorithm is designed for the MDPs and the MDSs to obtain their optimal strategies. In the data selling phase, we consider the diversified requirements of the MDBs and propose an iteration-based mechanism to help the MDSs dynamically determine the data selling strategies. Compared with the traditional schemes, the simulation results show that our scheme can obtain the optimal strategies for the MDPs and the MDSs and bring them the highest utilities.

AB Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to train the machines to perform various complicated tasks that begin to modify and improve with experiences. It has become widely used for automated deci-sions. In particular, the applications which have a profound impact on society that rely on Deep Learning (DL) for autonomous decisions, such as Patient Health Record (PHR), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), etc. Such impacts have a vital concern about the potential vulnerabilities introduced by DL. Traditional attackers have powerful motives that can alter and modify DL algorithms to subvert the outcomes. In poisoning attacks, an attacker can consciously change training dataset, which is used to operate the out-comes of decision-based model. While in privacy and evasion attacks, an adversary can also misclassify new datasets to infer private information. Therefore, in this paper, we have provided a review of security and privacy issues of DL algorithms and analyzed their applications and challenges based on state-of-the-art literature. We have classified attacks, devised a taxonomy, and comprehensive analysis of defense techniques for the most common attacks such as poisoning, evasion, model extraction, and model inver-sion. We have also presented various privacy preserving techniques to ensure the privacy of dataset. We have proposed a secure cryptographic framework for dataset based on hash functions and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) scheme. Finally, we have provided recent research challenges and future studies con-cerning security and privacy issues. We believed that the highlighted limitations and weaknesses provide possible research questions and open matters for designing efficient future DL algorithms.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Multiple deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in real-world intelligent applications, such as intelligent robotics and autonomous vehicles to collectively complete complicated tasks running on edge devices. Because each layer of the subtasks prefers a distinct dataflow due to the heterogeneity in shape and scale of the network layers, a variable dataflow approach on the DNN accelerators is urgently required. On DNN accelerators that enable multiple dataflows, however, we detect a dimension mismatch between parallel processing under the dataflow approach and linear data memory arrangement. When multiple DNN tasks share partial features or weights, the issue is further exacerbated. During processing, this mismatch causes a sluggish data supply from both off-chip and on-chip memory. Consequently, the overall throughput, performance, and energy efficiency suffer since DNN models are sensitive to data density. In this work, we reveal the mechanism behind this data dimension mismatch and present a series of metrics that quantify the influence on system performance. On this foundation, we offer a framework that tracks the data tensor dimension conversion and employs a flexible data arrangement over multi-DNN computation to adapt to dataflow variability. An accelerator architecture named data arrangement multi-DNN accelerator (DARMA) that features a data arrangement and distribution circuit and hierarchical memory for data dimension conversion is also presented. Since the mismatch is mitigated, the suggested accelerator outperforms current accelerators in terms of bandwidth and processing unit utilization. Through tests on VR/AR, MLperf, and other multitask applications, the evaluation results show that the proposed architecture provides both energy-efficiency and throughput improvements.

AB Underwater communication is a mode of transmitting or receiving the signals below water. Many applications such as shipments, autonomous vehicle, climate recording etc. use the antennas for transmitting and receiving the signals below water. The antenna design for underwater sensor networks is an emerging field for the researchers, as many of the antenna design have proposed in order to get the better radiation patterns and return loss during the data transmission but the researches are done mostly with narrow band and low frequencies which results in low data rate during transmission of the data. Here in this research paper a novel patch antenna design is proposed with circular insulation provided for its circuitry called as a circular quad band bowtie antenna works with high frequencies and also capable of radiate multiple frequencies from its four tapers. The lack of work in this field is a driving force for the development of an underwater UWB antenna. UWB antennas come in a variety of shapes and sizes, although the majority of them are designed for air communications. To acquire a result, UWB technology is required a high level of resolution for device placement in order to enhance the underwater communication applications. The radiation patterns of the proposed design are omnidirectional and it results the return loss of less than - 25 dB and due to the robust design of the proposed antenna, it can transmit the multiple frequencies via different tapers. The parameters of the proposed antenna are taken for considerations after testing at different frequencies. The future scope of circular quad band bow tie antenna is to use of it in other MIMO applications used in fifth generation of mobile communications.

AB Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the industry and made it possible to develop systems that ensure safety in human-robot collaboration. Mobile and industrial robots need a point of reference in their orientation for avoiding obstacles. Device and sensor technologies, such as acoustic sensors, Global Positioning System (GPS), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), accelerometers, and digital cameras play an important role in providing high resolution and sensitivity to solve complex problems in the industry. However, their cost and the need of applying signal processing techniques to filter their signals may not offer the required reliability for critical applications, such as indoor localization methods for industrial robots. The optical scanning systems (OSS) are devices that can be used instead at a lower cost, compared to the costs of devices previously mentioned. Nevertheless, there is still the challenge of avoiding the filtering of the signal. In this paper, a method to determine the energy center from sensors of an OSS using AI techniques is introduced. It uses defuzzification algorithms to accomplish accuracy measurements for localization and navigation tasks. The advantage of this method is that it eliminates the need of using the filtering process. One of the main contributions of this work is that the results can be used to implement an accurate and efficient indoor localization system, which can be used by an autonomous vehicle, such as industrial robots. According to the statistical analysis carried out, the minimal difference between the real position and the position estimated by the OSS was 0.021 degrees.

AB The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) gradually becomes the future direction of ocean. Many devices, which are called the sources, are deployed in the sea to fulfill scientific, civilian, and military needs. If the locations of these sources are leaked, it will cause a serious economic and military crisis. Thus, in this context, the source location privacy protection becomes critical. In this paper, we focus on the source location privacy protection of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), where a multi-channel interference based source location privacy protection scheme (MCISLP) is proposed. The MCISLP mainly contains four steps. First, to enhance the sense of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) for nodes, a noise reduction method is proposed. Then, based on the previous step, an AUV movement prediction method for nodes is presented to ensure the success of packet transmission. After that, for the information exchange among nodes, given the interference of multiple underwater channels, this interference is then utilized to protect the source location privacy. Further, to reduce the channel interference on the source packet, the time slot control is added to weaken the influence. Last, the ant colony algorithm is adopted for the data collection of AUV. The simulation results show that the MCISLP can increase the network safety time by up to 57% (compared with data collection algorithms), and balance the energy consumption of nodes (for about 20% energy saving), with a minor compromise of energy consumption of AUV and delay.

AB The fundamental diagram and self-organized phenomena in crowds are widely used to test the applicability of evacuation models. These benchmarks are good indicators for the validity of a model, whereas they are insufficient descriptors for the realistic microscopic behaviors of pedestrians. In recent years, the rapid increase of the trajectory datasets which benefits from the development of recognition technologies open the door to new possibilities for an extensive quantitative validation of the models. In this work, a trajectories-based analysis approach which contains types of indexes is proposed. The indexes are a mix of macroscopic type (fundamental diagram index, speed choice index, and direction choice index) and microscopic type (trajectories pattern index), distribution type (route length distribution index, travel time distribution index) and time-series type (starting position distance time-series index, destination position distance time-series index. Moreover, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test as well as the dynamic time warping (DTW) method are introduced to quantify the similarities of results on different types of indexes. In brief, by comparing experimental and simulation trajectories, we can measure a set of performance scores in different perspectives. Here, the Social Force Model (SFM) and Heuristics Model (HM) are respectively introduced and evaluated. According to the proposed evaluation approach, we show that the HM performs better than the SFM. Our analysis approach is model agnostic and is defined in a general way, such that it can be applied for trajectory sets from different experiment settings. This work can help to improve the accuracy of simulation models, and the pedestrian safety in crowd activities and autonomous vehicle navigation will be benefited.

AB China is promoting the construction of an integrated positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems with the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) as its core. To expand the positioning coverage area and improve the positioning performance by taking advantage of device-to-device (D2D) and self-organizing network (SON) technology, a BDS/SON integrated positioning system is proposed for the fifth-generation (5G) networking environment. This system relies on a combination of time-of-arrival (TOA) and BeiDou pseudo-range measurements to effectively supplement BeiDou signal blind spots, expand the positioning coverage area, and realize higher precision in continuous navigation and positioning. By establishing the system state model, and addressing the single-system positioning divergence and insufficient accuracy, a robust adaptive fading filtering (RAF) algorithm based on the prediction residual is proposed to suppress gross errors and filtering divergence in order to improve the stability and accuracy of the positioning results. Subsequently, a federated Kalman filtering (FKF) algorithm operating in fusion-feedback mode is developed to centrally process the positioning information of the combined system. Considering that the prediction error can reflect the magnitude of the model error, an adaptive information distribution coefficient is introduced to further improve the filtering performance. Actual measurement and significance test results show that by integrating BDS and SON positioning data, the proposed algorithm realizes robust, reliable, and continuous high precision location services with anti-interference capabilities and good universality. It is applicable in scenarios involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), autonomous driving, military, public safety and other contexts and can even realize indoor positioning and other regional positioning tasks.</p>

ID EVASION ATTACK
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in machine learning areas such as image recognition, speech recognition, intrusion detection, and pattern analysis. However, it has been revealed that DNNs have weaknesses in the face of adversarial examples, which are created by adding a little noise to an original sample to cause misclassification by the DNN. Such adversarial examples can lead to fatal accidents in applications such as autonomous vehicles and disease diagnostics. Thus, the generation of adversarial examples has attracted extensive research attention recently. An adversarial example is categorized as targeted or untargeted. In this paper, we focus on the untargeted adversarial example scenario because it has a faster learning time and less distortion compared with the targeted adversarial example. However, there is a pattern vulnerability with untargeted adversarial examples: Because of the similarity between the original class and certain specific classes, it may be possible for the defending system to determine the original class by analyzing the output classes of the untargeted adversarial examples. To overcome this problem, we propose a new method for generating untargeted adversarial examples, one that uses an arbitrary class in the generation process. Moreover, we show that our proposed scheme can be applied to steganography. Through experiments, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve a 100% attack success rate with minimum distortion (1.99 and 42.32 using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, respectively) and without the pattern vulnerability. Using a steganography test, we show that our proposed scheme can be used to fool humans, as demonstrated by the probability of their detecting hidden classes being equal to that of random selection.

AB Self-driving car navigation is currently attracting considerable research interests. The key problem is to guide the car to the destination in real-time with a safe and obstacle free path in real-world environments. We propose an innovative self-driving car navigation approach that incorporates a VFH (Vector Field Histogram) local path planner adapted for modern 3D laser scanners and a global path planner using satellite positioning and digital map along with a custom built PID controller (Proportional Integral Derivative controller). Since classical path planning methods such as VFH are often used on small robots with ultrasonic rangefinders or in simulation based environments, we applied the VFH method to a real self-driving car with two different LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) configurations. The quantitative results from extensive experiments indicate that the developed VFH method with the modern real-time 3D LiDAR generally outperform the conventional LIDAR in terms of efficiency, accuracy and reliability. In addition, the tracks produced by 3D LIDAR are more convergent, smooth and consistent than the other configuration. The maximum position deviation for the VFH with 3D LiDAR is 0.28 m and -0.16 m while the deviation for the other low-cost solution is 0.88 m and -0.49 m respectively. The global path planner can provide an accuracy of within 1 meter most of the time. The proposed approach is successfully implemented and tested on our self-driving car which took part in the national self-driving car competitions in recent years, and ranked No.3 and 4. in the future challenge 2014 self-driving car competition in China.

TI Terrain Matching Positioning Method Based on Node Multi-information

DT Article
DE Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV); Terrain reference navigation; Node
   data packet; Multi-information fusion
AB Measurement bias and lack of terrain features often cause false peaks during underwater terrain matching positioning, that is, there is more than one peak near the real position. Previous methods to address this problem have increased the number of measurement beams, but this also increases the data processing time and energy consumption. At the same time, the ratio of measured information that is used does not increase. In other words, we should increase the ratio of measured information that is used, not simply increase the amount of information that is measured. Conventional matching algorithms only use the height of nodes without considering surface information, which is composed of height and the position of multiple nodes in three-dimensional space. Multi-beam sonar can obtain the three-dimensional distribution of terrain nodes. This node information is not just a height sequence, as it is used in previous methods. If we consider the nodes as a three-dimensional distribution of points with height and position information, this increases the matching position information and more of the terrain features can be extracted from the same measured data. Hence, in this paper, a terrain positioning method called the Node Multi-information Fusion (NMIF) is presented. This method focuses on improving the stability and accuracy degraded by bias in the Digital Elevation Map (DEM), terrain repeatability, and other factors. First, the concept of a Single Node Data Packet (SNDP) is introduced. The SNDP includes elevation and surface information surrounding the node, such as roughness, gradient, and slope. This additional topographic feature information improves the robustness and accuracy of the system. A computer simulation using actual ocean bottom topography verifies the advantages of the proposed NMIF algorithm.

AB The application of an auto-guided tractor to rice cultivation in Korean paddy fields may be limited by tire slippage and headland turning due to wet soil conditions and the use of small-sized fields < 1 ha. This study examines the development of a computer simulator capable of virtually testing the motion of a tractor based on a look-ahead distance method in a real-time 3D graphic environment. The tractor motion was simulated based on the dynamic model of a vehicle that considered the effects of tire slippage and side force imparted by soil. The validity of the computer simulation was confirmed by a paved road test, thereby providing tracking trajectories similar to those obtained from the road test. However, an oscillation in the steering angle, ranging from -8 to +5 deg., occurred when the tractor traveled on straight paths. This oscillation might be related to the limitations of the electric motor in controlling the tractor's hydraulic steering system due to the non-linear response of the hydraulic actuator to the rotation of the steering wheel by motor torque. In an arable field (90 m x 25 m), the auto-guided tractor followed the predefined path including C-shape headland turning with acceptable tracking, showing RMS lateral errors ranging from 3.8 to 12.8 cm on the straight paths. However, RMS lateral errors obtained on the curved paths increased to 100 cm when the tractor traveled in a wet sub-field with moisture content > 30%, thereby requiring more accurate estimation of sliding parameters.

TI A Semi-Supervised Federated Learning Fault Diagnosis Method Based on

AB With the development of Autonomous Marine Vehicles, research on real-time health monitoring based on data from remote monitoring and shore-based control center has attracted more and more attention. However, the feature extraction capability of each local client model is limited by the size and quality of data collected by remote monitoring. For clients with zero-shot, it is necessary to design an efficient federated learning framework which allows shore-based federation center with few-shot help to strengthen the feature extraction capability of clients. In this paper, a semi-supervised federated learning strategy based on adaptive learning mechanism of prototype points is proposed to solve the problem that clients with zero-shot have difficulty in establishing reliable fault diagnosis models when the quality of client data is inhomogeneous. By designing an adaptive prototypical network learning mechanism driven by sample quality and a dynamic in-and-out mechanism for local pseudo-labeled dataset, the few-shot learning capability of federation center as well as the reliability of local client's prototype points are enhanced to alleviate the impact of unreliable pseudo-label on semi-supervised learning. The experiment validation on the rolling bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University can come to an accuracy increasement of 13.12%, which indicates that the proposed Adpro-SSFL outperforms existed semi-supervised federated learning method when data suffered by high missing rate due to the interference of external factors on the signal acquisition sensor.

AB Background People who were previously hospitalised with stroke may have difficulty operating a motor vehicle, and their driving aptitude needs to be evaluated to prevent traffic accidents in today's car-based society. Although the association between motor-cognitive functions and driving aptitude has been extensively studied, motor-cognitive functions required for driving have not been elucidated.Methods In this paper, we propose a machine-learning algorithm that introduces sparse regularization to automatically select driving aptitude-related indices from 65 input indices obtained from 10 tests of motor-cognitive function conducted on 55 participants with stroke. Indices related to driving aptitude and their required tests can be identified based on the output probability of the presence or absence of driving aptitude to provide evidence for identifying subjects who must undergo the on-road driving test. We also analyzed the importance of the indices of motor-cognitive function tests in evaluating driving aptitude to further clarify the relationship between motor-cognitive function and driving aptitude.Results The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved predictive evaluation of the presence or absence of driving aptitude with high accuracy (area under curve 0.946) and identified a group of indices of motor-cognitive function tests that are strongly related to driving aptitude.Conclusions The proposed method is able to effectively and accurately unravel driving-related motor-cognitive functions from a panoply of test results, allowing for autonomous evaluation of driving aptitude in post-stroke individuals. This has the potential to reduce the number of screening tests required and the corresponding clinical workload, further improving personal and public safety and the quality of life of individuals with stroke.

DE Fisheye image segmentation; Multi-view data augmentation; Deformable
   convolutions; Deep convolutional neural networks
AB Semantic image segmentation is an essential task for autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars where a complete and real-time perception of the surroundings is mandatory. Convolutional Neural Network approaches for semantic segmentation standout over other state-of-the-art solutions due to their powerful generalization ability over unknown data and end-to-end training. Fisheye images are important due to their large field of view and ability to reveal information from broader surroundings. Nevertheless, they pose unique challenges for CNNs, due to object distortion resulting from the Fisheye lens and object position. In addition, large annotated Fisheye datasets required for CNN training is rather limited. In this paper, we investigate the use of Deformable convolutions in accommodating distortions within Fisheye image segmentation for fully residual U-net by learning unknown geometric transformations via variable shaped and sized filters. The proposed models and integration strategies are exploited within two main paradigms: single(front)-view and multi-view Fisheye images segmentation. The validation of the proposed methods is conducted on synthetic and real Fisheye images from the WoodScape and the SynWoodScape datasets. The results validate the significance of the Deformable fully residual U-Net structure in learning unknown geometric distortions in both paradigms, demonstrate the possibility in learning view-agnostic distortion properties when trained on the multi-view data and shed light on the role of surround-view images in increasing segmentation performance relative to the single view. Finally, our experiements suggests that Deformable convolutions are a powerful tool that can increase the efficiency of fully residual U-Nets for semantic segmentation of automotive fisheye images.

ID RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS
AB Traffic sign detection and recognition in an unconstrained environment is a challenging task for autonomous vehicle operations. The small traffic signs in the captured image make this problem harder. Furthermore, detecting and recognizing these signs accurately in real-time is crucial. This work proposes a modified YOLOv4based deep learning model that uses CSPDarknet53 as the backbone. We have applied data preprocessing and image enhancement strategies for better model generalization. For this purpose, a nighttime image enhancement method is used to illuminate night images. In our work, prior to the YOLOv4 model, anchor boxes are calculated using the K-Means clustering algorithm, which uses Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) as the distance instead of Intersection over Union (IoU). Our modified architecture uses an improved PANet with grouped convolutional layers in the detection neck and an additional feature scale for detecting smaller traffic signs. The proposed model has been experimented on the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD) and the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K dataset (TT-100K). MTSD consists of global traffic signs from different countries, and TT-100K consists of traffic signs from China. We have also tested the performance of the proposed model on our own dataset, consisting of Indian traffic sign images. The proposed model is compared with existing stateof-the-art models. We have achieved an accuracy of 94.80% and 80.71% on the TT-100K dataset and MTSD dataset, respectively, which outperforms existing methods. We have also performed the cross-data experiment on the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB) and Indian Traffic Signs Dataset (ITSD) using the model trained on MTSD. We have achieved 91.74% and 63.64% accuracy on GTSDB and ITSD datasets, respectively.

AB Hybrid aerial-aquatic robots can operate in both air and water and cross between these two. They can be applied to amphibious observation, maritime search and rescue, and cross-domain environmental monitoring. Herein, an aerial-aquatic hitchhiking robot is proposed that can fly, swim, and rapidly cross the air-water boundaries (0.16 s) and autonomously attach to surfaces in both air and water. Inspired by the mechanoreceptors of the remora (Echeneis naucrates) disc, the robot's hitchhiking device is equipped with two flexible bioinspired tactile sensors (FBTS) based on a triboelectric nanogenerator for tactile sensing of attachment status. Based on tactile sensing, the robot can perform reattachment after leakage or adhesion failure, enabling it to achieve long-term adhesion on complex surfaces. The rotor-based aerial-aquatic robot, which has two thrust vectoring units for underwater locomotion, can maneuver to pitch, yaw, and roll 360 & DEG; and control precision motion position. The field tests show that the robot can continuously cross the air-water boundary, attach to the rough stone surface, and record video in both air and underwater. This study may shed light on future autonomous robots capable of intelligent navigation, adhesion, and operation in complex aerial-aquatic environments.
   An untethered aerial-aquatic hitchhiking robot that can be remotely controlled for flying, swimming, and transiting air-water boundaries rapidly (0.16 s), is presented. Notably, it can autonomously attach to various surfaces in both air and water environments using a remora-inspired suction disc with flexible tactile sensors.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB As a product of hydrothermal mineralization at spreading centers, seafloor massive sulfides (SMS) have become a research hotspot in the field of prospecting and exploring deep-sea mineral resources owing to their enrichment of various strategic metals. Since hydrothermal circulation changes the magnetic properties of host rocks and can generate magnetic anomalies, near-bottom magnetic surveying is an effective method to determine magnetic anomaly features of the seafloor. This technology has been applied to the detection of SMS deposits, in addition to its use in understanding hydrothermal fluid flow conduits and associated hydrothermal alterations. The Tianxiu Vent Field (TVF) is a detachment-fault-controlled, ultramafic-associated hydrothermal system located on the Carlsberg Ridge, Northwest Indian Ocean. During China's DY57th cruise in 2019, near-bottom magnetic data were collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle. In this paper, we use bathymetric and magnetic data, as well as rock sampling information, to analyze and discuss the magnetic anomaly features of the TVF region. Then, we apply 2.5D magnetic anomaly profile forward modeling to determine the shallow magnetic structure and the pattern of detachment faults in the subsurface. Our results show that TVF is characterized by a significant positive magnetic anomaly, where stronger magnetization exists in the area with active hydrothermal vent clusters. The detachment fault has a dip of less than 30 degrees at shallow depths, which steepens to a dip of similar to 70 degrees at depths of around 300 m.

AB Smart product service system (PSS) has become an essential strategy to transform towards digital servitization for manufacturing companies. By leveraging smart capabilities, smart PSS aims to create superior user experience in a smart context. To develop a successful smart PSS, customer requirement management from smart experience perspective is necessary. However, it is a challenging task to identify and evaluate diverse, implicit and inter-related smart experience-oriented customer requirement (SEO-CR) in smart PSS context. Hence, this paper proposes an effective methodology to elicit and analyze SEO-CRs. At first, a generic, two-dimensional SEO-CR system is presented as a basis to derive the tailored SEO-CRs for various smart PSS applications. Second, a novel HFLC-DEMATEL (hesitant fuzzy linguistic cloud-based Decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory) method is proposed to accurately evaluate the priority and complicated interaction of SEO-CRs, considering the hesi-tancy, fuzziness and randomness under uncertain decision environment. Some new operations (e.g., cloud total -relation matrix and weight determination method) and a cloud influence relation map are developed to fully take advantage of cloud model in DEMATEL implementation. Finally, a real case of smart vehicle service system (SVSS) is presented. The 18 SEO-CRs of the SVSS are derived based on the generalized SEO-CRs. By using HFLC-DEMATEL, some important SEO-CRs in context of SVSS are identified, such as autonomous and convenience. The finding of results can help designers make proper decisions in design and development of SVSS with a superior smart experience. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are validated by conducting some comparative analyses.

AB The main objective of this unmanned ground vehicle is to deal with the security issues like terrorist activities across the border and in various remote combat missions by reducing the involvement of soldiers. This unmanned ground robot comprises a wireless high-definition camera that can transfer live streams from the robot to headquarters using Wi-Fi. The robot's movement can be controlled with two modes; one of them is a radio controller working on 2.4 GHz frequency with seven independent channels. Secondly, its movement can also be controlled using a Python-based GUI application. Nowadays, different techniques have been used for face recognition; in our remotely piloted robot, we have used Haar-cascade classifiers in combination with the LBPH algorithm to implement real-time facial recognition. The robot uses a rack and pinion driving mechanism and an ATMEL Cortex-M3 CPU as a controller with 32-bit/s processing speed. In addition, a laser is installed on the turret to shoot the targets down, which can be used in an autonomous mode based on facial recognition results, or it can be used manually either through an RF controller or Python-based GUI. The turret moves in 2-DOF with the help of metallic geared servo motors. Both servo motors can rotate up to 180 degrees. The driving mechanism of the robotic tank is just like DDR, with one difference, the two DC gear motors of the robot are connected diagonally.

AB Real-time motion tracking of kinematic chains is a key prerequisite in the control of, e.g., robotic actuators and autonomous vehicles and also has numerous biomechanical applications. In recent years, it has been shown that, by placing inertial sensors on segments that are connected by rotational joints, the motion of that kinematic chain can be tracked accurately. These methods specifically avoid using magnetometer measurements, which are known to be unreliable since the magnetic field at the different sensor locations is typically different. They rely on the assumption that the motion of the kinematic chain is sufficiently rich to assure observability of the relative pose. However, a formal investigation of this crucial requirement has not yet been presented, and no specific conditions for observability have so far been given. In this work, we present an observability analysis and show that the relative pose of the body segments is indeed observable under a very mild condition on the motion. We support our results by simulation studies, in which we employ a state estimator that neither uses magnetometer measurements nor additional sensors and does not impose assumptions on the accelerometer to measure only the direction of gravity, nor on the range of motion or degrees of freedom of the joints. We investigate the effect of the amount of excitation and of stationary periods in the data on the accuracy of the estimates. We then use experimental data from two mechanical joints as well as from a human gait experiment to validate the observability criterion in practice and to show that small excitation levels are sufficient for obtaining accurate estimates even in the presence of time periods during which the motion is not observable.

AB The hydrodynamic performance of a self-propelled carangiform swimmer with a flexible caudal fin in the absence of a free stream is numerically investigated, where the fin's dimensionless bending stiffness varies from 10(-3) to 150. It reveals that large flexibility of the caudal fin has a negative impact on the propulsion and moderate rigidity is found to increase the hydrodynamic performance. Two different vortex configurations are observed at low and high bending stiffnesses: (i) reverse Benard-von Karman (rBvK) vortex configuration and (ii) deflected reverse Benard-von Karman wake with the secondary vortex street, respectively. With the increase in bending stiffness, the thrust-producing part switches from the swimmer body to the caudal fin corresponding to the switch of the vortex configuration. Furthermore, the thrust and drag productions are examined. As the bending stiffness increases, the "active portion" of the caudal fin provides more kinetic energy to the wake flow. It is found that the deflected rBvK is induced by the vortical strength imbalance of two adjacent vortices, and the secondary vortex street is formed by the large strain between the primary vortex and the secondary vortex street. Meanwhile, the dynamic mode decomposition analysis indicates that the dominant mode of the dynamic flow field is the excited frequency resonant mode and the inherent frequency of the secondary vortex street is the same as the undulatory frequency. These results shed new light onto the role of the flexible caudal fin in self-propelled biological systems and may provide some inspirations to autonomous underwater vehicle design.

AB The classical multi-period inventory routing problem (MIRP) combines inventory management and vehicle routing problems, attempting to maintain customer inventory levels via autonomous deliveries, with the assumption that stock-out never occurs at the supply side. While this is no more the truth when a common third-party logistics company operates a central warehouse for a group of small and medium sized retailing companies. Procurements have to be made to refill inventory at the central warehouse. This study thus extends the traditional MIRP by incorporating procurement decisions (MIRP-PD) and tries to minimize the total cost of procurement, inventory holding and transportation. To our knowledge, this paper is among the first to formally describe MIRP-PD and model it as a mixed integer linear program. A hybrid two-level heuristic is proposed to address large-scale instances. The upper level of the algorithm determines the visiting schedule while the lower level works out procurement and routing decisions accordingly. Components from tabu search and adaptive threshold acceptance are also embedded to help escape from local optima. Extensive numerical instances are generated from a real case in Chengdu (China), based on which the computational results reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared with the commercial solver CPLEX. The comparison between MIRP and MIRP-PD has demonstrated the cost advantage of incorporating procurement decisions into inventory and routing plans. Impacts on costs of key factors including delivery frequency and buffer size of stores have also been examined to provide managerial implications to practitioners.

AB Currently, the autonomous positioning of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) still faces the problems of insufficient persistence and poor reliability, especially in the challenging scenarios where satellites are denied, or the sensing modalities such as vision or laser are degraded. Based on multimodal information fusion and failure detection (FD), this article proposes a high-robustness and low-drift state estimation system suitable for multiple scenes, which integrates light detection and ranging (LiDAR), inertial measurement units (IMUs), stereo camera, encoders, attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) in a loose coupling way. Firstly, a state estimator with variable fusion mode is designed based on the error-state extended Kalman filtering (ES-EKF), which can fuse encoder-AHRS subsystem (EAS), visual-inertial subsystem (VIS), and LiDAR subsystem (LS) and change its integration structure online by selecting a fusion mode. Secondly, in order to improve the robustness of the whole system in challenging environments, an information manager is created, which judges the health status of subsystems by degeneration metrics, and then online selects appropriate information sources and variables to enter the estimator according to their health status. Finally, the proposed system is extensively evaluated using the datasets collected from six typical scenes: street, field, forest, forest-at-night, street-at-night and tunnel-at-night. The experimental results show our framework is better or comparable accuracy and robustness than existing publicly available systems.

AB Polymetallic nodules increase habitat heterogeneity in some abyssal benthic ecosystems by providing hard substrate. Besides their important role in structuring ecosystems, polymetallic nodules have high grades of valuable minerals and are a target of likely future exploitation, particularly in the Pacific Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ). Mining activities will remove hard substrate and sediment and cause sediment plumes potentially affecting faunal communities over large areas. Long-lived megafaunal assemblages may be particularly vulnerable but data are lacking on the density, biodiversity and community structure in many areas of the CCZ. This study aims to provide megabenthic community baseline data from two physically similar areas (B6S02 and B4S03) located in the contract area of Global Sea Mineral Resources N.V. (GSR). Seafloor images, obtained by an autonomous underwater vehicle are used to characterise the large areas required for robust evaluation of sparse megafauna. Higher altitude images cover a larger area for the same effort but have reduced resolution compared to images obtained closer to the seafloor, leading to difficulties in detecting and identifying individuals. Our comparison of images obtained at different altitudes shows that images taken above 8m altitude underestimate the megafauna density by almost 50%, so images <8m were used for further analysis. We also used multiobserver agreement analysis to improve the megafaunal annotation consistency, and the quality and robustness of the data in this study. The two GSR areas were significantly different in nodule coverage and megafauna composition and a general positive relationship between nodule coverage and megafauna abundance was observed. Differences in the megafaunal composition were primarily caused by differences in echinoderms (asteroids, echinoids, ophiuroids and holothuroids), representing almost 70% of the megafauna.

AB In the automotive and rail domains, vehicles are entering the era of full automation thanks to wireless sensors and communication systems, shifting control functions from a human driver to computers. High data rate, robustness, high reliability and ultra-low latency wireless communications are required in the context of autonomous train and safety critical applications. Today, the Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) is under development at European level within the International Union of Railways (UIC). This system will answer all the current and future needs of rail. It will be IP based, multi-bearer and resilient to technology evolution. In the context of the development of different FRMCS prototypes by industry, it is crucial to be able to test them in representative Railway radio environments thanks to laboratory tools. Characterization of radio channels in railway environments, by measurements or simulations, is a very active field. In this article, based on broad literature survey, we show that not all the published models are suitable for performance evaluation. Then, we propose a selection of typical Tapped-Delay-Line channel models to be implemented in an original hardware and software testing platform capable to reproduce the effect of representative Railway environments in laboratory, with real time emulation at RF (Radio Frequency) level. Preliminary results in Hilly 3 taps and Cutting 5 taps channel models are presented as a proof of concept of a "zero on site testing" approach, allowing for time and cost savings in the validation of railway communication systems.

AB In renewable microgrid systems, energy storage system (ESS) plays an important role, as an energy buffer, to stabilize the system by compensating the demand-generation mismatch. Battery energy storage system serves as a decisive and critical component. However, due to low power density and consequently slow dynamic response the lifetime of BESS is observably reduced due to high current stress, specifically experienced during abrupt/transient power variations. Hence, hybridization with supercapacitor storage system is conferred. Additionally, the controllers designed for energy storage systems should substantially respond for compensating the transient requirement of the system. In this article, we propose a decoupled control strategy for batteries and supercapacitors based on k - Type compensators and a nonlinear PI controller (NPIC) respectively. The formulated control design is tested for voltage regulation in a standalone microgrid. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is presented with benchmark low-pass-filter (LPF) based controller. The results obtained shows the proposed control technique possess a faster response with improved voltage regulation capabilities. For the test system regulated at 48 V for various abrupt load-generation various case studies presented, the proposed methodology maintains a significantly reduced voltage deviation between 47 V - 51 V in contrast to 45 V - 56 V observed in the LPF methodology. Furthermore, the complexity is simpler in comparison to LPF based control strategy and a comparative obviation of additional sensing devices is achieved, that inherently reduces the detrimental effect on ESS response during transient condition.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has been attracting considerable attention as an important scientific topic in the field of medicine. Deep-leaning (DL) technologies have been applied more dominantly than other traditional machine-learning methods. They have demonstrated excellent capability to retract visual features of objectives, even unnoticeable ones for humans, and analyze huge amounts of information within short periods. The amount of research applying DL-based models to real-time computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems has been increasing steadily in the GI endoscopy field. An array of published data has already demonstrated the advantages of DL-based CAD models in the detection and characterization of various neoplastic lesions, regardless of the level of the GI tract. Although the diagnostic performances and study designs vary widely, owing to a lack of academic standards to assess the capability of AI for GI endoscopic diagnosis fairly, the superiority of CAD models has been demonstrated for almost all applications studied so far. Most of the challenges associated with AI in the endoscopy field are general problems for AI models used in the real world outside of medical fields. Solutions have been explored seriously and some solutions have been tested in the endoscopy field. Given that AI has become the basic technology to make machines react to the environment, AI would be a major technological paradigm shift, for not only diagnosis but also treatment. In the near future, autonomous endoscopic diagnosis might no longer be just a dream, as we are witnessing with the advent of autonomously driven electric vehicles.

AB In this paper, a game-theoretical autonomous decision-making approach for efficient deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a multi-level and multi-dimensional assisted network is analyzed. The UAVs have directional antennas that work as wireless stations, which provide the best coverage for multiple ground mobile/fixed users. In general, UAVs work in a cooperative manner for achieving the suitable deployment with the optimal coverage values for the candidate region. In this paper, a game theory concept is used and the payoff function for each UAV is defined based on the coverage probability value, which depends on the altitude and the characteristic of antennas in the UAVs. We introduce a mathematical formulation for evaluating the payoff values based on a set of actions for each UAV, and the Nash equilibrium for this kind of game. This approach works in an intelligent way based on the interactions between the UAVs and their neighbors in a connected network and it might work even in harsh environments. In order to minimize interference, the UAVs' altitudes are adjusted based on the antennas and other deployment requirements (i.e. search and surveillance purposes) by using the minimum number of UAVs to cover the candidate geographical region. The simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves the maximum coverage value, converges fast with the environmental changes based on the power levels, and robust for failure scenarios. Finally, we compare our approach against one of the traditional approaches called Collaborative Visual Area Coverage Approach (CVACA) based on uniform coverage quality. The simulation results show that the game approach outperforms the traditional approach in term of the coverage value and the computational time.

AB We describe detailed magnetic and bathymetric studies around 13 degrees N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a site of extensive detachment faulting. Inversion of closely spaced sea surface magnetic anomalies reveals a disorganized pattern of magnetization, with anomalies younger than anomaly 2 being poorly delineated. The Brunhes anomaly width is highly variable but averages similar to 60% of that predicted for the regional spreading rate. It is often split, both along and across axis, by apparently reversely magnetized crust. Gaps in the Brunhes anomaly match gaps in the neovolcanic zone inferred from acoustic backscatter. A strong negative magnetization is associated with the oceanic core complex (OCC) at 13 degrees 2'N (OCC1320) and is inferred to arise from exhumed old, reversely magnetized lithosphere. The inferred position of the magmatic axis implies similar to 30% asymmetry of crustal accretion post-anomaly-2. Higher spatial resolution magnetic anomalies near the seafloor, measured by autonomous underwater vehicle, are qualitatively similar to earlier deep-towed data but differ somewhat from the sea surface magnetics. We interpret this mismatch as reflecting the differing sensitivities of the two observing geometries and the existence of a highly heterogeneous topography and magnetization. This suggests that a strongly three-dimensional structure exists, more compatible with a geodynamic model where neighboring OCCs are not connected but evolve independently. A modeled near-seafloor profile through OCC1320 shows low positive magnetization below the smooth dome. A second profile, running E-W between two OCCs, shows high magnetization coinciding with a large seamount, reflecting recent off-axis volcanism. Measured microbathymetry reveals extensive small volcanic cones on this seamount and confirms previous interpretations of OCC morphology.

ID PERMAFROST; LEAKAGE
AB There is a significant need for reliable, cost-effective, and preferably automatic methods for detecting and monitoring marine gas seeps. Seeps at the seafloor may originate from natural sources including sediments releasing biogenic methane and volcanoes releasing CO2, or from man-made constructions such as pipelines or well heads, and potentially also from subseafloor CO2 storage sites. Improved seep detection makes it possible to estimate the amount of greenhouse gases entering the oceans, and to promptly detect and address potential leaks to reduce environmental and economical consequences. Sonar is an excellent tool for seep detection due to the strong acoustic backscatter properties of gas-filled bubbles in water. Existing methods for acoustic seep detection include multibeam and sidescan surveying, as well as active and passive sensors mounted on a stationary platform. In this work, we develop a new method for automatic seep detection using an interferometric sidescan sonar. We apply signal processing techniques combined with knowledge about acoustical and spatial properties of seeps for improved detectability. The proposed method fills an important gap in existing technology-the ability to automatically detect a seep during a single pass with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with an interferometric sidescan sonar. Results from simulations as well as field data from two leaking abandoned wells in the North Sea indicate that small seeps are consistently detected on a sandy seafloor even when the observation time is limited (a single pass with the AUV). We explore the detection capability for different seafloor types ranging from silt to gravel.

AB Prescribing open boundary conditions for regional coastal ocean models encounters the challenge of imposing information on sea level, velocity and tracers that characterize the unrepresented far field ocean. Deriving such information from a larger domain model without communicating information from the nested model back to the exterior model is downscaling. We evaluate whether real-time models presently in operation for the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) can deliver useful predictions of subtidal frequency currents and subsurface temperature and salinity for this downscaling purpose. The MAB is a broad continental shelf region where several models run in real time and there is a dense observational data set available for skill assessment. We examine seven real-time models that cover the MAB: three global models, and four regional models. A regional climatology is included as an eighth model. Skill metrics with respect to model bias, centered root mean square error and cross correlation are computed for temperature and salinity profile data from 16 autonomous underwater glider vehicle missions and four hydrographic voyages in 2010-2011. Two years of hourly HF-radar surface current observations that span the shelf are used to evaluate modeled mean surface currents and daily time scale variability in speed and direction. Skill metrics, with uncertainty estimates, are reported for inner and outer shelf subregions, and for stratified and unstratified seasons. A group of models is identified that offers useful skill for the purposes of providing open boundary data to inner shelf and estuary models for real-time applications.

AB In recent years, low cost and highly accurate underwater remote sensing instruments and technologies have advanced at an astonishing rate. Intense competition among manufacturers, coupled with advances in digital signal processing has brought about these breakthroughs, all to the benefit of the scientific community. Commercial Off the Shelf Technology (COST) is now available and incorporated into current acoustic sensors, with quality and resolution that was previously reserved for only large-scale ocean exploration. The corollary to this observation is that the entire field of acoustic remote sensing of the aquatic environment is rapidly evolving and is likely to continue to do so over the next decade. Acoustic bottom mapping, Doppler sensing and remote and autonomous vehicle imaging systems are now becoming commonplace for large lake science and are approaching maturity. Given this evolution, this summary reviews two major categories of underwater, acoustic remote sensing technologies; bottom mapping systems and Doppler sensing systems. Bottom mapping systems are primarily used to determine the presence of the bottom, map its features and classify its composition. Doppler systems make use of target motion to deduce the velocity of the target, in up to three spatial dimensions. For each category of acoustic remote sensing a brief description of the theory of operation is provided, followed by examples of the types of data produced by the technology. When possible, estimates of range and accuracy of typical units in each class is provided. Finally, examples of new utilizations of combined remote sensing technologies are discussed.

AB Machine vision represents a particularly attractive solution for sensing and detecting potential collision-course targets due to the relatively low cost, size, weight, and power requirements of vision sensors (as opposed to radar and Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System). This paper describes the development and evaluation of a real-time, vision-based collision-detection system suitable for fixed-wing aerial robotics. Using two fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to recreate various collision-course scenarios, we were able to capture highly realistic vision (from an onboard camera perspective) of the moments leading up to a collision. This type of image data is extremely scarce and was invaluable in evaluating the detection performance of two candidate target detection approaches. Based on the collected data, our detection approaches were able to detect targets at distances ranging from 400 to about 900 m. These distances (with some assumptions about closing speeds and aircraft trajectories) translate to an advance warning of between 8 and 10 s ahead of impact, which approaches the 12.5-s response time recommended for human pilots. We overcame the challenge of achieving real-time computational speeds by exploiting the parallel processing architectures of graphics processing units (GPUs) found on commercial-off-the-shelf graphics devices. Our chosen CPU device suitable for integration onto UAV platforms can be expected to handle real-time processing of 1,024 x 768 pixel image frames at a rate of approximately 30 Hz. Flight trials using manned Cessna aircraft in which all processing is performed onboard will be conducted in the near future, followed by further experiments with fully autonomous UAV platforms.

AB Nowadays, wireless position location of multiple sources attracts considerable interest, not only for military, law-enforcement, and public safety applications, but also in the field of intelligent transportation systems and location-specific commercial services. In this paper, we present a complete, autonomous, and movable-on-demand localization system. It is based on the estimation of the direction of arrival of signals emitted by mobile sources, impinging on an array of sensors placed on board a mobile localization station, represented by any aerial or terrestrial vehicle. The system is especially tailored for wireless users unable to perform self-localization, and its most attractive characteristic is its inherent mobility, which allows a quick employment "on demand," in emergency situations, where other localization infrastructures are not present or are unable to properly operate. Procedures of autolocalization and autoorientation of the localization station, based on a set of emitting sources in known location, are considered as well. The user to be located should only be equipped with a very simple radio transmitter, whose signal can be received and identified by the localization station. Alternatively, in more sophisticated scenarios, the user's equipment can be a personal mobile phone, seamlessly connected with the localization station acting as a temporary base station. The performance of the overall system has been evaluated for a case of code division multiple access (CDMA)-based transceiver via computer simulations, showing that the achievable accuracy for locating the user position can fulfill the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) E-911 standard requirements for emergency calls over reasonably wide coverage areas.

AB We propose and present a parallelized metric framework for evaluating human-machine teams that draws upon current knowledge of human-systems interfacing and integration but is rooted in team-centric concepts. Humans and machines working together as a team involves interactions that will only increase in complexity as machines become more intelligent, capable teammates. Assessing such teams will require explicit focus on not just the human-machine interfacing but the full spectrum of interactions between and among agents. As opposed to focusing on isolated qualities, capabilities, and performance contributions of individual team members, the proposed framework emphasizes the collective team as the fundamental unit of analysis and the interactions of the team as the key evaluation targets, with individual human and machine metrics still vital but secondary. With teammate interaction as the organizing diagnostic concept, the resulting framework arrives at a parallel assessment of the humans and machines, analyzing their individual capabilities less with respect to purely human or machine qualities and more through the prism of contributions to the team as a whole. This treatment reflects the increased machine capabilities and will allow for continued relevance as machines develop to exercise more authority and responsibility. This framework allows for identification of features specific to human-machine teaming that influence team performance and efficiency, and it provides a basis for operationalizing in specific scenarios. Potential applications of this research include test and evaluation of complex systems that rely on human-system interaction, including-though not limited to-autonomous vehicles, command and control systems, and pilot control systems.

ID FEMTOCELL
AB Telecom operators have applied the cell association and load balancing technique with femtocell (HeNB) in urban dense 5G Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) for reducing loads of macrocells (MeNBs) and improving the total capacity. However, this deployment creates an interference scenario; mainly, the problem occurs severely from the users of the connected and autonomous vehicle in MeNBs coverage to HeNBs coverage. The main reason is that deploying HeNBs in MeNBs applies the co-subchannels by HeNB and MeNB, leading to severe cross-tier interference (CSI) in the OFDMA subcarrier. Due to this CSI occurrence, the spectral efficiency, Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR), and system outages affect severely. As a result, the MeNB User Equipment (MUEs) and HeNB User Equipment (HUEs) suffer from service disruption, and the entire system's performance degrades. This challenge has attracted the attention of many researchers and the telecom industries. As a result, several interferences controlling methods such as enhanced frequency allocation strategies, power management, control technique, resource scheduling, spectrum sharing, and Cognitive Radio (CR) techniques have been suggested for 5G communications. However, the study suggests that downlink interference is still challenging in dense urban zones, especially in multilevel and high-rise complex buildings. This paper proposes the EBBDSA-CSI technique where a novel Evolutionary Biogeography-based Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation (EBBDSA) algorithm is introduced for reducing the cross-tier Subcarriers interference (CSI) issues in MeNB and HeNB. The system-level simulation results suggest that the proposed algorithm reduces the system outage to 88.1%, and total spectral efficiency achieves 83.6% compared to the existing techniques.

AB Smart environmental monitoring has gained prominence, where target localization is of utmost importance. Employing UAVs for localization tasks is appealing owing to their low-cost, light-weight, and high maneuverability. However, UAVs lack the autonomy of decision-making if met with uncertain situations. Therefore, reinforcement learning (RL) can introduce intelligence to UAVs, where they learn to act based on the presented situation. Existing works focus on UAV trajectory optimization, navigation, and target tracking. These methods are application-specific and cannot be adapted to localization tasks since they require prior knowledge of the target. Moreover, the current RL-based autonomous target localization systems are lacking since-1) they must keep track of all visited locations and their corresponding readings, 2) they require retraining when encountering new environments, and 3) they are not scalable since the agent's movement is limited to slow speeds and for specific environments. Therefore, this work proposes a data-driven UAV target localization system based on Q-learning, which employs tabular methods to learn the optimal policy. Deep Q-network (DQN) is introduced to enhance the RL model and alleviate the curse of dimensionality. The proposed models enable smart decision-making, where the sensory information gathered by the UAV is exploited to produce the best action. Moreover, the UAV movement is modeled based on motion physics, where the actions correspond to linear velocities and heading angles. The proposed approach is compared with different benchmarks, where the results indicate that a more efficient, scalable, and adaptable localization is achieved, irrespective of the environment or source characteristics, without retraining.

AB The complicated spectrum produced by electric and hybrid car engines is particularly sensitive to the mid-frequency range. Furthermore, sensor placement in future mobility is crucial because when the positions and orientations of sensors are altered by excessive vehicle vibration, it results in the malfunctioning of autonomous driving systems. Smart structure-based active mounting approaches have been developed to reduce engine-induced vibration. These are made to continually adjust the mounts' dynamic properties and enhance their performances in terms of noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) under diverse operating circumstances. It can take the place of the engine support system's current mount technique. The performance of the source part for reducing vibration when the structure is triggered by a sinusoidal and multi-frequency signal is the main subject of this study. The overall structure, which has two active mounts based on the source-paths-receiver structure, was modeled using a lumped parameter model. In the source section, sinusoidal, amplitude modulation (AM), and frequency modulation (FM) signals were used in order to assess the effectiveness of vibration reduction in the mid-frequency band. The normalized least mean-square (NLMS) technique was utilized to assess the effectiveness of an active mounting system, and a tracking signal was employed as a control signal. The algorithm was further expanded to the multi-NLMS algorithm to monitor the complex spectral signal. This demonstrates how an active mounting system can successfully reduce vibrations when the structure is activated by many mid-frequency complex signals.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing many fields of study, such as visual recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and prediction. Traditional von-Neumann computing architecture with separated processing elements and memory devices have been improving their computing performances rapidly with the scaling of process technology. However, in the era of AI and ML, data transfer between memory devices and processing elements becomes the bottleneck of the system. To address this data movement issue, memory-centric computing takes an approach of merging the memory devices with processing elements so that computations can be done in the same location without moving any data. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) has attracted research community's attention because it can improve the energy efficiency of memory-centric computing systems substantially by minimizing the data movement. Even though the benefits of PIM are well accepted, its limitations and challenges have not been investigated thoroughly. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of state-of-the-art PIM research works based on various memory device types, such as static-random-access-memory (SRAM), dynamic-random-access-memory (DRAM), and resistive memory (ReRAM). We will present the overview of PIM designs in each memory type, covering from bit cells, circuits, and architecture. Then, a new software stack standard and its challenges for incorporating PIM with the conventional computing architecture will be discussed. Finally, we will discuss various future research directions in PIM for further reducing the data conversion overhead, improving test accuracy, and minimizing intra-memory data movement.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to confirm that increasing the hardness of thrust collars can improve the load carrying capacity (LCC) and wear resistance of water lubricated thrust bearings (WTBs) made of polymers paired with non-polymeric thrust collars, and to design a WTB with high LCC and durability for a shaftless pump-jet propulsor of an autonomous underwater vehicle. Six kinds of WTBs were manufactured by matching aluminum bronze, stainless steel and silicon nitride with two different polymer bearing materials. Their tribological behaviors were tested and compared.
   Design/methodology/approach - The tribological behaviors of the WTBs made with different materials were investigated experimentally on a specially designed test rig.
   Findings - Aluminum bronze is not suitable for crafting thrust collars of heavy load WTBs due to severe abrasive wear. Two body abrasive wear first occurred between the thrust collar and the polymer bearing. Next, aluminum bronze wear particles were produced. The particles acted between the two materials and formed three body abrasive wear. Stainless steel/polymer bearings showed better wear resistance while Si3N4/polymer bearings were the best. Improving the hardness of thrust collars is significant to the LCC and service life of WTBs.
   Originality/value - The wear mechanism of WTBs under heavy load conditions was revealed. Improving the hardness of the thrust collar was confirmed to be a preferable method to improve the wear resistance and LCC of WTBs. The results of this study may provide an important reference for the selection of water lubricated materials and the design of heavy load WTBs.

AB Attitude Measurement System (AMS) that constructed by the low-cost Micro-Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU) is usually adopted as the backup equipment for the fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to enhance its safety performance during flight. However, both the large-maneuvering acceleration and the high-frequency propeller dithering are major reasons that decreasing its real-time measurement precision. In addition, there are only tri-axial gyroscope and tri-axial accelerometer measurements could be utilized to compensate the measurement errors in the autonomous MIMU based AMS. In this paper, an Adaptive Mahony Complementary Filter (AMCF) with dynamic tuning of the complementary filter Proportion and Integral (PI) parameters is used to estimate the real-time attitude of the highly dynamic aviation UAV with low-cost MIMU in high-frequency propeller dithering. Meanwhile, the maneuvering acceleration compensation technology is also integrated with the AMCF to eliminate the UAV highly dynamic maneuvering acceleration. Moreover, the attitude of AMS is updated by the quaternion updating algorithm to improve its real-time performance and reliability. Finally, both UAV ground high-speed taxiing experiment and UAV flight experiment are conducted to verify the measurement accuracy of low-cost AMS. The real-time flight experimental results demonstrated that the Rooted Mean Square Error (RMSE) of AMS based on the low-cost MIMU do not exceed 0.882 degrees in terms of pitch angle and 0.864 degrees in roll angle under various maneuvering conditions. These results provide powerful supports for both the UAV developers and the low-cost MIMU based AMS. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Surface cracks on the concrete structures are a key indicator of structural safety and degradation. To ensure the structural health and reliability of the buildings, frequent structure inspection and monitoring for surface cracks is important. Surface inspection conducted by humans is time-consuming and may produce inconsistent results due to the inspectors' varied empirical knowledge. In the field of structural health monitoring, visual inspection of surface cracks on civil structures using deep learning algorithms has gained considerable attention. However, these vision-based techniques require high-quality images as inputs and depend on high computational power for image classification. Thus, in this study, shallow convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture for surface concrete crack detection is proposed. LeNet-5, a well-known CNN architecture, is optimized and trained for image classification using 40,000 images in the Middle East Technical University (METU) dataset. To achieve maximum accuracy for crack detection with minimum computation, the hyperparameters of the proposed model were optimized. The proposed model enables the employment of deep learning algorithms using low-power computational devices for a hassle-free monitoring of civil structures. The performance of the proposed model is compared with those of various pretrained deep learning models, such as VGG16, Inception, and ResNet. The proposed shallow CNN architecture was found to achieve a maximum accuracy of 99.8% in the minimum computation. Better hyperparameter optimization in CNN architecture results in higher accuracy even with a shallow layer stack for enhanced computation. The evaluation results confirm the incorporation of the proposed method with autonomous devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicle, for real-time inspection of surface crack with minimum computation.

TI Accelerating Exact Constrained Shortest Paths on GPUs
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGORITHM
AB The recently emerging applications such as software-defined networks and autonomous vehicles require efficient and exact solutions for constrained shortest paths (CSP), which finds the shortest path in a graph while satisfying some user-defined constraints. Compared with the common shortest path problems without constraints, CSP queries have a significantly larger number of subproblems. The most widely used labeling algorithm becomes prohibitively slow and impractical. Other existing approaches tend to find approximate solutions and build costly indices on graphs for fast query processing, which are not suitable for emerging applications with the requirement of exact solutions. A natural question is whether and how we can efficiently find the exact solution for CSP.
   In this paper, we propose Vine, a framework that parallelizes the labeling algorithm to efficiently find the exact CSP solution using GPUs. The major challenge addressed in Vine is how to deal with a large number of subproblems that are mostly unpromising but require a significant amount of memory and computational resources. Our solution is twofold. First, we develop a two-level pruning approach to eliminate the subproblems by making good use of the GPU's hierarchical memory. Second, we propose an adaptive parallelism control model based on the observations that the degree of parallelism (DOP) is the key to performance optimization with the given amount of computational resources. Extensive experiments show that Vine achieves 18x speedup on average over the widely adopted CPU-based solution running on 40 CPU threads. Vine also has over 5x speedup compared with a GPU approach that statically controls the DOP. Compared to the state-of-the-art approximate solution with preprocessed indices, Vine provides exact results with competitive or even better performance.

AB Various methods have been developed and used for monitoring marine benthic habitats, such as coral reefs and seagrass meadows. However, the efficiency of general survey methods [e.g., line intercept transects and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)] still is not high. In this article, we propose a practical coral-coverage estimation method combining an effective survey system [Speedy Sea Scanner (SSS)] and a deep-learning-based estimation method. The SSS is a towed-type system with six cameras arrayed on the platform. The depth rating of the system in our trial was 50 m. The length of the array baseline was 4.4 m, and six cameras were placed on the platform with equal spacing. The sea trial was conducted at Kujuku-Shima, Japan, on September 30, 2017. We successfully generated 3-D models and high-quality orthophotos of the seafloor with high resolution of about 1.5 mm/pixel. The survey efficiency of the SSS was about 7000 m(2)/h. In addition, the experimental results of coral-coverage estimation showed that the corals can be distinguished with accuracy of about 80% in places with relatively high transparency, and the error of coverage estimation was 10% or less. The proposed coral-coverage estimation method is more efficient than other survey techniques and costs less than AUV surveying; therefore, it is expected to become a promising tool for marine environmental surveying.

AB In a one-way mobility-on-demand system or distributed transportation system, customer requests for rides are served by a fleet of agents, e.g., taxis or even autonomous vehicles. We present a simplified three-node network model of such a transportation system in an urban agglomeration. The agents in this model play a non-cooperative game as each one tries to maximize their individual expected profit. We compute Nash equilibria in this game for different customer load cases, specifically the light- and heavy-load cases, and compare the social cost of a system with selfish agents to that of a system with coordinated agents. In particular, we establish a lower bound for the price of anarchy as a function of the system parameters, including taxi fares. We investigate the required mechanism design in the form of the fare ratio for a downtown core node and a city outskirts node that minimizes the social cost caused by selfish agents. Furthermore, we show that this optimal fare ratio is required to bring the social cost for the selfish agents as close as possible to that of the coordinated fleet. The chosen level of abstraction for the network with only three nodes is not intended to accomplish completeness; rather, it provides elementary insights into why mobility-on-demand systems with selfish agents in many cities operate at a sub-optimal level of performance. This paper motivates the investigation of the value of coordination in more complex systems, as well as the study and implementation of coordinated one-way mobility-on-demand transportation systems.

AB A case-picking operation with Multiple In-The-Aisle Pick Positions (MIAPP) is modeled as an M/G/1/N queueing system. Cases are picked manually from pallets located on the bottom level of storage racks. An aisle-captive Narrow-Aisle Lift Truck (NALT) travels rectilinearly to replenish the floor level of the rack by retrieving a pallet load from an upper level of the rack. From a queueing perspective, the NALT is the server and the order-picking positions in need of replenishment are customers. In this article, the replenishment requests from order-picking positions are assumed to occur at a Poisson rate (i.e., homogeneous customers). The corresponding probability density functions of service times are derived, and their Laplace-Stieltjes transforms are obtained, leading to steady-state performance measures of the system. In many situations, the replenishment requests from individual pick positions may not follow a homogeneous Poisson process, and the order-picking operation consists of heterogeneous customers. However, a simulation study indicates that an M/G/1/N queueing model yields accurate performance measures in such situations. Interestingly, when the number of pick positions is large enough to justify an MIAPP-NALT operation, the time between consecutive replenishment requests within a storage/retrieval aisle is approximately exponentially distributed. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the use of the developed model and to show the practical values of the analytical results in the performance analysis of such storage/retrieval systems.

AB Deep neural networks have revolutionized a variety of applications in varying domains like autonomous vehicles, weather forecasting, cancer detection, surveillance, traffic management, and so on. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is the state-of-the-art technique for many machine learning tasks in the image and video processing domains. Deployment of CNNs on embedded systems with lower processing power and smaller power budget is a challenging task. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) as a hardware accelerator for the CNNs that can deliver high performance at low power budgets. Majority of computations in CNNs involve 2-D convolution. Winograd minimal filtering-based algorithm is the most efficient technique for calculating convolution for smaller filter sizes. CNNs also consist of fully connected layers that are computed using general element-wise matrix multiplication (GEMM). In this article, we propose a unified architecture named UniWiG, where bothWinograd-based convolution and GEMM can be accelerated using the same set of processing elements. This approach leads to efficient utilization of FPGA hardware resources while computing all layers in the CNN. The proposed architecture shows performance improvement in the range of 1.4x to 4.02x with only 13% additional FPGA resources with respect to the baseline GEMM-based architecture. We have mapped popular CNN models like AlexNet and VGG-16 onto the proposed accelerator and the measured performance compares favorably with other state-of-the-art implementations. We have also analyzed the vulnerability of the accelerator to the side-channel attacks. Preliminary investigations show that the UniWiG architecture is more robust to memory side-channel attacks than direct convolution-based techniques.

AB In recent years, miniaturized particulate matter (PM) sensors have been studied intensively as an alternative device for air quality measurement due to their price advantage, moderate accuracy, and portable size. The accuracy of these sensors has been studied by calibration against conventional laboratory instruments. Such sensors have been connected in a network for spatiotemporal air quality measurements or used as personal monitors for exposure estimation. Another important application is combining low-cost PM sensors with drones or other unmanned vehicles for sampling environments where the setup of a static sensor network may not be viable. In this study, a mobile robot cart with a low-cost PM sensor (AAQRL-ROBOPM) was developed to map spatial PM distributions over time. The robot can be moved either manually via Bluetooth inputs from an Android device, autonomously by following preprogrammed instructions, or with basic artificial intelligence (AI) and an algorithm. PM concentration readings are sent to the Android device for monitoring and storage. The mobile sensor module was tested for both indoor and outdoor environments, and effectively found the locations of the highest PM concentrations. Using such a device has advantages over a sensor network, such as lower overall cost and lesser complexity of setup. This mobile sensor module provides a more cost-efficient and time-efficient method of finding PM hotspots. Once hotspots are located in the sampled environment, static sensors can be placed for the greatest effectiveness in measuring PM concentration over time. Furthermore, the mobile sensor module was manufactured with low-cost components, making it broadly affordable.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Demand for Genetic Algorithms (GA) in research and market applications has been increasing considerably. This can be explained through big data and the necessity of interpreting them in an automatic, efficient and intelligent way. In the case of intelligent systems for unmanned vehicles there are two well-defined subsystems: autonomous and robotic navigation. Despite the present day's good development of the latter, taking the best decisions is an essential robot's attribute that can only be acquired with the former. This work presents a fully programmed GA for a robot to walk around a planar graph G with the highest efficiency. Each robot's action is one among five kinds of genes, and fourteen of them build a chromosome, namely a sequence of actions for the robot to walk all around G. The efficiency of a chromosome is given by the number of visited vertices and the amount of saved energy, which are both computed by a fitness function. Our GA returns near-optimal chromosomes for the robot to clean the whole reflection pool with the least energy consumption. Our Coverage Path Planning differs from others in the literature because they consider obtaining a near-optimal sequence of vertices for the robot to follow in that order. Moreover, for such a sequence they do not allow vertex repetitions, whereas in our developed algorithm the robot can pass more than once in a same vertex, with the objective of guaranteeing a lower energy consumption. This objective already makes our best chromosomes avoid repeating vertices, as we have observed in our experiments.

AB This paper provides a genetic algorithm-based approach to calculate the optimal placement of receivers in a novel 3D position estimation system that uses a single transmitter and multiple receivers. The novelty in the system is the use of the difference in the times of arrival (TOAs) of an ultrasonic wave from the transmitter to the different receivers fixed in 3D space. This is a different approach to traditional systems that use the actual times of flight (TOFs) from the transmitter to the different receivers and triangulate the position of the transmitter. The new approach makes the system more accurate, makes the transmitter independent of the receivers and does not require the need of calculating the time delay term that is inherent in traditional systems due to delays caused by the electronic circuitry. This paper presents a thorough analysis of receiver configurations in the 2D and 3D systems that lead to singularities, i.e. locations of receivers that lead to formulations that cannot be solved due to a shortage of information. It provides guidelines of where not to place receivers so as to get a robust system, and further, presents a detailed analysis of locations that are optimal, i.e. locations that lead to the most accurate estimation of the transmitter positions. The results presented in this paper are not only applicable to ultrasonic systems but all systems that use wave theory, e.g. infrared, laser, etc. This work finds applications in virtual reality cells, robotics, guidance of indoor autonomous vehicles and vibration analysis.

AB Next-generation industrial edge artificial intelligence (AI) applications will undoubtedly emerge on energy-efficient, highly-integrated platforms incorporating various sensors, processors, and functional modules. Embedding the data quantization module onto edge AI chips, connecting sensors, processors, and functional modules is critical to achieving adaptive transformation of diverse data representation formats. This paper proposes a novel adaptive and low-power quantization technique and systematically validates its effectiveness from algorithm to hardware module for industrial IoT applications, covering precise navigation for autonomous vehicles and accurate classification utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs). The proposed quantization method merges an adaptive conversion function from floating-point to fixed-point binaries and an adaptive radix-point determination function, ensuring adequate resolution and minimal error loss of the fixed-point inputs to the edge AI modules. The experimental results demonstrate that the quantization error in the proposed quantization technique contributes negligible errors to the navigation solutions of the strapdown inertial navigation system and the DNNs' top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy (on the order of 10(-8) and 10(-7)). Moreover, a quantization-on-multiplier (QoM) hardware module is designed, synthesized, and routed in accordance with the proposed quantization technique. The simulation results indicate that the QoM's power consumption and area are 0.1 mW and 649.552 mu m(2), accounting for 5% and 14.15% of its total energy consumption and area, respectively. With our proposed on-chip quantization technique, the time required to quantize the parameters of DNNs is up to 1142 times shorter than with the existing benchmark off-chip quantization approaches.

AB Optical wireless data transmission from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to a sea-surface buoy has become a viable solution to support the increasing needs for many applications in the field of marine technology. Despite having unique characteristics and advantages, underwaterwireless optical communication remains a challenging field due to the difficulties associated with the harsh marine environments and severe attenuation caused by the bubbles and particulates. This study aims to evaluate the uplink UWOC system in the presence of particles and bubbles under various wind speeds. To calculate the link distances and signal loss between a transmitter and a receiver of the UWOC system, simulations were performed with the inputs of the water optical properties obtained from the Bay of Bengal and Southern Ocean waters and bubble properties derived from the Hall-Novarini (HN) model. Consequently, the normalized received power were calculated for the different receiver configurations and oceanic conditions without and with bubbles. Our results showed that the received power decreased with the increasing wind speeds and smaller bubble populations. The angular and spatial distributions of the received beam increased for smaller bubble populations under high wind speeds. When compared to the clean bubbles, the received power slightly decreased for the non-absorbing coated bubbles with different film thicknesses (0.01 similar to 1.0 mu m) and increased for the absorbing coated bubbles with higher thicknesses (>= 1 mu m). These results will significantly help the system designer to develop and optimize an UWOC system under different bubble populations and wind speed conditions.

AB Imaging through degraded visual environments is a challenging task in remote sensing missions. Image degradation may come from the loss of contrast due to particle scattering and/or distortion due to turbulence-induced effects. The problem is especially challenging when imaging from moving platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles. One potential approach to address these issues is to use multiple images and employ a multi-frame image fusion technique to aid in the recovery of corrupted image detail and quality. A machine learning (ML)-based image enhancement and fusion technique is investigated to restore images distorted by underwater turbulence. The main contributions include the incorporation of a ML-based image weight predictor to predict the ideal weight maps to be used in an image fusion process. This network is trained using a generative adversarial network framework and a synthetically generated image dataset, which is created according to an analytical image degradation model. In addition, the image loss function for the weight map predictor is determined by the final fused image, resulting in a balanced fusion technique that can reduce image distortion, recover crisp image detail, and reduce the overall noise figure. Another key contribution of this paper is the adoption of an image loss function that incorporates an innovative combined correntropy and Fourier space loss function to reinforce the network in both the spatial and frequency domain. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using a synthetic validation dataset of images and several real datasets captured at the Naval Research Lab's Simulated Turbulence and Turbidity Environment under various controlled turbulence intensities.

TI Assessment of Android Network Positioning as an Alternative Source of

DE Android; drone; network; location; Wi-Fi positioning; cell positioning
AB Applications of drones have increased significantly in the past decade for both indoor and outdoor operations. In order to assist autonomous drone navigation, there are numerous sensors installed onboard the vehicles. These include Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) chipsets, inertial sensors, barometer, lidar, radar and vision sensors. The two sensors used most often by drone autopilot controllers for absolute positioning are the GNSS chipsets and barometer. Although, for most outdoor operations, these sensors provide accurate and reliable position information, their accuracy, availability, and integrity deteriorate for indoor applications and in the presence of radio frequency interference (RFI), such as GNSS spoofing and jamming. Therefore, it is possible to derive network-based locations from Wi-Fi and cellular transmission. Although there have been many theoretical studies on network positioning, limited resources are available for the expected quantitative performance of these positioning methodologies. In this paper, the authors investigate both the horizontal and vertical accuracy of the Android network location engines under rural, suburban, and urban environments. The paper determines the horizontal location accuracy to be approximately 1637 m, 38 m, and 32 m in terms of 68% circular error probable (CEP) for rural, suburban, and urban environments, respectively, and the vertical accuracy to be 1.2 m and 4.6 m in terms of 68% CEP for suburban and urban environments, respectively. In addition, the availability and latency of the location engines are explored. Furthermore, the paper assesses the accuracy of the Android network location accuracy indicator for various drone operation environments. The assessed accuracies of the network locations provide a deeper insight into their potential for drone navigation.

ID NAVIGATION
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles require accurate navigation. Techniques such as image registration using consecutive acoustic images from a sonar have shown promising results for this task. The implementation of such techniques using sonar images augmented with deep learning (DL) networks demonstrate high navigation accuracy; this is possible even with highly compressed images. The sonar images are estimates of sampled in time (with a ping period) magnitudes of channel impulse responses representing the underwater acoustic environment. More information about the environment is contained in (almost) continuous in time estimates of the channel impulse responses. Such estimates can be obtained using full-duplex technology. Rather than using sonar images, this paper investigates the use of channel impulse response estimates for underwater platform motion estimation. The proposed system uses a single projector and a small number of receiving transducers installed on the moving platform. A DL network is used to estimate the motion in two degrees of freedom (forward/backward and sideways), using two or more consecutive impulse response estimates as the input. To train the DL network, a specially designed simulator is used to model the underwater acoustic environment, populated with multiple objects spread on the seafloor. The proposed technique can significantly reduce the acoustic hardware and processing complexity of the DL network and obtain a higher accuracy of motion estimation, compared with techniques based on the processing of sonar images, e.g., the error achieved with the technique proposed in this paper is 1.7% of the maximum platform displacement, compared to 4% achieved with a technique using sonar images. The navigation accuracy is further illustrated by examples of estimation of complex trajectories.

TI MRAS Based Speed Control of DC Motor with Conventional PI Control - A
   Comparative Study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Adaptive control; DC Motor; MIT rule; MRAS; PI controller
AB The major challenges in applying a conventional speed controller in DC motor are the effects of motor non-linearity. The non-linear characteristics of a DC motor like, saturation and friction could degrade the performance of conventional controllers. The parameters of such a dynamic system changes with time and drive the system beyond the stability margins. The conventional feedback control system thereby fails to maintain the control especially when the plant parameters are unknown. To overcome these problems, an adaptive control system is proposed which can cope up with the changes in motor dynamics. The control scheme used here is the model reference adaptive system (MRAS) where the output of the unknown plant is tuned to track the output of the ideal reference model. The perfect adaptation is achieved by an adaptive estimator implemented based on MIT rule. The plant output is stabilized by an auto-PID controller (PID controller that tunes its parameters by its own) along with the adaptive estimator. The adaptation mechanism modulates the controller and update the controller parameters to minimize error and track the ideal output. The entire proposed system is modelled and simulated in MATLAB, SIMULINK. The results are analyzed and compared over conventional PI control scheme as a part of the study. The proposed system showed better resistance to the forced perturbations induced, with good decay ratio and fine settling. The system showed satisfactory results when operated in low, medium and high speeds. The motive of the thesis is to implement a self-adaptive and autonomous DC motor speed control for variable orbit tracking applications in robotics, launch vehicles, space probes, satellites, unmanned rovers etc.

AB Deep learning models have achieved high performance across different domains, such as medical decision making, autonomous vehicles, decision support systems, among many others. However, despite this success, the inner mechanisms of these models are opaque because their internal representations are too complex for a human to understand. This opacity makes it hard to understand the how or the why of the predictions of deep learning models. There has been a growing interest in model-agnostic methods that make deep learning models more transparent and explainable to humans. Some researchers recently argued that for a machine to achieve human level explainability, this machine needs to provide human causally understandable explanations, also known as causability. A specific class of algorithms that have the potential to provide causability are counterfactuals. This paper presents an in-depth systematic review of the diverse existing literature on counterfactuals and causability for explainable artificial intelligence (AI). We performed a Latent Dirichlet topic modelling analysis (LDA) under a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework to find the most relevant literature articles. This analysis yielded a novel taxonomy that considers the grounding theories of the surveyed algorithms, together with their underlying properties and applications to real-world data. Our research suggests that current model-agnostic counterfactual algorithms for explainable AI are not grounded on a causal theoretical formalism and, consequently, cannot promote causability to a human decision-maker. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the explanations derived from popular algorithms in the literature provide spurious correlations rather than cause/effects relationships, leading to sub-optimal, erroneous, or even biased explanations. Thus, this paper also advances the literature with new directions and challenges on promoting causability in model-agnostic approaches for explainable AI.

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
LA English
DT Article
DE unmanned aerial vehicle; deep reinforcement learning; visual active
   tracking
AB Active tracking control is essential for UAVs to perform autonomous operations in GPS-denied environments. In the active tracking task, UAVs take high-dimensional raw images as input and execute motor actions to actively follow the dynamic target. Most research focuses on three-stage methods, which entail perception first, followed by high-level decision-making based on extracted spatial information of the dynamic target, and then UAV movement control, using a low-level dynamic controller. Perception methods based on deep neural networks are powerful but require considerable effort for manual ground truth labeling. Instead, we unify the perception and decision-making stages using a high-level controller and then leverage deep reinforcement learning to learn the mapping from raw images to the high-level action commands in the V-REP-based environment, where simulation data are infinite and inexpensive. This end-to-end method also has the advantages of a small parameter size and reduced effort requirements for parameter turning in the decision-making stage. The high-level controller, which has a novel architecture, explicitly encodes the spatial and temporal features of the dynamic target. Auxiliary segmentation and motion-in-depth losses are introduced to generate denser training signals for the high-level controller's fast and stable training. The high-level controller and a conventional low-level PID controller constitute our hierarchical active tracking control framework for the UAVs' active tracking task. Simulation experiments show that our controller trained with several augmentation techniques sufficiently generalizes dynamic targets with random appearances and velocities, and achieves significantly better performance, compared with three-stage methods.

AB Depth profiling investigation plays an important role in studying the dynamic processes of the ocean. In this paper, a newly developed hyphenated underwater system based on multi-optical spectrometry is introduced and used to measure seawater spectra at different depths with the aid of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The hyphenated system consists of two independent compact deep-sea spectral instruments, a deep ocean compact autonomous Raman spectrometer and a compact underwater laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy system for sea applications (LIBSea). The former was used to take both Raman scattering and fluorescence of seawater, and the LIBS signal could be recorded with the LIBSea. The first sea trial of the developed system was taken place in the Bismarck Sea, Papua New Guinea, in June 2015. Over 4000 multi-optical spectra had been captured up to the diving depth about 1800 m at maximum. The depth profiles of some ocean parameters were extracted from the captured joint Raman-fluorescence and LIBS spectra with a depth resolution of 1 m. The concentrations of SO4 2- and the water temperatures were measured using Raman spectra. The fluorescence intensities from both colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and chlorophyll were found to be varied in the euphotic zone. With LIBS spectra, the depth profiles of metallic elements were also obtained. The normalized intensity of atomic line Ca(I) extracted from LIBS spectra raised around the depth of 1600 m, similar to the depth profile of CDOM. This phenomenon might be caused by the nonbuoyant hydrothermal plumes. It is worth mentioning that this is the first time Raman and LIBS spectroscopy have been applied simultaneously to the deep-sea in situ investigations.

AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have been developed rapidly over the last few decades because of global urbanization and industrialization. ITS involve a wide range of different technologies and applications such as automatic road enforcement, dynamic traffic light sequence, and as a result, a significant number of scientific papers have been published in the field of ITS. In this paper, we present a useful insight into the development of ITS area by systematically analyzing the publications over the period of 20 years. First, we identify the most cited papers and most impactful authors in the field. Second, in the aspect of topic analysis, we identify some active keywords. To do so, we develop a keyword co-occurrence network to find topics in the ITS field. Finally, for the collaboration pattern analysis, we construct two networks to interpret collaboration patterns, including a co-authorship network, and an author co-keyword network to show the development and research tendency of ITS. Some most interesting findings from our investigation include the following: 1) Besides the USA, China and Europe have begun to play an increasingly significant role in this field and 2) GPS, traffic control, and road safety show an upward trend from the analysis of the evolution of ITS research topics, given the rise of new research areas such as autonomous vehicles. Our first-hand investigation and analysis of the literature provides a valuable reference to research activities in the development of ITS field and presents worthy insights on the current status and future technical trends.

AB CubeSats are playing an increasingly larger role in exploration, technology demonstrations, scientific research and educational investigations at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). These miniature satellites provide a low-cost platform for NASA missions, including planetary space exploration; Earth observation; and technology demonstrations such as cutting-edge laser communications, energy storage, in-space propulsion and autonomous movement capabilities. They also provide educators with an inexpensive means to engage students in all phases of satellite development, operation and exploitation through real world, hands-on research and development experience on NASA-funded and non-NASA funded opportunities. These advancements in turn are propelling an emerging and fast-growing commercial industry to support a wide application user base.
   For the past seven years, NASA has enabled educational institutions, universities, non-profit organizations and agency field centers to launch these small research satellites through the CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) for Educational Launch of Nanosatellite (ELaNa) missions. Launch opportunities are made available via existing launch services of government payloads on previously planned launches, commercial missions or as International Space Station deployments, as well as dedicated CubeSat launches from the newly selected Venture Class Launch Services contracts. CSLI establishes Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with satellite development partners, which supports NASA's emphasis on public-private partnerships.
   Since the inception of the CubeSat Launch Initiative, NASA has selected over 162 CubeSat missions from 93 unique organizations and has launched 66 CubeSats into orbit on seventeen ELaNa Missions. This paper provides a status and overview of missions and community involvement, launch vehicles, and technology and science focus areas. It also details the methods employed by NASA to deliver CSLI, requirements for participation, and next steps for the initiative.

AB The rapid pace of developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is providing unprecedented opportunities to enhance the performance of different industries and businesses, including the transport sector. The innovations introduced by AI include highly advanced computational methods that mimic the way the human brain works. The application of AI in the transport field is aimed at overcoming the challenges of an increasing travel demand, CO2 emissions, safety concerns, and environmental degradation. In light of the availability of a huge amount of quantitative and qualitative data and AI in this digital age, addressing these concerns in a more efficient and effective fashion has become more plausible. Examples of AI methods that are finding their way to the transport field include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Genetic algorithms (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Artificial Immune system (AIS), Ant Colony Optimiser (ACO) and Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) and Fuzzy Logic Model (FLM) The successful application of AI requires a good understanding of the relationships between AI and data on one hand, and transportation system characteristics and variables on the other hand. Moreover, it is promising for transport authorities to determine the way to use these technologies to create a rapid improvement in relieving congestion, making travel time more reliable to their customers and improve the economics and productivity of their vital assets. This paper provides an overview of the AI techniques applied worldwide to address transportation problems mainly in traffic management, traffic safety, public transportation, and urban mobility. The overview concludes by addressing the challenges and limitations of AI applications in transport.

AB While processes associated with initiation and maintenance of oceanic detachment faults are becoming better constrained, much less is known about the tectonic and magmatic conditions that lead to fault abandonment. Here we present results from near-bottom investigations using the submersible Alvin and autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry at a recently extinct detachment fault near 13 degrees 48N, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, that allow documentation of the final stages of fault activity and magmatism. Seafloor imagery, sampling, and near-bottom magnetic data show that the detachment footwall is intersected by an similar to 850 m-wide volcanic outcrop including pillow lavas. Saturation pressures in these vesicular basalts, based on dissolved H2O and CO2, are less than their collection pressures, which could be explained by eruption at a shallower level than their present depth. Sub-bottom profiles reveal that sediment thickness, a loose proxy for seafloor age, is similar to 2m greater on top of the volcanic terrain than on the footwall adjacent to the hanging-wall cutoff. This difference could be explained by current-driven erosion in the axial valley or by continued slip after volcanic emplacement, on either a newly formed or pre-existing fault. Since current speeds near the footwall are unlikely to be sufficient to cause significant erosion, we favor the hypothesis that detachment slip continued after the episode of magmatism, consistent with growing evidence that oceanic detachments can continue to slip despite hosting magmatic intrusions.

AB High-resolution geophysical mapping was conducted from an autonomous underwater vehicle on the flank of Daisan-Kume Knoll in the Ryukyu Arc, southwest of Japan. 1 m resolution bathymetry identified 264 spires, 173 large mounds and 268 small mounds within a depression that is up to 1600 m wide and up to 60 m deep, at water depths between 1330 and 1470 m. Hydrothermal venting is strongly inferred from the observation of plumes in sidescan sonar imagery and positive temperature anomalies over the spires and mounds. This field, named the Gondou Field, has a giant mound G1 with a diameter of 280 m and a height of 80 m. Mound G1 has distinctive summit ridges composed of multiple spires where acoustic plumes with temperature anomalies up to 1.12 degrees C are observed, indicative of high-temperature venting. Other than mound G1, a number of active large mounds more than 30 m wide and spires over 10-22 m tall are common and they concentrate in the central and southern areas of the field, suggesting that these areas are the center of present hydrothermal activity. Acoustic plumes imaged by side-scan sonar at the Gondou Field are different in character from bubble plumes imaged in other hydrothermal fields in the Ryukyu Arc. The plumes are diffused and deflected as they rise through the water column and have a shape consistent with black smokers.

AB Physical and optical measurements taken over the mud belt on the southern continental shelf of Monterey Bay, California documented the frequent occurrence of suspended particulate matter features, the majority of which were detached from the seafloor, centered 9-33 m above the bed. In fall 2011, an automated profiling mooring and fixed instrumentation, including a thermistor chain and upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profiler, were deployed at 70 m depth for 5 weeks, and from 12 to 16 October a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle performed across-shelf transects. Individual SPM events were uncorrelated with local bed shear stress caused by surface waves and bottom currents. Nearly half of all observed SPM layers occurred during 1 week of the study, 9-16 October 2011, and were advected past the fixed profiling mooring by the onshore phase of semidiurnal internal tide bottom currents. At the start of the 9-16 October period, we observed intense near-bed vertical velocities capable of lifting particulates into the middle of the water column. This updraft event appears to have been associated with nonlinear adjustment of high-amplitude internal tides over the mid and outer shelf. These findings suggest that nonlinear internal tidal motions can erode material over the outer shelf and that, once suspended, this SPM can then be transported shoreward to the middle and shallow sections of the mud belt. This represents a fundamental broadening of our understanding of how shelf mud belts may be built up and sustained.

AB An imager that can measure the distance from each pixel to the point on the object that is in focus at the pixel is described. This is accomplished by short photo-conducting lightguides at each pixel. In the eye the rods and cones are the fiber-like lightguides. The device uses ambient light that is only coherent in spherical shell-shaped light packets of thickness of one coherence length. Modern semiconductor technology permits the construction of lightguides shorter than a coherence length of ambient light. Each of the frequency components of the broad band light arriving at a pixel has a phase proportional to the distance from an object point to its image pixel. Light frequency components in the packet arriving at a pixel through a convex lens add constructively only if the light comes from the object point in focus at this pixel. The light in packets from all other object points cancels. Thus the pixel receives light from one object point only. The lightguide has contacts along its length. The lightguide charge carriers are generated by the light patterns. These light patterns, and thus the photocurrent, shift in response to the phase of the input signal. Thus, the photocurrent is a function of the distance from the pixel to its object point. Applications include autonomous vehicle navigation and robotic vision. Another application is a crude teleportation system consisting of a camera and a three-dimensional printer at a remote location. (C) The Authors.

AB Several researchers have attempted to formulate and solve different classes of the earthwork allocation problem. Linear programming (LP) and integer programming (IP) techniques have traditionally been applied to minimize transportation costs and mass-haul distances associated with earthwork processes. However, typical formulations of the earthwork allocation problem do not consider the sequence of equipment movement and are, therefore, limited in their ability to establish a practical and workable hauling plan. A more complex problem, which is formulated and solved in this research, is the least-cost route cut and fill problem (LCRCFP). The primary objective of the LCRCFP is to determine the specific route to be traveled and the quantities of soil that construction equipment must haul to meet the desired grade while minimizing the total distance traveled. In this research, the LCRCFP was formulated as a mixed binary optimization problem and solved using a traditional branch-and-bound method and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. Accordingly, this solution can provide efficient and practical hauling plans for construction sites. Furthermore, a linear variation of the problem, which is common for linear roadwork or utility construction, was also formulated and solved. Extensive computational results are reported for several randomly generated instances of the LCRCFP. Realistic problems can be effectively solved using PSO. Thus, the derived plan can be used in mapping and path planning and by on-site engineers. It can also be used for the deployment of unmanned construction equipment in autonomous vehicle control systems. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000512. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB On June 1, 2009, Air France AF447 disappeared in the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France. On June 6-19, 2009, bodies and debris from the aircraft were recovered floating in the equatorial ocean. This paper describes efforts on using the global-local nested finite volume community ocean model (FVCOM) to model reversely the tracks of bodies and debris back to the time of the crash and to help searchers locate the cockpit voice and flight data recorders and learn why this tragic accident occurred. To validate the reliability and reality of FVCOM, eight surface drifters were deployed by the French Bureau d'Enqutes et d'Analyses pour la s,curit, de l'aviation civile (BEA) near the last known position in early June 2010 for a period of 3 weeks. These drifter data were used to optimize the spatial and temporal correlation scales of the adaptive sampling data assimilation method of FVCOM. Applying an optimized FVCOM system to assimilate all available drifter- and float-tracking-derived currents in May-June 2009 under three different wind conditions, we reproduced the June 2009 current fields in the area near the LKP and used these fields to reversely track bodies and debris from locations where they were found to the time when the crash occurred. Possible locations for the crashed plane were suggested based on our model results and were made available to the French investigators and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle Operations Group who successfully located the aircraft debris field in April 2011 on the seafloor at a depth of 3,900 m.

AB Implementing tele-assistance or supervisory control for autonomous subsea robots requires atomic actions that can be called from high level task planners or mission managers. This paper reports on the design and implementation of a particular atomic action for the case of a subsea robot carrying out tasks in contact with the surrounding environment.
   Subsea vehicles equipped with manipulators can have upward of 11 degrees of freedom (DOF), with degenerate and redundant inverse kinematics. Distributed local motion planning is presented as a means to specify the motion of each robot DOF given a goal point or trajectory. Results are presented to show the effectiveness of the distributed versus non-distributed approach, a means to deal with local minima difficulties, and the performance for trajectory following with and without saturated joint angles on a robot arm.
   Consideration is also given to the modelling of hydraulic underwater robots and to the resulting design of hybrid position/force control strategies. A model for a hydraulically actuated robot is developed, taking into account the electrohydraulic servovalve, the bulk modulus of oil, piston area, friction, hose compliance and other arm parameters. Open and closed-loop control results are reported for simulated and real systems.
   Finally, the use of distributed motion planning and sequential position/force control of a Slingsby TA-9 hydraulic underwater manipulator is described, to implement an atomic action for tele-assistance. The specific task of automatically positioning and inserting a Tronic subsea mateable connector is illustrated, with results showing the contact conditions during insertion.

AB There are complex coupling relationships between flight motion and energy management for hybrid electric fixed wing UAVs with photovoltaic/fuel cell/battery. Aiming at realizing high-energy-efficiency long endurance autonomous flight, this paper proposes a coordinated optimization method of trajectory optimization and energy management for hybrid electric UAVs. Numerical simulation and experiment are carried out. Separated by surplus demand energy except that produced by PV, this method includes an optimal energy flight trajectory optimization layer and an energy management layer. For the former, fuzzy neural network sequential convex optimization (FNNSCP) is proposed to handle the flight trajectory optimization problem for maximizing utilization solar energy. For the latter, an online energy management strategy based on convex quadratic programming MPC (CQPMPC) is proposed to realize the power allocation. Numerical simulation results show that FNNSCP reduced 2% energy requirement compared with Radau pseudo-spectral method (RPM) from flight trajectory optimization level. From energy management level, CQPMPC saves hydrogen consumption by 3.1% and 16.3% compared with nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and fuzzy logic state machine (FLSM), respectively. In the experiment, less hydrogen fuel is consumed by proposed method by 5.2% and 15.6% compared with NMPC and FLSM, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better energy-saving performance and excellent real time performance. It indicates that optimizing flight trajectory and improving energy management efficiency can realize the high-energy-efficiency flight of hybrid electric UAVs. This method is conducive to promoting the application of hydrogen energy in the field of UAVs.

ID SELECTION
AB The development and rise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications including Intelligent Transport System (ITS) has significantly reshaped and transformed. A key research area that is, an intelligent visual aid for Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) has been certainly persuaded and transformed to control automobiles and ensure safe driving. Similarly, TSR is an important feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) that contributes to the safety of drivers, pedestrians, and automobiles. This work is aimed to recognize traffic signs robustly and effi-ciently in challenging environmental conditions. Hence, keeping the diversity of the problem in mind, a novel 30-layered deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is proposed. In the proposed model each convolutional layer produced around a minimum number of salient and highly discriminative features incorpo-rating different datasets for classification purposes. This novel approach used the extracted features to train the model without the assistance of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Once the model becomes trained, different competitive classifiers including Tree, SVM, KNN, and discriminant analysis are used to classify the data. The re-sult reflects that Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) achieves comparable results among all other competitive classifiers with 97.4% accuracy with a minimum training time of 5.12 s on the CURE-TSR dataset. To evaluate and monitor the efficacy of the novel approach, it is further tested on two more datasets including GTSRB and BTSRB. The proposed approach acquired 99.12% and 98.16% accuracy on both datasets respectively. Finally, the comparable results on all the benchmark datasets reflect the proposed approach's applicability and advantage.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Before-after analysis methods in traffic safety often aggregate traffic crashes into crash frequencies using relatively long aggregation time periods, such as a year. The implicit assumption is that the treatment effect is temporally stable over the aggregation period. However, certain "treatments", such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in fast-evolving changes to road safety. By aggregating individual crashes, it is difficult to investigate the temporal characteristics of crashes and capture the potential temporal instability in treatment effect at detailed temporal levels, such as within a year. Therefore, this study exploits the disaggregated nature of crashes and proposes a survival analysis with random parameter (SARP) before-after analysis approach that can flexibly accommodate the temporal instability in treatment effect at various temporal levels. To validate and test the proposed approach, a statistical simulation study and an empirical case study that investigates the safety impact of COVID-19 lockdown in Manhattan, New York, are conducted. The statistical simulation study shows that the SARP method can unbiasedly estimate different patterns of temporally instable treatment effect at various temporal levels. The estimated monthly crash modification factors from the case study display an increasing trend after the largest decrease in the first month after the lockdown, which implies that traffic safety conditions are gradually returning to normal and provides evidence of temporal instability in treatment effect. The proposed SARP approach is promising to investigate the evolving safety impact of emerging technologies in transportation, such as the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles.

AB In smart cities, the fast increase in automobiles has caused congestion, pollution, and disruptions in the transportation of commodities. Each year, there are more fatalities and cases of permanent impairment due to everyday road accidents. To control traffic congestion, provide secure data transmission also detecting accidents the IoT-based Traffic Management System is used. To identify, gather, and send data, autonomous cars, and intelligent gadgets are equipped with an IoT-based ITM system with a group of sensors. The transport system is being improved via machine learning. In this work, an Adaptive Traffic Management system (ATM) with an accident alert sound system (AALS) is used for managing traffic congestion and detecting the accident. For secure traffic data transmission Secure Early Traffic -Related EveNt Detection (SEE-TREND) is used. The design makes use of several scenarios to address every potential problem with the transportation system. The suggested ATM model continuously modifies the timing of traffic signals based on the volume of traffic and anticipated movements from neighboring junctions. By progressively allowing cars to pass green lights, it considerably reduces traveling time. It also relieves traffic congestion by creating a seamless transition. The results of the trial show that the suggested ATM system fared noticeably better than the traditional traffic-management method and will be a leader in transportation planning for smart-city-based transportation systems. The suggested ATM-ALTREND solution provides secure traffic data transmission that decreases traffic jams and vehicle wait times, lowers accident rates, and enhances the entire travel experience.

DE Speech recognition; universal adversarial attack; black-box attacks;
   transfer attacks
AB Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been widely and commercially employed in health care, autonomous vehicles, and finance. Yet, recent studies have shown that universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) pose a serious threat to white-box ASR systems when the adversary has access to the target model. Until now, the impacts of such a threat on commercial systems are still open since their models are not publicly available. To understand the security weakness in the practical black-box setting, this paper introduces the first zero-query UAP attacks, called AdvDDoS, with black-box access to ASR systems: we do not need to pay any query expense to estimate UAPs. Specifically, we craft targeted UAPs under a popular feature extractor and a local ASR model by reversing the robust target-category features, in which adversarial perturbations containing robust features are believed to have better transferability. Compared with vanilla UAPs, our UAPs incorporated with target-category features lead to better attacks against commercial ASR systems. We validate the efficacy of our AdvDDoS by launching attacks against a range of commercial ASR systems, i.e., three API services (Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu), and three personal assistants (Apple Siri, iFlytek, and Google). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of AdvDDoS. For example, AdvDDoS achieves 83.26% word error rate (WER) and 53.25% success rates of attacks (SRoA) for the universal attack against Tencent ASR API, which outperforms the vanilla UAPs by up to 61.56% on WER and 11.6% on SRoA. The success of our attack sheds light on zero-query UAP attacks against commercial ASR systems.

AB The rapid development of the Internet and smart devices trigger surge in network traffic making its infrastructure more complex and heterogeneous. The predominated usage of mobile phones, wearable devices and autonomous vehicles are examples of distributed networks which generate huge amount of data each and every day. The computational power of these devices have also seen steady progression which has created the need to transmit information, store data locally and drive network computations towards edge devices. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a significant role in ensuring security and privacy of such devices. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) with Intrusion Detection Systems have gained great momentum due to their achievement of high classification accuracy. However the privacy and security aspects potentially gets jeopardized due to the need of storing and communicating data to centralized server. On the contrary, Federated Learning (FL) fits in appropriately as a privacy-preserving decentralized learning technique that does not transfer data but trains models locally and transfers the parameters to the centralized server. The present paper aims to present an extensive and exhaustive review on the use of FL in intrusion detection system. In order to establish the need for FL, various types of IDS, relevant ML approaches and its associated issues are discussed. The paper presents detailed overview of the implementation of FL in various aspects of anomaly detection. The allied challenges of FL implementations are also identified which provides idea on the scope of future direction of research. The paper finally presents the plausible solutions associated with the identified challenges in FL based intrusion detection system implementation acting as a baseline for prospective research.

AB In this article, the pose regulation control problem of a robotic fish is investigated by formulating it as a Markov decision process (MDP). Such a typical task that requires the robot to arrive at the desired position with the desired orientation remains a challenge, since two objectives (position and orientation) may be conflicted during optimization. To handle the challenge, we adopt the sparse reward scheme, i.e., the robot will be rewarded if and only if it completes the pose regulation task. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can achieve such an MDP with sparse rewards, the absence of immediate reward hinders the robot from efficient learning. To this end, we propose a novel imitation learning (IL) method that learns DRL-based policies from demonstrations with inverse reward shaping to overcome the challenge raised by extremely sparse rewards. Moreover, we design a demonstrator to generate various trajectory demonstrations based on one simple example from a nonexpert helper, which greatly reduces the time consumption of collecting robot samples. The simulation results evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed demonstrator and the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed IL method. Furthermore, we deploy the trained IL policy on a physical robotic fish to perform pose regulation in a swimming tank without/with external disturbances. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods in real world. Therefore, we believe this article is a step forward in the field of biomimetic underwater robot learning.

AB The autonomous and controllable Dual Synthetic Jet Actuator (DSJA) is firstly integrated into the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and flight tests without the deflection of rudders are carried out to verify the viability of DSJA to control the attitudes of UAV during cruising. DSJA is improved into an actuator with two diaphragms and three cavities, which has higher energy levels. Actuators, differentially distributed on both sides of the wings, are installed on the trailing edge close to the wing tips. Flight tests, containing Differential Circulation Control (DCC) using double-side actuators, Positive Circulation Control (PCC) using left-side actuators and Negative Circulation Control (NCC) using right-side actuators, are implemented at cruising speed of 25 m/s. Results show that roll attitude control without rudders could be realized by DSJAs. DCC and NCC can generate the rightward roll and yaw angular velocity, prompting UAV to turn right. The stronger controlling ability can be achieved by DCC, with the maximum roll angular velocity of 15.62 (degrees)/s. PCC can generate a rightward roll moment, but a leftward yaw moment will be produced at the same time. Leftward yaw induces the leftward rolling moment, which weakens the roll control effect, making UAV keep to yaw to the left with a small slope.

AB As a promising autonomous observation platform for ocean phenomena, underwater glider can achieve space motion by adjusting its net buoyancy and attitude. In some high accuracy exploration missions, underwater glider needs to move on a specific trajectory, and the position that the glider resurfaces should be accurate enough. In fact, many uncertain factors will affect the glider motion and reduce the motion accuracy, especially the current. In this paper, we present a feedback control strategy for improving the glider motion accuracy in currents. The feedback control is achieved by intermittently adjusting the movable mass block rotation amount, which is energy-saving. Especially, the feedback control strategy considers the force condition change of the glider in different water depths and the different motion states of the glider in currents. Besides, we introduce the surrogate models to calculate the adjustment time length of movable mass block rotation amount, which can ensure that the feedback control has a higher reaction speed. To verify the effectiveness of the above strategy, the dynamic model of underwater glider is established, and the model is validated by using experimental data. The simulation results under specific working conditions illustrate that the feedback control strategy can effectively improve the glider motion accuracy in currents. To achieve the optimal control, we further propose a method to optimize the relevant parameters of feedback control strategy, considering the multiple working conditions and the energy consumption metric. The simulation results under specific working conditions verify the effectiveness of proposed optimization method. The research works can provide certain guidance for the achievement of the glider precision operation.

TI Joint Generative Image Deblurring Aided by Edge Attention Prior and
   Dynamic Kernel Selection
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING

DT Article
ID BLIND; SHAKEN; BLUR
AB Image deblurring is a classic and important problem in industrial fields, such as aviation photo restoration, object recognition in robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Blurry images in real-world scenarios consist of mixed blurring types, such as a natural motion blurring owing to shaking of the camera. Fast deblurring does not deblur the entire image because it is not the best option. Considering the computational costs, it is also better to have an alternative kernel to deblur different objects at a high-semantic level. To achieve better image restoration quality, it is also beneficial to combine the blurring category location and important structural information in terms of specific artifacts and degree of blurring. The goal of blind image deblurring is to restore sharpness from the unknown blurring kernel of an image. Recent deblurring methods tend to reconstruct prior knowledge, neglecting the influence of blur estimation and visual fidelity on image details and structure. Generative adversarial networks(GANs) have recently been attracting considerable attention from both academia and industry because GAN can perfectly generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. Therefore, this study proposes a generative neural architecture and an edge attention algorithm developed to restore vivid multimedia patches. Joint edge generation and image restoration techniques are designed to solve the low-level multimedia retrieval. This multipath refinement fusion network (MRFNet) can not only perform deblurring of images directly but also individual the frames separately from videos. Ablation experiments validate that our generative adversarial network MRFNet performs better in joint training than in multimodel. Compared to other GAN methods, our two-phase method exhibited state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and accuracy as well as has a significant visual improvement.

AB With advances in machine vision systems (e.g., artificial eye, unmanned aerial vehicles, surveillance monitoring) scene semantic recognition (SSR) technology has attracted much attention due to its related applications such as autonomous driving, tourist navigation, intelligent traffic and remote aerial sensing. Although tremendous progress has been made in visual interpretation, several challenges remain (i.e., dynamic backgrounds, occlusion, lack of labeled data, changes in illumination, direction, and size). Therefore, we have proposed a novel SSR framework that intelligently segments the locations of objects, generates a novel Bag of Features, and recognizes scenes via Maximum Entropy. First, denoising and smoothing are applied on scene data. Second, modified Fuzzy C-Means integrates with super-pixels and Random Forest for the segmentation of objects. Third, these segmented objects are used to extract a novel Bag of Features that concatenate different blobs, multiple orientations, Fourier transform and geometrical points over the objects. An Artificial Neural Network recognizes the multiple objects using the different patterns of objects. Finally, labels are estimated via Maximum Entropy model. During experimental evaluation, our proposed system illustrated a remarkable mean accuracy rate of 90.07% over the MSRC dataset and 89.26% over the Caltech 101 for object recognition, and 93.53% over the Pascal-VOC12 dataset for scene recognition, respectively. The proposed system should be applicable to various emerging technologies, such as augmented reality, to represent the real-world environment for military training and engineering design, as well as for entertainment, artificial eyes for visually impaired people and traffic monitoring to avoid congestion or road accidents.

AB This paper proposes a path planning algorithm using the hybridization of the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) and ant colony system (ACS) algorithms. The RRT algorithm can quickly generate paths. However, the resulting path is suboptimal. Meanwhile, the ACS algorithm can generate the optimal path from the suboptimal previous path information. Then, the proposed algorithm will combine the advantages of RRT with the ACS algorithm. Therefore, it can reach the optimal value with a good convergence speed. We call this proposed algorithm the RRT-ACS algorithm. This study developed a new method for hybridizing the RRT and ACS algorithms for path planning problems. This hybridization process is carried out using one of the ACS principles: the pseudorandom proportional rule. The performance of the proposed algorithm with the RRT*, informed RRT*, RRT*-connect, and informed RRT*-connect algorithms is tested with several benchmark cases. The test results from benchmark case tests with known optimal values indicate that the proposed algorithm has succeeded in achieving those optimal values. Furthermore, statistical tests have also been carried out to verify whether there is a significant difference in performance between the RRT-ACS algorithm and the existing algorithms. The test and statistical analysis results show that the RRT-ACS algorithm has good performance and convergence speed. We also discuss the stability, robustness, convergence, and rapidity of the RRT-ACS algorithm. The results indicates that the RRT-ACS algorithm may be used in applications that require fast and optimal path planning algorithms such as robots and autonomous vehicles.

AB The number and areal extent of marine protected areas worldwide is rapidly increasing as a result of numerous national targets that aim to see up to 30% of their waters protected by 2030. Automated seabed classification algorithms are arising as faster and objective methods to generate benthic habitat maps to monitor these areas. However, no study has yet systematically compared their repeatability. Here we aim to address that problem by comparing the repeatability of maps derived from acoustic datasets collected on consecutive days using three automated seafloor classification algorithms: (1) Random Forest (RF), (2) K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and (3) K means (KMEANS). The most robust and repeatable approach is then used to evaluate the change in seafloor habitats between 2012 and 2015 within the Greater Haig Fras Marine Conservation Zone, Celtic Sea, UK. Our results demonstrate that only RF and KNN provide statistically repeatable maps, with 60.3% and 47.2% agreement between consecutive days. Additionally, this study suggests that in low-relief areas, bathymetric derivatives are non-essential input parameters, while backscatter textural features, in particular Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices, are substantially more effective in the detection of different habitats. Habitat persistence in the test area between 2012 and 2015 was 48.8%, with swapping of habitats driving the changes in 38.2% of the area. Overall, this study highlights the importance of investigating the repeatability of automated seafloor classification methods before they can be fully used in the monitoring of benthic habitats.

AB This article outlines a counter-cyclical innovation strategy to achieve prosperity, derived from an innovative project, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). We identify an innovation paradox' in that the very point in the business cycle, when legislators are tempted to view austerity as a cure for economic downturns and to reduce innovation spend, is when an increase is most needed to create new industries and jobs and innovate out of recession or depression. It is both desirable and possible that policymakers resist the urge to capitulate to the innovation paradox. During periods that exhibit subdued inflation, elevated spare productive capacity, and low government borrowing rates, governments should increase their borrowings and use the proceeds to boost investment targeted towards innovation. We show how the State of California successfully utilized debt financing, traditionally reserved for physical infrastructure projects, to stimulate the development of intellectual infrastructure. Finally, we recommend a halt to European austerity policies and a triple helix' broadening of narrow smart specialization' policies that chase a private venture capital chimera. Europe should seize the present macroeconomic opportunity of low interest rates, borrow for innovation and be paid back manifold by picking winners', similarly to what the USA has been doing through DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) with GPS, as a response to Sputnik, the Internet and artificial intelligence, or the driverless car, formerly known as the autonomous land vehicle' in its military guise. Proactively targeted macroscopic investments in innovation are needed to solve the productivity/employment puzzle and foster the transition to a knowledge-based society.

DE on-board orbit determination; Kalman filter; twoline elements; GPS
AB Kalman filters provide a well established means for satellite orbit determination. In combination with space based sensors like GPS, DORIS or PRARE, accurate estimates of the spacecraft position and velocity can be obtained in real-time on-board the space vehicle. Traditionally, numerical methods of varying complexity are applied for propagating the state vector between measurements and updates of the state vector are referred to the epoch of the latest sensor output. In the present study a different approach is followed, which offers increased on-board autonomy and is particularly promising for small satellites with moderate accuracy requirements. An analytical orbit model is used to describe the spacecraft trajectory and mean elements at epoch are estimated instead of the instantaneous, osculating state vector. This adds the capability of performing on-board orbit prediction over time scales of up to one week, which is required, for instance, for the autonomous forecast of eclipse times or station contacts. Making use of the SGP4 orbit model that is compatible with NORAD twoline elements, an epoch state Kalman filter has been implemented and tested with GPS flight data of GPS/MET (MicroLab-1) and MOMSNAV (MIR). It is demonstrated that the proposed method provides an accuracy compatible with that of the analytical model and is robust enough to handle large data gaps in case of limited on-board resources for GPS operations. By adjusting the ballistic coefficient along with the mean elements, a considerable improvement of mid-term orbit predictions is achieved over methods that are restricted to the estimation of the state vector alone.

AB Vehicular cloud networking (VCN) is a new study area that combines vehicular cloud computing (VCC) and information-centric networking. By utilizing VCC technologies, it is effectively use in road security and traffic control. The benefits of VCC in VCN are superior, including faster turnover times, scalability, flexibility, cost savings, greater collaborations, advanced security, the prevention of data loss, data security, minimal maintenance, limitless storage capacity, traffic information aggregation, etc. VCN is an intelligent networking system that manages autonomous traffic, system security, privacy, and vehicle control capabilities. During communication, various adversary types have the potential to compromise the security and privacy of these networks. To preserve their security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity, such systems require an authentication framework. The paper presents an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and biometrics-based secure authenticated framework for VCN. The suggested protocol accomplishes all security, privacy, and other criteria for secure communications against active and passive attackers. It is also demonstrated, both formally and informally, that the proposed framework is secure, correct and efficient. The study further establishes, using the simulation tool AVISPA, that the proposed protocol is secure against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. Additionally, the study uses BAN logic to demonstrate how the mutual authentication property is proven. In VCN, the proposed protocol efficacy is evaluated and compared to other similar protocols within the study. The results show that the proposed framework is secure and efficient in terms of computation and communication overheads. Consequently, the proposed protocol will be advantageous for VCN.

AB Power line inspection is one important task performed by electricity distribution network operators worldwide. It is part of the equipment maintenance for such companies and forms a crucial procedure since it can provide diagnostics and prognostics about the condition of the power line network. Furthermore, it helps with effective decision making in the case of fault detection. Nowadays, the inspection of power lines is performed either using human operators that scan the network on foot and search for obvious faults, or using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and/or helicopters equipped with camera sensors capable of recording videos of the power line network equipment, which are then inspected by human operators offline. In this study, we propose an autonomous, intelligent inspection system for power lines, which is equipped with camera sensors operating in the visual (Red-Green-Blue (RGB) imaging) and infrared (thermal imaging) spectrums, capable of providing real-time alerts about the condition of power lines. The very first step in power line monitoring is identifying and segmenting them from the background, which constitutes the principal goal of the presented study. The identification of power lines is accomplished through an innovative hybrid approach that combines RGB and thermal data-processing methods under a custom-made drone platform, providing an automated tool for in situ analyses not only in offline mode. In this direction, the human operator role is limited to the flight-planning and control operations of the UAV. The benefits of using such an intelligent UAV system are many, mostly related to the timely and accurate detection of possible faults, along with the side benefits of personnel safety and reduced operational costs.

AB Automated driving technology relies heavily on continuous, high-precision, and high-reliability positioning in complex urban situations. With the mass production of autonomous vehicles, the issue of keeping equipment as cheap as possible while maintaining precision is getting much attention. The low-cost global navigation satellite system (GNSS)/micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) integrated navigation system, as the mainstream solution, is often faced with MEMS dead-reckoning rapid divergence during GNSS outages. Meanwhile, the high-definition maps (HD maps), as the positioning resource which stores the absolute coordinate information, cover urban roads more and more perfectly. In this case, we propose a method to enhance low-cost GNSS/MEMS integrated positioning by using a monocular camera and straight lane lines in HD maps. The positioning results are corrected by projecting lanes from OpenDRIVE maps onto the image, matching them with the visually detected ones, and minimizing the reprojected linear coefficients residuals. The algorithm can be embedded into GNSS/MEMS integrated navigation system as a module without breaking the architecture and increasing the cost. The feasibility and influencing factors were analyzed in simulation and field experiments. The tests demonstrate that positions in the lateral and up directions can be corrected to within 10 cm under current HD maps accuracy. Moreover, it is not seriously limited by the initial pose error, the number of lanes, and the road flatness. The results indicate that the lane coefficients-based algorithm is a potential module for enhancing the low-cost GNSS/MEMS integrated positioning performance.

AB Consumer electronics hardware is designed and manufactured following a global supply chain which opens doors to their security challenges. Even with the advanced methods of formal verification and coverage analysis, there is still a chance of hiding malicious hardware/software which can degrade performance, leak data, or even stop functionalities. In this work, we present security solution of Network on Chip (NoC) based Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) consumer electronics (CE) systems such as set-top boxes and autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing methods targeted for such systems focus on protection in Network Interfaces (NI) and other software solutions rather than routers against Hardware Trojans (HT) which can be embedded in NoC by a rogue designer. In this work, we propose a 3-tier methodology leading to "Fortified-NoC" to secure the data and resources against different kinds of threats. A Trojan cognizant routing algorithm (TCRA) is proposed which limits the HTs to a particular router that contains them. Data shuffling with Trojan detectability is also used to mislead and identify the HTs. We validated the proposed approach using various experiments. Our proposed method is capable of mitigating the Trojan attacks such as data leakage, performance degradation, denial of service and live locking of data packets at the cost of a little latency and, some extra hardware. It is able to recover more than 80% of lost packets, improve the throughput by 1.3x against performance degrading Trojan attacks.

AB Hybrid systems are complex systems where a software controller interacts with a physical environment, usually named a plant, through sensors and actuators. The specification and design of such systems usually rely on the description of both continuous and discrete behaviours. From complex embedded systems to autonomous vehicles, these systems became quite common, including in safety critical domains. However, their formal verification and validation as a whole is still a challenge.
   To address this challenge, this article contributes to the definition of a reusable and tool supported formal framework handling the design and verification of hybrid system models that integrate both discrete (the controller part) and continuous (the plant part) behaviours. This framework includes the development of a process for defining a class of basic theories and developing domain theories and then the use of these theories to develop a generic model and system-specific models. To realise this framework, we present a formal proof tool chain, based on the Event-B correct-by-construction method and its integrated development environment Rodin, to develop a set of theories, a generic model, proof processes, and the required properties for designing hybrid systems in Event-B.
   Our approach relies on hybrid automata as basic models for such systems. Discrete and continuous variables model system states and behaviours are given using discrete state changes and continuous evolution following a differential equation. The proposed approach is based on refinement and proof using the Event-B method and the Rodin toolset. Two case studies borrowed from the literature are used to illustrate our approach. An assessment of the proposed approach is provided for evaluating its extensibility, effectiveness, scalability, and usability.

AB Background: While advanced driver assistance technologies have the potential to increase safety, there is concern that driver inattention resulting from overreliance on these features may result in crashes. Driver monitoring technologies to assess a driver's state may be one solution. The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend the research on physiological responses to common driving hazards and examine how these may differ based on driving experience.
   Methods: Learner and Licensed drivers viewed a Driving Hazard Perception Task while electrodermal activity (EDA) was measured. The task presented 30 Event (hazard develops) and 30 Non-Event (routine driving) videos. A skin conductance response (SCR) score was calculated for each participant based on the percentage of videos that elicited an SCR.
   Results: Analysis of the SCR score during Event videos revealed a medium effect (d = 0.61) of group differences, whereby Licensed drivers were more likely to have an SCR than Learner drivers. Interaction effects revealed Licensed drivers were more likely to have an SCR earlier in the Event videos compared to the end, and the Learner drivers were more likely to have an SCR earlier in the Non-Event videos compared to the end.
   Conclusion: Our results support the viability of using SCR during driving videos as a marker of hazard anticipation differing based on experience. The interaction effects may illustrate situational awareness in licensed drivers and deficiencies in sustained vigilance among learner drivers. The findings demand further examination if physiological measures are to be validated as a tool to inform driver potential performance in an increasingly automated driving environment.

ID RECURRENCE QUANTIFICATION ANALYSIS
AB As the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) industry is rapidly advancing, the classification of non-motorized (vulnerable) road users (VRUs) becomes essential to ensure their safety and to smooth operation of road applications. The typical practice of non-motorized road users' classification usually takes significant training time and ignores the temporal evolution and behavior of the signal. In this research effort, we attempt to detect VRUs with high accuracy be proposing a novel framework that includes using Deep Transfer Learning, which saves training time and cost, to classify images constructed from Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) that reflect the temporal dynamics and behavior of the signal. Recurrence Plots (RPs) were constructed from low-power smartphone sensors without using GPS data. The resulted RPs were used as inputs for different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers including constructing 227 x 227 images to be used for AlexNet and SqueezeNet; and constructing 224 x 224 images to be used for VGG16 and VGG19. Results show that the classification accuracy of Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning (CNN-TL) reaches 98.70%, 98.62%, 98.71%, and 98.71% for AlexNet, SqueezeNet, VGG16, and VGG19, respectively. Moreover, we trained resnet101 and shufflenet for a very short time using one epoch of data and then used them as weak learners, which yielded 98.49% classification accuracy. The results of the proposed framework outperform other results in the literature (to the best of our knowledge) and show that using CNN-TL is promising for VRUs classification. Because of its relative straightforwardness, ability to be generalized and transferred, and potential high accuracy, we anticipate that this framework might be able to solve various problems related to signal classification.

AB The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption, network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB High-latitude reefs support unique ecological communities occurring at the biogeographic boundaries between tropical and temperate marine ecosystems. Due to their lower ambient temperatures, they are regarded as potential refugia for tropical species shifting poleward due to rising sea temperatures. However, acute warming events can cause rapid shifts in the composition of high-latitude reef communities, including range contractions of temperate macroalgae and bleaching-induced mortality in corals. While bleaching has been reported on numerous high-latitude reefs, post-bleaching trajectories of benthic communities are poorly described. Consequently, the longer-term effects of thermal anomalies on high-latitude reefs are difficult to predict. Here, we use an autonomous underwater vehicle to conduct repeated surveys of three 625 m(2) plots on a coral-dominated high-latitude reef in the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, over a four-year period spanning a large-magnitude thermal anomaly. Quantification of benthic communities revealed high coral cover (>70%, comprising three main morphospecies) prior to the bleaching event. Plating Montipora was most susceptible to bleaching, but in the plot where it was most abundant, coral cover did not change significantly because of post-bleaching increases in branching Acropora. In the other two plots, coral cover decreased while macroalgal cover increased markedly. Overall, coral cover declined from 73% to 59% over the course of the study, while macroalgal cover increased from 11% to 24%. The significant differences in impacts and post-bleaching trajectories among plots underline the importance of understanding the underlying causes of such variation to improve predictions of how climate change will affect reefs, especially at high-latitudes.

AB In contemporary orbital missions, workloads are so high and varied that crew may rarely experience stretches of monotony. However, in historical long duration missions, occurrences of monotony were, indeed, reported anecdotally by crew. Of the effective countermeasures that appear to be at hand, many rely on visual or logistical proximity to the Earth, and are not feasible in the remote context of an extended deep space mission scenario. There, particularly in- and outbound cruising stages would be characterised by longer, comparably uneventful periods of low workload, coupled with confinement and unchanging vehicle surroundings.
   While the challenge of monotony has been pointed out as an exploration-related research area, it has received less explicit attention from a habitation design perspective than other human behaviour and performance issues. The paper addresses this gap through a literature review of the theory and application of design-based mitigation strategies. It outlines models of emergence of monotony, situates the phenomenon in a remote mission context as a problem of sensory, social and spatio-temporal isolation, and discusses proposed countermeasures related to habitability. The scope of the literature is extended to primary sources in the form of a qualitative review of six onboard diaries from orbital and simulator missions, highlighting a range of habitat-related design themes. These are translated into the autonomous deep space setting with the overall rationale of integrating affordances into onboard habitation systems and placing emphasis on reinforcing positive situational characteristics.

AB Background: Myocardial fibrosis is a key process in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, their underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated, leading to a lack of therapy. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) enhancer, sitagliptin, reduces hyperglycemia but may also trigger direct effects on the heart.
   Methods: Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats developed type-II diabetes and received sitagliptin, an anti-hyperglycemic drug (metformin) or vehicle (n=10, each). After cardiac structure and function assessment, plasma and left ventricles were isolated for biochemical studies. Cultured cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts were used for in vitro assays.
   Results: Untreated GK rats exhibited hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, plasma GLP-1 decrease, and cardiac cell-death, hypertrophy, fibrosis and prolonged deceleration time. Moreover, cardiac pro-apoptotic/necrotic, hypertrophic and fibrotic factors were up-regulated. Importantly, both sitagliptin and metformin lessened all these parameters. In cultured cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, high-concentration of palmitate or glucose induced cell-death, hypertrophy and fibrosis. Interestingly, GLP-1 and its insulinotropic-inactive metabolite, GLP-1(9-36), alleviated these responses. In addition, despite a specific GLP-1 receptor was only detected in cardiomyocytes, GLP-1 isoforms attenuated the pro-fibrotic expression in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. In addition, GLP-1 receptor signalling may be linked to PPAR delta activation, and metformin may also exhibit anti-apoptotic/necrotic and anti-fibrotic direct effects in cardiac cells.
   Conclusions: Sitagliptin, via GLP-1 stabilization, promoted cardioprotection in type-II diabetic hearts primarily by limiting hyperglycemia e hyperlipidemia. However, GLP-1 and GLP-1(9-36) promoted survival and anti-hypertrophic/fibrotic effects on cultured cardiac cells, suggesting cell-autonomous cardioprotective actions.

AB In recent years, interest in the use of mobile robots in the agricultural industry has increased, both to address labor shortages in rural areas and to increase food production in a more sustainable way. In order to have an efficient navigation system to cover long crop row fields, a path planner algorithm must consider maneuvering restrictions of the targeted robot. Most state-of-the-art works in agricultural navigation systems are intended for robots with a high degree of maneuverability that can typically make in-place turnings. This work aims to fill the gap in terms of the development of an efficient navigation system for car-like robots with limited turning radius in crop row fields. For this, we combine the global path planner A* and the local trajectory planner Timed Elastic Band (TEB). Additionally, we state the problem of finding an optimal path that covers the entire field as a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) that is based on the different turning maneuvers the robot can perform at field headlands. The solution of the TSP results in a time efficient coverage strategy that aligns with the robot's kinematics. Experiments performed in the Gazebo simulation environment show a reduction in field completion times of up to 20%, compared to trivial coverage paths. On the other hand, deviation of the robot with respect to the center of the field furrows was in all cases less than 10cm, which proves that the entire system operates with sufficient accuracy to avoid damaging the crops.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; ARCHITECTURE
AB In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, telepresence robots (TRs) are increasingly a part of healthcare, academia, and industry due to their enormous benefits. IoT provides a sensor-based environment in which robots receive more precise information about their surroundings. The researchers work day and night to reduce cost, duration, and complexity in all application areas. It provides tremendous benefits, such as sustainability, welfare improvement, cost-effectiveness, user-friendliness, and adaptability. However, it faces many challenges in making critical decisions during motion, which requires a long training period and intelligent motion planning. These include obstacle avoidance during movement, intelligent control in hazardous situations, and ensuring the right measurements. Following up on these issues requires a sophisticated control design and a secure communication link. This paper proposes a control design to normalize the integration process and offer an auto-MERLIN robot with cognitive and sustainable architecture. A control design is proposed through system identification and modeling of the robot. The robot control design was evaluated, and a prototype was prepared for testing in a hazardous environment. The robot was tested by considering various parameters: driving straight ahead, turning right, self-localizing, and receiving commands from a remote location. The maneuverability, controllability, and stability results show that the proposed design is well-developed and cost-efficient, with a fast response time. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly minimizes the obstacle collisions. The results confirm the employability and sustainability of the proposed design and demonstrate auto-MERLIN's capabilities as a sustainable robot ready to be deployed in highly interactive scenarios.

DE simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM); semantic; information

AB Multi-camera-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been widely applied in various mobile robots under uncertain or unknown environments to accomplish tasks autonomously. However, the conventional purely data-driven feature extraction methods cannot utilize the rich semantic information in the environment, which leads to the performance of the SLAM system being susceptible to various interferences. In this work, we present a semantic-aware multi-level information fusion scheme for robust global orientation estimation. Specifically, a visual semantic perception system based on the synthesized surround view image is proposed for the multi-eye surround vision system widely used in mobile robots, which is used to obtain the visual semantic information required for SLAM tasks. The original multi-eye image was first transformed to the synthesized surround view image, and the passable space was extracted with the help of the semantic segmentation network model as a mask for feature extraction; moreover, the hybrid edge information was extracted to effectively eliminate the distorted edges by further using the distortion characteristics of the reverse perspective projection process. Then, the hybrid semantic information was used for robust global orientation estimation; thus, better localization performance was obtained. The experiments on an intelligent vehicle, which was used for automated valet parking both in indoor and outdoor scenes, showed that the proposed hybrid multi-level information fusion method achieved at least a 10-percent improvement in comparison with other edge segmentation methods, the average orientation estimation error being between 1 and 2 degrees, much smaller than other methods, and the trajectory drift value of the proposed method was much smaller than that of other methods.

TI A Deployable and Cost-Effective Kirigami Antenna for Sub-6 GHz MIMO

DE MIMO; Kirigami antenna; sub-6 GHz; polarization diversity
AB In this work, a low-cost, deployable, integratable, and easy-to-fabricate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Kirigami antenna is proposed for sub-6 GHz applications. The proposed MIMO antenna is inspired by Kirigami art, which consists of four radiating and parasitic elements. The radiating and parasitic elements are composed of a rectangular stub. These elements are placed in such a way that they can provide polarization diversity. The proposed MIMO antenna is designed and fabricated using a soft printed board material called flexible copper-clad laminate (FCCL). It is observed from the results that the proposed MIMO antenna resonates in the 2.5 GHz frequency band, with a 10 dB reflection coefficient bandwidth of 860 MHz ranging from 2.19 to 3.05 GHz. It is worthwhile to mention that the isolation between adjacent radiating elements is higher than 15 dB. In addition, the peak realized gain of the MIMO antenna is around 11 dBi, and the total efficiency is more than 90% within the band of interest. Moreover, the envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) is noted to be less than 0.003, and the channel capacity is >= 17 bps/Hz. To verify the simulated results, a prototype was fabricated, and excellent agreement between the measured and computed results was observed. By observing the performance attributes of the proposed design, it can be said that there are many applications in which this antenna can be adopted. Because of its low profile, it can be used in 5G small-cell mobile MIMO base stations, autonomous light mobility vehicles, and other applications.

AB Knowledge of the spatial variation of deep-sea fish assemblages is a critical gap in understanding seamount ecology. Pioneer Bank in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (Hawaii, USA) has a history of hook-and-line fishing but not trawling; thus, it is a good location to further describe deep-sea fish assemblages. From replicated autonomous underwater vehicle transects at 300, 450, and 600 m on 3 sides of Pioneer Bank, we observed 4190 fish representing 81 species. Fish assemblages were dominated by Gadiformes, Perciformes, and Stomiiformes. The relative abundance of fish was significantly different among sides of the seamount and the interaction of side and depth, with the NW side having the highest relative abundance at 450 m. Species richness, rarefaction estimates of expected species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson dominance showed significant differences by side, but not by depth. These differences were between the S and NW sides, with the S side having the lowest diversity and high dominance. The structure of the fish assemblage was significantly different among both sides and depths, with depth as the most important factor. Fish assemblage structure was most strongly correlated with salinity, % rugosity, chlorophyll a, and mean direction of substrate. These scales of spatial variability both with depth and across short horizontal distances on a single seamount are similar to those found on nearby Necker Island, which reaffirms the spatial heterogeneity in deepsea fish assemblages on seamounts. This study provides an ecological baseline for the management and conservation of seamounts.

AB The maneuverability of standard quadrotors with coplanar propellers is limited by their inherent underactuation. To overcome this challenge, in-flight, active propeller tilting has been widely investigated in the literature. However, biaxial propeller tilting that renders extensive thrust vectoring has not been explored much owing to the ensuing mechanical complexities. Therefore, this article presents an innovative design capable of achieving independent biaxial tilting of 100 degrees and 180 degrees about two perpendicular axes while keeping the mechanical complexity relatively low. The developed quadrotor, aptly named QuadPlus, efficiently combines actuator redundancy and propeller rotation in a compact package, compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts. The hyperdynamic QuadPlus with a total of 12 degrees of freedom can control its attitude independent of the position, thus enabling effective maneuvering through narrow spaces. Moreover, a novel cascade approach comprising of a high-level nonlinear model-predictive control algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal actuator configuration for an underdetermined system while dealing with the physical constraints. In addition, proportional-integral-derivative controllers are employed at low level to track attitude references generated by the navigation algorithm. Finally, with the help of realistic Gazebo simulations, the efficacy of the system is demonstrated by tracking complex 3-D trajectories, which replicate the motion in a constrained environment. Overall, the obtained results manifest QuadPlus's capability of achieving independent position and attitude control even with multiple actuator saturation. The authors envision that the proposed simplistic design would stimulate interest in the community for exploring the benefits offered by biaxial propeller tilting platforms.

AB Several works have focused on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which is a topic that has been studied for more than a decade to meet the needs of robots to navigate in an unknown environment. SLAM is an essential perception functionality in several applications, especially in robotics and autonomous vehicles. RGB-D cameras are among the sensors commonly used with recent SLAM algorithms. They provide an RGB image and the associated depth map, making it possible to solve scale drift with less complexity and create a dense 3D environment representation. Many RGB-D SLAM algorithms have been studied and evaluated on publicly available datasets without considering sensor specifications or image acquisition modes that could improve or decrease localization accuracy. In this work, we deal with indoor localization, taking into account the sensor specifications. In this context, our contribution is a deep experimental study to highlight the impact of the sensor acquisition modes on the localization accuracy, and a parametric optimization protocol for a precise localization in a given environment. Furthermore, we apply the proposed protocol to optimize a depth-related parameter of the SLAM algorithm. The study is based on a publicly available dataset in an indoor environment with a depth sensor. The reconstruction results' analysis is founded on the study of different metrics involving translational and rotational errors. These metrics errors are compared with those obtained with a state-of-the-art stereo vision-based SLAM algorithm.

AB Achieving reliable intervehicle positioning is one of the most fundamental elements for many vehicular applications, including collision avoidance and autonomous driving. Vehicle position is generally provided by a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), which unfortunately suffers from inaccuracy to varying degrees in challenging environments, for example, GNSS outages. In this article, a reliable fusion technique, called non-Gaussian Redheffer weighted least squares (nGRWLSs), is proposed. This new approach highlights the intervehicle positioning estimation in multi-GNSS outage environments, such as complete, partial, and free GNSS pseudorange outages. The proposed method combines, on the one hand, the benefits of the Gaussian dynamical matrix principle and the Redheffer distribution function for the sparse property in complete GNSS pseudorange outages and, on the other hand, the use of the optimal window size to regulate the data flow generated by both the inertial navigation systems (INSs) and GNSS during a partial GNSS pseudorange outage. During the free GNSS pseudorange outage, the process ignores data from the INS, and instead, GNSS pseudorange information alone will be considered to compute the intervehicle positioning information. Consequently, weighted least squares is used as an intervehicle positioning estimator. To address the pseudorange uncommon and INS measurement noises, the generalized error distribution (GED) is used to estimate the non-Gaussian densities. Finally, road-test experiments are implemented to evaluate the consistency of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the proposed nGRWLS can accurately estimate the intervehicle positioning under various conditions (free, partial, and complete GNSS pseudorange outages).

AB The advantage of using the Network Address Translation device is that the internal IP address, which makes the IP address space of Internet of Things (IoT) devices expanded, is invisible from the outside and safe from external attacks. However, the use of these private IPv4 addresses poses traversal problems, especially for the mobile IoTs to operate peer-to-peer applications. An alternative solution is to use IPv6 technologies for future IoT devices. However, IPv6 package, including IPSec, is too complex to apply to the IoT device because it is a technology developed for the user terminal with enough computing power. This paper proposes a gatekeeper to enable the real IP addresses of IoTs inside the same subnetwork to be not explicitly addressable and visible from outside of the gatekeeper. Each IoT device publishes its virtual IP address via the Registrar Server or Domain Name System (DNS) with which the gatekeeper shares the address mapping information. While the gatekeeper maintains the mapping information for the local IoT devices, the registration server or DNS has global address mapping information so that any peer can reach the mapping information. All incoming and outgoing packets must pass through the gatekeeper responsible for the address conversion and security checks for them from the entrance. This paper aims to apply our gatekeeper system to a platform of self-driving cars that allows surrounding IoT cameras and autonomous vehicles to communicate with each other securely, safely, and rapidly. So, this paper finally analyzes improvement effects on latency to show that our gatekeeper system guarantees the latency goal of 20 ms under the environment of 5G links.

AB Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, specifically supervised learning, are widely used in modern real-world applications, which utilize Computational Intelligence (CI) as their core technology, such as autonomous vehicles, assistive robots, and biometric systems. Attacks that cause misclassifications or mispredictions can lead to erroneous decisions resulting in unreliable operations. Designing robust ML with the ability to provide reliable results in the presence of such attacks has become a top priority in the field of adversarial machine learning. An essential characteristic for rapid development of robust ML is an arms race between attack and defense strategists. However, an important prerequisite for the arms race is access to a well-defined system model so that experiments can be repeated by independent researchers. This article proposes a fine-grained system-driven taxonomy to specify ML applications and adversarial system models in an unambiguous manner such that independent researchers can replicate experiments and escalate the arms race to develop more evolved and robust ML applications. The article provides taxonomies for: 1) the dataset, 2) the ML architecture, 3) the adversary's knowledge, capability, and goal, 4) adversary's strategy, and 5) the defense response. In addition, the relationships among these models and taxonomies are analyzed by proposing an adversarial machine learning cycle. The provided models and taxonomies are merged to form a comprehensive system-driven taxonomy, which represents the arms race between the ML applications and adversaries in recent years. The taxonomies encode best practices in the field and help evaluate and compare the contributions of research works and reveals gaps in the field.

AB Featured Application This work describes the design of an intelligent tool for hydrophobicity classification of polymeric insulators used in electrical transmission lines. It eliminates the manual inspection of insulators, which involves a significant amount of labor work load. This automated tool can be integrated to an unmanned aerial vehicle to provide autonomous inspection of insulators.
   Abstract Hydrophobicity of polymeric insulator plays a vital role in determining the insulation quality in outdoor overhead electrical transmission and distribution lines. Loss of hydrophobicity increases the leakage current and leads to flashover. Monitoring hydrophobicity becomes a fundamental requirement to ensure continuity of power line operations. Hydrophobicity of polymeric insulator is classified according to STRI (Swedish Transmission Research Institute) guidelines. This paper proposes an intelligent ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) based classifier to determine the hydrophobicity quality using the digital image of the insulator. Ten statistical features are extracted from the digital images. Two stages of feature reduction are employed to reduce the number of features. Pre-design stage uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and reduces the number of features to six from ten and the post-design stage analyzes the accumulation effect to reduce the number of features to four. Various ANFIS classifiers are trained using these reduced features extracted from the image. The performance of these ANFIS classifiers is evaluated in both field and laboratory specimens. Results indicate classification accuracy of 96.4% and 93.3% during the training and testing phase when triangular membership function with linear output function is employed in ANFIS. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) has also been designed to facilitate the use of the proposed system by field operators.

AB Provably correct and computationally efficient path planning in the presence of various constraints is essential for autonomous driving and agile maneuvering of mobile robots. In this paper, we consider the planning of G(3)-continuous planar paths with continuous and limited curvature in a motion environment that is bounded and contains obstacles modeled by a set of (non-convex) polygons. In practice, the curvature constraints often arise from mechanical limitations for the robot, such as limited steering and articulation angles in wheeled robots, or aerodynamic constraints in unmanned aerial vehicles. To solve the planning problem under those stringent constraints, we improve upon known path primitives, such as Reeds-Shepp (RS) and CC-steer (curvature-continuous) paths. Given the initial and final robot configuration, we developed extend-procedure computing paths that can approximate RS paths with arbitrary precision, but guaranteeing G(3)-continuity. We show that satisfaction of all stated path constraints is guaranteed and, contrary to many other methods known from the literature, the method of checking for collisions between the planned path and obstacles is given by a closed-form analytic expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is not conservative, i.e., it allows for precise maneuvers in tight environments under the assumption of a rectangular robot footprint. The presented extend procedure can be integrated into various motion-planning algorithms available in the literature. In particular, we utilized the Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT*) algorithm in conjunction with our extend procedure to demonstrate its feasibility in motion environments of nontrivial complexity and low computational cost in comparison to a G(3)-continuous extend procedure based on eta(3)-splines.

AB Objective: Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of different non-driving related tasks (NDR tasks) on takeover performance in highly automated driving.
   Background: During highly automated driving, it is allowed to engage in NDR tasks temporarily. However, drivers must be able to take over control when reaching a system limit. There is evidence that the type of NDR task has an impact on takeover performance, but little is known about the specific task characteristics that account for performance decrements.
   Method: Thirty participants drove in a simulator using a highly automated driving system. Each participant faced five critical takeover situations. Based on assumptions of Wickens's multiple resource theory, stimulus and response modalities of a prototypical NDR task were systematically manipulated. Additionally, in one experimental group, the task was locked out simultaneously with the takeover request.
   Results: Task modalities had significant effects on several measures of takeover performance. A visual-manual texting task degraded performance the most, particularly when performed handheld. In contrast, takeover performance with an auditory-vocal task was comparable to a baseline without any task. Task lockout was associated with faster hands-on-wheel times but not altered brake response times.
   Conclusion: Results showed that NDR task modalities are relevant factors for takeover performance. An NDR task lockout was highly accepted by the drivers and showed moderate benefits for the first takeover reaction.
   Application: Knowledge about the impact of NDR task characteristics is an enabler for adaptive takeover concepts. In addition, it might help regulators to make decisions on allowed NDR tasks during automated driving.

AB It is well known that docking of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) provides scope to perform long duration deep-sea exploration. A large amount of literature is available on vision-based docking which exploit mechanical design, colored markers to estimate the pose of a docking station. In this work, we propose a method to estimate the relative pose of a circular-shaped docking station (arranged with LED lights on periphery) up to five degrees of freedom (5-DOF, neglecting roll effect). Generally, extraction of light markers from underwater images is based on fixed/adaptive choice of threshold, followed by mass moment-based computation of individual markers as well as center of the dock. Novelty of our work is the proposed highly effective scene invariant histogram-based adaptive thresholding scheme (HATS) which reliably extracts positions of light sources seen in active marker images. As the perspective projection of a circle features a family of ellipses, we then fit an appropriate ellipse for the markers and subsequently use the ellipse parameters to estimate the pose of a circular docking station with the help of a well-known method in Safaee-Rad et al. (IEEE Trans Robot Autom 8(5): 624-640, 1992). We analyze the effectiveness of HATS as well as proposed approach through simulations and experimentation. We also compare performance of targeted curvature-based pose estimation with a non-iterative efficient perspective-n-point (EPnP) method. The paper ends with a few interesting remarks on vantages with ellipse fitting for markers and utility of proposed method in case of non-detection of all the light markers.

AB The vastness of the ocean offers great challenges for various underwater exploratory and communication related applications using multiple robotic platforms such as remotely operated vehicle (ROV), underwater glider, vertical profiler and autonomous surface vessel (ASV). Small in size, higher sensitivities and lower power consumptions of micro-ultrasonic devices make it a perfect match for those robotic platforms. This paper proposed two micro-ultrasonic transducer (MUT) designs for underwater applications. Two sensing mechanisms were utilized namely, piezoelectric (pMUT) and capacitive (cMUT). The objective is not meant for comparison, but it is rather a work carried to investigate on the option available to cater different underwater applications. Responses of those micro-devices were identified using finite element method (FEM). Three different materials were suggested for each design; which was ZnO, PZT and quartz for pMUT and S(i)3N(4), Teflon and PDMS for cMUT. Analyses conducted including mechanical, piezoelectric and frequency. PZT were found to be the most responsive material for pMUT with voltage response at 1.3 x 10(-3) mu m/V and 2750.2 pC/V of charge response but carried the lowest resonant frequency at 85.9 kHz. For cMUT design, PDMS had the highest detection sensitivity, which is equal to 1.6 mu m/Pa. This occurred at the resonance of 515.9 kHz. However, in terms of static deflection analysis, PDMS showed the weakest performance. This suggests the need for delicate design considerations and tradeoffs. Final specification of both designs was summarized at the end of the report as a guideline to underwater robotic engineers in determining the best applications within the specified performance.

AB The latest development of multi-robot collaborative systems has put forward higher requirements for multi-sensor fusion localization. Current position methods mainly focus on the fusion of the carrier's own sensor information, and how to fully utilize the information of multiple robots to achieve high-precision positioning is a major challenge. However, due to the comprehensive impact of factors such as poor performance, variety, complex calculations, and accumulation of environmental errors used by commercial robots, the difficulty of high-precision collaborative positioning is further exacerbated. To address this challenge, we propose a low-cost and robust multi-sensor data fusion scheme for heterogeneous multi-robot collaborative navigation in indoor environments, which integrates data from inertial measurement units (IMUs), laser rangefinders, cameras, and so on, into heterogeneous multi-robot navigation. Based on Discrete Kalman Filter (DKF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) principles, a three-step joint filtering model is used to improve the state estimation and the visual data are processed using the YOLO deep learning target detection algorithm before updating the integrated filter. The proposed integration is tested at multiple levels in an open indoor environment following various formation paths. The results show that the three-dimensional root mean square error (RMSE) of indoor cooperative localization is 11.3 mm, the maximum error is less than 21.4 mm, and the motion error in occluded environments is suppressed. The proposed fusion scheme is able to satisfy the localization accuracy requirements for efficient and coordinated motion of autonomous mobile robots.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles have been extensively developed in the past decades and deployed for various ocean research activities. While the leaping-out motions of underwater creatures have motivated the development of underwater robots with the motion ability to jump out of water, the dynamics of such jumping robots have not been fully described. In this study, we developed a leaping fishbot, a flying fish-inspired underwater soft robot that can leap out of the water and further sail on the surface using the combustion and propulsion hybrid actuation. Specifically, the fishbot uses the transient driving method, in which a premixed oxygen-propane gas generates an instant pushing impulse to launch the robot out of the water at a transiently high speed while the attached jetting propellers provide a sustained thrust as it swims on the water surface at a stable velocity. A series of flume experiments and solid-fluid hybrid computational fluid dynamics numerical simulations were conducted to study the kinematic performance of the robot. Experimental results established a quantitative relationship between the kinematic performance, gas amount, and launch angle. The numerical results accurately predicted the water-air multiphase jumping motions, the numerical result of kinematic was significantly agreeing with the experimental results, the error in the horizontal direction is less than 15%, and that in the vertical direction is less than 10%. We further analyzed the flow field generated by the leaping fishbot to gain a better understanding of the velocity and vortex distribution around it. Our research findings provide valuable insights into bionic application of underwater robots in the future.

AB Utilization of marine photovoltaic energy is primarily focused on surface harvesting with limited photovoltaic cell implementations in submarine environments. Potential applications include marine wildlife telemetry devices, autonomous underwater vehicles, or remote sensing assets. In these applications, understanding the power at depth is critical, but there has yet to be a long-term study of cell performance in a realistic marine environment that spans time, geographic location, and depth. In this paper, we present photovoltaic assessments carried out by devices mounted to adult female northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) during their spring migrations in the Pacific Ocean with deployment times between 76 and 107 days. Encompassing a large geographic area between Santa Cruz, California, and the Aleutian Islands of Alaska during their migrations, elephant seal behavior allows for repeated depth profiles each day, making them an ideal host for subsurface power assessments. This paper presents the first longitudinal study of photovoltaic cell performance in the marine environment that spans location, time, and depth. This work discusses the calibration, data time alignment, and power calculations of these oceanic deployments. Deployment results, including power results and energy predictions from the data record, are presented up to 22 m in depth. We highlight how the recorded power data of these cells compares to previously published results and how depth impacts subsurface power and energy harvesting.
   Custom photovoltaic assessment modules (CPAMs) were designed to measure photovoltaic performance via current-voltage measurements at depth. They were attached to adult female northern elephant seals prior to migrations in the Pacific Ocean. The results of this deployment, including power and energy averages, are presented up to 22 meters in depth.image

AB Modern agriculture necessitates the use of techniques and tools that pollute the environment less and improve the safety of food and feed production. In the field of plant protection, drones are attracting increasing attention due to their versatility and applicability in a variety of environmental and working conditions. Drone crop spraying techniques offer several advantages, including increased safety and cost effectiveness through autonomous and programmed operations based on specific schedules and routes. One of the main advantages of using drones for plant protection is their ability to monitor large areas of crops in a short amount of time. In addition to crop protection management, using drones for augmentative biocontrol facilitates the distribution of beneficial organisms to the exact locations where they are required, which can increase the effectiveness of biocontrol agents while reducing distribution costs. In this context, given the very limited commercial use of drones in the Western Balkans' agri-food sector, the use of drones in the agri-food industry is a topic that needs to be elaborated on and highly promoted. Additionally, the specific legal regulations in Serbia that currently limit the use of drones in agriculture must be outlined. Conventional crop production is still significantly more prevalent in Serbia, but given the region's continuous technological progress, there is no doubt that farmers' education and future investments in precision agriculture will most likely increase the use of state-of-the-art technologies and drones in agriculture.

AB Given a degraded input image, image restoration aims to recover the missing high-quality image content. Numerous applications demand effective image restoration, e.g., computational photography, surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and remote sensing. Significant advances in image restoration have been made in recent years, dominated by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The widely-used CNN-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution or on progressively low-resolution representations. In the former case, spatial details are preserved but the contextual information cannot be precisely encoded. In the latter case, generated outputs are semantically reliable but spatially less accurate. This paper presents a new architecture with a holistic goal of maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through the entire network, and receiving complementary contextual information from the low-resolution representations. The core of our approach is a multi-scale residual block containing the following key elements: (a) parallel multi-resolution convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b) information exchange across the multi-resolution streams, (c) non-local attention mechanism for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention based multi-scale feature aggregation. Our approach learns an enriched set of features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while simultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details. Extensive experiments on six real image benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method, named as MIRNet-v2, achieves state-of-the-art results for a variety of image processing tasks, including defocus deblurring, image denoising, super-resolution, and image enhancement. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/swz30/MIRNetv2.

AB Human detection methods are widely used in various fields such as autonomous vehicles, video surveillance, and rescue systems. To provide a more effective detection system, different types of sensor data (i.e. optics, thermal, and depth data) may be used together as hybrid information. Fortifying object detection, based on optical data and additional sensor data, such as depth and thermal data, also represents information regarding the distance and temperature of classified objects that can be used for video surveillance, rescue systems, and various applications. In this study, a simple and effective method is introduced to fuse RGB-D and thermal sensor data to achieve a more accurate form of human detection. To accurately combine the sensors, they are physically fixed to each other, and the relationship between them is determined using a novel method. The feature points on the optical and thermal images are extracted and matched successfully using computer vision. The proposed method is completely brand-free, easy to implement, and can be used in real-time applications. Using both thermal and optical data, humans are classified as benefiting from a widely used object detection method. The performance of the presented method is tested with a newly generated dataset. The proposed method boosts human detection accuracy by 5% when compared to the use of only optical data and by 37% when compared to the use of thermal data with COCO Dataset upon YOLOv4 neural network weights. After training with the newly generated dataset, the detection accuracy increases by 18% compared with the best results of single sensor usage.

AB In the past thirty years, alcohol influence on drivers has been widely researched using driving simulators across the world. However, a critical evaluation of the existing evidence is required to project the current status and provide directions for future investigations. The present study conducts a comprehensive systematic review of the research examining the effects of alcohol on simulated driving performance. The literature search was conducted in academic databases such as Google Scholar, SCOPUS, Transportation Research Information Database (TRID), PubMed, and Web of science. In total, 1015 articles were identified from the initial database search along with 14 additional articles from other sources (Articles Plus, Cochrane Library, Medline, National Technical Information Services, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Medline Grey Literature Report), out of which 110 articles were included in the systematic review. The majority of the studies were conducted in the United States of America (45%), followed by Australia (15%). These studies were reviewed based on the following aspects: type of driving simulator, study design, Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) or alcohol dose used in the experiments, driving environment characteristics, driving performance measures, data analysis techniques, and additional factors affecting driver behaviour under the influence of alcohol. Overall, the evidence regarding driving performance under the influence of alcohol shows that the majority of the previous studies have found a significant impact of alcohol on the various aspects of driving behaviour. The systematic review highlighted the methodological limitations observed in the previous driving simulator studies which should be acknowledged in future research.

AB The submarine pipeline is an important way to transport marine resources such as oil and gas. For maintaining submarine pipelines, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with sonars are leveraged. Whether the complete submarine pipelines can be segmented from the complex and noisy background is the key to path planning and navigation, which determines the efficiency of AUVs. Existing methods for segmenting sonar images such as Markov random field (MRF) are insufficient to achieve this goal. Inspired by the similarities between submarine pipelines in sonar images and salient objects in natural images, we propose a novel method to extract pipelines which can be summarized as three steps. First, an effective denoising method via curvelet thresholding is proposed to suppress speckle noise. Second, we attempt to compute the probability whether a pixel belongs to submarine pipelines by global information containing four similarities. Two of them are shape similarity and angle similarity, which are proposed according to the characteristics of pipelines in sonar images. Third, we propose a coarse segmentation method based on bootstrapped support vector machines (SVMs) and a fusion strategy to generate binary segmentation results precisely and completely. We captured 15 sonar sequences via the AUV equipped with a forward-looking sonar at Qingdao National Deep-Sea Base and selected 262 sonar images from the sequences for evaluating the segmentation performance. The proposed method is compared with other advanced methods. The experimental results show that our method achieves a better performance than other methods, and demonstrate the feasibility of segmenting submarine pipelines inspired by saliency segmentation.

AB Accurate road marking extraction and classification play a significant role in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and high-definition (HD) maps. Due to point density and intensity variations from mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems, most of the existing thresholding-based extraction methods and rule-based classification methods cannot deliver high efficiency and remarkable robustness. To address this, we propose a capsule-based deep learning framework for road marking extraction and classification from massive and unordered MLS point clouds. This framework mainly contains three modules. Module I is first implemented to segment road surfaces from 3D MLS point clouds, followed by an inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation method for 2D georeferenced image generation. Then, in Module II, a U-shaped capsule-based network is constructed to extract road markings based on the convolutional and deconvolutional capsule operations. Finally, a hybrid capsule-based network is developed to classify different types of road markings by using a revised dynamic routing algorithm and large-margin Softmax loss function. A road marking dataset containing both 3D point clouds and manually labeled reference data is built from three types of road scenes, including urban roads, highways, and underground garages. The proposed networks were accordingly evaluated by estimating robustness and efficiency using this dataset. Quantitative evaluations indicate the proposed extraction method can deliver 94.11% in precision, 90.52% in recall, and 92.43% in F-1-score, respectively, while the classification network achieves an average of 3.42% misclassification rate in different road scenes.

AB Artificial Neural Networks have reached "grandmaster" and even "super-human" performance across a variety of games, from those involving perfect information, such as Go, to those involving imperfect information, such as "Starcraft". Such technological developments from artificial intelligence (AI) labs have ushered concomitant applications across the world of business, where an "AI" brand-tag is quickly becoming ubiquitous. A corollary of such widespread commercial deployment is that when AI gets things wrong-an autonomous vehicle crashes, a chatbot exhibits "racist" behavior, automated credit-scoring processes "discriminate" on gender, etc.-there are often significant financial, legal, and brand consequences, and the incident becomes major news. As Judea Pearl sees it, the underlying reason for such mistakes is that "... all the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just curve fitting." The key, as Pearl suggests, is to replace "reasoning by association" with "causal reasoning" -the ability to infer causes from observed phenomena. It is a point that was echoed by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis in a recent piece for the New York Times: "we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets-often using an approach known as 'Deep Learning'-and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space, and causality." In this paper, foregrounding what in 1949 Gilbert Ryle termed "a category mistake", I will offer an alternative explanation for AI errors; it is not so much that AI machinery cannot "grasp" causality, but that AI machinery (qua computation) cannot understand anything at all.

DE LiDAR-camera-based 3D detector; single stage; one backbone; point-wise

AB Currently, many kinds of LiDAR-camera-based 3D object detectors have been developed with two heavy neural networks to extract view-specific features, while a LiDAR-camera-based 3D detector with only one neural network has not been implemented. To tackle this issue, this paper first presents an early-fusion method to exploit both LiDAR and camera data for fast 3D object detection with only one backbone, achieving a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. We propose a novel point feature fusion module to directly extract point-wise features from raw RGB images and fuse them with their corresponding point cloud with no backbone. In this paradigm, the backbone that extracts RGB image features is abandoned to reduce the large computation cost. Our method first voxelizes a point cloud into a 3D voxel grid and utilizes two strategies to reduce information loss during voxelization. The first strategy is to use a small voxel size (0.05m, 0.05m, 0.1m) in X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis, respectively, while the second one is to project the feature (e.g. intensity or height information) of point clouds onto RGB images. Numerous experiments evaluated on the KITTI benchmark suite show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR-camera-based methods on the three classes in 3D performance (Easy, Moderate, Hard): cars (88.04%, 77.60%, 76.23%), pedestrians (66.65%, 60.49%, 54.51%), and cyclists (75.87%, 60.07%, 54.51%). Additionally, the proposed model runs at 17.8 frames per second (FPS), which is almost 2x faster than state-of-the-art fusion methods for LiDAR and camera.

AB Although modern machine learning has the potential to greatly speed up the interpretation of imagery, the varied nature of the seabed and limited availability of expert annotations form barriers to its widespread use in seafloor mapping applications. This motivates research into unsupervised methods that function without large databases of human annotations. This paper develops an unsupervised feature learning method for georeferenced seafloor visual imagery that considers patterns both within the footprint of a single image frame and broader scale spatial characteristics. Features within images are learnt using an autoencoder developed based on the AlexNet deep convolutional neural network. Features larger than each image frame are learnt using a novel loss function that regularises autoencoder training using the Kullback-Leibler divergence function to loosely assume that images captured within a close distance of each other look more similar than those that are far away. The method is used to semantically interpret images taken by an autonomous underwater vehicle at the Southern Hydrates Ridge, an active gas hydrate field and site of a seafloor cabled observatory at a depth of 780 m. The method's performance when applied to clustering and content-based image retrieval is assessed against a ground truth consisting of more than 18,000 human annotations. The study shows that the location based loss function increases the rate of information retrieval by a factor of two for seafloor mapping applications. The effects of physics-based colour correction and image rescaling are also investigated, showing that the improved consistency of spatial information achieved by rescaling is beneficial for recognising artificial objects such as cables and infrastructures, but is less effective for natural objects that have greater dimensional variability.

ID CHALLENGES
AB As online services and applications are moving towards a more human-centered design, many app vendors are taking the quality of experience (QoE) increasingly seriously. End-to-end latency is a key factor that determines the QoE experienced by users, especially for latency-sensitive applications such as online gaming, autonomous vehicles, critical warning systems and so on. Edge computing has then been introduced as an effort to reduce network latency. In a mobile edge computing system, edge servers are usually deployed at, or near cellular base stations, offering processing power and low network latency to users within their proximity. In this work, we tackle the edge user allocation (EUA) problem from the perspective of an app vendor, who needs to decide which edge servers to serve which users in a specific area. Also, the vendor must consider the various levels of quality of service (QoS) for its users. Each QoS level leads to a different QoE level. Thus, the app vendor also needs to decide the QoS level for each user so that the overall user experience is maximized. We first optimally solve this problem using Integer Linear Programming technique. Being an NP-hard problem, it is intractable to solve it optimally in large-scale scenarios. Thus, we propose a heuristic approach that is able to effectively and efficiently find sub-optimal solutions to the QoE-aware EUA problem. We conduct a series of experiments on a real-world dataset to evaluate the performance of our approach against several state-of-the-art and baseline approaches. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ID HISTOGRAMS
AB Identification of rigid-body objects from point clouds is a well-studied topic and one of the most important utilities of 3D computer vision in robotics, industrial automation, unmanned systems and autonomous vehicle applications. However, simultaneous retrieval of both identity and pose of objects is still an open problem because of the challenges attributed to the vast search space of all possible poses of an object. Further, the precision of pose retrieval is inherently hard to improve because the resolution of the pose database is limited. This paper presents a point cloud retrieval method that finds the object ID and pose, simultaneously. Unlike the traditional learning-based methods that retrieve the point cloud by matching high dimensional feature vectors, we solve the point cloud retrieval problem using an end-to-end point cloud convolution neural network (CNN) model that linearly projects the 3D point cloud onto a unique discriminating 2D view using an energy-based loss function. Based on the proposed mechanism of the projection network, the rigid-body pose is obtained using the reduced QR factorization. As a result, the object ID retrieval problem is simplified because the within-class differences caused by various poses of the object are removed. The projection results exhibit strong discriminating features based on shapes while the precision of pose retrieval is improved thanks to the generalization ability of the network model. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method yields considerably more robust and accurate object ID retrieval, and at the same time significantly improves the precision of pose retrieval compared to the descriptor-based methods as well as two commonly used learning-based methods.

AB Supercooled water is liquid water that is colder than its pressure- and salinity-dependent freezing temperature. As supercooling is a metastable state, it is sensitive to small environmental changes that may force switches between solid and liquid phases, including disruption from instruments introduced to the environment. Here we present a thoroughly-tested set of observational protocols that have been developed over 15 years working in supercooled Ice Shelf Water in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. We identify the four issues most commonly encountered in observations of supercooled ocean water as (i) the requirement for an extended process of thermal equilibration, (ii) contamination by ice within conductivity cells, (iii) anchor ice accumulation on suspended equipment, and (iv) ice coating and resultant sensing of artificially-produced latent heat. We present protocols for identifying and managing these potential modes of corruption, which include determining and allowing appropriate time for thermal equilibration, identifying and eliminating data that have been corrupted by ice capture and growth, and practical steps that can be taken to minimise accumulation of anchor ice on suspended equipment. We stress the need for planned data redundancy to enable identification and elimination of data contaminated by ice capture and phase change. We also include a complete procedure for CTD profiling which includes a 10-min soak (for an instrument initially warm relative to the ocean) and exercises data redundancy in the form of multiple up- and down-casts. Finally, we discuss how these protocols may be extended to other platforms since there is increasing scope for ice-related contamination of data as access to ice-covered oceans, and the use of autonomous vehicles in the polar oceans, increases.

AB The smart e-bike monitoring system (SEMS) is a platform for the real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes (also called pedelecs or e-bikes). It is autonomous (runs off the bike battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), so it can be used for further research and development. The system monitors location (global positioning system), rider control data (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for data analysis, for riders to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use and explores features for future design iterations. The SEMS turns singular e-bikes into a networked fleet and is an example of the internet of things in the cycling context.

ID MOBILE ROBOT LOCALIZATION
AB This paper describes an approach to solve the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem with a team of cooperative autonomous vehicles. We consider that each robot is equipped with a stereo camera and is able to observe visual landmarks in the environment. The SLAM approach presented here is feature-based, thus the map is represented by a set of 3D landmarks each one defined by a global position in space and a visual descriptor. The robots move independently along different trajectories and make relative measurements to landmarks in the environment in order to jointly build a common map using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. We show results obtained in a simulated environment that validate the SLAM approach. The process of observing a visual landmark is simulated in the following way: first, the relative measurement obtained by the robot is corrupted with Gaussian noise, using a noise model for a standard stereo camera. Second, the visual description of the landmark is altered by noise, simulating the changes in the descriptor which may occur when the robot observes the same landmark under different scales and viewpoints. In addition, the noise in the odometry of the robots also takes values obtained from real robots. We propose an approach to manage data associations in the context of visual features. Different experiments have been performed, with variations in the path followed by the robots and the parameters in the particle filter. Finally, the results obtained in simulation demonstrate that the approach is suitable for small robot teams. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flight control in insects depends on self-induced image motion (optic flow), which the visual system must process to generate appropriate corrective steering maneuvers. Classic experiments in tethered insects applied rigorous system identification techniques for the analysis of turning reactions in the presence of rotating pattern stimuli delivered in open-loop. However, the functional relevance of these measurements for visual free-flight control remains equivocal due to the largely unknown effects of the highly constrained experimental conditions. To perform a systems analysis of the visual flight speed response under free-flight conditions, we implemented a 'one-parameter open-loop' paradigm using 'TrackFly' in a wind tunnel equipped with real-time tracking and virtual reality display technology. Upwind flying flies were stimulated with sine gratings of varying temporal and spatial frequencies, and the resulting speed responses were measured from the resulting flight speed reactions. To control flight speed, the visual system of the fruit fly extracts linear pattern velocity robustly over a broad range of spatio-temporal frequencies. The speed signal is used for a proportional control of flight speed within locomotor limits. The extraction of pattern velocity over a broad spatio-temporal frequency range may require more sophisticated motion processing mechanisms than those identified in flies so far. In Drosophila, the neuromotor pathways underlying flight speed control may be suitably explored by applying advanced genetic techniques, for which our data can serve as a baseline. Finally, the high-level control principles identified in the fly can be meaningfully transferred into a robotic context, such as for the robust and efficient control of autonomous flying micro air vehicles.

AB Objectives: To describe a prehospital thrombolysis (PHT) and expedited inhospital thrombolysis (IHT) programme in south-east Scotland using prehospital 12-lead ECG recordings transmitted by telemetry and autonomous paramedic-administered thrombolysis with decision support being provided by coronary care nurses.
   Design: Retrospective observational study.
   Setting: Three hospitals in south-east Scotland covering a population of 778 468 served by 54 ambulance vehicles.
   Patients: 11 840 patients who telephoned the ambulance service with "chest pain'' over 20 months, during which 812 patients were admitted with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
   Main outcome measures: All calls and cardiac/potential cardiac calls to the ambulance service, type/time of patient presentation, symptoms/call/door-to-thrombolysis times.
   Results: Of the 11 840 calls to the ambulance service for chest pain over 20 months of the initiative, 60% were cardiac/potentially cardiac-related by Scottish Ambulance Service triage. ST segment elevation was present in 8% of the 5150 12-lead ECGs transmitted by paramedics to the ECG receiving station in the CCU. Over the 20 months, 812 patients were admitted to the three hospitals with STEMI and 71% received thrombolysis. Median symptom-tothrombolysis times were 91, 148 and 184 min, respectively, in the PHT, telemetry-facilitated IHT and self-presenting IHT groups. Median call-to-needle time for the PHT group was 40 min. In 2/146 cases the cardiologists judged that the patient should not have been administered PHT.
   Conclusions: Based on prehospital 12-lead ECG telemetry, it is possible for paramedics and CCU nurses to conduct live reperfusion decision-making in patients with STEMI, with resultant benefits in symptoms-to-thrombolysis time.

AB Structural health monitoring (SHM) is the automation of the condition assessment process of an engineered system. When applied to geometrically large components or structures, such as those found in civil and aerospace infrastructure and systems, a critical challenge is in designing the sensing solution that could yield actionable information. This is a difficult task to conduct cost-effectively, because of the large surfaces under consideration and the localized nature of typical defects and damages. There have been significant research efforts in empowering conventional measurement technologies for applications to SHM in order to improve performance of the condition assessment process. Yet, the field implementation of these SHM solutions is still in its infancy, attributable to various economic and technical challenges. The objective of this Roadmap publication is to discuss modern measurement technologies that were developed for SHM purposes, along with their associated challenges and opportunities, and to provide a path to research and development efforts that could yield impactful field applications. The Roadmap is organized into four sections: distributed embedded sensing systems, distributed surface sensing systems, multifunctional materials, and remote sensing. Recognizing that many measurement technologies may overlap between sections, we define distributed sensing solutions as those that involve or imply the utilization of numbers of sensors geometrically organized within (embedded) or over (surface) the monitored component or system. Multi-functional materials are sensing solutions that combine multiple capabilities, for example those also serving structural functions.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Many emerging cyber-physical systems, such as autonomous vehicles and robots, rely heavily on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to perform important system operations. Since these highly parallel applications are computationally intensive, they need to be accelerated by graphics processing units (GPUs) to meet stringent timing constraints. However, despite the wide adoption of GPUs, efficiently scheduling multiple GPU applications while providing rigorous real-time guarantees remains challenging. Each GPU application has multiple CPU execution and memory copy segments, with GPU kernels running on different hardware resources. Because of the complicated interactions between heterogeneous segments of parallel tasks, high schedulability is hard to achieve with conventional approaches. This paper proposes RTGPU, which combines fine-grain GPU partitioning on the system-side with a novel scheduling algorithm on the theory-side. We start by building a model for CPU and memory copy segments. Leveraging persistent threads, we then implement fine-grained GPU partitioning with improved performance through interleaved execution. To reap the benefits of fine-grained GPU partitioning and schedule multiple parallel GPU applications, we propose a novel real-time scheduling algorithm based on federated scheduling and grid search with uniprocessor fixed-priority scheduling. Our approach provides real-time guarantees to meet hard deadlines and achieves over 11% improvement in system throughput and up to 57% schedulability improvement compared with previous work. We validate and evaluate RTGPU on NVIDIA GPU systems. Our system-side techniques can be applied on mainstream GPUs, and the proposed scheduling theory can be used in general heterogeneous computing platforms which have a similar task execution pattern.

AB The popularity of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) to be used in civilian applications has increased in the last years. However, in most of these applications, a MAV is used to acquire aerial images and video of areas and structures of interest. However, MAVs could become more useful if they can interact with the environment. For instance, in a parcel delivery task, the goal is for the MAV to deliver a package somewhere, but what about having to pick up a package autonomously? This task raises some challenges: i) the MAV has to recognize where the package or object of interest is; ii) the MAV has to plan its maneuver to achieve the picking. In this paper, we address both challenges, considering the scenario where the MAV has a suspended cable that moves freely with a hook attached at the end of the cable. A suspended cable saves weight, although it has to be indirectly controllable with the MAV's flight. Thus, we present a solution based on a Convolutional Neural Network that is trained to recognize the object of interest, in this case, a bucket; and that simultaneously recognizes the hook. Both objects are expected to be observed with a camera on board the MAV. Our method uses the distance between these two objects in a state machine controller to position the MAV and trigger the lifting maneuver in a single upward motion action that reduces the effects of air current on the hook. We use synthetic datasets to train the bucket and hook detector, but the model is capable of performing the detection in real environments. We achieved an average lifting success rate of 70% for indoor and 60% for outdoor scenarios.

AB This paper aims to study passengers' preference for High-Speed Railways (HSRs) and High-Speed Trains (HSTs) through a systematic literature review. The existing relevant literature was examined by using the Scopus application, and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method is applied to extract the topics of the selected documents. By comparing the contents of the relevant literature, the general overview of research in this field can be further understood, and the key factors that have been studied so far that affect passengers' preference can be analyzed. As a green, safe, and sustainable transport mode, HSRs do not only play an essential role in serving passengers but could also be a novel option for freight transport as long as HSRs are able to adjust their technology to the requirements of the rapid growth of the modern logistics industry. The evaluation of passengers' preference for HSRs/HSTs presents some gaps that need to be addressed in future studies: (1) the speed of the HST line ought to be introduced clearly; (2) more competing alternatives, such as maglev, autonomous vehicles, and other access-egress transport modes to terminals, such as subways and aero taxis, need to be included; (3) the analysis of passengers' preferences needs to be extended to the new role that HSRs can play in the logistics industry as new cargo services have been developed with the participation of HSRs; and (4) some attributes related to environmental costs and carbon emissions for the transport modes, as well as segmentation variables that are proxies for different passengers' attitudes towards climate change concerns, need to be included in the design of the choice experiment.

AB Electroacoustic transducers arrays operating in the 50-100 kHz frequency range are currently being investigated for underwater applications such as target detection transducers installed on underwater autonomous vehicles (UAV) and detection of underwater intruders to protect and secure economically and strategically critical coastal areas and facilities. However, the frequency range is such that it prevents the use of monolithic piezoceramics operating in the thickness mode due to the unacceptably high voltages that are required to drive them. Whereas the alternative such as Langevin-type transducer solutions have certain other assembly difficulties that arise due to the size limitations imposed on the transducer from the half-wavelength (lambda/2) arrangement requirement of the units. In our study, an entirely new alternative was proposed to overcome these difficulties. A piezoceramic transducer constructed from a hollow cylindrical shell form poled in the radial direction was designed and developed to operate at the longitudinal length extension mode. Since the hollow cylindrical piezoceramics were designed and produced with one end closed, this closed end was used as a passive cap with the transducer operating in a piston mode. ATILA finite element analysis code was used to design, analyze and fine-tune the dimensional requirements of the transducer. The center frequency of the transducer was fixed to 70 kHz. Commercial lead zirconate titanate (PZT) composition with hard piezoelectric character (PZT-4) was used as the starting powder. The slip casting method was used to obtain the cylindrical shell form. Single element transducers, as well as a hexagonal close-packed array consisting of seven units and arranged with a distance of half-wavelength (lambda/2) to obtain constructive interference at 70 kHz were constructed and tested for underwater electroacoustic performance.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping is very essential for autonomous navigation when the mobile robot is navigating in unknown environment without a global positioning system. Various techniques to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem have been extensively studied using the combination of low-cost sensors. Most of the work in mobile robotics still consists of finding solutions to problems in data exchange between mobile robot and communication control station, which is a challenging task. In fact, communication systems impose severe constraints in terms of channel capacity and transmission quality, because the transmission channel in communication systems is undergoing at the different physical phenomena like scattering, diffusion and diffraction, which occur interference and multiple path effects in wireless communications, while keeping these effects levels low. This article describes a simultaneous localization and mapping problem based on second-order smooth variable structure filter embedded in mobile robot equipped with a sensor for data wireless collection. The inclusion of the control in environments outside the mobile robot field of view can make the wireless communication simultaneous localization and mapping process much more difficult to find a solution under realistic conditions. In order to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping issue and to mitigate the fading phenomena, which affect the quality of service in advanced wireless communication systems, we use a new approach to combat the fading effect without requiring any statistical knowledge of the propagation channel parameters. Several experiments have been done in real-world applications, and good performances were obtained using a second-order smooth variable structure filter-simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm-based wireless communication.

AB To increase the measurement rate of real-time in-situ laser ranging, an online Gauss-Newton-based parallel-pipeline method (GNPPo) is proposed to extract waveform parameters. The proposed method includes waveform pre-processing for initial estimation, variable substitution for fast computation, and Gauss-Newton method for optimization. In waveform pre-processing, parallel-pipeline architecture was used to obtain initial values of waveform parameters as input for Gauss-Newton method. In the variable substitution, the initial values were transformed to reduce the number of divisions and accelerate Jacobi matrix calculation. To obtain the optimized waveform parameters, adjoint matrix method was used to calculate the iteration vector in Gauss-Newton method. The optimized waveform parameters required inverse transformation by variable substitution for accurately calculating the distance. The proposed method employed parallel-pipeline architecture, implemented on Kintex-7 FPGA. Simulations first proved that the proposed method decreased time cost and increased the occupied computational resource. Extensive experiments were conducted using a lab-built full-waveform ranging system. In comparison with the online Gauss-Newton-based pipeline method (GNPo) and the Gauss-Newton-based post-processing method (GNp), experimental results revealed that the proposed method realizes a range measurement rate of 285.7 kHz, approximately 2.5 times and 49 times as fast as GNPo and GNp, respectively. The mean range error and range standard deviation of GNPPo are 0.6 cm and 1.7 cm, at a distance of 21 m with an SNR of 36.6 dB, roughly the same scale of GNp, and a millimeter-scale increase of GNPo. The proposed method will be used for LiDAR application on autonomous vehicles with real-time centimeter accuracy.

AB This article addresses the problem of directing a family of second-order agents suffering external flowfields to achieve the lateral formation tracking motion on a target sphere. Distinguishing from the existing results based on bidirectional networks, this paper firstly attempts to deal with the fixed directed strongly connected multiagent systems and then the switch directed networks with the strong connectivity of each topology. Both the velocity field (eg, the constant-velocity flowfield, the rotating flowfield, Eulerian specification flowfield, the parameterized flowfield) and the gravitational field are under consideration, where the flow specification is a spatiotemporal variable with an unknown parameter vector. Therefore, it is known as the general flowfield. To access to the fixed network, a new second-order observer for the velocity field as well as an adaptive estimate for the gravitational field are constructed by using the tool of adaptive backstepping in the beginning. They, together with the distributed control laws in the spherical normal, lateral, and longitudinal directions, are proposed to accomplish spherical tracking, circular tracking, and lateral formation. For the purpose of avoiding the overparametrization of observer and reducing the complexity of design, a minimum-order observer is proposed later. Finally, our proposed methods servicing to the fixed topologies are developed to the cases where the switching topologies are directed and each one is strongly connected. The stability of the fixed and directed strongly connected system is investigated based on the Barbalat's lemma, whereas the Lyapunov stability theory of nonsmooth systems is introduced to analyze the stability of the switching cases. Theoretical results are proven by the numerical examples.

AB With an increasing number of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), solutions supporting the improvement in their precision of operation and safety of autonomous flights are gaining importance. They are particularly crucial in transportation tasks, where control systems are required to provide a stable and controllable flight in various environmental conditions, especially after changing the total mass of the UAV (by adding extra load). In the paper, the problem of using only available basic sensory information for fast, locally best, iterative real-time auto-tuning of parameters of fixed-gain altitude controllers is considered. The machine learning method proposed for this purpose is based on a modified zero-order optimization algorithm (golden-search algorithm) and bootstrapping technique. It has been validated in numerous simulations and real-world experiments in terms of its effectiveness in such aspects as: the impact of environmental disturbances (wind gusts); flight with change in mass; and change of sensory information sources in the auto-tuning procedure. The main advantage of the proposed method is that for the trajectory primitives repeatedly followed by an UAV (for programmed controller gains), the method effectively minimizes the selected performance index (cost function). Such a performance index might, e.g., express indirect requirements about tracking quality and energy expenditure. In the paper, a comprehensive description of the method, as well as a wide discussion of the results obtained from experiments conducted in the AeroLab for a low-cost UAV (Bebop 2), are included. The results have confirmed high efficiency of the method at the expected, low computational complexity.

AB In this study, the relation between two approaches to assess the ocean predictability on interannual to decadal time scales is investigated. The first pragmatic approach consists of sampling the initial condition uncertainty and assess the predictability through the divergence of this ensemble in time. The second approach is provided by a theoretical framework to determine error growth by estimating optimal linear growing modes. In this paper, it is shown that under the assumption of linearized dynamics and normal distributions of the uncertainty, the exact quantitative spread of ensemble can be determined from the theoretical framework. This spread is at least an order of magnitude less expensive to compute than the approximate solution given by the pragmatic approach. This result is applied to a state-of-the-art Ocean General Circulation Model to assess the predictability in the North Atlantic of four typical oceanic metrics: the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the intensity of its heat transport, the two-dimensional spatially-averaged Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over the North Atlantic, and the three-dimensional spatially-averaged temperature in the North Atlantic. For all tested metrics, except for SST, 75% of the total uncertainty on interannual time scales can be attributed to oceanic initial condition uncertainty rather than atmospheric stochastic forcing. The theoretical method also provide the sensitivity pattern to the initial condition uncertainty, allowing for targeted measurements to improve the skill of the prediction. It is suggested that a relatively small fleet of several autonomous underwater vehicles can reduce the uncertainty in AMOC strength prediction by 70% for 1-5 years lead times.

AB Marine seismic surveys are an important tool to map geology beneath the seafloor and manage petroleum resources, but they are also a source of underwater noise pollution. A mass mortality of scallops in the Bass Strait, Australia occurred a few months after a marine seismic survey in 2010, and fishing groups were concerned about the potential relationship between the two events. The current study used three field-based methods to investigate the potential impact of marine seismic surveys on scallops in the region: 1) dredging and 2) deployment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) were undertaken to examine the potential response of two species of scallops (Pecten fumatus, Mimachlamys asperrima) before, two months after, and ten months after a 2015 marine seismic survey; and 3) MODIS satellite data revealed patterns of sea surface temperatures from 2006-2016. Results from the dredging and AUV components show no evidence of scallop mortality attributable to the seismic survey, although sub-lethal effects cannot be excluded. The remote sensing revealed a pronounced thermal spike in the eastern Bass Strait between February and May 2010, overlapping the scallop beds that suffered extensive mortality and coinciding almost exactly with dates of operation for the 2010 seismic survey. The acquisition of in situ data coupled with consideration of commercial seismic arrays meant that results were ecologically realistic, while the paired field-based components (dredging, AUV imagery) provided a failsafe against challenges associated with working wholly in the field. This study expands our knowledge of the potential environmental impacts of marine seismic survey and will inform future applications for marine seismic surveys, as well as the assessment of such applications by regulatory authorities.

AB Ground experiment under microgravity is very essential because it can verify the space enabling technologies before applied in space missions. In this paper, a novel ground experiment system that can provide long duration, large scale and high microgravity level for the six degree of freedom (DOF) spacecraft trajectory tracking is presented. In which, the most gravity of the test body is balanced by the buoyancy, and the small residual gravity is offset by the electromagnetic force. Because the electromagnetic force on the test body can be adjusted in the electromagnetic system, it can significantly simplify the balancing process using the proposed microgravity test bed compared to the neutral buoyance system. Besides, a novel compensation control system based on the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method is developed to estimate and compensate the water resistance online, in order to improve the fidelity of the ground experiment. A six-DOF trajectory tracking in the microgravity system is applied to testify the efficiency of the proposed compensation controller, and the experimental simulation results are compared to that obtained using the classic proportional-integral-derivative (PID) method. The simulation results demonstrated that, for the six-DOF motion ground experiment, the microgravity level can reach to 5 x 10(-4) g. And, because the water resistance has been estimated and compensated, the performance of the presented controller is much better than the PID controller. The presented ground microgravity system can be applied in on-orbit service and other related technologies in future.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles were used to conduct a high-resolution water column survey of Lake Rotomahana using temperature, pH, turbidity, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) to identify active hydro thermal discharge zones within the lake. Five areas with active sublacustrine venting were identified: (1) the area of the historic Pink Terraces; (2) adjacent to the western shoreline subaerial "Steaming Cliffs," boiling springs and geyser; (3) along the northern shoreline to the east of the Pink Terrace site; (4) the newly discovered Patiti hydrothermal system along the south margin of the 1886 Tarawera eruption rift zone; and (5) a location in the east basin (northeast of Patiti Island). The Pink Terrace hydrothermal system was active prior to the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera, but venting along the western shoreline, in the east basin, and the Patiti hydrothermal system appear to have been initiated in the aftermath of the eruption, similar to Waimangu Valley to the southwest. Different combinations of turbidity, pH anomalies (both positive and negative), and ORP responses suggest vent fluid compositions vary over short distances within the lake. The seasonal period of stratification limits vertical transport of heat to the surface layer and the hypolimnion temperature of Lake Rotomahana consequently increases with an average warming rate of similar to 0.010 degrees C/day due to both convective hydrothermal discharge and conductive geothermal heating. A sudden temperature increase occurred during our 2011 survey and was likely the response to an earthquake swarm just 11 days prior. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Novel topographic survey methods that integrate both structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry and small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) are a rapidly evolving investigative technique. Due to the diverse range of survey configurations available and the infancy of these new methods, further research is required. Here, the accuracy, precision and potential applications of this approach are investigated. A total of 543 images of the Cwm Idwal moraine-mound complex were captured from a light (<5 kg) semi-autonomous multi-rotor unmanned aircraft system using a consumer-grade 18 MP compact digital camera The images were used to produce a DSM (digital surface model) of the moraines. The DSM is in good agreement with 7761 total station survey points providing a total vertical RMSE value of 0.517 m and vertical RMSE values as low as 0.200 m for less densely vegetated areas of the DSM. High-precision topographic data can be acquired rapidly using this technique with the resulting DSMs and orthorectified aerial imagery at sub-decimetre resolutions. Positional errors on the total station dataset, vegetation and steep terrain are identified as the causes of vertical disagreement. Whilst this aerial survey approach is advocated for use in a range of geomorphological settings, care must be taken to ensure that adequate ground control is applied to give a high degree of accuracy.

ID BARRIER FUNCTIONS
AB This article addresses the problem of safety-critical control for multiagent systems with unknown dynamics in unknown environments. It has been shown that stabilizing affine control systems to desired (sets of) states while optimizing quadratic costs subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of quadratic programs (QPs) by using control barrier functions (CBFs) and control Lyapunov functions (CLFs). One of the main challenges in this approach is obtaining accurate system dynamics of all components in the system, which is especially difficult when online model identification is required given limited computational resources and system data. We address this problem by proposing a robust framework (to unknown dynamics including uncertainties) through defining adaptive affine control dynamics that are updated based on the error states obtained by real-time sensor measurements. We define a CBF for a safety requirement on the unmodeled agents based on the adaptive dynamics and error states, and reformulate the safety-critical control problem as the abovementioned sequence of QPs. Then, we determine a set of events that trigger the QPs and ensure safety when solving them. We also derive a condition that guarantees the satisfaction of a CBF constraint between events. The proposed framework can also be used for state convergence guarantees for systems with unknown dynamics based on CLFs. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a robot control problem, an adaptive cruise control problem and a traffic merging problem using autonomous vehicles. We also compare the proposed event-driven method with the classical time-driven approach.

AB In advanced transportation-management systems, variable speed limits are a crucial application. Deep reinforcement learning methods have been shown to have superior performance in many applications, as they are an effective approach to learning environment dynamics for decision-making and control. However, they face two significant difficulties in traffic-control applications: reward engineering with delayed reward and brittle convergence properties with gradient descent. To address these challenges, evolutionary strategies are well suited as a class of black-box optimization techniques inspired by natural evolution. Additionally, the traditional deep reinforcement learning framework struggles to handle the delayed reward setting. This paper proposes a novel approach using covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), a gradient-free global optimization method, to handle the task of multi-lane differential variable speed limit control. The proposed method uses a deep-learning-based method to dynamically learn optimal and distinct speed limits among lanes. The parameters of the neural network are sampled using a multivariate normal distribution, and the dependencies between the variables are represented by a covariance matrix that is optimized dynamically by CMA-ES based on the freeway's throughput. The proposed approach is tested on a freeway with simulated recurrent bottlenecks, and the experimental results show that it outperforms deep reinforcement learning-based approaches, traditional evolutionary search methods, and the no-control scenario. Our proposed method demonstrates a 23% improvement in average travel time and an average of a 4% improvement in CO, HC, and NOx emission.Furthermore, the proposed method produces explainable speed limits and has desirable generalization power.

AB Biogenic traces (lebensspuren) result from the activity of benthic organisms on and within the seafloor and are a common feature of deep-sea environments. Rosette-shape traces (RSTs), also referred to as spoke burrows, are a commonly observed and distinctive trace, likely created by echiuran worms during feeding and burrowing. We conduct a quantitative morphometric assessment of RSTs from two contrasting sites at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Sustained Observatory (PAP-SO; Northeast Atlantic) with similar physico-chemical conditions except for relative sediment compaction, but substantive differences in their megabenthic communities. We quantified RST abundance (numerical density and seafloor cover) and morphological characteristics (spoke number and overlap, spoke length and width, trace area and relative completeness) for 148 individual RSTs observed in some 6800 seafloor photograph (8788 m  2 seafloor area) captured with an autonomous underwater vehicle. We derived two primary results between study sites: (a) individual spoke morphology exhibited no statistically significant differences, while (b) individual trace completeness was significantly different. The consistency in spoke morphometrics reflects our identification of a single RST morphotype, potentially representing a single functional group of echiurans. The difference in trace completeness between sites may have resulted from differences in competition for resource with other megabenthic surface deposit feeders, and not to be directly related to relative sediment compaction. By reference to literature data and observations of similar traces in other deep-sea settings, we further suggest that this connection between trace completeness and resource availability may be more generally applicable in both contemporary ecology and paleoichnology.

TI NFTS AS DECENTRALIZED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
SO UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW

DT Article
ID NORMS; INNOVATION; COPYRIGHT; PARADOX; AUTHORS; ARTS
AB This Article is the first to elaborate a theory of decentralized intellec-tual property (De-IP) to explain the phenomenon of NFTs. This theory of De-IP provides a compelling new understanding of NFTs. Like the current movement to adopt decentralized finance (`DeFi'), De-IP utilizes block -chain technology to provide an alternative, decentralized way to engage in activities traditionally governed by a highly centralized regulatory system, typically involving the U.S. government and dominant industry intermedi-aries who operate as de facto gatekeepers. The primary vehicle for De-IP is a new technology called the non-fungible token (`NFT'), which consists of a computer program called a smart-contract that authenticates a unique virtual token on blockchain and identifies some other subject matter, such as a copyrighted artwork, whose use is governed by a license setting forth the rights the NFT owner receives. Through a combination of virtual tokens (which are new intellectual property in their own right), code, licenses, practices, and norms, NFTs are providing a viable, decentralized alterna-tive to the copyright system-an alternative that does not eliminate the cop-yright system, but instead, makes it more responsive to what artists and people want. Although critics may object that De-IP does not adequately consider the public interest in how the copyright system should be re-formed, both republican theory of deliberation and the ongoing public de-bate about copyright on social media and in decentralized autonomous or-ganizations (`DAOs') allay such concerns. Indeed, the current decentralized debate about NFTs and copyright law may be not only better for democratic deliberation but also more responsive to the needs of indi-vidual authors and the public. Everyone can participate.

AB Aiming at the thermal control challenges of the Chang'E-5 lunar module, which is a complex of lunar lander and lunar ascent vehicle, a design method was proposed based on optimized management of energy. An integrated and autonomous thermal management system for robotic lunar spacecraft was designed including a single-phase fluid loop, water sublimator and high temperature thermal protection shield. The single-phase fluid loop driven by a miniature pump served as the thermal bus to collect heat. The water sublimator was applied as a supplementary heat sink of panel radiators to dissipate heat load on the lunar surface. The lightweight thermal protection shield was applied to protect the equipment in confined space from high temperature plume of big-powered engine during powered descent and ascending. The combination heat sink of fixed panel radiators and water sublimator was managed to meet different heat dissipation requirements of the Chang'E-5 lunar module. The flight data showed that the proposed thermal control system achieved excellent performance. The electronic equipment onboard the Chang'E -5 lunar module was kept between -7.7 degrees C to 39.6 degrees C during the mission profile. An optimized goal was achieved that there was zero thermal power compensation for the electronic equipment, while the ratio of thermal load peak-to-trough was as high as 7:1. At the same time, an inter-layer heat transfer model of the heat shield was verified with a temperature difference of less than 3 degrees C between the prediction result and flight data.

AB 5G communication brings substantial improvements in the quality of service provided to various applications by achieving higher throughput and lower latency. However, interactive multimedia applications (e.g., ultra high definition video conferencing, 3D and multiview video streaming, crowd-sourced video streaming, cloud gaming, virtual and augmented reality) are becoming more ambitious with high volume and low latency video streams putting strict demands on the already congested networks. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm that extends cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network i.e., at the base station level. To meet the latency requirements and avoid the end-to-end communication with remote cloud data centers, MEC allows to store and process video content (e.g., caching, transcoding, pre-processing) at the base stations. Both video on demand and live video streaming can utilize MEC to improve existing services and develop novel use cases, such as video analytics, and targeted advertisements. MEC is expected to reshape the future of video streaming by providing ultra-reliable and low latency streaming (e.g., in augmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous vehicles), pervasive computing (e.g., in real-time video analytics), and blockchain-enabled architecture for secure live streaming. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent developments in MEC-enabled video streaming bringing unprecedented improvement to enable novel use cases. A detailed review of the state-of-the-art is presented covering novel caching schemes, optimal computation offloading, cooperative caching and offloading and the use of artificial intelligence (i.e., machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning) in MEC-assisted video streaming services.

AB The Algerian Basin is a key area for the general circulation in the western Mediterranean Sea. The basin has an intense inflow/outflow regime with complex circulation patterns, involving both fresh Atlantic water and more saline Mediterranean water. Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of the combined use of autonomous underwater vehicles, such as gliders, with remotely sensed products (e.g., altimetry, MUR SST) to observe meso- and submesoscale structures and their properties. An important contribution could come from a new generation of enhanced satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) products, e.g., those provided by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. In this paper, we assess the advantages of using Barcelona Expert Center (BEC) SMOS SSS products, obtained through a combination of debiased non-Bayesian retrieval, DINEOF (data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions) and multifractal fusion with high resolution sea surface temperature (OSTIA SST) maps. Such an aim was reached by comparing SMOS Level-3 (L3) and Level-4 (L4) SSS products with in situ high resolution glider measurements collected in the framework of the Algerian Basin Circulation Unmanned Survey (ABACUS) observational program conducted in the Algerian Basin during falls 2014-2016. Results show that different levels of confidence between in situ and satellite measurements can be achieved according to the spatial scales of variability. Although SMOS values slightly underestimate in situ observations (mean difference is -0.14 (-0.11)), with a standard deviation of 0.25 (0.26) for L3 (L4) products), at basin scale, the enhanced SMOS products well represent the salinity patterns described by the ABACUS data.

AB Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) exploration at the distal margins of a debris avalanche deposit from Kick'em Jenny submarine volcano in Grenada has revealed areas of cold seeps with chemosynthetic-based ecosystems. The seeps occur on steep slopes of deformed, unconsolidated hemipelagic sediments in water depths between 1952 and 2042 m. Two main areas consist of anastomosing systems of fluid flow that have incised local sediments by several tens of centimeters. No temperature anomalies were observed in the vent areas and no active flow was visually observed, suggesting that the venting may be waning. An Eh sensor deployed on a miniature autonomous plume recorder (MAPR) recorded a positive signal and the presence of live organisms indicates at least some venting is still occurring. The chemosynthetic-based ecosystem included giant mussels (Bathymodiolus sp.) with commensal polychaetes (Branchipolynoe sp.) and cocculinid epibionts, other bivalves, Siboglinida (vestimentiferan) tubeworms, other polychaetes, and shrimp, as well as associated heterotrophs, including gastropods, anemones, crabs, fish, octopods, brittle stars, and holothurians. The origin of the seeps may be related to fluid overpressure generated during the collapse of an ancestral Kick'em Jenny volcano. We suggest that deformation and burial of hemipelagic sediment at the front and base of the advancing debris avalanche led to fluid venting at the distal margin. Such deformation may be a common feature of marine avalanches in a variety of geological environments especially along continental margins, raising the possibility of creating large numbers of ephemeral seepbased ecosystems.

AB Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is an extension to the three stages of industry that reshapes it into a combination of physical and digital worlds. The I4.0 paradigm shift coupled with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, the internet of things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, and digital twins (DTs), have brought and will continue to bring profound changes that impact entire systems across all industries. Despite I4.0's many advantages, it also brings a host of problems and disruptions. These problems and disruptions must be identified to maximize its potential. Saudi Arabia is undergoing significant transformation as it has initiated several plans to develop the industrial sector and enhance its contribution to the national economy. Despite Saudi Arabia's 2030 vision, the industrial sector has still not fully grasped the breadth and depth of the new revolution due to its novelty. This is particularly true in the cement industry, one of the most vital industries in the region. Due to its many unique systemic complexities, the cement industry has faced numerous challenges due to the lack of a comprehensive framework for mitigating disruptions and leveraging I4.0 benefits. Accordingly, the paper conducts an exploratory study on I4.0 for Saudi Arabian cement companies. Therefore, this paper provides an overview of I4.0 for Saudi Arabia's cement companies. The paper analyzes key findings and proposes a plan-do-check-act (PDCA) framework for I4.0 implementation based on a system thinking approach to guide cement companies to strategically embrace the new phenomenon and maximize their key performance indicators.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are important tools for exploring and studying the ocean. To improve the stealthiness of AUV positioning, a new type of inverted ultra-short baseline (i-USBL) positioning system is proposed in this paper. The system uses a surface GPS buoy as a positioning base station to transmit positioning signals to the AUV, which receives the signals through the i-USBL and calculates its own coordinates. In this way, the power consumption of the AUV will be lower, improving its endurance. In addition, azimuth observation is one of the key observation quantities in ultra-short baseline positioning systems. Therefore, this paper derives two phase difference estimation algorithms for azimuth measurement, which are the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm and the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithm. Simulation results show that when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is less than or equal to 0 dB, the DFT algorithm has higher accuracy; when SNR is greater than or equal to 10 dB, LMS has slightly higher accuracy than DFT; however, DFT is more stable than LMS at all SNRs. When SNR is 20 dB, the maximum azimuth measurement error of LMS and DFT is 0.3301 degrees and 0.2204 degrees, respectively, which can meet the positioning accuracy requirements. The average running times of LMS and DFT are 0.085 s and 0.011 s, respectively, and LMS has a faster running speed. In summary, the LMS algorithm can be used for azimuth observation when the SNR is good, and DFT can be applied when the SNR is poor.

AB Connected and Automated Shuttles (CAS) are emerging technologies recently introduced into urban intelligent transport systems to enhance their efficiency. However, the majority of existing studies primarily concentrate on their design and public acceptance, while their integration to complement more conventional mobility systems is largely ignored. Indeed, the integration of CAS with existing transport systems represents a promising opportunity to improve the overall efficiency and safety of existing mobility services, be it offered to citizens or companies. However, this integration presents significant challenges for mobility service operators, who must consider the potential impact of these new technologies on traffic patterns, infrastructure investments, and travel behavior. This paper reviews the current state of connected and automated shuttle's technologies, including the different experiments and pilot projects in Europe for the transport of people, goods or both, in addition to the scientific efforts to build new services (e.g., optimisation and AI-based models). We discuss the challenges that mobility service providers face when planning for the long-term integration of CAS, and propose a digital twin approach to help overcome these challenges. The proposed approach is based on advanced simulation and modeling software that can create realistic 3D representations of transport systems and has the potential to simulate the impact of CAS on traffic patterns and infrastructure investments. This paper serves as a starting point for future investigations on the integration of CAS with the existing mobility systems by identifying research gaps, limitations and challenges, and potential areas of research to overcome these challenges and improve the effectiveness of future mobility services.

AB Massive access outside the coverage of terrestrial cellular networks will be the main feature of the sixth generation (6G) networks. In order to cope with it, the cognitive satellite-UAV network (CSUN) has drawn a lot of attentions. In this paper, we investigate the UAV trajectory optimization and power allocation for the cell-free CSUN consisting of one satellite and a swarm of UAVs. Indeed, due to the on-board energy constraints of UAVs, both the trajectory optimization and the power allocation can significantly save the energy to improve the energy efficiency. The joint trajectory optimization and power allocation problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem which is extremely difficult to solve. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we decompose the original optimization problem into two subproblems in terms of the trajectory optimization and power allocation. For the trajectory optimization subproblem, we model it as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and the PSO is adopted to solve it. When the trajectory variables are fixed, the power allocation subproblem is still difficult to tackle due to its non-convexity and large scale. Firstly, we present a kind of centralized algorithm in which the DC (difference of two convex functions) algorithm is applied to optimize it, and then a distributed algorithm based on auxiliary variables is proposed to reduce the signaling overhead and computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation algorithm for the cell-free CSUN.

AB Injuries and fatalities for vulnerable road users, especially bicyclists and pedestrians, are on the rise. To better inform design for vulnerable road users, we need to evaluate how bicyclist and pedestrian behavior and physiological states change in different roadway design and contextual settings. Previous research highlights the advantages of using immersive virtual environments (IVEs) in conducting bicyclist and pedestrian studies. These environments do not put participants at risk of injury, are low cost compared to on-road or naturalistic studies, and allow researchers to fully control variables of interest. In this paper, we propose a framework, Omni-Reality and Cognition Lab Simulator (ORCLSim), to support human sensing techniques within IVEs to evaluate bicyclist and pedestrian physiological and behavioral changes in different contextual settings. To showcase this framework, we present two case studies, where pilot data from five participants' physiological and behavioral responses in an IVE setting are collected and analyzed, representing real-world roadway segments and traffic conditions. Results from these case studies indicate that physiological data are sensitive to road environment changes and real-time events in the IVE, especially changes in heart rate and gaze behavior. In addition, our preliminary data indicate participants may respond differently to various roadway settings (e.g., signalized vs. unsignalized intersections). By analyzing these changes, future studies can identify how participants' stress level and cognitive load are impacted by the surrounding environment. The ORCLSim system architecture is a prototype that can be customized for future studies in understanding users' behavioral and physiological responses in virtual reality settings.

AB A comprehensive review of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels prepared by the freezing/thawing (F-T) process is presented. We discuss their preparation, gelation mechanisms, handling of physical/mechanical properties, physicochemical characteristics, and various applications. PVA gelation through repeated F-T occurs without an externally added crosslinking agent due to the molecular structure and ability of PVA solutions to crystallize, resulting in ultrapure hydrogels. Gelation factors such as F-T cycle number, maximum and minimum temperature used, cycle duration, as well as molecular characteristics of the employed PVA samples, such as the average molecular weight, and the degree of hydrolysis, enable precise tuning of crystallization, hydrogen bonding as well as the final hydrogel properties. Incorporation of a second polymer and/or nanoparticles, which respectively results in interpenetrating polymer networks and nanocomposites, further facilitates obtaining desirable final properties to customize the gels for variety of applications. Facile customizability of the properties along with biocompatibility of PVA has led to the development of diverse prosthetic materials ranging from vascular stents, cartilages, and even contact lenses. In addition, PVA hydrogels have also been under investigation for drug delivery vehicles, and wound dressings. Furthermore, PVA hydrogels may possess a variety of other interesting features such as autonomous self-healing ability and programmed shape memory characteristic. As such PVA hydrogels can be used as components in actuators. Applications of the F-T PVA hydrogels in ionically conductive and photonic crystal-based sensors are also discussed.

AB The LiDAR point cloud data and camera images are distorted to a different degree under various severe weather conditions. Due to this, the traditional single-modal object detection methods are unable to use the complementary information between different sensors. Consequently, these algorithms are unable to address various issues caused by severe weather conditions. Recently, the multimodal data fusion methods are applied to the road object detection under severe weather conditions. However, the multimodal algorithms suffer from low data alignment accuracy and the inability to suppress the changes in exposure under severe weather conditions. In this work, we propose a new multimodal sensor fusion object detection network. The proposed network effectively overcomes the shortcomings caused by the camera and LiDAR distortions in severe weather conditions and achieves robust environment perception. We propose: 1) pointwise aligned data fusion method based on K-means++ clustering to improve the accuracy of data alignment; 2) implicit feature pyramid network (i-FPN) to fuse the image features for suppressing the distortions caused by the changes in exposure; and 3) hybrid attention mechanism (HAM) to deal with the fusion features and improve the adaptability toward different working conditions. We perform experiments using the One Million Scenes for Autonomous Driving (ONCE) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) datasets. The experimental results and analysis show that the proposed method effectively improves the performance of multimodal deep fusion network under both clear and severe weather conditions.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown excellent performance for vision-based lane detection. However, maintaining the performance of the trained models under new test scenarios still remains challenging due to the dataset bias between the training and test datasets; In lane detection processes, the dataset bias can be categorized into lane position bias and lane pattern bias, with the former one particularly influences the lane detection performance. To tackle this dataset bias, this article proposes a unified viewpoint transformation (UVT) method that transforms the camera viewpoints of different datasets into a common virtual world coordinate system, such that the mismatched lane position distributions can be effectively aligned. Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets including the Caltech [1], Tusimple [2], and KITTI [3] dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the UVT algorithm in improving the lane detection performance on the test datasets. Moreover, by incorporating the UVT into other techniques that tackling the dataset bias, the lane position and pattern differences are disentangled and separately minimized. As a result, the performance gap between the training data and the test scenarios can be bridged. Specifically, the model trained on the KITTI dataset have achieved high performance in the Tusimple and the Caltech dataset (F1-score: 84.8 and 87.1%). With the proposed algorithm, a lane detection model trained on one dataset can be effectively applied to datasets with different camera settings in vastly different localities, and achieve better generalization ability compared to the state of the art methods.

AB There is currently great interest in enhancing the ability of aerial robots to navigate indoors. Navigating a building under various lighting and environmental conditions would have application in disaster response, infrastructure inspections, as well as a wide variety of commercial applications. In order to achieve this goal, one common feature of indoor environments that must be addressed is the detection of transparent/reflective barriers. Transparent/reflective barriers as they pertain to structures generally take the form of a window, office divider, or storefront. Human tele-operators of aerial robots in environments such as malls, airports, office buildings, and museums that feature transparent barriers will need some means to enhance their situational awareness so they can recognize the presence of transparent/reflective barriers, distinguish between the two, and have some idea of the distance and pose relative to the transparent/reflective barrier. The ability to detect and localize transparent barriers will also be important for autonomous navigation. The focus of this work is to develop a multi-modal sensing solution that can successfully identify transparent/reflective barriers, distinguish between the two, and provide information on pose and distance to the barrier at time-scales exceeding human response in order to facilitate navigation of indoor spaces. The sensing solution relies on using an imager to measure the differences in the interactions of actively visible light illumination of transparent/reflective barriers. A silicon retina event-driven imager is used in this work to provide a path to obtaining information on transparent/reflective barriers at high speeds, while requiring very little communications bandwidth.

AB Large birds always choose orderly flight formations for migration. The energy-saving hypothesis and visual communication hypothesis have provided explanations for the formation mechanisms of flight formations of large birds. However, the experimental data differ greatly from the theoretical results of the energy-saving hypothesis, and the visual communication hypothesis lacks sufficient supporting evidence. Moreover, neither of these two hypothesises can explain the differences between flight formations of large and small birds. In this article, the authors investigated the formation mechanism of bird flocks from a new perspective, i.e., the weight of repulsive force between individuals, and provided explanations for the differences between flight formations of large and small birds. The authors believe that the weight of repulsive force between large birds is greater than that between small birds, which makes them better at preventing collisions between individuals. The simulation results show that as the weight of repulsive force between individuals is gradually increased, the flight formation of the flock converts from a cluster formation (corresponding to the flight formation of small birds) to a single-row formation (corresponding to the flight formation of large birds). And the migration speed of the single-row flight formation is larger than that of the cluster formation. In addition, the authors also studied the effects of population and density of individuals on flight formations: the entire flock will lose the ability to migrate when the number or density of individuals is large enough. The findings of this article may provide theoretical guidance for the autonomous control for unmanned aerial vehicle swarms. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inspired by its success in financial sectors, the blockchain technique is emerging as an enabling technology for secure distributed control and management of wireless networks. In order to fully benefit from this distributed ledger technology, its limitations, cost, complexity and empowerment also have to be critically appraised. Depending on the specific context of the problem to be solved, these limitations have been handled to some extent through a clear dichotomy in the blockchain architectures, namely by conceiving both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. Permissionless blockchain requires massive computing power to achieve consensus, while its permissioned counterpart is energy efficient but would require trusted participants. To combine these benefits by gaining trust at a high energy efficiency, a novel mechanism is proposed for automatically learning the trust level of users in a public blockchain network and granting them access to a private blockchain network. In this context, machine learning is a very powerful tool capable of automatically learning the trust level. We have proposed reinforcement learning for bridging the dichotomy of blockchains in terms of striking a trust vs complexity trade-off in an unknown environment. Benefits and limitations of various forms of blockchain techniques are analyzed, followed by their reinforcement-aided evolution. We demonstrate that the proposed reinforcement learning aided blockchain is capable of supporting high-integrity autonomous operation and decision making in wireless networks. The win-win amalgamation of these techniques has been demonstrated for striking a compelling balance between the benefits of permissioned and permissionless blockchain networks through the case-study of the proposed blockchain based unmanned aerial vehicle aided wireless networks.

AB In order to achieve high-precision path following of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the horizontal plane, a three degrees-of-freedom adaptive line-of-sight based proportional (3DOFAPLOS) guidance law is proposed. Firstly, the path point coordinate system is introduced, which is suitable for the conversion of an arbitrary path. Then, the appropriate look-ahead distance is obtained by an improved adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) according to three degrees-of-freedom (3DOF), including the cross-track error, the curvature of reference path, and the forward speed. Moreover, combining three degrees-of-freedom ALOS (3DOFALOS) with proportional guidance law, the desired heading is calculated considering the drift angle. 3DOFAPLOS has two functions: in the convergence stage, 3DOFALOS plays a leading role, making AUV converge to the path more quickly and smoothly. In the guidance stage, proportional guidance law plays a major role in effectively resisting the influence of drift angle and making AUV sail along the reference path. If the path is curved, 3DOFALOS makes contributions in both stages, adjusting look-ahead distance in real time with respect to curvature. The stability of the designed closed system is proved by Lyapunov theory. Both simulation and experiment results have verified that 3DOFAPLOS has a satisfactory result, which improves tracking performance more than 50% compared with the traditional line-of-sight (LOS). Specifically, the mean average error (MAE) of path following under 3DOFAPLOS can be reduced by about 60%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) can be reduced by about 50% compared with LOS.

AB Multi-deep automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs) have seen many implementations in warehouses due to their high floor space utilization. However, the rack size, which will fundamentally affect the operating efficiency of the storage and retrieval machine in the system, should be optimized analytically. While extensive studies have been made to analyze the system performance and optimize operating policies for single-deep and double-deep AS/RSs by travel-time models. No analytical models are available for multi-deep AS/RSs. To fill this gap, we develop travel-time models for this system, considering the random storage policy and two class-based storage policies in a multi-deep AS/RS: the one that zoning only on picking face and the one that zoning on both picking face and the depth direction. Based on the travel-time models, we derive the formulation of the optimal system size, to minimize the expected travel time of S/R machine. Simulation models are built to validate the analytical models and the results show that the maximum relative error between analytical result and simulation result is 4.3%. Numerical experiments are conducted to find the optimal size of a multi-deep AS/RS and compare the performance of these storage policies. The results show that class-based storage policy always outperform the random storage policy in terms of expected travel time, and the class-based storage policy that zoning on both picking face and the depth direction may not be better than that only zoning on the picking face, while it may be harder to handle in the system.

AB We collected deep-sea multibeam, side scan, and subbottom profiler data using an autonomous underwater vehicle at the Bayonnaise knoll, a submarine caldera located in the rift zone of the Izu-Ogasawara arc. We aimed to reveal topographic and geological features and the origin of a hydrothermal field called the Hakurei site in the caldera. We performed seafloor classification by textural analysis using calibrated side-scan sonar data, which provided an effective means to understand the geology and to highlight potential areas of hydrothermal constructions. The high-resolution bathymetric map illustrates that the Hakurei hydrothermal field is distributed over a landslide landform in the caldera wall. The distribution of hydrothermal vents indicates that the slip surface has served as a major route of hydrothermal fluids. The radial alignment of chimneys and mounds indicates radial routes of hydrothermal fluid and/or belching along fragile lines in the landslide landform. Various postcaldera activities are inferred including the formation of a lava dome, a pyroclastic cone, and subsequent phreatic explosions. A general volcano-tectonic structure extending across the caldera in a NW-SE direction is interpreted as an inferred boundary fault of the North Myojin Rift. Analogous to the Hokuroku basin and land kuroko deposits, it is suggested that the main contributing factor in the formation of kuroko deposits was volcano-tectonic activity that dominated the margin of the back-arc rift basin. The intersections between the margin of a rift basin and the surrounding knolls have a high potential for ore-forming areas.

AB Autonomous navigation of field robots in an agricultural environment is a difficult task due to the inherent uncertainty in the environment. The drawback of existing systems is the lack of robustness to these uncertainties. In this study we propose a vision-based navigation method to address these problems. The focus is on navigation through a maize field in an outdoor environment where the robot has to navigate through a corridor formed by two plant rows, detect the end of the rows, navigate the headland and turn into another corridor under natural conditions. The method is based on a Particle Filter (PF) using a novel measurement model, where we construct a model image from the particle and compare it directly with the measurement image after elementary processing, such as down-sampling, excessive-green filtering and thresholding. The new measurement model does not extract features from the image and thus does not suffer from errors associated with the feature extraction process. We show how PF can be used for robust navigation of a robot in a semi-structured agricultural environment such as maize fields with inherent uncertainty. We demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm through experiments in several maize fields with different row patterns, varying plant sizes and diverse lighting conditions. To date we have logged over 5 km of successful test runs in which the robot navigates through the corridor without touching the plant stems, accurately detects the end of the rows and traverses the headland.

AB In order to increase the efficiency of wheeled mobile manipulators (WMM), it is preferred to carry the maximum payload, but in the case of a small-sized platform, which is desirable in applications, it may cause dangerous tip over, especially in the presence of obstacles. So, it is necessary to consider stability constraint in the determination of robot motion planning. This paper presents a novel approach for the determination of the maximum payload-carrying capacity of a coordinated mobile manipulator in an environment with presence of obstacle, based on stability. The proposed method considers the tip over stability on zero moment point criterion, which must be considered when the path of the end-effector is predefined but the position of the mobile platform is free, because tipping over in this condition is probable. Hence, the full dynamic model of WMM (including the coordinating vehicle and manipulator) is used, the obstacle avoidance scheme is implied based on potential functions, and the maximum payload path for a specified payload is generated using the optimal control approach. Then, an iterative method based on the stability criterion and motor restriction, including torque and jerk, was implied to calculate the maximum payload capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper reporting on some simulation results as well as successful experiments of implementing the algorithm. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested on a nonholonomic WMM consisting of a differential-drive mobile base and a robotic arm to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Scene understanding based on image segmentation is a crucial component of autonomous vehicles. Pixel-wise semantic segmentation of RGB images can be advanced by exploiting complementary features from the supplementary modality (X-modality). However, covering a wide variety of sensors with a modality-agnostic model remains an unresolved problem due to variations in sensor characteristics among different modalities. Unlike previous modality-specific methods, in this work, we propose a unified fusion framework, CMX, for RGB-X semantic segmentation. To generalize well across different modalities, that often include supplements as well as uncertainties, a unified cross-modal interaction is crucial for modality fusion. Specifically, we design a Cross-Modal Feature Rectification Module (CM-FRM) to calibrate bi-modal features by leveraging the features from one modality to rectify the features of the other modality. With rectified feature pairs, we deploy a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to perform sufficient exchange of long-range contexts before mixing. To verify CMX, for the first time, we unify five modalities complementary to RGB, i.e., depth, thermal, polarization, event, and LiDAR. Extensive experiments show that CMX generalizes well to diverse multi-modal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performances on five RGB-Depth benchmarks, as well as RGB-Thermal, RGB-Polarization, and RGB-LiDAR datasets. Besides, to investigate the generalizability to dense-sparse data fusion, we establish an RGB-Event semantic segmentation benchmark based on the EventScape dataset, on which CMX sets the new state-of-the-art. The source code of CMX is publicly available at https://github.com/huaaaliu/RGBX_Semantic_ Segmentation.

AB Field crops are generally planted in rows to improve planting efficiency and facilitate field management. Therefore, automatic detection of crop planting rows is of great significance for achieving autonomous navigation and precise spraying in intelligent agricultural machinery and is an important part of smart agricultural management. To study the visual navigation line extraction technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in farmland environments and realize real-time precise farmland UAV operations, we propose an improved ENet semantic segmentation network model to perform row segmentation of farmland images. Considering the lightweight and low complexity requirements of the network for crop row detection, the traditional network is compressed and replaced by convolution. Based on the residual network, we designed a network structure of the shunting process, in which low-dimensional boundary information in the feature extraction process is passed backward using the residual stream, allowing efficient extraction of low-dimensional information and significantly improving the accuracy of boundary locations and row-to-row segmentation of farmland crops. According to the characteristics of the segmented image, an improved random sampling consensus algorithm is proposed to extract the navigation line, define a new model-scoring index, find the best point set, and use the least-squares method to fit the navigation line. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm allows accurate and efficient extraction of farmland navigation lines, and it has the technical advantages of strong robustness and high applicability. The algorithm can provide technical support for the subsequent quasi-flight of agricultural UAVs in farmland operations.

AB This article addresses a fundamental question of multiagent knowledge distribution: what information should be sent to whom and when with the limited resources available to each agent? Communication requirements for multiagent systems can be rather high when an accurate picture of the environment and the state of other agents must be maintained. To reduce the impact of multiagent coordination on networked systems, for example, power and bandwidth, this article introduces two concepts for the partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs): 1) action-based constraints that yield constrained-action POMDPs (CA-POMDPs) and 2) soft probabilistic constraint satisfaction for the resulting infinite-horizon controllers. To enable constraint analysis over an infinite horizon, an unconstrained policy is first represented as a finite-state controller (FSC) and optimized with policy iteration. The FSC representation then allows for a combination of the Markov chain Monte Carlo and discrete optimization to improve the probabilistic constraint satisfaction of the controller while minimizing the impact on the value function. Within the CA-POMDP framework, we then propose intelligent knowledge distribution (IKD) which yields per-agent policies for distributing knowledge between agents subject to interaction constraints. Finally, the CA-POMDP and IKD concepts are validated using an asset tracking problem where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with heterogeneous sensors collaborate to localize a ground asset to assist in avoiding unseen obstacles in a disaster area. The IKD model was able to maintain asset tracking through multiagent communications while only violating soft power and bandwidth constraints 3% of the time, while greedy and naive approaches violated constraints more than 60% of the time.

AB Integrating automated buses (ABs) into the public transport system may have potentials of providing more environment-friendly and cost-efficient mobility solutions by improving travel safety, reducing cost and decreasing congestion. However, the realization of the potentials depends not only on innovative technologies but also on users' acceptance of the ABs service. Whilst there has been a number of studies exploring the acceptance and adoption of ABs services, hardly any longitudinal studies have analyzed the long-term changes of individuals' behavior in adopting AB services. This paper aims to add knowledge on user acceptance of ABs in public transport based on empirical evidence in a real-life deployment context. Three waves of surveys that investigated users' travel attitudes and behaviors towards the automated bus were conducted at three different time points (six months, 11 months, and 14 months after the launch). The relationship between socio-demographic variables, travel experience variables, and attitude variables is modeled using structural equation modelling (SEM). Factors that influence experienced users to continue using the service were found to dynamically change over time. Initially, people were attracted to use the service if they perceived the information of the service to be sufficient, but they were demotivated to continue using the service if the comfort was worse, frequency was lower, or travel time was longer than expected. The results show that previous experience of adopting the ABs has impacts on different attitude variables. In order to promote individuals' continued use of ABs, the public transport authorities and operators should work closely to increase the frequency of the services. It is also necessary to enhance the comfort of the ABs.

ID PRIVACY
AB Intelligent transportation systems, especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are emerging as a paradigm with the potential to change modern society. However, with this, there is a strong need to ensure the security and privacy of such systems. AV ecosystems depend on machine learning algorithms to autonomously control their operations. Given the amount of personal information AVs collect, coupled with the distributed nature of such ecosystems, there is a movement to employ federated learning algorithms to develop secure decision-making models. Although federated learning is a viable candidate for data privacy, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly data poisoning attacks, where malicious vectors would be injected in the training phase. Additionally, hyperparameters play an important role in establishing an efficient federated learning model that can be resilient against adversarial attacks. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel Optimized Quantum-based Federated Learning (OQFL) framework to automatically adjust the hyperparameters of federated learning using various adversarial attacks in AV settings. This work is innovative in two ways: first, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization technique is used to update the hyperparameters of the learning rate, local and global epochs. Second, the proposed technique is utilized within a cyber defense framework to defend against adversarial attacks. The performance of the proposed framework was evaluated using two benchmark datasets: MINST and Fashion-MINST, where they include images that would be extracted from smart cameras of AVs. This framework is shown to be more resilient against various adversarial attacks compared with peer techniques.

AB Background Last-mile delivery (LMD) is becoming more and more demanding due to an increasing number of users and traffic problems in cities. Besides, medical crises (like the COVID-19 outbreak) and air pollution represent additional motives for the transition from traditional to socially and environmentally sustainable LMD mode. An emerging problem for companies in the postal and logistics industry is how to determine the best LMD mode in a multi-criteria setting under uncertainty. Method For the first time, an extension of the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product ASsessment (WASPAS) method under the picture fuzzy environment is presented to solve the LMD mode selection problem. The introduced picture fuzzy set (PFS) based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method can be highly beneficial to managers who are in charge of LMD since it can take into account the neutral/refusal information and efficiently deal with high levels of imprecise, vague, and uncertain information. The comparative analysis with the existing state-of-the-art PFS-based MCDM methods approved the high reliability of the proposed picture fuzzy WASPAS method. Its high robustness and consistency are also confirmed. The presented method can be used to improve LMD in urban areas worldwide. Besides, it can be applied to solve other emerging MCDM problems in an uncertain environment. Findings A real-life case study of Belgrade is presented to fully illustrate the potentials and applicability of the picture fuzzy WASPAS method. The results show that postomates are the best mode for LMD in Belgrade, followed by cargo bicycles, drones, traditional delivery, autonomous vehicles, and tube transport.

AB In transportation, LiDAR sensors have been primarily used in surveying and autonomous driving as a major onboard sensing device to detect field objects. Recently, with reduced price and increased demand from real-time and trajectory-level traffic detection, LiDAR technology sees great potential for becoming a mainstream means of infrastructure-based traffic detection other than only being used onboard. In addition to its many advanced features, LiDAR is much less impacted by illumination conditions compared to video sensors and significant in data processing speed, which makes it ideal for real-time traffic detection. The research team has conducted a wealth of studies to investigate the feasibility of installing LiDAR sensors at the roadside to obtain trajectories of automobiles and pedestrians at a frequency of 10 Hz. While our findings on how to process roadside LiDAR data have been presented in other literatures, this paper reveals our findings on another important issue regarding roadside LiDAR application - installation strategies to achieve the best performance. The authors first developed a theoretical approach based on the analysis of the built-in features of the applied LiDAR sensors and followed the results to install the sensors in our testbed. Then, experimental studies were conducted onsite and examined the theoretical results accordingly. As a result, a technical guidance for proper installation of LiDAR sensors at the roadside for the best real-time and trajectory-level traffic detection was produced. This study helps researchers and practitioners in better preparing for future deployment of roadside LiDAR sensors as part of the connected vehicles and infrastructures.

AB The smart city concept has attracted high research attention in recent years within diverse application domains, such as crime suspect identification, border security, transportation, aerospace, and so on. Specific focus has been on increased automation using data driven approaches, while leveraging remote sensing and real-time streaming of heterogenous data from various resources, including unmanned aerial vehicles, surveillance cameras, and low-earth-orbit satellites. One of the core challenges in exploitation of such high temporal data streams, specifically videos, is the trade-off between the quality of video streaming and limited transmission bandwidth. An optimal compromise is needed between video quality and subsequently, recognition and understanding and efficient processing of large amounts of video data. This research proposes a novel unified approach to lossy and lossless video frame compression, which is beneficial for the autonomous processing and enhanced representation of high-resolution video data in various domains. The proposed fast block matching motion estimation technique, namely mean predictive block matching, is based on the principle that general motion in any video frame is usually coherent. This coherent nature of the video frames dictates a high probability of a macroblock having the same direction of motion as the macroblocks surrounding it. The technique employs the partial distortion elimination algorithm to condense the exploration time, where partial summation of the matching distortion between the current macroblock and its contender ones will be used, when the matching distortion surpasses the current lowest error. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art techniques, including the four step search, three step search, diamond search, and new three step search.

AB Governments must keep agricultural systems free of pests that threaten agricultural production and international trade. Biosecurity surveillance already makes use of a wide range of technologies, such as insect traps and lures, geographic information systems, and diagnostic biochemical tests. The rise of cheap and usable surveillance technologies such as remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) presents value conflicts not addressed in international biosurveillance guidelines. The costs of keeping agriculture pest-free include privacy violations and reduced autonomy for farmers. We argue that physical and digital privacy in the age of ubiquitous aerial and ground surveillance is a natural right to allow people to function freely on their land. Surveillance methods must be co-created and justified through using ethically defensible processes such as discourse theory, value-centred design and responsible innovation to forge a cooperative social contract between diverse stakeholders. We propose an ethical framework for biosurveillance activities that balances the collective benefits for food security with individual privacy: (1) establish the boundaries of a biosurveillance social contract; (2) justify surveillance operations for the farmers, researchers, industry, the public and regulators; (3) give decision makers a reasonable measure of control over their personal and agricultural data; and (4) choose surveillance methodologies that give the appropriate information. The benefits of incorporating an ethical framework for responsible biosurveillance innovation include increased participation and accumulated trust over time. Long term trust and cooperation will support food security, producing higher quality data overall and mitigating against anticipated information gaps that may emerge due to disrespecting landholder rights.

AB Benthic ecosystems are chronically undersampled, particularly in environments >50 m depth. Yet a rising level of anthropogenic threats makes data collection ever more urgent. Currently, modern underwater sampling tools, particularly autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV5), are able to collect vast image data, but cannot bypass the bottleneck formed by manual image annotation. Computer vision (CV) offers a faster, more consistent, cost effective and sharable alternative to manual annotation. We used TensorFlow to evaluate the performance of the Inception V3 model with different numbers of training images, as well as assessing how many different classes (taxa) it could distinguish. Classifiers (models) were trained with increasing amounts of data (20 to 1000 images of each taxa) and increasing numbers of taxa (7 to 52). Maximum performance (0.78 sensitivity, 0.75 precision) was achieved using the maximum number of training images but little was gained in performance beyond 200 training images. Performance was also highest with the least classes in training. None of the classifiers had average performances high enough to be a suitable alternative to manual annotation. However, some classifiers performed well for individual taxa (0.95 sensitivity, 0.94 precision). Our results suggest this technology is currently best applied to specific taxa that can be reliably identified and where 200 training images offers a good compromise between performance and annotation effort. This demonstrates that CV could be routinely employed as a tool to study benthic ecology by non-specialists, which could lead to a major increase in data availability for conservation research and biodiversity management.

ID OPTIMIZATION; METHODOLOGY; ALGORITHM; NETWORK
AB The time has come for renewed emphasis on the life cycle management of the physical aspects of transportation infrastructure. The urgency for this new direction is underscored by the fact that the physical transportation network at most countries constitutes the most valuable publicly owned infrastructure and efforts must be made to keep it resilient to possible threats of man-made or natural disasters over its service life so that the movement of people and goods can continue uninterrupted to serve the economy and maintain the quality of life. The concept of transportation asset management (TAM) is a systematic process based on multiple disciplines (engineering, finance, operations research and economics), to make cost-effective repair and replacement decisions geared towards a sustained state of good repair over the infrastructure life cycle. This paper first argues for the continued application of asset management principles for transportation infrastructure in the new millennium. The paper then discusses the development cycle of transportation infrastructure as a prelude to a discussion of the key functions of an asset management system. The paper proceeds to identify the components (asset types) and elements of asset management (that is, the tasks that are carried out by an asset manager in an agency). The challenges and opportunities of asset management in the new millennium are then discussed. These include, among others, the specter of climate change, infrastructure resilience, sustainable development of transportations assets, the emerging era of autonomous vehicles and smart cities, and the consideration of transportation assets as a holistic system-of-systems. These issues are addressed in the context of the availability of big data and advances in analytical techniques and computing power.

TI Deployment Scheme for Enhancing Coverage and Connectivity in Underwater

SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS

DE Deployment; Acoustic communication; Coverage; Connectivity; Multiple

ID ABSORPTION; PLACEMENT; FORMULA
AB The deployment of an under water acoustic sensor network (UWASN) is constrained by the sensor node resources such as power, memory and processing speed, and is affected by dynamically varying channel characteristics. The sensor nodes in a static UWASN may have link breakages due to adverse channel and environmental conditions. Thus, there is a need to develop a low cost, high quality, easily deployable and self configurable platform for UWASN that will automate information collection to reduce the latency through better coverage and connectivity, and utilize the resources efficiently. This paper proposes a deployment scheme based on 3D network architecture which consists of the following major components: (1) nodes for event detection (events like, antisubmarine, chemical spill, biological hazards, etc.), (2) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for collecting information and relaying to the surface gateways (SGs), and (3) multiple SGs on the surface of sea which are responsible for collecting the information from AUVs and nodes in its vicinity, and relaying to the control center. The proposed scheme employs mathematical models that are designed based on parameters associated with underwater channel characteristics. The use of multiple AUVs and SGs enhances the coverage area of the sensor nodes and network connectivity. AUVs patrol the areas where connectivity is likely to be poor due to channel conditions. These AUVs assist in overcoming interference problems, and also does the work on behalf of the drained sensor nodes until they are repaired. The scheme is simulated for analysis of area coverage, connectivity, resource requirement, and delays for various cases of AUVs route planning. Simulation results show better coverage, connectivity, resource utility as compared to purely distributed node deployment scheme based on connected dominating set based depth computation approach.

ID CONTROL ALLOCATION
AB This study presents two fault-tolerant control (FTC) schemes for an octorotor UAV. The FTC schemes are based on an linear parameter varying system representation and utilises a combination of sliding-mode ideas and control allocation (CA) in order to take full advantage of the available redundant rotors in the octorotor configuration. A detailed synthesis procedure for the design of the two FTC schemes in the presence of uncertainty, as well as faults/failures, is presented. The first scheme is based on an online CA methodology where knowledge of the rotor effectiveness level has been used to redistribute the control signals to the healthy rotors. The second scheme assumes that this information is not available and uses a fixed CA structure even in the event of faults/failures. Although the synthesis process for the two schemes is different and they use different strategies to redistribute the control signals when faults/failures occur, both schemes involved the same baseline' (sliding-mode) controller which does not need to be reconfigured. The difference is in the final physical control law where the CA matrix is defined. Simulation results on the full non-linear octorotor model are presented for the two different schemes in the presence of uncertainty, sensor noise as well as faults/failures. The simulation results for various fault/failure scenarios show no visible degradation in state tracking performance, highlighting the potential of the proposed schemes.

AB A recombinant MVMp of the fibrotropic strain of minute virus of mice (MVMp) expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was used to infect a series of biologically relevant cultured cells, normal or tumor-derived, including normal melanocytes Versus melanoma cells, normal mammary epithelial cells versus breast adenocarcinoma cells, and normal neurons or astrocytes versus glioma cells. As a reference cell system we used normal human fibroblasts versus the SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line NB324K. After infection, we observed good expression of the reporter gene in the different tumor cell types, but only poor expression if any in the corresponding normal cells. We also constructed a recombinant MVMp expressing the green fluorescent protein reporter gene and assessed by flow cytometry the efficiency of gene transduction into the different target cells. At a multiplicity of infection of 30, we observed substantial transduction of the gene into most of the tumor cell types tested, but only marginal transduction into normal cells under the same experimental conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that a recombinant MVMp expressing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene can, in vitro, cause efficient killing of most tumor cell types in the presence of ganciclovir, whilst affecting normal proliferating cells only marginally if at all. However, in the same experimental condition, breast tumor cells appeared to be resistant to GCV-mediated cytotoxicity, possibly because these cells are not susceptible to the bystander effect. Our data suggest that MVMp-based vectors could prove useful as selective vehicles for anticancer gene therapy, particularly for in vivo delivery of cytotoxic effector genes into tumor cells.

AB Geometry-based Visual Odometry (VO) techniques are renowned in the fields of computer vision and robotics. They use methods from multi-view geometry to estimate camera motion from visual data obtained from one or more cameras. Tracking the camera motion precisely between different views is dependent on the correct estimation of correspondences between salient points of the views. In practice, geometry-based methods are found to be quite effective but do not perform well in challenging cases due to tracking failures caused by abrupt motion, occlusions, textureless and low-light scenes, etc. On the contrary, end-to-end learning from visual data using deep neural networks is an emerging area of research and deals with challenging cases successfully. Despite being computationally expensive, these methods do not outperform their counterparts in conditions favorable to geometry-based methods. Considering these facts in this work, our goal is to integrate deep descriptors to improve the correspondence between image points for tracking in a traditional geometry-based VO pipeline. We propose a simple stereo VO pipeline inspired by popular techniques found in the literature. Two conventional and four deep descriptors have been used in our experiments conducted on various image sequences of the challenging KITTI benchmark dataset. We have determined empirically that deep descriptors can effectively minimize drift in the VO estimates and produce better camera trajectories. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our VO method performs at par with the state-of-the-art works reported in the literature.

AB The Rolling Shutter (RS) mechanism is widely used in consumer-grade cameras, which are essential parts in smartphones and autonomous vehicles. RS leads to image distortion when the camera moves relative to the scene while capturing images. This effect needs to be considered in structure-from-motion, and vision-aided odometry, for which recent studies have extended Global Shutter (GS) methods to RS cameras. So far, it has been unclear how the RS affects spatiotemporal calibration of the camera in a multi-sensor system, which is crucial for good performance of aforementioned applications. This work takes the camera-IMU system as an example and looks into how the RS affects its spatiotemporal calibration. We develop a continuous-time calibration method for a RS camera-IMU system based on basis splines by using a calibration target. Considering the RS, every observation of a landmark on the target corresponds to a unique camera pose fitted by B-splines. Tests conducted on simulated data generated from public calibration datasets showed that the RS can noticeably affect accuracy of the camera extrinsic parameters, causing errors about 0.5 degrees in orientation and 2 cm in translation with a setting common to smartphone cameras. With real data collected by two industrial camera-IMU systems, we found that considering the RS effect gives more accurate and consistent spatiotemporal calibration. These tests also revealed the impact of alternative IMU models and of the continuous-time versus discrete-time representation on camera extrinsic calibration, and the degradation of visual inertial odometry by extrinsic calibration errors.

AB Communication across the water-air interface is an open research problem. A common solution is to place a relay on the water-air interface, which transmits received underwater acoustic signals to shore via electromagnetic waves. However, this solution has limitations, such as surface relays easily floating away or underwater relays becoming resource-intensive due to frequent surfacing, which make water-air communications unstable and costly. In this article, we investigate a recently proposed cross-medium communication technique, translational acoustic radio frequency (TARF) communications, in which underwater nodes can directly communicate with airborne nodes via acoustic waves and millimeter waves. For the first time, we introduce a closed-form, end-to-end channel and present its experimental validation. The high-frequency TARF communication is achievable with a frequency of up to 4.4 kHz. In the experiment deployment, underwater acoustic signals traveled as pressure waves, which produced water surface waves when they impinged on the water-air boundary. Airborne radar was employed to measure and decode these water surface waves. Experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrated that 1) the cross-medium communication channel is frequency selective and time invariant; 2) cross-medium communications with both single-carrier and multicarrier signals are feasible; and 3) high-frequency signals from 3.6 to 4.4 kHz can be detected, which was considered difficult previously. This study provides a theoretical and experimental basis for achieving cross-medium communications between deep-sea moving objects, such as autonomous underwater vehicles and airborne nodes.

AB Advanced air mobility (AAM) is a broad concept enabling consumers access to on-demand air mobility, cargo and package delivery, healthcare applications, and emergency services through an integrated and connected multimodal transportation network. However, a number of challenges could impact AAM's growth potential, such as autonomous flight, the availability of take-off and landing infrastructure (i.e., vertiports), integration into airspace and other modes of transportation, and competition with shared automated vehicles. This article discusses the results of a demand analysis examining the market potential of two potential AAM passenger markets-airport shuttles and air taxis. The airport shuttle market envisions AAM passenger service to, from, or between airports along fixed routes. The air taxi market envisions a more mature and scaled service that provides on-demand point-to-point passenger services throughout urban areas. Using a multi-method approach consisting of AAM travel demand modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and constraint analysis, this study estimates that the air taxi and airport shuttle markets could capture a 0.5% mode share. The analysis concludes that AAM could replace non-discretionary trips greater than 45 min; however, demand for discretionary trips would be limited by consumer willingness to pay. This study concludes that AAM passenger services could have a daily demand of 82,000 passengers served by approximately 4000 four- to five-seat aircraft in the U.S., under the most conservative scenario, representing an annual market valuation of 2.5 billion USD.

DE UAV swarm; Resilience; Flight coordination
AB As we witness the fast growth of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) field, new applications and services emerge at a rapid pace. Above all, the interest in groups of UAVs working together (swarms) is gaining momentum. This interest emerges since swarms are able to undertake more sophisticated tasks. Furthermore, they can also increase task performance and/or robustness. However, organizing a multi-UAV flight is not easy, involving challenges in terms of (i) swarm formation definition, (ii) takeoff procedure, (iii) in-flight coordination, (iv) communication between the swarm elements, (v) swarm layout reconfiguration, (vi) handling the loss of swarms elements, and (vii) controlled landing. These and other issues still hold back the mainstream adoption of swarms in sectors such as agriculture, border surveillance, and parcel delivery. In this work we provide solutions for two of the main critical challenges: (a) swarm layout reconfiguration, and (b) handling the loss of swarm elements. A wide set of experiments were made using our own realistic UAV emulation tool (ArduSim) in order to validate our proposals. The experiments show that the chances of facing collisions during the reconfiguration are greatly reduced even in error-prone scenarios, and that, in many cases, the loss of a UAV is handled seamlessly; otherwise (in the worst-case scenarios) a delay of just a few seconds is introduced. Additionally, this work addresses cases where, due to the lack of proper communication between the swarm elements, a swarm splits up. Experiments show that with our swarm resilience mechanisms those cases are inherently solved by creating autonomous sub-swarms which will then complete their part of the mission independently.

AB The new radio technologies (i.e. 5G and beyond) will allow a new generation of innovative services operated by vertical industries (e.g. robotic cloud, autonomous vehicles, etc.) with more stringent QoS requirements, especially in terms of end-to-end latency. Other technological changes, such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), will bring unique service capabilities to networks by enabling flexible network slicing that can be tailored to the needs of vertical services. However, effective orchestration strategies need to be put in place to offer latency minimization while also maximizing resource utilization for telco providers to address vertical requirements and increase their revenue. Looking at this objective, this paper addresses a latency-sensitive orchestration problem by proposing different strategies for the coordinated selection of virtual resources (network, computational, and storage resources) in distributed DCs while meeting vertical requirements (e.g., bandwidth demand) for network slicing. Three orchestration strategies are presented to minimize latency or the blocking probability through effective resource utilization. To further reduce the slice request blocking, orchestration strategies also encompass a retrial mechanism applied to rejected slice requests. Regarding latency, two components were considered, namely processing and network latency. An extensive set of simulations was carried out over a wide and composite telco cloud infrastructure in which different types of data centers coexist characterized by a different network location, size, and processing capacity. The results compare the behavior of the strategies in addressing latency minimization and service request fulfillment, also considering the impact of the retrial mechanism.

AB To improve the throughput performance of the autonomous guide vehicle (AGV) unmanned storage system, a two-stage mathematical model was established. The model also considers the equipment configuration of the AGV unmanned storage system and the AGV- picking stations dual resource coordination scheduling problem. In the equipment-task scheduling phase, the model aims at the shortest order completion time, while the equipment configuration and layout model aims at the minimum equipment configuration and operating cost. To solve the two-stage model, a two-layer genetic algorithm was designed. The inner layer algorithm was used to optimize the task scheduling order of AGVs and picking stations. The results of the inner layer algorithm are fed back to the outer model to optimize configuration of the equipment and the picking station's layout. The inner and outer loops are combined to obtain the optimal equipment configuration scheme. Through the simulation study of an enterprise AGV unmanned storage case, the optimal equipment configuration combination and picking stations layout scheme are obtained. Compared with the equipment configuration scheme based on the principle the task scheduling in operation is another key link that affects the picking efficiency of an unmanned warehouse of random task scheduling and the principle of shortest job time first; The model can improve the efficiency of warehouse retrieval and minimize the number of equipment configurations. Finally, the improved genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, and the performance is compared with that of LINGO to verify the effectiveness of the improved algorithm.

AB In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights, power lines are considered as one of the most threatening hazards and one of the most difficult obstacles to avoid. In recent years, many vision-based techniques have been proposed to detect power lines to facilitate self-driving UAVs and automatic obstacle avoidance. However, most of the proposed methods are typically based on a common three-step approach: (i) edge detection, (ii) the Hough transform, and (iii) spurious line elimination based on power line constrains. These approaches not only are slow and inaccurate but also require a huge amount of effort in post-processing to distinguish between power lines and spurious lines. In this paper, we introduce LS-Net, a fast single-shot line-segment detector, and apply it to power line detection. The LS-Net is by design fully convolutional, and it consists of three modules: (i) a fully convolutional feature extractor, (ii) a classifier, and (iii) a line segment regressor. Due to the unavailability of large datasets with annotations of power lines, we render synthetic images of power lines using the physically based rendering approach and propose a series of effective data augmentation techniques to generate more training data. With a customized version of the VGG-16 network as the backbone, the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the LS-Net can detect power lines in near real time. This suggests that our proposed approach has a promising role in automatic obstacle avoidance and as a valuable component of self-driving UAVs, especially for automatic autonomous power line inspection.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB The problem of autonomous transportation in industrial scenarios is receiving a renewed interest due to the way it can revolutionise internal logistics, especially in unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel architecture allowing a robot to detect, localise, and track (possibly multiple) pallets using machine learning techniques based on an on-board 2D laser rangefinder only. The architecture is composed of two main components: the first stage is a pallet detector employing a Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) detector cascaded with a CNN-based classifier; the second stage is a Kalman filter for localising and tracking detected pallets, which we also use to defer commitment to a pallet detected in the first stage until sufficient confidence has been acquired via a sequential data acquisition process. For fine-tuning the CNNs, the architecture has been systematically evaluated using a real-world dataset containing 340 labelled 2D scans, which have been made freely available in an online repository. Detection performance has been assessed on the basis of the average accuracy overk-fold cross-validation, and it scored 99.58% in our tests. Concerning pallet localisation and tracking, experiments have been performed in a scenario where the robot is approaching the pallet to fork. Although data have been originally acquired by considering only one pallet as per specification of the use case we consider, artificial data have been generated as well to mimic the presence of multiple pallets in the robot workspace. Our experimental results confirm that the system is capable of identifying, localising and tracking pallets with a high success rate while being robust to false positives.

AB Echo-integration measurements have been traditionally made from dedicated fisheries survey vessels, but extensive measurements from moorings, autonomous vehicles, and fishing vessels are increasingly available. Processing these data by traditional means developed for well-staffed fisheries surveys can be prohibitively time-consuming, which has limited their use. Automated processing methods exist to efficiently handle these large datasets; however, as compared to post-processing by trained analysts, these methods require substantial expertise and methodological development, and they often produce less certain results. Here, we evaluate the use of subsampling, which takes advantage of the spatial correlation common in many fish populations, to improve the efficiency of traditional processing methods while retaining a high level of precision. We subsampled data from an eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) acoustic-trawl survey and compared estimates of pollock backscatter from subsamples to those from the full survey. Over a survey-wide scale, processing < 5% of the data resulted in estimates within 5% of those from processing the full survey. This suggests that in some applications there may be diminishing returns associated with exhaustively processing large spatially correlated datasets. We present an example that applies this simple approach by subsampling archived echo sounder data from chartered fishing vessels to prioritize the areas surveyed in future surveys, which would not have been feasible without subsampling. When averaged values over large scales (e.g. over a survey domain) are required, precise echo integration estimates can be obtained with modest effort by processing relatively small subsamples of a dataset.

AB Object tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision since it is required in many practical applications including video-based surveillance and autonomous vehicles. One of the most challenging scenarios in the problem is when the target object is partially or even fully occluded by other objects. In such cases, most of existing trackers can fail in their task while the object is invisible. Recently, a few techniques have been proposed to tackle the occlusion problem by performing the tracking on plenoptic image sequences. Although they have shown promising results based on the refocusing capability of plenoptic images, there is still room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel focus index selection algorithm to identify an optimal focal plane where the tracking should be performed. To determine an optimal focus index, we use a focus measure to find maximally focused plane and a visual similarity to capture the plane where the target object is visible, and its appearance is distinguishably clear. We further use the selected focus index to generate proposals. Since the optimal focus index allows us to estimate the distance between the camera and the target object, we can more accurately guess the scale changes of the object in the image plane. Our proposal algorithm also takes the trajectory of the target object into account. We extensively evaluate our proposed techniques on three plenoptic image sequences by comparing them against the prior tracking methods specialized to the plenoptic image sequences. In experiments, our method provides higher accuracy and robustness over the prior art, and those results confirm that the merits of our proposed algorithms.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to understand how to secure driver supervision engagement and conflict intervention performance while using highly reliable (but not perfect) automation. Background: Securing driver engagement-by mitigating irony of automation (i.e., the better the automation, the less attention drivers will pay to traffic and the system, and the less capable they will be to resume control) and by communicating system limitations to avoid mental model misconceptions-is a major challenge in the human factors literature. Method: One hundred six drivers participated in three test-track experiments in which we studied driver intervention response to conflicts after driving highly reliable but supervised automation. After 30 min, a conflict occurred wherein the lead vehicle cut out of lane to reveal a conflict object in the form of either a stationary car or a garbage bag. Results: Supervision reminders effectively maintained drivers' eyes on path and hands on wheel. However, neither these reminders nor explicit instructions on system limitations and supervision responsibilities prevented 28% (21/76) of drivers from crashing with their eyes on the conflict object (car or bag). Conclusion: The results uncover the important role of expectation mismatches, showing that a key component of driver engagement is cognitive (understanding the need for action), rather than purely visual (looking at the threat), or having hands on wheel. Application: Automation needs to be designed either so that it does not rely on the driver or so that the driver unmistakably understands that it is an assistance system that needs an active driver to lead and share control.

AB We used an Environmentally Non-Disturbing Under-ice Robotic ANtarctic Explorer to make measurements of conductivity and temperature in Lake Bonney, a chemically stratified, permanently ice-covered Antarctic lake that abuts Taylor Glacier, an outlet glacier from the Polar Plateau. The lake is divided into two lobes - East Lobe Bonney (ELB) and West Lobe Bonney (WLB), each with unique temperature and salinity profiles. Most of our data were collected in November 2009 from WLB to examine the influence of the Taylor Glacier on the structure of the water column. Temperatures adjacent to the glacier face between 20 m and 22 m were 3 degrees C colder than in the rest of WLB, due to latent heat transfer associated with melting of the submerged glacier face and inflow of cold brines that originate beneath the glacier. Melting of the glacier face into the salinity gradient below the chemocline generates a series of nearly horizontal intrusions into WLB that were previously documented in profiles measured with 3 cm vertical resolution in 1990-1991. WLB and ELB are connected by a narrow channel through which water can be exchanged over a shallow sill that controls the position of the chemocline in WLB. A complex exchange flow appears to exist through the narrows, driven by horizontal density gradients and melting at the glacier face. Superimposed on the exchange is a net west-to-east flow generated by the higher volume of meltwater inflows to WLB. Both of these processes can be expected to be enhanced in the future as more meltwater is produced.

AB The Denmark Strait Overflow (DSO) contributes roughly half to the total volume transport of the Nordic overflows. The overflow increases its volume by entraining ambient water as it descends into the subpolar North Atlantic, feeding into the deep branch of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. In June 2012, a multiplatform experiment was carried out in the DSO plume on the continental slope off Greenland (180 km downstream of the sill in Denmark Strait), to observe the variability associated with the entrainment of ambient waters into the DSO plume. In this study, we report on two high-dissipation events captured by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) by horizontal profiling in the interfacial layer between the DSO plume and the ambient water. Strong dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy of O( 10-6) W kg(-1) was associated with enhanced small-scale temperature variance at wavelengths between 0.05 and 500 m as deduced from a fast-response thermistor. Isotherm displacement slope spectra reveal a wave number-dependence characteristic of turbulence in the inertial-convective subrange ( k1/3) at wavelengths between 0.14 and 100 m. The first event captured by the AUV was transient, and occurred near the edge of a bottom-intensified energetic eddy. Our observations imply that both horizontal advection of warm water and vertical mixing of it into the plume are eddy-driven and go hand in hand in entraining ambient water into the DSO plume. The second event was found to be a stationary feature on the upstream side of a topographic elevation located in the plume pathway. Flow-topography interaction is suggested to drive the intense mixing at this site.

AB The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) Canada is an integrative seven-year research program initiated in 2010 with academic, government, and industry partners. The team makes use of novel biotelemetry (primarily acoustic telemetry curtains), biologging, and oceanographic technologies to better understand changing ocean dynamics and their impact on ocean ecosystems, animal movements, and ecology and the dynamics of marine animal populations, many of which are commercially important. The network is organized around three ocean arenas (i.e., the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific) where specific research projects will occur. However, all projects will contribute toward addressing a single unifying national-scale question-what are the movements of continental shelf marine animals, how do these movements affect species interactions, and what are the consequences of environmental variability/change and human activities on these species' distributions and abundance? Taxa that will be tracked include diadromous (e.g., salmon, eels, sturgeon) and marine (e.g., sharks, capelin, cod) fishes and a variety of marine mammals (e.g., grey seals, killer whales). Some of the common activities that occur in all arenas include measurements of oceanographic characteristics and variability at various spatial and temporal scales, movements of key species at several trophic levels, and use of key acoustic "bioprobes" (animals that carry tags that record locations visited, ocean conditions, and interactions with other tagged animals) and "roboprobes" (remotely controlled autonomous vehicles such as gliders that measure physical, biological, and chemical conditions) to complement measurements from fixed OTN acoustic telemetry curtains. Ultimately, scientific information generated will inform resource management, help formulate new socioeconomic policies, and provide some impetus to the reformulation of governance practices and legal standards.

ID FISH SCHOOLS; MODEL; SIMULATION
AB In the context of social organisms, a school refers to a cohesive group of organisms that share a common speed and direction of motion, as well as a common axis of body alignment or polarization. Schools are also noted for the relatively fixed nearest-neighbour distances between individuals. The rules of interaction that lead to the formation and maintenance of a school structure have been explored experimentally, analytically, and by simulation. Interest in biological examples, and non-biological "self-propelled particles" such as robots, vehicles, or autonomous agents leads to the question of what are the simplest possible sets of rules that can assure the formation and the stability of the "perfect school": an aggregate in which the nearest-neighbour distances and speeds are identical.
   Here we explore mechanisms that lead to a perfect school structure in one and two dimensions. We consider distance-detection as well as velocity-detection between the interacting pairs of self-propelled particles. We construct interaction forces and formulate schooling equations. In the simplest cases, these equations have analytic solutions. In many cases, the stability of the perfect school can be explored. We then investigate how these structures form and evolve over time from various initial configurations using simulations. We study the relationship between the assumed interaction forces and the school patterns that emerge. While true biological schools are far from perfect, the insights gained from this investigation can help to understand some properties of real schools, and to suggest the appropriate properties of artificial schools where coordinated motion is desired.

AB A rapidly deployable intelligent GATEWAY buy system, capability of both air and sea deployment has been developed to aid in the navigation and communication of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The device is based around the A sized (sonobuoy) standard and is deployable from aircraft, helicopters ships and submarines using pressure and gravity launch tubes or charge activated devices. The system consists of Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) acoustic modems, both capable of providing Long Base Line (LBL) positing Global Positioning System (GPS) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and Radio Frequency (RF) communications. It utilizes a combined parachute and anchor , a low drag inflatable buoy, and an intelligent scope adjusting mooring line spool. The design based amount a fire-and-forget" methodology which, when the system is turned on and launched required no initial knowledge of the operating environment. The interoperable acoustic communication (ACOMMS) system can be operated at ranges up to 3000 meters and can achieve a true data rate of up to 860 bits-per-second using reliable spread-spectrum frequency modulation. The LBL positioning system operates sequentially and does not preclude acoustic communications Switching between protocols (FAU or WHOI) is achieved through an automated process or is requested via RF commands. The mechanical system is modular and compact. The system is capable of operating in depths between 5 m and 200 m in conditions up to sea state 3 and in currents up to 1 5 m/s. The mooning is versatile and able to hold in bottom types ranging from mud and sand to broken rock and reef.

TI Optimal RSU deployment using complex network analysis for traffic

ID ALLOCATION
AB Road Side Units (RSUs) are an integral component of Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANET) along with connected and autonomous vehicles. RSUs have been used to host numerous traffic sensing and control mechanisms to enhance transportation throughput in terms of safety, congestion avoidance, route planning, etc. In order to reduce installation and maintenance costs and associated network and security overhead, it is highly desirable to deploy these RSUs optimally, particularly in strategic and influential positions. While too many RSUs may increase overhead, too few RSUs may fail to map the entire region properly, resulting in erroneous computations. This paper aims to address this trade-off by incorporating a novel scheme called Intersection Influence Analysis System for Optimal RSU Deployment (IIA-ORD). The primary objective of IIA-ORD is achieved through modelling the transportation network as connected graphs and executing a modified K-shell and TOPSIS-based framework. Specifically, the network vertices are mapped with road intersections, and live traffic data is used to analyze various statistical measures, leading to the identification of influential junctions. Extensive performance analysis in an open-source simulation platform backed by real-time data justifies the performance superiority of the IIA-ORD system over existing RSU deployment strategies in terms of an overall number of deployed RSUs, average coverage, coverage time ratio, packet delivery ratio, and delay. The system is validated by a traffic forecasting application. The RSU is equipped with the Stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (SBi-LSTM) based traffic prediction model, under which the RSU of a particular junction predicts the traffic congestion of the entire region without the deployment of additional RSUs. Comparative analysis records high accuracy with low loss values for the proposed model in relation to the vanilla LSTM model.

AB The publish/subscribe (Pub/Sub) model offers a communication scheme that is appropriate for a variety of mobile Internet of Things (IoT) systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles). In most of these systems, ensuring the end-to-end (E2E) security of exchanged information is a critical requirement. However, the Pub/Sub scheme lacks appropriate mechanisms to ensure the E2E security, even when state-of-the-art solutions, such as transport layer security (TLS) or attribute-based encryption (ABE), were adopted. These solutions either do not offer E2E security or are infeasible to be adopted in mobile IoT systems with resource-constrained platforms. In this article, we propose a framework, so-called SEEMQTT, to ensure secure E2E Pub/Sub-based communication for mobile IoT systems. Our solution allows the publisher to encrypt the published messages and control which subscribers can decrypt these messages without violating the decoupling requirement of the Pub/Sub model. Our solution leverages multiple honest-but-curious KeyStores to store secret shares generated from a secret key using a secret sharing scheme. The links between the publisher and every KeyStores are secured using identity-based encryption (IBE). The publisher uses the secret key to encrypt published messages. Trust delegation is used to authorize certain subscribers to access these shares and consequently decrypt the published messages. We provide an Arduino-based library that implements our proposed protocol. Also, we perform an extensive performance evaluation using real IoT hardware. Experimental results show that adopting our proposed solution, SEEMQTT, makes E2E security for mobile IoT systems feasible.

AB A smart city is a city equipped with many sensors communicating with each other for different purposes. Cybersecurity and signal security are important in such cities, especially for airports and harbours. Any signal interference or attack on the navigation of autonomous vehicles and aircraft may lead to catastrophes and risks in people's lives. Therefore, it is of tremendous importance to develop wireless security networks for the localisation of any radio frequency interferer in smart cities. Time of arrival, angle of arrival, time-difference of arrivals, received signal strength and received signal strength difference (RSSD) are known observables used for the localisation of a signal interferer. Localisation means to estimate the coordinates of an interferer from some established monitoring stations and sensors receiving such measurements from an interferer. The main goal of this study is to optimise the geometric configuration of the monitoring stations using a desired dilution of precision and/or variance-covariance matrix (VCM) for the transmitter's location based on the RSSD. The required mathematical models are developed and applied to the Arlanda international airport of Sweden. Our numerical tests show that the same configuration is achieved based on dilution of precision and VCM criteria when the resolution of design is lower than 20 m in the presence of the same constraints. The choice of the pathloss exponent in the mathematical models of the RSSDs is not important for such low resolutions. Finally, optimisation based on the VCM is recommended because of its larger redundancy and flexibility in selecting different desired variances and covariances for the coordinates of the transmitter.

AB Active debris removal and unmanned on-orbit servicing missions have gained interest in the last few years, along with the possibility to perform them through the use of an autonomous chasing spacecraft. In this work, new resources are proposed to aid the implementation of guidance, navigation, and control algorithms for satellites devoted to the inspection of noncooperative targets before any proximity operation is initiated. In particular, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) performing object detection and instance segmentation is proposed, and its effectiveness in recognizing the components and parts of the target satellite is evaluated. Yet, no reliable training images dataset of this kind exists to date. A tailored and publicly available software has been developed to overcome this limitation by generating synthetic images. Computer-aided design models of existing satellites are loaded on a three-dimensional animation software and used to programmatically render images of the objects from different points of view and in different lighting conditions, together with the necessary ground truth labels and masks for each image. The results show how a relatively low number of iterations is sufficient for a CNN trained on such datasets to reach a mean average precision value in line with state-of-the-art performances achieved by CNN in common datasets. An assessment of the performance of the neural network when trained on different conditions is provided. To conclude, the method is tested on real images from the Mission Extension Vehicle-1 on-orbit servicing mission, showing that using only artificially generated images to train the model does not compromise the learning process.

AB The hydrodynamic performance of the virtual underwater vehicle under self-yaw is investigated numerically in this paper, we aim to explore the fluid laws behind this plane motion achieved by the bionic flexibility, especially the spanwise flexibility of the caudal fin. The kinematics of the chordwise flexible body and the spanwise flexible caudal fin are explored through dynamic mesh technology and user-defined functions (UDF). The 3-D Navier-Stokes equations are applied to simulate the viscid fluid surrounding the bionic dolphin. The study focuses on quantitative problems about the fluid dynamics behind the specific motion law, including speed of movement, energy loss and working efficiency. The current results show that the self-yaw can be composed of two motions, autonomous propulsion and active steering. In addition, the degree of the flexible caudal fin can produce different yaw effects. The chordwise phase difference. is dominant in the propulsion function, while the spanwise phase difference dhas a more noticeable effect on the steering function. The pressure distribution on the surface of the dolphin and the wake vortex generated in the flow field reasonably reveal the evolution of self-yaw. It properly turns out that the dolphin can combine the spanwise flexible caudal fin and the chordwise flexible body to achieve self-yaw motion. (c) 2021 Shanghai Jiaotong University.

AB Research Summary Nightly confrontations occurred between protestors and officers outside of the Seattle Police Department's (SPD's) East precinct in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder. On June 8, 2020, the SPD abandoned the East precinct in an attempt to calm the situation. Following closure of the precinct, the Capitol Hill Occupation Protest (CHOP) took hold in the surrounding 6-block area. The CHOP occupation lasted until July 1, 2020. Over this time period, CHOP operated as an autonomous zone, with police officers not patrolling and generally not responding to calls for police service within the area. We used the microsynthetic control group method to analyze the effect of CHOP on crime during the 24-day occupation. Results indicate crime significantly increased in the CHOP zone, the encompassing two-block area, and the overall East precinct service area. Policy Implications The current study found comparatively stronger effects than the general literature on depolicing. The significant crime increase is particularly noteworthy given the short time frame of the CHOP occupation and retreat of police from the area theoretically making it more challenging for crimes to be reported by citizens and/or proactively discovered by officers. This suggests that police abolition, the most extreme form of the police defunding movement, may significantly compromise public safety. Moving forward, a prudent policy solution may be to simultaneously support the evidence-based crime prevention work of police and community-based institutions. Such an approach may achieve currently desired policing reforms without risking crime spikes that can result from drastic reductions of police presence. Wide-scale adoption of evidence-based policing may provide a vehicle for such meaningful, long-term reform.

AB This study presents a mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled UAV communication system, where a number of UAVs are served by terrestrial base stations (TBSs) equipped with computation resource in the non-orthogonal multiple access manner. Each UAV has to offload its computing tasks to the proper TBS due to the limited energy supply. For this, the authors aim at minimising the sum of transmission energy of UAVs and computation energy of TBSs through jointly optimising the UAV transmit power, computation resource allocation, and UAV grouping. Considering the non-convexity of this optimisation problem, they obtain the optimal solution in the coupled steps: the convex resource allocation optimisation and the combinatorial UAV grouping optimisation. By exploiting the convex nature of the resource allocation optimisation problem, they obtain the optimal transmit power and computation allocation based on the KKT conditions and the idea of gradient descent method when considering a single TBS. Then, they adopt the simulated annealing to obtain the optimal UAV grouping and TBS selection based on the proposed resource allocation optimisation algorithm. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed joint optimisation of transmit power, computation resource allocation, and UAV grouping can effectively reduce the energy consumption of MEC-aware UAV communication system.

ID TRACKING
AB In this paper, mm-Pose, a novel approach to detect and track human skeletons in real-time using an mmWave radar, is proposed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first method to detect >15 distinct skeletal joints using mmWave radar reflection signals. The proposed method would find several applications in traffic monitoring systems, autonomous vehicles, patient monitoring systems and defense forces to detect and track human skeleton for effective and preventive decision making in real-time. The use of radar makes the system operationally robust to scene lighting and adverse weather conditions. The reflected radar point cloud in range, azimuth and elevation are first resolved and projected in Range-Azimuth and Range-Elevation planes. A novel low-size high-resolution radar-to-image representation is also presented, that overcomes the sparsity in traditional point cloud data and offers significant reduction in the subsequent machine learning architecture. The RGB channels were assigned with the normalized values of range, elevation/azimuth and the power level of the reflection signals for each of the points. A forked CNN architecture was used to predict the real-world position of the skeletal joints in 3-D space, using the radar-to-image representation. The proposed method was tested for a single human scenario for four primary motions, (i) Walking, (ii) Swinging left arm, (iii) Swinging right arm, and (iv) Swinging both arms to validate accurate predictions for motion in range, azimuth and elevation. The detailed methodology, implementation, challenges, and validation results are presented.

ID VIDEO DISSEMINATION
AB Collaboration between multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to establish a Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) is a growing trend since future applications claim for more autonomous and rapidly deployable systems. In this context, Software-Defined Networking FANET (SDN-FANET ) separates the control and data plane and provides network programmability, which considers a centralized controller to perform all FANET control functions based on global UAV context information, such as UAV positions, movement trajectories, residual energy, and others. However, control message dissemination in an SDN-FANET with low overhead and high performance is not a trivial task due to FANET particular characteristics, i.e., high mobility, failures in UAV to UAV communication, and short communication range. With this in mind, it is essential to predict UAV information for control message dissemination as well as consider hierarchical network architecture, reducing bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead. In this article, we present a Cluster-bAsed control Plane messages management in sOftware-defined flying ad-hoc NEtwork, called CAPONE. Based on UAV contextual information, the controller can predict UAV information without control message transmission. In addition, CAPONE divides the FANET into groups by computing the number of clusters using the Gap statistics method, which is input for a Fuzzy C-means method to determine the group leader and members. In this way, CAPONE reduces the bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead, while guaranteeing the control message delivering in FANET scenarios. Extensive simulations are used to show the gains of the CAPONE in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio, overhead, and energy compared to existing SDN-FANET architectures.

AB Unlike high-end three-dimensional (3-D) scanners with more than 16 layers which are mainly used in academia, low-end 3-D scanners with a few layers are being developed by sensor makers for installation in commercial advanced driver assistance system. The output of a low-end 3-D scanner is completely different from that of a full 3-D scanner and it is rather similar to the output of a 2-D scanner with a single layer. In this paper, a new framework for moving object detection and subsequent tracking using a low-end 3-D scanner with four layers is proposed. The proposed method uses the contours of the objects to obtain a robust association between a detection and a tracking. The proposed method comprises five steps: preprocessing, contour extraction, hypothesis generation, pruning, and moving object detection. In the preprocessing step, outliers, such as the ground or backlights from preceding vehicles, are removed and the scanned points are decomposed into segments, each of which corresponds to a single object. In the track hypothesis generation step, each segment is associated with an existing track maintained over multiple scans. The association method developed here uses the contour shape of the segments and is motivated by the linear programming and dynamic time warping. In the track hypothesis pruning step, unlikely tracks are removed from the hypothesis trees based on the proposed hypothesis scores. In the last step, moving objects are detected based on the track velocity. The proposed method is applied to four challenging real-world scenarios, and its validity is demonstrated via experimentation.

AB Our aim in the EU funded JERICO project was to develop a flexible and scalable imaging platform that could be used in the widest possible set of ecological situations. Depending on research objectives, both image acquisition and analysis procedures may indeed differ. Up to now the attempts for automating image analysis procedures have consisted of the development of pieces of software specifically designed for a given objective. This led to the conception of a new software: AVIExplore. Its general architecture and its three constitutive modules: AVIExplore - Mobile, AVIExplore - Fixed and AVIExplore - ScriptEdit are presented. AVIExplore provides a unique environment for video analysis. Its main features include: (1) image selection tools allowing for the division of videos in homogeneous sections, (2) automatic extraction of targeted information, (3) solutions for long-term time-series as well as large spatial scale image acquisition, (4) real time acquisition and in some cases real time analysis, and (5) a large range of customized image-analysis possibilities through a script editor. The flexibility of use of AVIExplore is illustrated and validated by three case studies: (1) coral identification and mapping, (2) identification and quantification of different types of behaviors in a mud shrimp, and (3) quantification of filtering activity in a passive suspension-feeder. The accuracy of the software is measured comparing with visual assessment. It is: 90.2%, 82.7%, and 98.3% for the three case studies, respectively. Some of the advantages and current limitations of the software as well as some of its foreseen advancements are then briefly discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Automatic methods are needed to efficiently process the large point clouds collected using a mobile laser scanning (MLS) system for surveying applications. Machine-learning-based object recognition from MLS point clouds in a road and street environment was studied in order to create maps from the road environment infrastructure. The developed automatic processing workflow included the following phases: the removal of the ground and buildings, segmentation, segment classification, and object location estimation. Several novel geometry-based features, which were previously applied in autonomous driving and general point cloud processing, were applied for the segment classification of MLS point clouds. The features were divided into three sets, i.e., local descriptor histograms (LDHs), spin images, and general shape and point distribution features, respectively. These were used in the classification of the following roadside objects: trees, lamp posts, traffic signs, cars, pedestrians, and hoardings. The accuracy of the object recognition workflow was evaluated using a data set that contained more than 400 objects. LDHs and spin images were applied for the first time for machine-learning-based object classification in MLS point clouds in the surveying applications of the road and street environment. The use of these features improved the classification accuracy by 9.6% (resulting in 87.9% accuracy) compared with the accuracy obtained using 17 general shape and point distribution features that represent the current state of the art in the field of MLS; therefore, significant improvement in the classification accuracy was achieved. Connected component segmentation and ground extraction were the cause of most of the errors and should be thus improved in the future.

AB The thick permanent ice cover on the lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, inhibits spatial lake sampling due to logistical constraints of penetrating the ice cover. To date most sampling of these lakes has been made at only a few sites with the assumption that there is a spatial homogeneity of the physical and biogeochemical properties of the ice cover and the water column at any given depth. To test this underlying assumption, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was deployed in Lake Bonney, Taylor Valley. Measurements were obtained over the course of 2 years in a 100 x 100 m horizontal sampling grid (at a 0.2 m vertical resolution). Additionally, the AUV measured the ice thickness (in water equivalent) and collected images looking up through the ice, which were used to quantify sediment distribution on the surface and within the ice. Satellite imagery was used to map sediment distribution on the surface of the ice. We present results of the spatial investigation of the sediment distribution on the ice cover and its effects on biological processes, with particular emphasis on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The surface sediment is a secondary controller of the ice cover thickness, which in turn controls the depth-integrated PAR in the water column. Our data revealed that depth-integrated PAR was negatively correlated with depth-integrated chlorophyll-a (r = 0.88, p < 0.001, n = 83), which appears to be related to short-term photoadaptation of phytoplanktonic communities to spatial and temporal variation in PAR within the water column.

AB In this work we evaluate the use of several real-time dense stereo algorithms as a passive 3D sensing technology for potential use as part of a driver assistance system or autonomous vehicle guidance. A key limitation in prior work in this area is that although significant comparative work has been done on dense stereo algorithms using de facto laboratory test sets only limited work has been done on evaluation in real world environments such as that found in potential automotive usage. This comparative study aims to provide an empirical comparison using automotive environment video imagery and compare this against dense stereo results drawn on standard test sequences in addition to considering the computational requirement against performance in real-time. We evaluate five chosen algorithms: Block Matching, Semi-Global Matching, No-Maximal Disparity, Cross-Based Local Approach, Adaptive Aggregation with Dynamic Programming. Our comparison shows a contrast between the results obtained on standard test sequences and those for automotive application imagery where a Semi-Global Matching approach gave the best empirical performance. From our study we can conclude that the noise present in automotive applications, can impact the quality of the depth information output from more complex algorithms (No-Maximal Disparity, Cross-Based Local Approach, Adaptive Aggregation with Dynamic Programming) resulting that in practice the disparity maps produced are comparable with those of simpler approaches such as Block Matching and Semi-Global Matching which empirically perform better in the automotive environment test sequences. This empirical result on automotive environment data contradicts the comparative result found on standard dense stereo test sequences using a statistical comparison methodology leading to interesting observations regarding current relative evaulation approaches.

TI Design considerations for oceanographic research vessels
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL

DT Article
AB As the oceanographic research vessel community prepares for updating its fleet of research vessels, they must consider vessel designs that improve the capability of the fleet to support science in the near and long-term. Advances in informational technologies have changed the "instruments" of science and resulted in the ability to study ocean processes in smaller time and space scales than before. While, networked structures on the ocean floor, remote sensing, and autonomous vehicles will allow oceanographers to synoptically measure the environment, skips will remain the "host-platforms" for such research. However, deployment and recovery of such systems, requires that future designs incorporate capabilities for increased speed, seakeeping, acoustic quietness, efficient power management systems, and lifecycle considerations. Consideration of such issues in the design phases will allow for the development of a technologically advanced ship that can serve the research community in the near and long-term.
   A major aspect of oceanography through the decades has been the availability of research vessels for science. However, the access to and the capability of such vessels under the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System, (UNOLS) must not be taken for granted. Changes in the oceanographer's ability to make measurements at smaller and smaller sampling scales are brought on by advents in computational and information technologies. These changes necessitate that the researcher's "host-platform" evolves to handle these new observing systems. Mis evolution can include, but is not limited to speed, seakeeping, efficient skip power arrangements, and acoustic quietness. While each subject can be the focus of detailed individual papers, this article presents a general discussion on four elements of oceanographic research vessel design-hull concepts, power systems, acoustics, and life cycle management.

TI Mask-VRDet: A robust riverway panoptic perception model based on dual

   convolution network; Radar clutter removal
AB With the development of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), the perception of inland waterways has become significant to autonomous navigation. RGB cameras can capture images with rich semantic features, but they would fail in adverse weather and at night. As a perception sensor that has initially emerged in recent years, 4D millimeter-wave radar (4D mmWave radar) can work in all weather and has more abundant point -cloud features than ordinary radar, but it also suffers from water-surface clutter seriously. Furthermore, the shape and outline of dense point cloud captured by 4D mmWave radar are irregular. CNN-based neural networks treat features as 2D rectangle grids, which excessively favor image modality and are unfriendly to radar modality. Therefore, we transform both features of image and radar into non-Euclidean space as graph structures. In this paper, we focus on robust panoptic perception in inland waterways. Firstly, we propose the first Clutter-Point-Removal (CPR) algorithm for 4D mmWave radar, removing water-surface clutter and improving the recall of radar targets. Secondly, we propose a high-performance panoptic perception model based on the graph neural network called Mask-VRDet, fusing features of vision and radar to simultaneously perform object detection and semantic segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, Mask-VRDet is the first riverway panoptic perception model based on vision-radar graphical fusion. It outperforms other single-modal and fusion models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on our collected dataset. We release our code at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/Mask-VRDet-Official.

AB This paper constructs a NOMA-based UAV-assisted Cellular Offloading (UACO) framework and designs a UAV path selection and resource offloading algorithm (UPRA) based on deep reinforcement learning. This paper focuses on the coupling relationship between path selection and resource offloading during the movement of UAVs. A joint optimization problem between UAV three-dimensional path design and resource offloading is proposed, considering the UAV's autonomous obstacle avoidance in complex environments and the influence of obstacles in 3D space on the channel model. In particular, a constrained clustering-assignment algorithm is designed by improving the K-means algorithm and combining it with the assignment algorithm in order to achieve periodic clustering of random motion users and UAV task assignment. In addition, a semi fixed hierarchical power allocation algorithm is embedded in the designed DQN algorithm to improve the convergence performance of the learning algorithm in this paper. Simulation results show that: the NOMAbased design is able to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency and communication throughput of the UAV network system. Compared with the artificial potential field, the proposed algorithm is able to solve the problem of falling into suboptimal solutions in path selection and improve the communication throughput. In addition, this paper explores the impact of the reward function on the training convergence and the results in deep reinforcement learning. The excellent adaptability of the designed algorithm in dynamic networks as well as in complex environments is demonstrated by random deployment of users and varying the maximum user movement speed.

AB A lane-level intersection map is a cornerstone in high-definition (HD) traffic network maps for autonomous driving and high-precision intelligent transportation systems applications such as traffic management and control, and traffic accident evaluation and prevention. Mapping an HD intersection is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive with conventional methods. In this paper, we used a low-channel roadside light detection and range sensor (LiDAR) to automatically and dynamically generate a lane-level intersection, including the signal phases, geometry, layout, and lane directions. First, a mathematical model was proposed to describe the topology and detail of a lane-level intersection. Second, continuous and discontinuous traffic object trajectories were extracted to identify the signal phases and times. Third, the layout, geometry, and lane direction were identified using the convex hull detection algorithm for trajectories. Fourth, a sliding window algorithm was presented to detect the lane marking and extract the lane, and the virtual lane connecting the inbound and outbound of the intersection were generated using the vehicle trajectories within the intersection and considering the traffic rules. In the field experiment, the mean absolute estimation error is 2 s for signal phase and time identification. The lane marking identification Precision and Recall are 96% and 94.12%, respectively. Compared with the satellite-based, MMS-based, and crowdsourcing-based lane mapping methods, the average lane location deviation is 0.2 m and the update period is less than one hour by the proposed method with low-channel roadside LiDAR.

AB Accurate control interfaces and high-sensitive tactile sensing are essential for normal and efficient operation of intelligent robots. Despite most research focus on human-machine interface (HMI), little attention is paid to autonomous control interface of the robots. Simultaneous achievement of both accurate control interface and tactile array sensing in one device has been a fundamental challenge in developing intelligent robots. Herein, one device integrated by two different working-mode laser-induced graphene (LIG)-based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is developed to achieve simultaneously its accurate wireless control and tactile pattern recognition capability. Based on the same triboelectric effect, both the rolling of nylon pellet on the poly (vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoro propylene) (PVDF-HFP) concave surface and the touching on the tactile pattern recognition array can excite the LIG electrodes to generate voltage outputs, which can be further employed for accurate wireless control and real-time tactile sensing (pressure sensitivity of 2.2 V/kPa within 0-2.8 kPa), respectively. When combining with a microprocessor, the accurate control interface layer based on eight parallel freestanding interdigital electrode-based TENGs on a concave cavity of silicone rubber can wirelessly operate motion direction of a miniature car as a proof-of-concept. Meanwhile, the tactile imaging of an 8 x 8 sensing array based on single-electrode TENG can successfully achieve tactile pattern recognition. Consequently, the multifunctional device integrated by two different LIG-based TENGs has achieved simultaneously accurate wireless control and sensitive tactile pattern recognition, which would demonstrate a promising application in metaverse, unmanned vehicles, and intelligent robots.

ID PLASTIC WASTE
AB Ending water pollution is urgent for environmental recovery globally. Floating litter cleaning up solution, as an essential strategy for reducing pollution, is formulated in a few studies. In autonomous waste collection systems like unmanned surface vehicles (USV), floating litter cleaning up is very challenging on natural water surfaces due to the complex environmental factors seriously degrading litter detection accuracy, lowering efficiency, or even causing the failure of collection. The impact of the cleaning-up solution on environmental recovery has yet to be discussed. To fill knowledge gaps, we propose an accurate and adaptable deep learning solution based on Faster RCNN to address this challenge through the first-time implementation of the attention mechanism at the C3 stage of ResNet50 to effectively extract the useful feature information and compress the negative influence of the complex environmental factors. We here first discuss the effectiveness of our cleaning-up solution in water pollution-reducing and waste recycling for resource-saving, to the best of our knowledge. The extensive exper-imental results on our self-built dataset show that our solution is superior to the state of the arts in the accuracy and adaptability of floating litter detection under the different complex scenes. Our solution improves the effectiveness of floating waste collection a lot. It significantly contributes to pollution mitigation, ecosystem, resource-saving, and human health. It is suggested that stakeholders should pay more attention to improving cleaning-up solutions. This work strives to shed light on it based on deep learning for environmental recovery and sustainability.

DE Image deraining; Raindrop removal; Generative adversarial network; Deep
   Raindrops dataset
ID WINDSHIELD; WEATHER
AB Image deraining is a new challenging problem in real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles. In a bad weather condition of heavy rainfall, raindrops, mainly hitting glasses or windshields, can significantly reduce observation ability. Moreover, raindrops spreading over the glass can yield refraction's physical effect, which seriously impedes the sightline or undermine machine learning systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced generative adversarial network to deal with the challenging problems of raindrops. UnfairGAN is an enhanced generative adversarial network that can utilize prior high-level information, such as edges and rain estimation, to boost deraining performance. UnfairGAN can effectively conserve the essential details caused by heavy raindrops and remove artifacts caused by the instability of training the discriminator. This method is based on three main primary advantages. First, UnfairGAN consists of an advanced loss function of the discriminator that can improve the instabilities of traditional GAN. Second, UnfairGAN comprises a new advanced activation function that is able to increase the learning effectiveness of image classification and reconstruction. Finally, UnfairGAN is basically built on a new end-to-end cascade network, namely DRD-UNet, used to probe hierarchical features for image restoration effectively. When evaluating competing methods on the well-known Raindrop dataset, we achieve a peak signal-to-noise ratio value of 31.56 while retaining the essential details in the image. Besides, we introduce a new large image dataset (DeepRaindrops) for training deep learning networks of removing raindrops. In this dataset, our proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches of deraining raindrops regarding quantitative metrics and visual quality. Our source codes for UnfairGAN are available at https://github.com/ZeroZero19/UnfairGAN.git.

AB Driven by the ever-growing diversity of software and hardware agents available on the market, Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, functioning as heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs), are increasingly required to provide a level of reliability and fault tolerance. In this paper, we develop an approach to generalized quantifiable modeling of fault-tolerant and reliable MAS. We propose a novel software architectural model, the Intelligence Transfer Model (ITM), by which intelligence can be transferred between agents in a heterogeneous MAS. In the ITM, we propose a novel mechanism, the latent acceptable state, which enables it to achieve improved levels of fault tolerance and reliability in task-based redundancy systems, as used in the ITM, in comparison with existing agent-based redundancy approaches. We demonstrate these improvements through experimental testing of the ITM using an open-source candidate implementation of the model, developed in Python, and through an open-source simulator that tested the behavior of ITM-based MASs at scale. The results of these experiments demonstrated improvements in fault tolerance and reliability across all MAS configurations we tested. Fault tolerance was observed to improve by a factor of between 1.27 and 6.34 in comparison with the control group, depending on the ITM configuration tested. Similarly, reliability was observed to improve by a factor of between 1.00 and 4.73. Our proposed model has broad applicability to various IoT applications and generally in MASs that have fault tolerance or reliability requirements, such as in cloud computing and autonomous vehicles.

AB In face of the high complexity of modern systems and the increasing reliance on technology, the strategies and methods to evaluate the integrity of systems and the information they provide are of great importance. The use of sensors to provide important information in various applications has become ubiquitous, which puts more pressure on the accuracy of sensor measurements. In the navigation field, in particular, the integrity of positioning information provided by sensors can be critical, as failures can lead to fatalities and catastrophic damages. Extensive research has been done into methods to assess and improve the integrity of positioning information provided by GNSS receivers, led by the high safety requirements in the aviation field. More recently, a shift into the research of integrity solutions suitable for the challenging positioning requirements of autonomous vehicles in urban environment has been a trend. There have been extensive advancements in developing integrity monitoring algorithms for GNSS and navigation in general. However, these methods have not been sufficiently extended into other types of sensors, and the development of integrity methods outside the navigation field have been scarce and scattered. This work aims to provide an overview of recent advances in the integrity monitoring field, including research outside the navigation domain. The goal is to give an introduction to the integrity monitoring concept to a broader audience, as these techniques have been highly specialized by GNSS experts and navigation related research, fostering multi-disciplinary approaches and creative use of existing methods in different areas and applications.

AB Drones are receiving popularity with time due to their advanced mobility. Although they were initially deployed for military purposes, they now have a wide array of applications in various public and private sectors. Further deployment of drones can promote the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though drones offer a number of advantages, they have limited flying time and weight carrying capacity. Effective drone schedules may assist with overcoming such limitations. Drone scheduling is associated with optimization of drone flight paths and may include other features, such as determination of arrival time at each node, utilization of drones, battery capacity considerations, and battery recharging considerations. A number of studies on drone scheduling have been published over the past years. However, there is a lack of a systematic literature survey that provides a holistic overview of the drone scheduling problem, existing tendencies, main research limitations, and future research needs. Therefore, this study conducts an extensive survey of the scientific literature that assessed drone scheduling. The collected studies are grouped into different categories, including general drone scheduling, drone scheduling for delivery of goods, drone scheduling for monitoring, and drone scheduling with recharge considerations. A detailed review of the collected studies is presented for each of the categories. Representative mathematical models are provided for each category of studies, accompanied by a summary of findings, existing gaps in the state-of-the-art, and future research needs. The outcomes of this research are expected to assist the relevant stakeholders with an effective drone schedule design.

AB For smart mobility, and autonomous vehicles (AV), it is necessary to have a very precise perception of the environment to guarantee reliable decision-making, and to be able to extend the results obtained for the road sector to other areas such as rail. To this end, we introduce a new single-stage monocular real-time 3D object detection convolutional neural network (CNN) based on YOLOv5, dedicated to smart mobility applications for both road and rail environments. To perform the 3D parameter regression, we replace YOLOv5's anchor boxes with our hybrid anchor boxes. Our method is available in different model sizes such as YOLOv5: small, medium, and large. The new model that we propose is optimized for real-time embedded constraints (lightweight, speed, and accuracy) that takes advantage of the improvement brought by split attention (SA) convolutions called small split attention model (Small-SA). To validate our CNN model, we also introduce a new virtual dataset for both road and rail environments by leveraging the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV). We provide extensive results of our different models on both KITTI and our own GTAV datasets. Through our results, we show that our method is the fastest available 3D object detection with accuracy results close to state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI road dataset. We further demonstrate that the pre-training process on our GTAV virtual dataset improves the accuracy on real datasets such as KITTI, thus allowing our method to obtain an even greater accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches with 16.16% 3D average precision on hard car detection with inference time of 11.1 ms/image on an RTX 3080 GPU.

AB The number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones) has increased dramatically in the airspace worldwide for tasks such as surveillance, reconnaissance, shipping and delivery. However, a small number of them, acting maliciously, can raise many security risks. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities for object detection can be very useful for the identification and classification of drones flying in the airspace and, in particular, are a good solution against malicious drones. A number of counter-drone solutions are being developed, but the cost of drone detection ground systems can also be very high, depending on the number of sensors deployed and powerful fusion algorithms. We propose a low-cost counter-drone solution composed uniquely by a guard-drone that should be able to detect, locate and eliminate any malicious drone. In this paper, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm is used to train the system to detect drones. Three existing object detection models are improved by transfer learning and tested for real-time drone detection. Training is done with a new dataset of drone images, constructed automatically from a very realistic flight simulator. While flying, the guard-drone captures random images of the area, while at the same time, a malicious drone is flying too. The drone images are auto-labelled using the location and attitude information available in the simulator for both drones. The world coordinates for the malicious drone position must then be projected into image pixel coordinates. The training and test results show a minimum accuracy improvement of 22% with respect to state-of-the-art object detection models, representing promising results that enable a step towards the construction of a fully autonomous counter-drone system.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is redefining how we exist in the world. In almost every sector of society, AI is performing tasks with super-human speed and intellect; from the prediction of stock market trends to driverless vehicles, diagnosis of disease, and robotic surgery. Despite this growing success, the pharmaceutical field is yet to truly harness AI. Development and manufacture of medicines remains largely in a 'one size fits all' paradigm, in which mass-produced, identical formulations are expected to meet individual patient needs. Recently, 3D printing (3DP) has illuminated a path for on-demand production of fully customisable medicines. Due to its flexibility, pharmaceutical 3DP presents innumerable options during formulation development that generally require expert navigation. Leveraging AI within pharmaceutical 3DP removes the need for human expertise, as optimal process parameters can be accurately predicted by machine learning. AI can also be incorporated into a pharmaceutical 3DP 'Internet of Things', moving the personalised production of medicines into an intelligent, streamlined, and autonomous pipeline. Supportive infrastructure, such as The Cloud and blockchain, will also play a vital role. Crucially, these technologies will expedite the use of pharmaceutical 3DP in clinical settings and drive the global movement towards personalised medicine and Industry 4.0.

DT Article
DE Ellipsoidal calculus; Firey p-sum; optimal ellipsoid; outer
   approximation; reach sets
AB In this article the problem of ellipsoidal bounding of convex set-valued data, where the convex set is obtained by the p-sum of finitely many ellipsoids, for any real p >= 1 is studied. The notion of p-sum appears in the Brunn-Minkowski-Firey theory in convex analysis, and generalizes several well-known set-valued operations, such as the Minkowski sum of the summand convex sets (here, ellipsoids). We derive an outer ellipsoidal parameterization for the p-sum of a given set of ellipsoids, and compute the tightest such parameterization for two optimality criteria: minimum trace and minimum volume. For such optimal parameterizations, several known results in the systemcontrol literature are recovered as special cases of our general formula. For the minimum volume criterion, our analysis leads to a fixed point recursion over a scalar that parameterizes the shape matrix of the outer ellipsoid. This recursion is proved to be contractive, and found to converge fast in practice. We apply these results to compute the forward reach sets for a linear control system subject to different convex set-valued uncertainty models for the initial condition and control, generated by varying p. [1,8]. Our numerical results show that the proposed fixed point algorithm offers more than two orders of magnitude speedup in computational time for p = 1, compared to the existing semidefinite programming approach without significant effect on the numerical accuracy. For p > 1, the reach set computation results reported here are novel. Our results are expected to be useful in real-time safety critical applications, such as decision making, for collision avoidance of autonomous vehicles, where the computational time scale for reach set calculation needs to be much smaller than the vehicular dynamics time scale.

AB Finding geometric primitives in 3D point clouds is a fundamental task in many engineering applications such as robotics, autonomous-vehicles and automated industrial inspection. Among all solid shapes, cylinders are frequently found in a variety of scenes, comprising natural or man-made objects. Despite their ubiquitous presence, automated extraction and fitting can become challenging if performed "in-the-wild", when the number of primitives is unknown or the point cloud is noisy and not oriented.
   In this paper we pose the problem of extracting multiple cylinders in a scene by means of a Game-Theoretic inlier selection process exploiting the geometrical relations between pairs of axis candidates. First, we formulate the similarity between two possible cylinders considering the rigid motion aligning the two axes to the same line. This motion is represented with a unitary dual-quaternion so that the distance between two cylinders is induced by the length of the shortest geodesic path in SE(3). Then, a Game-Theoretical process exploits such similarity function to extract sets of primitives maximizing their inner mutual consensus. The outcome of the evolutionary process consists in a probability distribution over the sets of candidates (ie axes), which in turn is used to directly estimate the final cylinder parameters. An extensive experimental section shows that the proposed algorithm offers a high resilience to noise, since the process inherently discards inconsistent data. Compared to other methods, it does not need point normals and does not require a fine tuning of multiple parameters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Driven by rising consumer demand, interest is growing in the application of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for the last-mile delivery of small express packages and fast-food meals in cities. To be realised, this would require the Very Low Level (VLL) urban airspace to be able to cope with high traffic densities of commercial delivery drones. The potential benefits of such novel drone-based applications are a reduction of traffic congestion in cities, lower greenhouse gas emissions and more efficient transportation operations. To help realise this concept, programs such as U-Space, the unmanned traffic management system for Europe, are developing important services such as deconfliction management and dynamic capacity management. However, for several of these services, design choices will depend on how, and how extensive they will be used. It therefore becomes important to estimate how many delivery drones would operate in a typical city. This paper aims to provide an estimate by establishing a framework to determine the traffic demand for express drone-based package delivery of five European countries. In addition, a detailed case-study is presented for determining traffic density of express package drone delivery for Paris metropolitan area in order to assess the feasibility from a user's perspective. The paper also discusses the potential of fast-food meal delivery drones compared to traditional delivery modes for Paris. Results suggest that hourly traffic densities culminating from express package and fast-food meal delivery drones will exceed today's global commercial aircraft traffic of 10,000 per day by more than six-fold for just one potential metropolitan city.

AB In recent years, we developed a small, unmanned aerial system (UAS) called OVLI-TA (Objet Volant Leger Instrumente-Turbulence Atmospherique) dedicated to atmospheric boundary layer research, in Toulouse (France). The device has a wingspan of 2.60 m and weighed 3.5 kg, including payload. It was essentially developed to investigate turbulence in a way complementary to other existing measurement systems, such as instrumented towers/masts. OVLI-TA's instrumental package includes a 5-hole probe on the nose of the airplane to measure attack and sideslip angles, a Pitot probe to measure static pressure, a fast inertial measurement unit, a GPS receiver, as well as temperature and moisture sensors in specific housings. In addition, the Pixhawk autopilot is used for autonomous flights. OVLI-TA is capable of profiling wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and humidity up to 1 km altitude, in addition to measuring turbulence. After wind tunnel calibrations, flight tests were conducted in March 2016 in Lannemezan (France), where there is a 60-m tower equipped with turbulence sensors. In July 2016, OVLI-TA participated in the international project DACCIWA (Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Clouds Interactions in West Africa), in Benin. Comparisons of the OVLI-TA observations with both the 60 m tower measurements and the radiosonde profiles showed good agreement for the mean values of wind, temperature, humidity, and turbulence parameters. Moreover, it validated the capacity of the drone to sample wind fluctuations up to a frequency of around 10 Hz, which corresponds to a spatial resolution of the order of 1 m.

TI A Relationship Between Sweep Angle of Flapping Pectoral Fins and Thrust

AB Propulsive capability of manta rays' flapping pectoral fins has inspired many to incorporate these fins as propulsive mechanisms for autonomous underwater vehicles. In particular, geometrical factors such as sweep angle have been postulated as being influential to these fins' propulsive capability, specifically their thrust generation. Although effects of sweep angle on static/flapping wings of aircrafts/drones have been widely studied, little has been done for underwater conditions. Furthermore, the findings from air studies may not be relatable to the underwater studies on pectoral fins because of the different Reynolds number (compared to the flapping wings) and force generation mechanism (compared to the static wings). This paper aims to establish a relationship between the sweep angle and thrust generation. An experiment was conducted to measure the thrust generated by 40 fins in a water channel under freestream and still water conditions for chord Reynolds number between 2.2 x 10(4) and 8.2 x 10(4). The fins were of five different sweep angles (0 deg, 10 deg, 20 deg, 30 deg, and 40 deg) that were incorporated into eight base designs of different flexibility characteristics. The results showed that the sweep angle (within the range considered) may have no significant influence on these fins' thrust generation, implying no significant effects on thrust under uniform flow condition and on the maximum possible thrust under still water. Overall, it can be concluded that sweep angle may not be a determinant of thrust generation for flapping pectoral fins. This knowledge can ease the decision-making process of design of robots propeled by these fins.

AB In the heterogeneous cloud radio access network (H-CRAN), which consists of multiple access points (APs) providing smaller coverage and a high power node (HPN) providing ubiquitous coverage, the mobile machines can connect to multiple APs and HPN by coordinated multi-point transmission (CoMP) concurrently to achieve ultra-reliable and low-latency communication. However, the current network association (or priorly known as handovers), which only focuses on switching between two base stations, may not be an efficient scheme in H-CRAN. In this paper, we innovate a proactive network association mechanism by taking CoMP into consideration under the H-CRAN architecture. We consider two scenarios under the H-CRAN architecture: with and without the assistance of HPN in the network. By regarding APs/HPN in H-CRAN as resources that allocated to mobile machines, a novel proactive network association concept is proposed, and then generalized from one-to-one to multiple-to-multiple case. With the assistance of Lyapunov optimization theory, effective bandwidth, and capacity theory, we can prove that this proactive network association scheme can guarantee that the queueing delay performance and the delay violation probability can be both smaller than a corresponding upper bound. That is, both low-latency and ultra-reliable communication can be guaranteed. We also conduct experiments by using real trace from taxis movement data to verify the analytical results. Our results suggest the guidelines to design the proactive network association scheme in H-CRAN.

TI MAIA-A machine learning assisted image annotation method for
   environmental monitoring and exploration
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Digital imaging has become one of the most important techniques in environmental monitoring and exploration. In the case of the marine environment, mobile platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are now equipped with high-resolution cameras to capture huge collections of images from the seabed. However, the timely evaluation of all these images presents a bottleneck problem as tens of thousands or more images can be collected during a single dive. This makes computational support for marine image analysis essential. Computer-aided analysis of environmental images (and marine images in particular) with machine learning algorithms is promising, but challenging and different to other imaging domains because training data and class labels cannot be collected as efficiently and comprehensively as in other areas. In this paper, we present Machine learning Assisted Image Annotation (MAIA), a new image annotation method for environmental monitoring and exploration that overcomes the obstacle of missing training data. The method uses a combination of autoencoder networks and Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN), which allows human observers to annotate large image collections much faster than before. We evaluated the method with three marine image datasets featuring different types of background, imaging equipment and object classes. Using MAIA, we were able to annotate objects of interest with an average recall of 84.1% more than twice as fast as compared to "traditional" annotation methods, which are purely based on software-supported direct visual inspection and manual annotation. The speed gain increases proportionally with the size of a dataset. The MAIA approach represents a substantial improvement on the path to greater efficiency in the annotation of large benthic image collections.

AB Insures are well versed in the litany of challenging conditions facing the sector. These challenges are economic, political, regulatory, legal, social, and technological. As a result of those pressures, the industry is experiencing increasing competition, muted growth, and an excess of capital. The increased connectivity among household and workplace devices, the development of autonomous vehicle and the rising threat of cyber attacks are transforming the way people live and risk they need to mitigate with insurance products. Insurers need to adopt their business models address the changes which can be threatening to the growth of the industry (Deloitte, 2017). Innovation is widely regarded as pinnacle success factor in highly competitive and global economy. An innovation perspective draws a clear picture of future opportunities that lie ahead. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship among innovations capability, innovation type and on the different aspect of firm performance including innovation, market and financial performance based on an empirical study covering insurance industry in Sri Lanka. The research framework developed in this study was tested 379 senior managers of insurance companies. The empirical verification of assumption of this model has given evidence to confirm the relationship between innovation capabilities; innovation efforts and firm performance are significant and strong.

AB A Seaglider autonomous underwater vehicle augmented the Ocean Station Papa (OSP; 50 degrees N, 145 degrees W) surface mooring, measuring spatial structure on scales relevant to the monthly evolution of the moored time series. During each of three missions from June 2008 to January 2010, a Seaglider made biweekly 50 km x 50 km surveys in a bowtie-shaped survey track. Horizontal temperature and salinity gradients measured by these surveys were an order of magnitude stronger than climatological values and sometimes of opposite sign. Geostrophically inferred circulation was corroborated by moored acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements and AVISO satellite altimetry estimates of surface currents, confirming that glider surveys accurately resolved monthly scale mesoscale spatial structure. In contrast to climatological North Pacific Current circulation, upper-ocean flow was modestly northward during the first half of the 18 month survey period, and weakly westward during its latter half, with Rossby number O(0.01). This change in circulation coincided with a shift from cool and fresh to warm, saline, oxygen-rich water in the upper-ocean halocline, and an increase in vertical fine structure there and in the lower pycnocline. The anomalous flow and abrupt water mass transition were due to the slow growth of an anticyclonic meander within the North Pacific Current with radius comparable to the scale of the survey pattern, originating to the southeast of OSP.

AB The Amundsen Sea is one of the most productive polynyas in the Antarctic per unit area and is undergoing rapid changes including a reduction in sea ice duration, thinning ice sheets, retreat of glaciers and the potential collapse of the Thwaites Glacier in Pine Island Bay. A growing body of research has indicated that these changes are altering the water mass properties and associated biogeochemistry within the polynya. Unfortunately difficulties in accessing the remote location have greatly limited the amount of in situ data that has been collected. In this study data from a Teledyne-Webb Slocum glider was used to supplement ship-based sampling along the Dotson Ice Shelf (DIS). This autonomous underwater vehicle revealed a detailed view of a meltwater laden outflow from below the western flank of the DIS. Circumpolar Deep Water intruding onto the shelf drives glacial melt and the supply of macronutrients that, along with ample light, supports the large phytoplankton blooms in the Amundsen Sea Polynya. Less well understood is the source of micronutrients, such as iron, necessary to support this bloom to the central polynya where chlorophyll concentrations are highest. This outflow region showed decreasing optical backscatter with proximity to the bed indicating that particulate matter was sourced from the overlying glacier rather than resuspended sediment. This result suggests that particulate iron, and potentially phytoplankton primary productivity, is intrinsically linked to the magnitude and duration of sub-glacial melt from Circumpolar Deep Water intrusions onto the shelf.

TI State Estimation Based on the Concept of Continuous Symmetry and
   Observability Analysis: The Case of Calibration
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Observability; sensor calibration; sensor fusion; state estimation and
   navigation
ID SYSTEM; DESIGN
AB This paper considers the problem of state estimation in autonomous navigation from a theoretical perspective. In particular, the investigation concerns problems where the information provided by the sensor data is not sufficient to carry out the state estimation (i.e., the state is not observable). For these systems, the concept of continuous symmetry is introduced. Detection of the continuous symmetries of a given system has a very practical importance. It allows the detection of an observable state whose components are nonlinear functions of the original nonobservable state. So far, this theoretical and very general concept has been applied to deal with two distinct fundamental estimation problems in the framework of mobile robotics. The former is in the framework of self-calibration, and the latter is in the framework of the fusion of the data provided by inertial sensors and vision sensors. For reasons of length, only the former is discussed. In particular, the theoretical machinery is used to address a specific calibration problem. The solution constrains the robot to move along specific trajectories in order to be able to apply the calibration algorithm. This paper provides two distinct contributions. The first is the introduction of this concept of continuous symmetry. The second is the introduction of a simple and efficient strategy to extrinsically calibrate a bearing sensor (e. g., a vision sensor) mounted on a vehicle and, simultaneously, estimate the parameters describing the systematic error of its odometry system. Many accurate simulations and real experiments show the robustness, the efficiency, and the accuracy of the proposed strategy.

AB The degree of layered organization of planktonic organisms in coastal systems impacts trophic interactions, the vertical availability of nutrients, and many biological rate processes. While there is reasonable characterization of the vertical structure of these phenomena, the extent and horizontal length scale of variation has rarely been addressed. Here we extend the examination of the vertical scale in the first paper of the series to the horizontal scale with combined shipboard acoustic measurements and bio-optic measurements taken on an autonomous underwater vehicle. Measurements were made in Monterey Bay, CA from 2002 to 2008 for the bio-optical parameters and during 2006 for acoustic scattering measurements. The combined data set was used to evaluate the horizontal decorrelation length scales of the bio-optical and acoustic scattering layers themselves. Because biological layers are often decoupled from the physical structure of the water column, assessment of the variance within identified layers was appropriate. This differs from other studies in that physical parameters were not used as a basis for the layer definition. There was a significant diel pattern to the decorrelation length scale for acoustic layers with the more abundant nighttime layers showing less horizontal variability despite their smaller horizontal extent. A significant decrease in the decorrelation length scale was found in bio-optical parameters over six years of study, coinciding with a documented shift in the plankton community. Results highlight the importance of considering plankton behavior and time of day with respect to scale when studying layers, and the challenges of sampling these phenomena. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The master circadian pacemaker located within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain controls system-level rhythms in animal physiology. Specific SCN outputs synchronize circadian physiological rhythms in other brain regions. Within the SCN, communication among neural cells provides for the coordination of autonomous cellular oscillations into ensemble rhythms. ATP is a neural transmitter involved in local communication among astrocytes and between astrocytes and neurons. Using a luciferin-luciferase chemiluminescence assay, we have demonstrated that ATP levels fluctuate rhythmically within both SCN2.2 cell cultures and the rat SCN in vivo. SCN2.2 cells generated circadian oscillations in both the production and extracellular accumulation of ATP. Circadian fluctuations in ATP accumulation persisted with an average period (tau) of 23.7 h in untreated as well as vehicle-treated and forskolin-treated SCN2.2 cells, indicating that treatment with an inductive stimulus is not necessary to propagate these rhythms. ATP levels in the rat SCN in vivo were marked by rhythmic variation during exposure to 12 h of light and 12 h of dark or constant darkness, with peak accumulation occurring during the latter half of the dark phase or subjective night. Primary cultures of cortical astrocytes similarly expressed circadian oscillations in extracellular ATP accumulation that persisted for multiple cycles with periods of about 23 h. These results suggest that circadian oscillations in extracellular ATP levels represent a physiological output of the mammalian cellular clock, common to the SCN pacemaker and astrocytes from at least some brain regions, and thus may provide a mechanism for clock control of gliotransmission between astrocytes and to neurons.

AB Spatial data clustering has long been used to facilitate the knowledge discovery process. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature for detecting and understanding hidden patterns. These approaches are based on different perspectives and can be roughly categorized into several main categories, including centroid-based, density-based, grid-based, and hierarchy-based clustering. In spite of being a very mature research area, existing spatial clustering techniques usually depend on user parameters and continue to utilize distances between objects as their similarity measure. In turn, clustering approaches are generally suffering from performance and scalability issues. To address this problem, we propose ACUTE, an efficient and scalable approach that detects both synthetic and real-world spatial clusters. ACUTE ascertains both the intra-cluster compactness (similarities) and inter-cluster connectedness (dissimilarities) of spatial objects by assessing the topological relations of their corresponding spatial points. While conventional methods conduct clustering according to pairwise comparisons of the distances between objects, our approach focuses on leveraging topological relations that reduce the distances required to be calculated. This in turn minimizes the number of comparisons required, thus enhancing the efficiency and increasing the scalability. To evaluate the accuracy of ACUTE, it has been extensively tested against twelve (12) synthetic datasets and five (5) actual datasets including one location-based (network) dataset. Results show that ACUTE has great performance when compared with state-of-the-art clustering techniques in terms of several evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and error rates.

AB The fog paradigm extends the cloud capabilities at the edge of the network. Fog computing-based real-time applications (Online gaming, 5G, Healthcare 4.0, Industrial IoT, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, augmented reality, and many more) are growing at a very fast pace. There are limited resources at the fog layer compared to the cloud, which leads to resource constraint problems. Edge resources need to be utilized efficiently to fulfill the growing demand for a large number of IoT devices. Lots of work has been done for the efficient utilization of edge resources. This paper provided a systematic review of fog resource management literature from the year 2016-2021. In this review paper, the fog resource management approaches are divided into 9 categories which include resource scheduling, application placement, load balancing, resource allocation, resource estimation, task offloading, resource provisioning, resource discovery, and resource orchestration. These resource management approaches are further subclassified based on the technology used, QoS factors, and data-driven strategies. Comparative analysis of existing articles is provided based on technology, tools, application area, and QoS factors. Further, future research prospects are discussed in the context of QoS factors, technique/algorithm, tools, applications, mobility support, heterogeneity, AI-based, distributed network, hierarchical network, and security. A systematic literature review of existing survey papers is also included. At the end of this work, key findings are highlighted in the conclusion section.

AB As an important means of obtaining information of marine situation, the marine monitoring system relying on UAV has been paid more and more attention by all countries in the world, and the demand for tasks is growing continually. In UAV ad hoc networks, routing protocols with immutable routing policies that lack flexibility are generally incapable of maintaining effective performance due to the complicated and rapidly changing environmental situation and application requirements. In this paper, we propose an intelligent clustering routing approach (ICRA) for UANETs. The ICRA is composed of three components: the clustering module, the clustering strategy adjustment module and the routing module. In the clustering process, each node needs to calculate its utility. In order to maintain high topology stability and long network lifetime in different network states, the reinforcement learning based clustering strategy adjustment module needs continuous learning the benefits brought by adopting different strategies to calculate the nodes utility in a specific network state. With the learned knowledge, clustering strategy adjustment module could determine the optimal clustering strategy according to the current network state. In the routing phase, the proposed scheme can reduce the end-to-end delay and improve the packet delivery rate by introducing inter-cluster forwarding nodes to forward messages among different clusters. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify ICRA's robustness and superiority over existing schemes. The results demonstrate that ICRA could achieve better performance than its state-of-the-art counterparts with regard to the clustering efficiency, topology stability, energy efficiency and quality of service.

AB The evolving "Industry 4.0" domain encompasses a collection of future industrial developments with cyber-physical systems (CPS), Internet of things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, etc. Besides, the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) directs data from systems for monitoring and controlling the physical world to the data processing system. A major novelty of the IIoT is the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are treated as an efficient remote sensing technique to gather data from large regions. UAVs are commonly employed in the industrial sector to solve several issues and help decision making. But the strict regulations leading to data privacy possibly hinder data sharing across autonomous UAVs. Federated learning (FL) becomes a recent advancement of machine learning (ML) which aims to protect user data. In this aspect, this study designs federated learning with blockchain assisted image classification model for clustered UAV networks (FLBIC-CUAV) on IIoT environment. The proposed FLBIC-CUAV technique involves three major processes namely clustering, blockchain enabled secure communication and FL based image classification. For UAV cluster construction process, beetle swarm optimization (BSO) algorithm with three input parameters is designed to cluster the UAVs for effective communication. In addition, blockchain enabled secure data transmission process take place to transmit the data from UAVs to cloud servers. Finally, the cloud server uses an FL with Residual Network model to carry out the image classification process. A wide range of simulation analyses takes place for ensuring the betterment of the FLBIC-CUAV approach. The experimental outcomes portrayed the betterment of the FLBIC-CUAV approach over the recent state of art methods.

AB Accurate navigation of an autonomous underwater vehicle is important for its reliable operation. However, this task is challenging due to limitations of radio wave propagation and poor visibility in the aquatic environment. Underwater navigation techniques based on analysing sonar images facilitated by machine learning have shown promising results. However, previously proposed techniques are still complicated for real-time applications. This paper investigates low complexity techniques for the motion estimation based on the use of images obtained by a sonar looking down to the seafloor. The sonar can use multiple beams within a field of view (FoV). Various configurations of beams are considered according to portions of the FoV covered and two estimation approaches are investigated. In one approach, the sonar images are directly processed by a deep learning (DL) network, whereas in the other, the images are converted into (reduced size) vectors before applying them to a DL network. The vector approach shows a significantly lower computation time (about 10 times faster), which makes it suitable for real-time applications. Both the approaches show a similar estimation accuracy, about 10% of the maximum magnitude of the motion. The vector technique has been used to estimate a simulated trajectory and compare the estimate with the ground truth, which showed a good match. It has also been applied to estimate the trajectory of an imaging sonar from a real data set from a ship's hull inspection. The estimated trajectory has successfully been used to build a mosaic by merging the sonar images from the real data set.

AB Predicting and understanding pedestrian intentions is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to navigate in a crowd. However, the movement of pedestrian is random. Pedestrian trajectory modeling needs to consider not only the past movement of pedestrians, the interaction between different pedestrians, the constraints of static obstacles in the scene, but also multi-modal of the human trajectory, which brings challenges to pedestrian trajectory prediction. Most of the existing trajectory prediction methods only consider the interaction between pedestrians in the scene, ignoring the static obstacles in the scene can also have impacts on the trajectory of pedestrian. In this paper, a scalable relative interactive spatial-temporal graph generation adversarial network architecture (RISTG-GAN) is proposed to generate a reasonable multi-modal prediction trajectory by considering the interaction effects of all agents in the scene. Our method extends recent work on trajectory prediction. First, LSTM nodes are flexibly used to model the spatial-temporal graph of human-environment interactions, and the spatial-temporal graph is converted into feed-forward differentiable feature coding, and the time attention module is proposed to capture the trajectory information in time domain and learn the time dependence in long time range. Then, we capture the relative importance of the interaction of all agents in the scene on the pedestrian trajectory through the improved relative scaled dot product attention and use the generative adversarial network architecture for training to generate reasonable pedestrian future trajectory distribution. Experiments on five commonly used real public datasets show that RISTG-GAN is better than previous work in terms of reasoning speed, accuracy and the rationality of trajectory prediction.

AB Yellow rust (YR) wheat disease is one of the major threats to worldwide wheat production, and it often spreads rapidly to new and unexpected geographic locations. To cope with this threat, integrated pathogen management strategies combine disease-resistant plants, sensors monitoring technologies, and fungicides either preventively or curatively, which come with their associated monetary and environmental costs. This work presents a methodology for timely detection of YR that cuts down on hardware and computational requirements. It enables frequent detailed monitoring of the spread of YR, hence providing the opportunity to better target mitigation efforts which is critical for successful integrated disease management. The method is trained to detect YR symptoms using reflectance spectrum (VIS-NIR) and a classification algorithm at different stages of YR development to distinguish them from typical defense responses occurring in resistant wheat. The classification method was trained and tested on four different spectral datasets. The results showed that using a full spectral range, a selection of the top 5% significant spectral features, or five typical multispectral bands for early detection of YR in infected plants yielded a true positive rate of similar to 86%, for infected plants. The same data analysis with digital camera bands provided a true positive rate of 77%. These findings lay the groundwork for the development of high-throughput YR screening in the field implementing multispectral digital camera sensors that can be mounted on autonomous vehicles or a drone as part of an integrated disease management scheme.

AB The adult circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is resilient to glucocorticoids (GCs). The fetal rodent SCN resembles that of the adult in its organization of GC-sensitive peripheral tissues. We tested the hypothesis that the fetal SCN clock is sensitive to changes in GC levels. Maternal GCs must pass through the placenta to reach the fetal SCN. We show that the maternal but not the fetal part of the placenta harbors the autonomous circadian clock, which is reset by dexamethasone (DEX) and rhythmically expresses Hsd11b2. The results suggest the presence of a mechanism for rhythmic GC passage through the placental barrier, which is adjusted according to actual GC levels. GC receptors are expressed rhythmically in the laser-dissected fetal SCN samples. We demonstrate that hypothalamic explants containing the SCN of the mPer2(Luc) mouse prepared at embryonic day (E)15 spontaneously develop rhythmicity within several days of culture, with dynamics varying among fetuses from the same litter. Culturing these explants in media enriched with DEX accelerates the development. At E17, treatment of the explants with DEX induces phase advances and phase delays of the rhythms depending on the timing of treatments, and the shifts are completely blocked by the GC receptor antagonist, mifepristone. The DEX-induced phase-response curve differs from that induced by the vehicle. The fetal SCN is sensitive to GCs in vivo because DEX administration to pregnant rats acutely downregulates c-fos expression specifically in the laser-dissected fetal SCN. Our results provide evidence that the rodent fetal SCN clock may respond to changes in GC levels.

AB Several islands around the world are facing common challenges in terms of high energy costs, local CO2 emissions, security of supply and system stability. In EU, many islands have become sites of energy innovation, where betting on Renewable Energy Sources is a winning choice to meet their energy needs. In this framework, renewable energies play a key role for supporting the transition of small islands to an autonomous, cleaner and low-carbon energy system in line with the overall EU Energy Union package and EU2030 goals. This study examines the suitability of using hybrid energy system comprising photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, biomass and diesel generators to meet the electricity demand of Favignana Island, to increase the penetration of renewables in the local electricity grid. Additionally, the energy scenarios simulation aimed at identifying foreseeable energy-environmentally improvements associated to the mutual merging of further energy sectors, such as transportation and heating sector. Consequently, the renewable capacity firming issues can be strongly mitigated by integrating new energy demand components. Thus, this work shows in a systemic overview all the outcomes related to the different energy mix layout, with varying the RES share values compatibly with the local grid electro-technical constraints. Furthermore, this paper studies the impact that the introduction of electric vehicles into the island car fleet will have on the energy system. The smart energy system's components and sizes have been studied both from an energy and an economic point of view by means of two different software (i.e. EnergyPLAN and HOMER).

AB Objective: The aim was to compare the effectiveness of two auditory displays, implemented with spearcons (time-compressed speech), for monitoring multiple patients. Background: Sequences of sounds can convey information about patients' vital signs, such as oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR). We tested whether participants could monitor five patients using spearcon-based sound sequences. Method: A 2 x 3 within-subjects design was used. The first factor was interface, with two levels: the ALL interface used spearcons to convey vital signs for all five patients, whereas the ABN (abnormal) interface represented patients who had normal vital signs with a low-pitched single-tone sound and patients who had at least one abnormal vital sign with spearcons. The second factor was the number of patients who had at least one abnormal vital sign: there were one, two, or three such patients in each monitoring sequence. Participants were 40 nonclinicians. Results: Participants identified abnormal patients' SpO(2) and HR levels and located abnormal patients in the sound sequence more accurately with the ABN interface than the ALL interface. Accuracy declined as the number of abnormal patients increased. Participants associated ABN with easier identification of vital signs, resulting in higher ratings of confidence and pleasantness compared with ALL. Conclusion: Sequences of spearcons may support effective eyes-free monitoring of multiple patients. Application: Sequences of spearcons may be useful in monitoring multiple patients and the underlying design principles may extend to monitoring in other domains such as industrial process control or control of multiple autonomous vehicles.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to develop a novel type of bionic underwater robot (BUR) with multi-flexible caudal fins. With the coordinate movement of multi-caudal fins, BUR will combine the undulation propulsion mode of carangiform fish and jet propulsion mode of jellyfish together organically. The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimental method helps to reveal the effect of caudal fin stiffness and motion parameters on its hydrodynamic forces.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, the prototype of BUR was given by mimicking the shape and propulsion mechanism of both carangiform fish and jellyfish. Besides, the kinematics models in both undulation and jet propulsion modes were established. Then, the effects of caudal fin stiffness on its hydrodynamic forces were investigated based on the CFD method. Finally, an experimental set-up was developed to test and verify the effects of the caudal fin stiffness on its hydrodynamic forces under different caudal fin actuation frequency and amplitude.
   Findings - The results of this paper demonstrate that BUR with multi-flexible caudal fins combines the hydrodynamic characteristics of undulation and jet propulsion modes. In addition, the caudal fin with medium stiffness can generate larger thrust force and reduce the reactive power.
   Practical implications - This paper implies that robotic fish can be equipped with both undulation and jet propulsion modes to optimize the swimming performance in the future.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a BUR with multi-propulsion modes, which has the merits of high propulsion efficiency, high acceleration performance and overcome the head shaken problem effectively.

AB This paper reports on a model-assisted bundle adjustment (BA) framework in which visually-derived features are fused with an underlying three-dimensional (3D) mesh provided a priori. By using an approach inspired by the expectation-maximization (EM) class of algorithms, we introduce a hidden binary label for each visual feature that indicates if that feature is considered part of the nominal model, or if the feature corresponds to 3D structure that is absent from the model. Therefore, in addition to improved estimates of the feature locations, we can identify visual features that correspond to foreign structure on the ship hull. We show that this framework is a special case of the Gaussian max-mixtures framework, which can be efficiently incorporated into state-of-the-art graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solvers.
   In addition, the precision of our bundle adjustment framework allows the identification of structural deviations between 3D structure inferred from bundle-adjusted camera imagery and the prior model. These structural deviations are clustered into shapes, which allow us to fuse camera-derived structure back into the 3D mesh. This augmented model can be used within a 3D photomosaicing pipeline, providing a visually intuitive 3D reconstruction of the ship hull. We evaluate our pipeline using the Bluefin Robotics hovering autonomous underwater vehicle (HAUV) surveying the SS Curtiss, where a 3D mesh derived from computer aided design (CAD) drawings serves as the prior model. In addition to more consistent visual reconstructions, we can update the prior mesh with 3D information corresponding to underwater structure, such as biofouling or manually-placed cylindrical shapes with known dimensions.

AB Future Mars exploration missions rely heavily on high-mobility autonomous rovers equipped with sophisticated scientific instruments and possessing advanced navigational capabilities. Increasing their navigation velocity and localization accuracy is essential for enabling these rovers to explore large areas on Mars. Contemporary Mars rovers move slowly, partially due to the long execution time of complex computer vision algorithms running on their slow space-grade CPUs. This paper exploits the advent of high-performance space-grade field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate the navigation of future rovers. Specifically, it focuses on visual odometry (VO) and performs HW/SW codesign to achieve one order of magnitude faster execution and improved accuracy. Conforming to the specifications of the European Space Agency, we build a proof-of-concept system on an HW/SW platform with processing power resembling that to be available onboard future rovers. We develop a codesign methodology adapted to the rover's specifications, design parallel architectures, and customize several feature extraction, matching, and motion estimation algorithms. We implement and evaluate five distinct HW/SW pipelines on a Virtex6 FPGA and a 150 MIPS CPU. We provide a detailed analysis of their cost-time-accuracy tradeoffs and quantify the benefits of employing FPGAs for implementing VO. Our solution achieves a speedup factor of 16x over a CPU-only implementation, handling a stereo image pair in less than 1 s, with a 1.25% mean positional error after a 100 m traverse and an FPGA cost of 54 K LUTs and 1.46-MB RAM.

AB A research cruise to Hannibal Bank, a seamount and an ecological hotspot in the coastal eastern tropical Pacific Ocean off Panama, explored the zonation, biodiversity, and the ecological processes that contribute to the seamount's elevated biomass. Here we describe the spatial structure of a benthic anomuran red crab population, using submarine video and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) photographs. High density aggregations and a swarm of red crabs were associated with a dense turbid layer 4-10 m above the bottom. The high density aggregations were constrained to 355-385 m water depth over the Northwest flank of the seamount, although the crabs also occurred at lower densities in shallower waters (similar to 280 m) and in another location of the seamount. The crab aggregations occurred in hypoxic water, with oxygen levels of 0.04 ml/l. Barcoding of Hannibal red crabs, and pelagic red crabs sampled in a mass stranding event in 2015 at a beach in San Diego, California, USA, revealed that the Panamanian and the Californian crabs are likely the same species, Pleuroncodes planipes, and these findings represent an extension of the southern endrange of this species. Measurements along a 1.6 km transect revealed three high density aggregations, with the highest density up to 78 crabs/m(2), and that the crabs were patchily distributed. Crab density peaked in the middle of the patch, a density structure similar to that of swarming insects.

TI Observed and modeled bio-optical, bioluminescent, and physical
   properties during a coastal upwelling event in Monterey Bay, California
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
LA English
DT Article
AB During spring and summer time, coastal upwelling influences circulation and ecosystem dynamics of the Monterey Bay, California, which is recognized as a National Marine Sanctuary. Observations of physical, bio-optical properties (including bioluminescence) together with results from dynamical biochemical and bioluminescence models are used to interpret the development of the upwelling event during August 2003 in Monterey Bay, California. Observations and the biochemical model show the development of a phytoplankton bloom in the southern portion of Monterey Bay. Model results show an increase of nutrients in the southern portion of the bay, where nutrient-rich water masses are brought in by the southward flow and cyclonic circulation inside the bay. This increase in nutrients together with the sluggish circulation in the southern portion of the bay provides favorable conditions for phytoplankton growth. Our observations and models suggest that with the development of upwelling the offshore water masses with the subsurface layer of bioluminescent zooplankton were replaced by water masses advected from the northern coast of the bay with a relatively high presence of mostly nonbioluminescent phytoplankton. Inshore observations from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) show consistent coincidence of chlorophyll, backscatter, and bioluminescence maxima during upwelling development. Offshore AUV observations (taken at the entrance to the bay) show a deeper bioluminescence maximum below the surface layers of high chlorophyll and backscatter values during the earlier stages of upwelling development. Later, the observed deep offshore bioluminescence maximum disappeared and became a shallower and much weaker signal, coinciding with high chlorophyll and backscatter values offshore. Based on the biochemical and bioluminescence models, a methodology for estimating the nighttime water-leaving radiance due to stimulated bioluminescence is demonstrated and evaluated.

AB The Bremen ocean bottom tiltmeter is a new 6000 m-depth deep sea instrument for autonomous observation of sea floor tilt with signal periods longer than 7.5 s. The instrument also records vertical acceleration in the frequency range from DC to 1 Hz. The tiltmeter has an Applied Geomechanics Inc. 756 wide angle biaxial bubble tilt sensor with a resolution of 1.0 mu rad (0.2 arc second). A Kistler Corp. MEMS accelerometer of type Servo K-Beam 8330A2.5 with about 10(-5)m/s(2) resolution is used for the acceleration measurements. An Oceanographic Embedded Systems AD24 24 bit Sigma-Delta converter, which is controlled by a low-power Persistor Inc. embedded computer system of type CF 2, samples the data. The duration of tiltmeter operation is more than one year, which is controlled by the battery life. In our design the tiltmeter does not need active leveling devices, i.e., servo motors or other moving components to adjust sensors or frame. We designed the instrument for deployments by means of a remote operated vehicle. Since May 2005 the Bremen ocean bottom tiltmeter has recorded sea floor deformation and seismicity level in the Logatchev hydrothermal vent field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The tiltmeter is a part of the monitoring system of project 'Logatchev Long-Term Environmental Monitoring,' called LOLEM, of the German research program with the name 'Schwerpunktprogramm 1144: Vom Mantel zum Ozean.'

AB Recently, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology is being used in autonomous vehicles. The LiDAR emits a laser in the near-infrared (NIR) region and receives light reflected from the object to measure the distance and structure. However, the current dark-tone pigment is based on carbon black, so it absorbs not only visible light but also NIR, making it difficult to sense in LiDAR. We have developed a dark-tone paint bilayer structure that can reflect NIR. To achieve effective penetration within the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, while simultaneously absorbing visible light, a novel set of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives were synthesized and blended with yellow and blue organic pigments. This resulted in the production of a dark-tone pigment that was subsequently applied to layers possessing high levels of NIR reflectivity. As a result, we made a black pigment close to carbon black under Br-phenyl-DPP:Yellow151:CuPc = 1:1:3 conditions (L* = 27.0, a* = - 0.03, and b* = 0.35), and secured a high NIR reflectivity of 58.07% and good ultraviolet resistance (& UDelta;E = 0.29). We expect this result to be used as a dark-tone pigment applicable to LiDAR.Graphical abstractIn this study, we mixed three different organic pigments to develop an NIR-transparent dark-tone pigment. And this dark-tone pigment is coated on the NIR-reflective layer to construct NIR-reflective dart-tone bilayer. As a result, we fabricated the black color (L* = 27.0, a* = - 0.03, and b* = 0.35) with high NIR reflectivity (58.07%) and also good ultraviolet resistance (& UDelta;E = 0.29)

ID UNIFIED FRAMEWORK
AB Visual recognition has become inevitable in applications such as object detection, biometric tracking, autonomous vehicles, and social media platforms. The images have multiple factors such as image resolution, illumination, perspective and noise, resulting in a significant mismatch between the training and testing domains. Unsupervised Domain adaptation (DA) has proven an effective way to reduce the differences by adapting the knowledge from a richly labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. But the real-time datasets are non-linear and high-dimensional. Though kernelization can handle the non-linearity in data, the dimension needs to be reduced as the salient features of the data lie in a low-dimensional subspace. Current dimensionality reduction approaches in DA preserve either the global or local part of information of manifold data. Specifically, the data manifold's static (subject-invariant) and dynamic (intra-subject variant) information need to be considered during knowledge transfer. Therefore, to preserve both parts of information Globality-Locality Preserving Projection (GLPP) method is applied to the labeled source domain. The other objectives are preserving the discriminant information and variance of target data, and minimizing the distribution and subspace differences between the domains. With all these objectives, we propose a unique method known as Kernelized Global-Local Discriminant Information Preservation for unsupervised DA (KGLDIP). KGLDIP aims to reduce the discrimination discrepancy geometrically and statistically between the two domains after calculating two projection matrices for each domain. Intensive experiments are conducted using five standard datasets and the analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm excels the other state-of-the-art DA approaches.

AB Hawkweeds (Pilosella spp.) have become a severe and rapidly invading weed in pasture lands and forest meadows of New Zealand. Detection of hawkweed infestations is essential for eradication and resource management at private and government levels. This study explores the potential of machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting mouse-ear hawkweed (Pilosella officinarum) foliage and flowers from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-acquired multispectral (MS) images at various spatial resolutions. The performances of different ML algorithms, namely eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbours (KNN), were analysed in their capacity to detect hawkweed foliage and flowers using MS imagery. The imagery was obtained at numerous spatial resolutions from a highly infested study site located in the McKenzie Region of the South Island of New Zealand in January 2021. The spatial resolution of 0.65 cm/pixel (acquired at a flying height of 15 m above ground level) produced the highest overall testing and validation accuracy of 100% using the RF, KNN, and XGB models for detecting hawkweed flowers. In hawkweed foliage detection at the same resolution, the RF and XGB models achieved highest testing accuracy of 97%, while other models (KNN and SVM) achieved an overall model testing accuracy of 96% and 72%, respectively. The XGB model achieved the highest overall validation accuracy of 98%, while the other models (RF, KNN, and SVM) produced validation accuracies of 97%, 97%, and 80%, respectively. This proposed methodology may facilitate non-invasive detection efforts of mouse-ear hawkweed flowers and foliage in other naturalised areas, enabling land managers to optimise the use of UAV remote sensing technologies for better resource allocation.

AB The potential for the use of drones in logistics and transportation is continuously growing, with multiple applications both in urban and rural environments. The safe navigation of drones in such environments is a major challenge that requires sophisticated algorithms and systems, that can quickly and efficiently estimate the situation, find the shortest path to the target, and detect and avoid obstacles. Traditional path planning algorithms are unable to handle the dynamic and uncertain nature of real environments, while traditional machine learning models are insufficient due to the constantly changing conditions that affect the drone location and the location of obstacles. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been widely used for autonomous navigation problems, however, computational complexity and energy demands of such methods can become a bottleneck to the execution of UAV flights. In this paper, we propose the use of a minimum set of sensors and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for the safe and efficient navigation of drones in urban and rural environments. Our approach considers the complex and dynamic nature of such environments by incorporating real-time data from low-cost onboard sensors. After performing a thorough review of the existing solutions in drone path planning and navigation in 3-D environments, we experimentally evaluate our proposed approach in a simulated environment, and in various scenarios. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RL-based approach in the navigation of drones in complex and unconstrained environments. The implemented approach can serve as a basis for the development of advanced and robust navigation systems for drones, which can improve safety and efficiency in transportation applications in the near future.

AB Frequency domain photoacoustic (FDPA) imaging has great potential in a clinical setting compared to time-domain photoacoustic imaging due to its reduced cost and small form factors. However FDPA system struggles with lower signal to noise ratio, necessitating the need for advanced image reconstruction methods. Most of the image reconstruction approaches in FDPA imaging are based on analytical or model based schemes. Very less emphasis has been placed on developing deep learning based approaches for FDPA imaging. In this work, a image translation network was developed with the ability to directly map from sinogram data (complex-valued) to the initial pressure rise distribution (real-valued) for FD-PA imaging. This architecture was based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) backbone (with adjoined real and imaginary parts of the complex sinogram data as input) followed by a fully connected layer, which is then passed through a convolution and transposed convolution layer pair. The result of the FDPA-LSTM architecture was compared with direct translational networks based on ResNet, UNet and AUTOMAP and found to have an improvement of about 15% in terms of PSNR and 10% in terms of SSIM with 150 degrees data acquisition limited-view angle. Further, the FDPA-LSTM was also compared with post-processing UNet architecture on backprojection and Tikhonov regularized reconstruction. A 20% improvement in terms of PSNR with backprojection and post-processing UNet was observed. Further FDPA-LSTM had similar performance as Tikhonov and post-processing UNet (with 75 times acceleration). The developed scheme will indeed be very useful for achieving accelerated and accurate frequency domain photoacoustic imaging.

AB A thrust vectoring ducted propeller with slotted nozzle is a new approach for vector propulsion that can produce lateral forces and torques, leading to the ability of manipulating the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for various movements. In this work, the geometric model of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is designed based on slotted nozzle. The nozzle of the ducted propeller is slotted and then divided into several pieces. Divided auxiliary nozzles are deflected to redirect the outflow, achieving thrust vectoring. The key feature parameters of the slotted nozzle are extracted. The performance of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is evaluated using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) method. Different parameters of the slotted nozzle are set to evaluate the influence on the thrust vectoring capability of the ducted propeller. Through comparison, a thrust vectoring ducted propeller model is determined. Hydrodynamic characteristics including thrust vectoring performance, scale effect and vertical-horizontal interactions of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller are analyzed. It is shown that the ducted propeller with slotted nozzle at full capacity has a higher vector ratio and lower thrust loss than ideal tilted thruster with a maximum tilt angle of 40 degrees. For high Reynolds (Re) number working conditions, all forces and torques including vector thrust can be nondimensionalized into hydrodynamic coefficients related to advance ratio J. At lower Re number working conditions, thrust vectoring capability improves in a certain extent. Interactions between perpendicular directions are caused by the counterclockwise rotation of the propeller. The pattern is quite clear and can be quantified. The performance of the thrust vectoring ducted propeller is verified through towing tank experiment. All the results show that the ducted propeller with slotted nozzle can be considered controllable with good thrust vectoring capability.

AB A positioning solution for users on the lunar surface is required for the success of upcoming missions. Technological advancements have enabled the use of accurate range and Doppler measurements from a lunar orbiter. This article introduces a filtered approach of joint Doppler and ranging (JDR), a minimal architecture that requires as few as one lunar orbiter to perform 3D positioning of lunar surface vehicles. The simulated performance of JDR and Doppler-based positioning methods is compared. Two lunar satellites are simulated: The lunar relay satellite (LRS) in a 12-h frozen orbit with its apogee above the lunar south pole, and the lunar reconnaissance orbiter in a 2-h Polar orbit. The analysis interval is 8 h over a single LRS ground pass. The ground pass has only a few intervals where both satellites are visible to the user and reference station on the lunar south pole. Navigation nodes are simulated with synchronized clocks for all methods. Measurement and satellite ephemeris errors are embedded into a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate 3D positioning error. The relative JDR method obtains the lowest and most consistent overall 3D root mean squared error, averaging around 10-15 m. The absolute positioning methods are limited by satellite orbit height and other factors. Ultimately, JDR is able to provide reasonably accurate positioning knowledge to users with a minimal required infrastructure. Though this article introduces JDR on the Moon, the same architecture can be applied for other celestial bodies like Venus, Mars, Titan, and asteroids.

AB The Puzzle-Based Storage (PBS) system is an innovative high-density storage system for physical goods, which has the advantage of gravity flow racks in terms of space efficiency and a relatively high accessibility to each unit-load of a variety of personalized goods stored. For the PBS system, among many intricate scheduling problems studied, the minimization of total number of item-moves when retrieving a single item with multiple escorts is an essential building block for its operation. To tackle this problem, we propose a hybrid approach that combines state appraisal, neighborhood search, and beam search. Our numerical experiments on a large number of benchmark instances show that, compared with the results of these instances provided by the best existing heuristic with computational complexity of O(n4), our algorithm with different computational complexity settings can improve the overall average solution accuracy from 1.096% to 0.055% by its setting of O(n(3)), or to 0.570% by its setting of O(n), where n is the size of the PBS system. For PBS systems that are more in line with the actual storage density, our algorithm shows stronger robustness by improving the accuracy from 1.086% to 0.026% by its setting of O(n(3)), or to 0.249% by its setting of O(n). The significant improvement in efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm for this basic problem makes its industrial applications in PBS systems promising. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The main black land conservation measure in China is the straw return to the fields. The processing of high-resolution images collected by aerial photography of UAVs through image stitching technology can provide image information for achieving fast and accurate detection of straw cover over large areas. The classical SIFT algorithm has many drawbacks, such as high dimensionality of feature descriptors, high computational effort, and low matching efficiency. To solve the problems above, this study proposes an improved algorithm. First, the method down sampled the high-resolution images before detecting the features to reduce the number of feature points and improve the efficiency of feature detection. Then, matching among feature points is achieved by gradient normalization-based feature descriptors to improve the matching accuracy. Next, the Progressive Sample Consistency algorithm eliminates the mismatch points and optimizes the transformation model. Finally, the images are fused with optimal stitching combined with fade-in and fade-out to achieve high-quality stitching. The comparative experimental results show that compared with the traditional SIFT and the speed-up robust feature algorithms, the algorithm has the advantage of the speed and good robustness to angle rotation, and makes full use of the texture information and the detail information, so it has higher accuracy. Compared with the traditional methods, the panoramic stitching image quality herein is excellent and can be applied to subsequent straw cover detection, the straw cover error is <= 3%, meeting the demand for large-area straw cover detection. Overall, the method proposed herein achieves an ideal balance between accuracy and efficiency; and outperforms other widely used and superior methods.

AB Cold-water gorgonians dwelling on the continental shelf are a common by-catch of bottom-contact fishing practices. Given the slow growth and limited recruitment of cold-water gorgonians, the impact of fishing activities may seriously compromise the conservation of the highly complex coral gardens communities. For this reason, the development of effective active and passive restoration methods is nowadays a priority in order to enhance the natural recovery of impacted cold-water coral gardens. However, the ecological restoration of mesophotic and deep-sea communities remains extremely limited, due to its technological requirements and associated costs, which bring its wide-scale and long-term application into question. This study reports the preliminary results of the first large-scale active restoration of more than 400 cold-water gorgonians on the Mediterranean continental shelf. By actively involving local fishers during two consecutive fishing seasons, bycatch gorgonians were recovered and returned to the continental shelf (at 80-90 m depth). The monitoring surveys performed by using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) revealed that 460 gorgonian transplants survived over an area of 0.23 ha. The reintroduced cold-water gorgonian population was compared to a reference natural population in terms of size and spatial structure. The cost of the restoration amounted to 140,000 euro /ha, which is significantly lower than that of any deep-sea restoration actions performed to date. The results of this cost-effective active restoration highlight the viability of large-scale restoration of impacted cold-water coral communities, with promising results for the conservation and recovery of mesophotic and deep-sea ecosystems.

AB We propose a novel formulation of the "effectiveness problem" in communications, put forth by Shannon and Weaver in their seminal work "The Mathematical Theory of Communication", by considering multiple agents communicating over a noisy channel in order to achieve better coordination and cooperation in a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Specifically, we consider a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP), in which the agents, in addition to interacting with the environment, can also communicate with each other over a noisy communication channel. The noisy communication channel is considered explicitly as part of the dynamics of the environment, and the message each agent sends is part of the action that the agent can take. As a result, the agents learn not only to collaborate with each other but also to communicate "effectively" over a noisy channel. This framework generalizes both the traditional communication problem, where the main goal is to convey a message reliably over a noisy channel, and the "learning to communicate" framework that has received recent attention in the MARL literature, where the underlying communication channels are assumed to be error-free. We show via examples that the joint policy learned using the proposed framework is superior to that where the communication is considered separately from the underlying MA-POMDP. This is a very powerful framework, which has many real world applications, from autonomous vehicle planning to drone swarm control, and opens up the rich toolbox of deep reinforcement learning for the design of multi-user communication systems.

DT Article
AB With the rapid development of wearable electronic devices, multifunctional ultrarobust, thermoconductive, nonflammable, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding films which are widely utilized to efficiently dissipate heat generated from electronic components are in high demand. The poor scalability and mechanical flexibility of multifunctional papers usually hinder their practical application. In this study, mass-scalable ultrarobust graphene nanoplatelet (GnP) cross-linked aramid nanofiber (ANF) papers with a nacre-bioinspired structure are fabricated via an evaporation-induced self-assembly approach. By chemical cross-linking between two-dimensional GnPs and one-dimensional ANFs in the nacre-bioinspired structure by a phosphorus agent, the excellent toughness and folding endurance of the GnP based ANF papers have been successfully achieved with simultaneous integration of high-level multifunctional properties. Specifically, the ultrarobust GnP based ANF paper with 50 wt% GnP loading exhibits exceptional ultimate tensile strength (437 MPa), Young's modulus (19.7 GPa) and toughness (23.9 MJ m(-3)) as well as superb folding endurance after 10 000 bending cycles. Moreover, the highly ordered alignment of GnP induced an unprecedented thermal/electrical conductivity, and the GnP (50 wt%) based ANF papers with an ultrathin thickness of 21 mu m show a superb in-plane thermal conductivity (up to 68.2 W m(-1) K-1) and outstanding absolute effectiveness EMI shielding (up to 11 060 dB cm(2) g(-1)) and are comparable with some commercial metals/alloys. These outstanding mechanical flexibility integrated superb thermal/EMI properties along with mass-scale production pave the way for practical applications of GnP based ANF papers in the development of advanced thermal management materials in autonomous cars, air vehicles and wearable devices.

AB Current predefined architectures for deep learning are computationally very heavy and use tens of millions of parameters. Thus, computational costs may be prohibitive for many experimental or technological setups. We developed an ad hoc architecture for the classification of multispectral images using deep learning techniques. The architecture, called 3DeepM, is composed of 3D filter banks especially designed for the extraction of spatial-spectral features in multichannel images. The new architecture has been tested on a sample of 12210 multispectral images of seedless table grape varieties: Autumn Royal, Crimson Seedless, Itum4, Itum5 and Itum9. 3DeepM was able to classify 100% of the images and obtained the best overall results in terms of accuracy, number of classes, number of parameters and training time compared to similar work. In addition, this paper presents a flexible and reconfigurable computer vision system designed for the acquisition of multispectral images in the range of 400 nm to 1000 nm. The vision system enabled the creation of the first dataset consisting of 12210 37-channel multispectral images (12 VIS + 25 IR) of five seedless table grape varieties that have been used to validate the 3DeepM architecture. Compared to predefined classification architectures such as AlexNet, ResNet or ad hoc architectures with a very high number of parameters, 3DeepM shows the best classification performance despite using 130-fold fewer parameters than the architecture to which it was compared. 3DeepM can be used in a multitude of applications that use multispectral images, such as remote sensing or medical diagnosis. In addition, the small number of parameters of 3DeepM make it ideal for application in online classification systems aboard autonomous robots or unmanned vehicles.

AB Recent studies have recently exploited knowledge distillation (KD) technique to address time-consuming annotation task in semantic segmentation, through which one teacher trained on a single dataset could be leveraged for annotating unlabeled data. However, in this context, knowledge capacity is restricted, and knowledge variety is rare in different conditions, such as cross-model KD, in which the single teacher KD prohibits the student model from distilling information using cross-domain context. In this study, we aim to train a robust, lightweight student under the supervision of several expert teachers, which provide better instructive guidance compared to a single student-teacher learning framework. To be more specific, we first train five distinct convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as teachers for semantic segmentation on several datasets. To this end, several state-of-the-art augmentation transformations have also been utilized in training phase of our teachers. The impacts of such training scenarios are then assessed in terms of student robustness and accuracy. As the main contribution of this paper, our proposed multi-teacher KD paradigm endows the student with the ability to amalgamate and capture a variety of knowledge illustrations from different sources. Results demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing studies on both clean and corrupted data in the semantic segmentation task while benefiting from our proposed score weight system. Experiments validate that our multi-teacher framework results in an improvement of 9% up to 32.18% compared to the single-teacher paradigm. Moreover, it is demonstrated that our paradigm surpasses previous supervised real-time studies in the semantic segmentation challenge.

AB In recent years there has been increased demand for readiness and availability metrics across many industries and especially in national defense to enable data-driven decision making at all levels of planning, maintenance, and operations, and in leveraging integrated models that inform stakeholders of current operational system health and performance metrics. The digital twin (DT) has been identified as a promising approach for deploying these models to fielded systems although several challenges exist in wide adoption and implementation. Two challenges examined in this article are that the nature of DT development is a system-specific endeavor, and the development is usually an additional effort that begins after initial system fielding. A fundamental challenge with DT development, which sets it apart from traditional models, is the DT itself is treated as a separate system, and therefore the physical asset/DT construct becomes a system-of-systems problem. This article explores how objectives in DT development align with those of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), and how the MBSE process can answer questions necessary to define the DT. The key benefits to the approach are leveraging work already being performed during system synthesis and DT development is pushed earlier in a system's lifecycle. This article contributes to the definition and development processes for DTs by proposing a DT development model and path, a method for scoping and defining requirements for a DT, and an approach to integrate DT and system development. An example case study of a Naval unmanned system is presented to illustrate the contributions.

AB Forming spawning aggregations is a critical life-history activity for fish, but it is unclear what physical conditions are associated with fish behavior at specific sites. The habitat, movements and distribution of blackfin snapper Lutjanus fulvus at a monthly aggregation site in Palau were studied using a combination of instruments and approaches, including active/passive acoustics, time-lapse cameras, an autonomous underwater vehicle, current profilers, and high resolution bathymetry. We found that L. fulvus predictably form a large pre-spawning aggregation of an estimated 15 000 fish in a small zone (10s of m) in a tidally forced channel. The aggregation spans 125 m along the northern channel wall, with the highest densities of fish from 9 to 13 m and <15 m from the wall where current velocities are <0.25 m s(-1). The aggregation occurs within an indent in the channel wall where an abrupt change in bathymetry creates a visible eddy-like feature during outgoing tides. The aggregation forms year-round, for 6 d each moon cycle, starting 1 d before the full moon to 4 d after. During the study, 4 tagged fish returned to the site for 6 consecutive lunar cycles; however, residency times within aggregation periods was similar to 1.5 d on average. Densely aggregated fish were present during the day, but migration patterns of tagged fish revealed regular evening migrations to and from the channel mouth, consistently at the highest tide of the day, a behavior assumed for spawning. These observations reveal some physical processes and biological patterns surrounding the formation and function of fish aggregations.

AB Context. The first data release from the Gaia mission contains accurate positions and magnitudes for more than a billion sources, and proper motions and parallaxes for the majority of the 2.5 million HIPPARCOS and Tycho-2 stars.
   Aims. We describe three essential elements of the initial data treatment leading to this catalogue: the image analysis, the construction of a source list, and the near real-time monitoring of the payload health. We also discuss some weak points that set limitations for the attainable precision at the present stage of the mission.
   Methods. Image parameters for point sources are derived from one-dimensional scans, using a maximum likelihood method, under the assumption of a line spread function constant in time, and a complete modelling of bias and background. These conditions are, however, not completely fulfilled. The Gaia source list is built starting from a large ground-based catalogue, but even so a significant number of new entries have been added, and a large number have been removed. The autonomous onboard star image detection will pick up many spurious images, especially around bright sources, and such unwanted detections must be identified. Another key step of the source list creation consists in arranging the more than 1010 individual detections in spatially isolated groups that can be analysed individually.
   Results. Complete software systems have been built for the Gaia initial data treatment, that manage approximately 50 million focal plane transits daily, giving transit times and fluxes for 500 million individual CCD images to the astrometric and photometric processing chains. The software also carries out a successful and detailed daily monitoring of Gaia health.

AB Robotic sampling is attractive in many field robotics applications that require persistent collection of physical samples for ex-situ analysis. Examples abound in the earth sciences in studies involving the collection of rock, soil, and water samples for laboratory analysis. In our test domain, marine ecosystem monitoring, detailed understanding of plankton ecology requires laboratory analysis of water samples, but predictions using physical and chemical properties measured in real-time by sensors aboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can guide sample collection decisions. In this paper, we present a data-driven and opportunistic sampling strategy to minimize cumulative regret for batches of plankton samples acquired by an AUV over multiple surveys. Samples are labeled at the end of each survey, and used to update a probabilistic model that guides sampling during subsequent surveys. During a survey, the AUV makes irrevocable sample collection decisions online for a sequential stream of candidates, with no knowledge of the quality of future samples. In addition to extensive simulations using historical field data, we present results from a one-day field trial where beginning with a prior model learned from data collected and labeled in an earlier campaign, the AUV collected water samples with a high abundance of a pre-specified planktonic target. This is the first time such a field experiment has been carried out in its entirety in a data-driven fashion, in effect closing the loop on a significant and relevant ecosystem monitoring problem while allowing domain experts (marine ecologists) to specify the mission at a relatively high level.

TI Decentralized Guidance Control of UAVs with Explicit Optimization of
   Communication
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Decentralized partially observable Markov decision process; UAV guidance
   control; Decentralized control; Target tracking
AB We design a decentralized guidance control method for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tracking multiple targets. We formulate this guidance control problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP). As in the case of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), it is intractable to solve a Dec-POMDP exactly. So, we extend a POMDP approximation method called nominal belief-state optimization (NBO) to solve our control problem posed as a Dec-POMDP. We incorporate the cost of communication into the objective function of the Dec-POMDP, i.e., we explicitly optimize the communication among the UAVs at the network level along with the kinematic control commands for the UAVs. We measure the performance of our method with the following metrics: 1) average target-location error, and 2) average communication cost. The goal to maximize the performance with respect to each of the above metrics conflict with each other, and we show through empirical study how to trade off between these performance metrics using a scalar parameter. The NBO method induces coordination among the UAVs even though the system is decentralized. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this coordination, we compare our Dec-POMDP approach with a greedy approach (a noncooperative approach), where the UAVs do not communicate with each other and each UAV optimizes only its local kinematic controls. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our approach of optimizing the communication between the UAVs with a fixed communication scheme-where only the UAV kinematic controls are optimized with an underlying fixed (non-optimized) communication scheme.

This study is focused on a magnetic field low extending several kilometers along axis, coincident with a trough created by the draining of a lava lake during a highly effusive fissure eruption at 17degrees28'S. Similar lows are observed at three other drained lava lake troughs, including one which is at least 1800 years old, residing 400 m away from the present-day axis. We attribute these lows to the presence of shallow dike swarms. The degree to which other geologic features may contribute to the lows is constrained using geologic, geophysical, and geochemical observations and forward modeling. Compositional analyses of Alvin samples at 17degrees28'S do not support Fe or Ti variations as a primary source. Hypotheses requiring hydrothermal alteration and porosity variations are both inconsistent with geologic observations and near-bottom gravity data analysis from similar areas. Previous mappings between paleointensity variations and the observed magnetic field over distances of several kilometers from the axis suggest that such variations do not create the field low. The dominant source of the magnetization low is most likely the presence of a 100-200 m wide region of shallow dikes which are poorly magnetized relative to extrusives, or a region heated above magnetic blocking or Curie temperatures by intrusions during the most recent eruption (though the latter interpretation cannot explain the low at the fossil trough). In the first case, this extrusive thinning implies a change in eruptive behavior over the last 750-1500 years given the local spreading rate. For the latter case, thermal models suggest the anomaly had to have been created by a dike swarms totaling at least 45 m width during the most recent eruption(s), corresponding to 300 years of plate spreading. Models indicate that the source of the low is centered slightly east of the axial trough. This offset suggests that the axis has been progressively migrating westward over the past millennium, consistent with other studies covering greater length and timescales. Westward migration provides an explanation for the preferential emplacement of recent lavas flows west of the axis, evident in ABE bathymetry and submersible observations.

AB The evolving need for all-weather light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors and cameras for autonomous vehicles, remote sensing surveillance, and space exploration has spurred the development of transparent heaters. While LiDAR photon sources have shifted from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) range, the use of transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) for heaters leads to significant optical losses due to their high plasmonic absorption and reflection in the NIR range. Although different TCO compositions can be employed to preserve transparency and electrical conductivity in this range, the choice of dopants, their concentrations, and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we present TCOs specifically designed for NIR applications with a focus on identifying new compositions that strike a balance between NIR transparency and electrical conductivity. We present a 4B-6B transition-metal-doped indium oxide thin-film heater that exhibits impressive NIR transmittance (>90%) surpassing that of commonly used indium tin oxide films. By incorporating effective dopants such as titanium, hafnium, and tungsten, we successfully reduced the resistivity and enhanced the electrical conductivity of indium oxide films. To enhance the practical utility of the film, we implemented post-treatments comprising argon plasma treatment and encapsulation with low-molecular-weight poly-(dimethylsiloxane), which resulted in significantly improved performance. The optimized film exhibited a sheet resistance of 520 Omega/sq and excellent optical transmittance at 850 nm (89.1%), 905 nm (89.7%), and 1550 nm (92%). Moreover, we successfully integrated defogging and defrosting capabilities into a commercial LiDAR camera and demonstrated its reliable operation in challenging environments.

AB Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to global health. Although immunizations can control most viral infections, bacterial infections, particularly those caused by drug-resistant strains, continue to cause high rates of illness and death. Unfortunately, the creation of new antibiotics has come to a grinding halt in the last ten years. In response to this crisis, nanotechnology has emerged as a hopeful solution to tackle drug resistance and enhance treatment results. A large variety of biomimetic nanomaterials, termed nanozymes, have demonstrated strong antimicrobial efficacy. While the inherent toxicity of nanomaterials is a concern, recent studies have harnessed the stimuli-responsiveness of nanomaterials to enable local and/or targeted delivery to reduce the treatment side effects. Indeed, the physicochemical versatility of nanomaterials affords many degrees of freedom that enable rational design of smart or autonomous therapeutics, which cannot be achieved using conventional antibiotics. The design straddles the fields of catalysis, nanoscience, microbiology, and translational medicine. To provide an overview of this interdisciplinary landscape, this review is organized based on composition into lipid, metal, metal oxide, and non-metallic nanomaterials. Liposomes as a delivery vehicle enhance bioavailability and reduce toxicity. Metal- and metal oxide-based nanomaterials inhibit bacterial growth by mimicking natural enzymatic activities such as peroxidase (POD) and oxidase. Furthermore, carbon-, polymer-, and cell membrane-based nanomaterials are combined into a discussion on non-metallic materials. At the end of this review, potentially fruitful directions for future bioinspired nanomaterials in infectious disease treatment are included.

AB Short-wavelength infrared photodetectors play a significant role in various fields such as autonomous driving, military security, and biological medicine. However, state-of-the-art short-wavelength infrared photodetectors, such as InGaAs, require high-temperature fabrication and heterogenous integration with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) readout circuits (ROIC), resulting in a high cost and low imaging resolution. Herein, for the first time, a low-cost, high-performance, high-stable, and thin-film transistor (TFT) ROIC monolithic-integrated (Bi,Sb)(2)Se-3 alloy thin-film short-wavelength infrared photodetector is reported. The (Bi,Sb)(2)Se-3 alloy thin-film short-wavelength infrared photodetectors demonstrate a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 21.1% (light intensity of 0.76 mu W cm(-2)) and a fast response time (3.24 mu s). The highest EQE is about two magnitudes than that of the extrinsic photoconduction of Sb2Se3 (0.051%). In addition, the unpackaged devices demonstrate high electric and thermal stability (almost no attenuation at 120 degree celsius for 312 h), showing potential for in-vehicle applications that may experient such a high temperature. Finally, both the (Bi,Sb)(2)Se-3 alloy thin film and n-type CdSe buffer layer are directly deposited on the TFT ROIC (with a 64 x 64-pixel array) with a low-temperature process and the material identification and imaging applications are presented. This work is a significant breakthrough in ROIC monolithic-integrated short-wavelength infrared imaging chips.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive forest mapping system using a customized drone payload equipped with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), cameras, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The goal is to develop an efficient solution for collecting accurate forest data in dynamic environments and to highlight potential wildfire regions of interest to support precise forest management and conservation on the ground. Our paper provides a detailed description of the hardware and software components of the system, covering sensor synchronization, data acquisition, and processing. The overall system implements simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, particularly Fast LiDAR Inertial Odometry with Scan Context (FASTLIO-SC), and LiDAR Inertial Odometry Smoothing and Mapping (LIOSAM), for accurate odometry estimation and map generation. We also integrate a fuel mapping representation based on one of the models, used by the United States Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to classify fire behavior, into the system using semantic segmentation, LiDAR camera registration, and odometry as inputs. Real-time representation of fuel properties is achieved through a lightweight map data structure at 4 Hz. The research results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed system and show that it can provide accurate forest data collection, accurate pose estimation, and comprehensive fuel mapping with precision values for the main segmented classes above 85%. Qualitative evaluations suggest the system's capabilities and highlight its potential to improve forest management and conservation efforts. In summary, this study presents a versatile forest mapping system that provides accurate forest data for effective management.

AB The large amount of debris in our oceans is a global problem that dramatically impacts marine fauna and flora. While a large number of human-based campaigns have been proposed to tackle this issue, these effort s have been deemed insufficient due to the insurmountable amount of existing litter. In re-sponse to that, there exists a high interest in the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) that may locate, identify, and collect this garbage automatically. To perform such a task, AUVs consider state-of-the-art object detection techniques based on deep neural networks due to their reported high performance. Nevertheless, these techniques generally require large amounts of data with fine-grained annotations. In this work, we explore the capabilities of the reference object detector Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks for automatic marine debris location and classification in the context of limited data availability. Considering the recent CleanSea corpus, we pose several scenarios regarding the amount of available train data and study the possibility of mitigating the adverse effects of data scarcity with syn-thetic marine scenes. Our results achieve a new state of the art in the task, establishing a new reference for future research. In addition, it is shown that the task still has room for improvement and that the lack of data can be somehow alleviated, yet to a limited extent.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

   path planning
AB The technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been growing rapidly in recent years. To achieve highly autonomous flight capability, collision-free path generation becomes a key research topic. However, for a large-scale terrain map, an efficient path searching algorithm is always a challenging problem. Based on the Goal-bias Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (GB-RRT*) together with the aid of a bidirectional search technique, in this paper, a new constrained path planning algorithm, called Parent Revisited Goal and Parent Bias RRT* (PRGPB-RRT*), is proposed. Three major objectives are considered as the development benchmark: 1). shorter total distance, 2). smoother flight path, and 3). high computational efficiency. To meet different task requirements, a dynamic path planning method is investigated to diminish the high costs due to large-scale environments and keep track of the changing destination by finding local target points. In addition, unknown object avoidance is an essential part of flight path planning. As a consequence, the Fitting-Octree is presented to partition the point clouds into multiple cubes to represent the obstacles precisely. Moreover, the method of grouping point clouds into clusters effectively increases the efficiency of the implementation under a large number of obstacles. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified by a real-world 3D large-scale point cloud map. Experiments show that the proposed method successfully enhances the path generation efficiency as well as the trajectory smoothness. Moreover, the presented PRGPB-RRT* can be applied to different intelligent UAVs subject to flight kinematics constrain.

AB Aiming at the problem of a large number of small dense objects in high-altitude shooting and complex background noise interference in the captured scenes, an improved object detection algorithm for YOLOv5 UAV capture scenes is proposed. A Feature Enhancement Block (FEBlock) is first proposed to generate adaptive weights for different receptive field features by convolution, assigning major weights to shallow feature maps to improve small object feature extraction ability. The FEBlock is then integrated into Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) to generate Enhanced Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ESPP), which performs feature enhancement for the result of each maximum pooling; and creates new features containing multi-scale contextual information with better feature characterization capability by weighting fused contextual features. Secondly, the Self-Characteristic Expansion Plate (SCEP) is proposed, which achieves the fusion and expansion of feature information through compression, non-linear mapping, and expansion with its own module, further improving the network's capacity for feature extraction and generating a new spatial pyramid pooling (ESPP-S) by splicing with ESPP. Finally, a shallower feature map is added as a detection layer to the YOLOv5 network model's large, medium, and small detection layers to improve the network's detection performance for medium and long-range objects. Experiments were conducted on the VisDrone2021 dataset, and the results showed that the improved YOLOv5 model improved mAP0.5 by 4.6%, mAP0.5:0.95 by 2.9%, and precision by 2.7%. The mAP0.5 of the model trained at the input resolution of 1024x1024 reached56.8%. The experiments show that the improved YOLOv5 model can improve object detection accuracy for UAV capture scenes.

AB The chemical composition of the soils (Haplic Andosols) of Shikotan Island (Lesser Kuril Chain) formed on volcanic rocks of different compositions and ages has been studied. The background content of metals (Ba, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Pb, Cd, Cr, Fe, V, Sc, K, Sr, Na, Ca, Mo) in soils was estimated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with complete acid digestion of samples. Bulk contents of chemical elements undergo abrupt changes and depend on bedrock composition, zonal and azonal geochemical landscape differentiation, influence of oceanic air masses, and the composition of plant communities. High natural concentrations (exceeding element abundances in the Earth's crust (clarkes)) of femaphile elements (Sc, V, Fe, Cu, Zn) are typical for the soils. The concentrations of Ca, Mo, Cd, and Pb are comparable to the clarkes and concentrations of K, Cr, Ni, Sr, and Ba are lower than their clarkes. The main factor of migration and accumulation of chemical elements in the studied soil is soil acid-base conditions depending on the ratio between intermediate and mafic rocks. Humid climate and contrasting relief of the island cause intensive migration of chemical elements not only in dissolved but also in particulate forms. This leads to different distribution of lithophile and siderophile elements along soil catenas. Thus, Cr, Co, and Ni are fixed in topsoil of subordinate positions, while Cd and Pb are abundant in topsoil of autonomous positions. Statistical data processing included correlation, cluster, and principal component analyzes (Statistica 12.0). The results indicate local chemical contamination of soil within the settlement of Krabozavodskoe and in some areas affected by educational tourism. Vehicles are the main source of contamination.

AB This paper presents a competition-based active learning approach that prepares undergraduate students for careers in the drone industry. The competition-based learning (CBL) approach focuses on preparing students for three key drone industry requirements (1) drone assembly, testing, and validation using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts, (2) simulation of drone flight missions and (3) manual and semi-autonomous drone piloting. The CBL curricular modules were developed using the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework of cognitive engagement. These modules immersed students in the technical challenges corresponding to the three essential drone industry requirements. The approach was implemented through fourteen (14) drone workshops that culminated in a final drone piloting competition at a STEM research university in the United States. Ninety-seven (97) students from various backgrounds with little to no prior experience in building drones participated in the competition as part of 22 teams in total. Multiple assessment methods were used to evaluate the students' progress and the perceived drone-related skills gained by the end of the workshops. Assessment methods included data from direct formative (weekly or biweekly curricular milestones), direct summative (drone piloting for multiple flight tests), indirect quantitative (Likert-style feedback survey about student perceptions), and indirect qualitative (descriptive feedback comments) tools. Direct quantitative assessments indicated that most students successfully reached the technical milestones of the workshop sessions and gained practical drone piloting skills. The indirect quantitative assessment revealed that students perceived the workshops to be a valuable experience in their drone industry skills and knowledge. Indirect qualitative analysis of the feedback comments revealed that students perceived CBL as an engaging and effective method of introducing drone technology.

AB In recent years, flying ad hoc networks have attracted the attention of many researchers in industry and universities due to easy deployment, proper operational costs, and diverse applications. Designing an efficient routing protocol is challenging due to unique characteristics of these networks such as very fast motion of nodes, frequent changes of topology, and low density. Routing protocols determine how to provide communications between drones in a wireless ad hoc network. Today, reinforcement learning (RL) provides powerful solutions to solve the existing problems in the routing protocols, and designs autonomous, adaptive, and self-learning routing protocols. The main purpose of these routing protocols is to ensure a stable routing solution with low delay and minimum energy consumption. In this paper, the reinforcement learning-based routing methods in FANET are surveyed and studied. Initially, reinforcement learning, the Markov decision process (MDP), and reinforcement learning algorithms are briefly described. Then, flying ad hoc networks, various types of drones, and their applications, are introduced. Furthermore, the routing process and its challenges are briefly explained in FANET. Then, a classification of reinforcement learning-based routing protocols is suggested for the flying ad hoc networks. This classification categorizes routing protocols based on the learning algorithm, the routing algorithm, and the data dissemination process. Finally, we present the existing opportunities and challenges in this field to provide a detailed and accurate view for researchers to be aware of the future research directions in order to improve the existing reinforcement learning-based routing algorithms.

AB The past decade has witnessed the great success of deep neural networks in various domains. However, deep neural networks are very resource-intensive in terms of energy consumption, data requirements, and high computational costs. With the recent increasing need for the autonomy of machines in the real world, e.g., self-driving vehicles, drones, and collaborative robots, exploitation of deep neural networks in those applications has been actively investigated. In those applications, energy and computational efficiencies are especially important because of the need for real-time responses and the limited energy supply. A promising solution to these previously infeasible applications has recently been given by biologically plausible spiking neural networks. Spiking neural networks aim to bridge the gap between neuroscience and machine learning, using biologically realistic models of neurons to carry out the computation. Due to their functional similarity to the biological neural network, spiking neural networks can embrace the sparsity found in biology and are highly compatible with temporal code. Our contributions in this work are: (i) we give a comprehensive review of theories of biological neurons; (ii) we present various existing spike-based neuron models, which have been studied in neuroscience; (iii) we detail synapse models; (iv) we provide a review of artificial neural networks; (v) we provide detailed guidance on how to train spike-based neuron models; (vi) we revise available spike-based neuron frameworks that have been developed to support implementing spiking neural networks; (vii) finally, we cover existing spiking neural network applications in computer vision and robotics domains. The paper concludes with discussions of future perspectives.

AB Video segmentation has a major role in several applications like autonomous vehicles, medical image analysis, video surveillance, and augmented reality. Portrait segmentation, a subset of semantic image segmentation, is the key step of preprocessing step in numerous applications and a few among them are entertainment applications, security systems, video conferences, and so on. For the given video, every object exhibiting independent motion in at least a single frame is segmented. This is formulated as a learning problem and designed as an Ensemble Soft Voting Algorithm based on Supervised Machine Learning (ESVA-SML). The motion stream requires an ensemble learning method trained on synthetic videos for segmenting independent objects at motion in the optical flow field. The spatial-temporal features are extracted from each sub-bands which efficiently resembles the human visual system characteristics concerning the feature extract using Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM). This method linear combines the previous vectors within a stipulated time interval thereby describing each spatial-temporal feature vector. Based on the prediction errors, shot boundaries of every shot are efficiently identified from which at least a single keyframe is extracted for further analysis. The proposed method is extensively evaluated using SegTrack-v2, DAVIS, and Fusion databases by comparing eight standard methods in various parameters. By analyzing all these three databases, SegTrack-v2 is best in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. While both DAVIS and Fusion databases produce less MAE. Finally, Fusion produces less RMSE and RAE with minimal response time.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Maritime traffic routes by ships navigation vary according to country and geographic characteristics, and they differ according to the characteristics of the ships. In ocean areas adjacent to coasts, regulated routes are present, e.g., traffic separation scheme for ships entering and leaving; however, most ocean areas do not have such routes. Maritime traffic route research has been conducted based on computer engineering to create routes; however, ship characteristics were not considered. Thus, this article proposes a framework to generate maritime traffic routes using statistical density analysis. Here, automatic identification system (AIS) data are used to derive quantitative traffic routes. Preprocessing is applied to the AIS data, and a similar ship trajectory pattern is decomposed into a matrix based on the Hausdorff-distance algorithm and then stored in a database. A similar pattern makes the AIS trajectory simple using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. In addition, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is performed to identify the waypoints of vessels then create routes by connecting waypoints. The width of maritime routes created based on a similar ship trajectory is subjected to kernel density estimation analysis (KDE). Then, waypoints evaluation of the main route is performed from the results of KDE 75% and 90% considering the statistical in the total maritime traffic, and the results applied to the targeted ocean area are compared. Finally, the result of KDE 90% of maritime traffic with framework analyzed the safety route, which can be a basis for developing routes for maritime autonomous surface ships.

AB Radar sensors are crucial for environment perception of driver assistance systems as well as autonomous vehicles. With a rising number of radar sensors and the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency band, mutual interference is inevitable and must be dealt with. Algorithms and models operating on radar data are required to run the early processing steps on specialized radar sensor hardware. This specialized hardware typically has strict resource-constraints, i.e. a low memory capacity and low computational power. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield promising results for radar processing in terms of performance. Regarding resource-constraints, however, CNNs typically exceed the hardware's capacities by far. In this paper we investigate quantization techniques for CNN-based denoising and interference mitigation of radar signals. We analyze the quantization of (i) weights and (ii) activations of different CNN-based model architectures. This quantization results in reduced memory requirements for model storage and during inference. We compare models with fixed and learned bit-widths and contrast two different methodologies for training quantized CNNs, i.e. the straight-through gradient estimator and training distributions over discrete weights. We illustrate the importance of structurally small real-valued base models for quantization and show that learned bit-widths yield the smallest models. We achieve a memory reduction of around 80% compared to the real-valued baseline. Due to practical reasons, however, we recommend the use of 8 bits for weights and activations, which results in models that require only 0.2 megabytes of memory.

AB Creating 3D models of the static environment is an important task for the advancement of driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. In this work, a static reference map is created from a Mobile Mapping "light detection and ranging" (LiDAR) dataset. The data was obtained in 14 measurement runs from March to October 2017 in Hannover and consists in total of about 15 billion points. The point cloud data are first segmented by region growing and then processed by a random forest classification, which divides the segments into the five static classes ("facade", "pole", "fence", "traffic sign", and "vegetation") and three dynamic classes ("vehicle", "bicycle", "person") with an overall accuracy of 94%. All static objects are entered into a voxel grid, to compare different measurement epochs directly. In the next step, the classified voxels are combined with the result of a visibility analysis. Therefore, we use a ray tracing algorithm to detect traversed voxels and differentiate between empty space and occlusion. Each voxel is classified as suitable for the static reference map or not by its object class and its occupation state during different epochs. Thereby, we avoid to eliminate static voxels which were occluded in some of the measurement runs (e.g. parts of a building occluded by a tree). However, segments that are only temporarily present and connected to static objects, such as scaffolds or awnings on buildings, are not included in the reference map. Overall, the combination of the classification with the subsequent entry of the classes into a voxel grid provides good and useful results that can be updated by including new measurement data.

AB Currently, the application of mobile ground robots spans a range of fields from surveillance, search and rescue, exploration, agriculture, military among others. In unstructured and dangerous environments such as disaster scene, military fields or chemical spray in agricultural farms, the experience and intelligence of the operator are necessary for making complex decisions beyond the autonomy of the robot. In such cases, teleoperation allow the operator to guide the robot in achieving complex task from a safe location. The effectiveness with which the operator controls the robot depends on, among others, operator's awareness of the robot's environment, the quality of communication link, the robustness of robot's control system and experience of the human operator. Ground mobile robots form the basis of this work since they are applicable in many fields and mostly operate in dynamic environments that require additional guidance from a human operator. This study reviews research work on mobile robot teleoperation systems, and puts more emphasis on the architecture, communication link and situation awareness creation. Moreover, future trend in mobile robot teleoperation is also put forward in this review to give ground for new research work in this field. Based on the sited literature, it is noted that making the operator feel present in the robot's environment through sufficient visual and force feedback as well as use of good quality network, significantly improve the navigation efficiency and task achievement of mobile ground robots.

TI Investigation into the Tip-Gap Flow and Its Influence on Ducted
   Propeller Tip-Gap Noise Using Acoustic Analogies
SO JOURNAL OF SHIP RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE tip gap flow; aeroacoustics; ducted propeller; acoustic analogy
AB Ducted propellers are commonly used on naval vessels such as submarines and increasingly more in omnipresent autonomous underwater vehicles. Understanding the noise signature of these vessels is of critical importance from both detection and concealment perspective, but the detailed physics of how the tip of the propeller blade interacts with the boundary layer on the duct is not sufficiently well understood. The present study introduces a series of simulations in which tip vortices formed over finite-span lifting surfaces are investigated with the aim of better understanding interactions of tip-gap flow and its interaction with incident boundary layers on radiated noise. Particular attention is devoted to characterizing the nature of the incipient complex flow features and their effect on the force coefficients, surface pressure fluctuations. These reveal that variations of force coefficients with tip-gap height may be used as an early indicator of tip vortex being suppressed as the gap is reduced. Use of the lambda(2) criterion identifies the formation of strong coherent vortical structures in the tip-gap region. It is suggested that the interaction of these structures with the tip edges is likely to be an important source of noise, with a similar generation mechanism to trailing edge noise. Preliminary analysis of the acoustic signatures computed using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy indicates high levels of directivity, with most of the noise being generated by the foil rather than the duct. The presence of substantial amounts of vorticity in the flow also suggests that accounting for the nonlinear quadrupole noise sources within the fluid might be necessary to fully describe the noise pattern developed.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a broad application prospect in the future, especially in the Industry 4.0. The development of Internet of Drones (IoD) makes UAV operation more autonomous. Network virtualization technology is a promising technology to support IoD, so the allocation of virtual resources becomes a crucial issue in IoD. How to rationally allocate potential material resources has become an urgent problem to be solved. The main work of this paper is presented as follows: (a) In order to improve the optimization performance and reduce the computation time, we propose a multidomain virtual network embedding algorithm (MP-VNE) adopting the centralized hierarchical multidomain architecture. The proposed algorithm can avoid the local optimum through incorporating the genetic variation factor into the traditional particle swarm optimization process. (b) In order to simplify the multiobjective optimization problem, we transform the multiobjective problem into a single-objective problem through weighted summation method. The results prove that the proposed algorithm can rapidly converge to the optimal solution. (c) In order to reduce the mapping cost, we propose an algorithm for selecting candidate nodes based on the estimated mapping cost. Each physical domain calculates the estimated mapping cost of all nodes according to the formula of the estimated mapping cost, and chooses the node with the lowest estimated mapping cost as the candidate node. The simulation results show that the proposed MP-VNE algorithm has better performance than MC-VNM, LID-VNE, and other algorithms in terms of delay, cost and comprehensive indicators.

AB Nowadays, Global Navigation Satellite Systems are the main source for high accuracy positioning and timing. For this reason, they are essential both for everyday activities and services, and for the industrial and critical infrastructure sectors. Moreover, the spread of increasingly autonomous vehicles results in strict accuracy and integrity requirements. This leads to the need for additional infrastructure to send corrections to the end users and mitigate the measurement errors, the Augmentation Networks. However, due to the increasing exploitation of localization functionalities, the Augmentation Networks could become a primary target for attackers resulting in a high financial and safety cost. Among the possible attacks, spoofing, that is the generation of a fake satellite signal which is seen as genuine by the receiver, is one of the most powerful and tricky. In this contribution, a detection and mitigation strategy for Augmentation Network spoofing attacks is proposed. We introduce two attack models and present a technique based on K-means clustering to counteract them. More in details, our approach is based on the computation of the number of clusters formed by the Augmentation Network corrections. Starting from the hypothesis that under nominal conditions only one cluster is present, the effects of the attacks on the clustering procedure are analyzed, and several attack simulations are performed to evaluate the algorithm performances. The proposed method has been compared both to an Augmentation Network attack detection technique, and to a receiver-level spoofing mitigation approach, showing comparable or better performances. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing mitigation for spoofing attacks which target an Augmentation Network.

AB Because of the complex task environment, long working distance, and random drift of the gyro, the positioning error gradually diverges with time in the design of a strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/Doppler velocity log (DVL) integrated positioning system. The use of velocity information in the DVL system cannot completely suppress the divergence of the SINS navigation error, which will result in low positioning accuracy and instability. To address this problem, this paper proposes a SINS/DVL integrated positioning system based on a filtering gain compensation adaptive filtering technology that considers the source of error in SINS and the mechanism that influences the positioning results. In the integrated positioning system, an organic combination of a filtering gain compensation adaptive filter and a filtering gain compensation strong tracking filter is explored to fuse position information to obtain higher accuracy and a more stable positioning result. Firstly, the system selects the indirect filtering method and uses the integrated positioning error to model the navigation parameters of the system. Then, a filtering gain compensation adaptive filtering method is developed by using the filtering gain compensation algorithm based on the error statistics of the positioning parameters. The positioning parameters of the system are filtered and information on errors in the navigation parameters is obtained. Finally, integrated with the positioning parameter error information, the positioning parameters of the system are solved, and high-precision positioning results are obtained to accurately position autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The simulation results show that the SINS/DVL integrated positioning method, based on the filtering gain compensation adaptive filtering technology, can effectively enhance the positioning accuracy.

AB Continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen, pH and carbon dioxide are of great importance in oceanography. Sensors are the optimal tools for in situ measurements from mobile platforms, like Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) or Argo profiling floats, and for shipboard deployments. A validation study of small, versatile, easy-to-use, stand-alone optodes is presented. Each analyte can be read out with the identical optoelectronics which greatly minimizes the costs of the hardware needed. Several deployments were performed to evaluate the applicability of the sensors. The deployments varied in terms of duration (profiling, long-term monitoring 5 days to 8 weeks) and environmental conditions (salinity: 6-33 PSS; temperature: 9-25 degrees C). A set of sensors was successfully deployed at a mooring buoy, in an aquaculture facility and in the Monterey Bay Aquarium Open Sea Exhibition. They were also integrated in an AUV and a profiling float. The performance of the optodes was evaluated in comparison with commercially available sensors for dissolved oxygen (Aanderaa Data Instruments AS, Sea-Bird Scientific, OxyGuarda), pH (Hach, Satlantic) and carbon dioxide (Turner design). The data collected by our optodes and the commercially available sensors is generally in good agreement showing that the new, compact sensor device in combination with sensor foils (pO(2), pH, pCO(2)) can be a valuable tool for many applications in oceanography. The data also revealed the importance of the calibration strategy since inappropriate calibration resulted in an offset in the measured parameter. The efficiency of simple biofouling protection strategy (copper guard) for prolong measurements in highly dynamic environments was also demonstrated.

AB The integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) real-time kinematics (RTK) and an inertial navigation system (INS) has been widely used in many applications, such as mobile mapping and autonomous vehicle control. Such applications require high-accuracy position information. However, continuous and reliable high-accuracy positioning is still challenging for GPS/INS integration in urban environments because of the limited satellite visibility, increasing multipath, and frequent signal blockages. Recently, with the rapid deployment of multi-constellation Global Navigation Satellite System (multi-GNSS) and the great advances in low-cost micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) inertial measurement units (IMUs), it is expected that the positioning performance could be improved significantly. In this contribution, the tightly-coupled single-frequency multi-GNSS RTK/MEMS-IMU integration is developed to provide precise and continuous positioning solutions in urban environments. The innovation-based outlier-resistant ambiguity resolution (AR) and Kalman filtering strategy are proposed specifically for the integrated system to resist the measurement outliers or poor-quality observations. A field vehicular experiment was conducted in Wuhan City to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results indicate that it is feasible for the proposed algorithm to obtain high-accuracy positioning solutions in the presence of measurement outliers. Moreover, the tightly-coupled single-frequency multi-GNSS RTK/MEMS-IMU integration even outperforms the dual-frequency multi-GNSS RTK in terms of AR and positioning performance for short baselines in urban environments.

TI Accurate and Robust Scene Reconstruction in the Presence of
   Misassociated Features for Aerial Sensing
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID IMAGE; INFRASTRUCTURE
AB Georeferencing through aerial imagery has several applications, including remote sensing, real-time situational mission awareness, environmental monitoring, rescue and relief, map generation, autonomous hazard avoidance, and landing and navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In aerial imagery, structure from motion (SfM) is often used for three-dimensional (3D) point reconstruction (i.e., ground locations) and for camera pose estimation (i.e., airborne position and orientation) from a set of geometrically matched features between two-dimensional (2D) images. In order to improve the correspondence estimation, outliers (defined as gross misassociated features) are determined and excluded using an outlier rejection algorithm such as random sample consensus (RANSAC); however, in practice, it is impossible to ensure that outlier rejection algorithms always lead to perfect feature correspondences. Consequently, there remain misassociations between matched features in different views that significantly lower the accuracy and robustness of 3D scene reconstruction algorithms. This paper introduces an adaptive resection-intersection bundle adjustment approach that refines the 3D points and camera poses separately after the gross misassociations are removed by an outlier rejection algorithm. For each iteration, the proposed approach identifies the potential misassociated features independently in the resection as well as the intersection stage, where these potential outliers, contrary to previous studies, are reexamined at later iterations. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed approach leads to smaller 3D reconstruction errors by rejecting almost all of the misassociations as outliers while the maximum number of inlier matched features are retained. The results from several numerical simulations and real data sets are presented, and it is shown that the proposed approach outperforms existing bundle adjustment (BA) approaches in the presence of misassociated features although the convergence rate is slower.

AB A calibrated 120 kHz single-beam echo-sounder was integrated into an ocean glider and deployed in the Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean. The glider was deployed for two short periods in January 2012, in separate survey boxes on the continental shelf to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula, to assess the distribution of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). During the glider missions, a research vessel undertook acoustic transects using a calibrated, hull-mounted, multi-frequency echo-sounder. Net hauls were taken to validate acoustic targets and parameterize acoustic models. Krill targets were identified using a thresholded schools analysis technique (SHAPES), and acoustic data were converted to krill density using the stochastic distorted-wave Born approximation (SDWBA) target strength model. A sensitivity analysis of glider pitch and roll indicated that, if not taken into account, glider orientation can impact density estimates by up to 8-fold. Glider-based, echo-sounder-derived krill density profiles for the two survey boxes showed features coherent with ship-borne measurements, with peak densities in both boxes around a depth of 60 m. Monte Carlo simulation of glider subsampling of ship-borne data showed no significant difference from observed profiles. Simulated glider dives required at least an order of magnitude more time than the ship to similarly estimate the abundance of krill within the sample regions. These analyses highlight the need for suitable sampling strategies for glider-based observations and are our first steps toward using autonomous underwater vehicles for ecosystem assessment and long-term monitoring. With appropriate survey design, gliders can be used for estimating krill distribution and abundance.

AB Objective: The Vision Zero initiative pursues the goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities and severe injuries. Today's advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are an important part of the strategy toward Vision Zero. In Germany in 2018 more than 26,000 people were killed or severely injured by traffic accidents on motorways and rural roads due to road accidents. Focusing on collision avoidance, a simulative evaluation can be the key to estimating the performance of state-of-the-art ADAS and identifying resulting potentials for system improvements and future systems. This project deals with the effectiveness assessment of a combination of ADAS for longitudinal and lateral intervention based on German accident data. Considered systems are adaptive cruise control (ACC), autonomous emergency braking (AEB), and lane keeping support (LKS). Methods: As an approach for benefit estimation of ADAS, the method of prospective effectiveness assessment is applied. Using the software rateEFFECT, a closed-loop simulation is performed on accident scenario data from the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) precrash matrix (PCM). To enable projection of results, the simulative assessment is amended with detailed single case studies of all treated cases without PCM data. Results: Three categories among today's accidents on German rural roads and motorways are reported in this study: Green, grey, and white spots. Green spots identify accidents that can be avoided by state-of-the-art ADAS ACC, AEB, and LKS. Grey spots contain scenarios that require minor system modifications, such as reducing the activation speed or increasing the steering torque. Scenarios in the white category cannot be addressed by state-of-the-art ADAS. Thus, which situations demand future systems are shown. The proportions of green, grey, and white spots are determined related to the considered data set and projected to the entire GIDAS. Conclusions: This article describes a systematic approach for assessing the effectiveness of ADAS using GIDAS PCM data to be able to project results to Germany. The closed-loop simulation run in rateEFFECT covers ACC, AEB, and LKS as well as relevant sensors for environment recognition and actuators for longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. Identification of green spots evaluates safety benefits of state-of-the-art level 0-2 functions as a baseline for further system improvements to address grey spots. Knowing which accidents could be avoided by standard ADAS helps focus the evolution of future driving functions on white spots and thus aim for Vision Zero.

AB In late 2010, the DLR Space Administration invited the German industry to submit a proposal for a study about a Mobile Payload Element (MPE), which could be a German national contribution to the ESA Lunar Lander Mission. Several spots in the south polar region of the moon come into consideration as landing site for this mission. All possible spots provide sustained periods of solar illumination, interrupted by darkness periods of several 10 h. The MPE is outlined to be a small, autonomous, innovative vehicle in the 10 kg class for scouting and sampling the environment in the vicinity of the lunar landing site. The novel capabilities of the MPE will be to acquire samples of lunar regolith from surface, subsurface as well as shadowed locations, define their geological context and bring them back to the lander. This will enable access to samples that are not contaminated by the lander descent propulsion system plumes to increase the chances of detecting any indigenous lunar volatiles contained within the samples.
   Kayser-Threde, as prime industrial contractor for Phase 0/A, has assembled for this study a team of German partners with relevant industrial and institutional competence in space robotics and lunar science. The primary scientific objective of the MPE is to acquire clearly documented samples and to bring them to the lander for analysis with the onboard Lunar Dust Analysis Package (L-DAP) and Lunar Volatile Resources Analysis Package (L-VRAP). Due to the unstable nature of volatiles, which are of particular scientific interest, the MPE design needs to provide a safe storage and transportation of the samples to the lander.
   The proposed MPE rover concept has a four-wheeled chassis configuration with active suspension, being a compromise between innovation and mass efficiency. The suspension chosen allows a compact stowage of the MPE on the lander as well as precise alignment of the solar generators and instruments. Since therefore no further complex mechanics are necessary, the active suspension significantly contributes to the lightweight MPE design. The thermal control system enables the MPE to operate in shaded areas for about 2 h and hibernate darkness periods of about 14 h. Increasing the hibernation capability requires additional battery capacity and thus increases the MPE mass. As operational modes teleoperations from earth and autonomous navigation are foreseen. The MPE payload includes navigation cameras, a close-up imager and a mole as sampling device.
   The MPE phase 0/A study finished in early 2012. This article describes the resulting MPE rover concept with focus on its scientific benefit for the Lunar Lander Mission. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The 2-week campaign lasting from June 1 to June 14, 2015, was carried out at the Middle and Upper Atmosphere (MU) Observatory in Shigaraki, Japan. During the campaign, the DataHawk UAV, developed at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and equipped with high-frequency response cold wire and pitot tube sensors (as well as an iMET radiosonde), was flown near and over the VHF-band MU radar. Measurements in the atmospheric column in the immediate vicinity of the radar were obtained. Simultaneous and continuous operation of the radar in range imaging mode enabled fine-scale structures in the atmosphere to be visualized by the radar. It also permitted the UAV to be commanded to sample interesting structures, guided in near real time by the radar images. This overview provides a description of the ShUREX campaign and some interesting but preliminary results of the very first simultaneous and intensive probing of turbulent structures by UAVs and the MU radar. The campaign demonstrated the validity and utility of the radar range imaging technique in obtaining very high vertical resolution (similar to 20 m) images of echo power in the atmospheric column, which display evolving fine-scale atmospheric structures in unprecedented detail. The campaign also permitted for the very first time the evaluation of the consistency of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates in turbulent structures inferred from the spectral broadening of the backscattered radar signal and direct, in situ measurements by the highfrequency response velocity sensor on the UAV. The data also enabled other turbulence parameters such as the temperature structure function parameter C-T(2) and refractive index structure function parameter C-n(2) and to be measured by sensors on the UAV, along with radar-inferred refractive index structure function parameter C-n(2) ; radar. The comprehensive dataset collected during the campaign (from the radar, the UAV, the boundary layer lidar, the ceilometer, and radiosondes) is expected to help obtain a better understanding of turbulent atmospheric structures, as well as arrive at a better interpretation of the radar data.

AB The development of quantitative zooplankton collecting systems began with Hensen (1887 Berichte der Kommssion wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung der deutschen Meere in Kiel 5, 1-107; 1895 Ergebnisse der Plankton-Expedition der Humbolt-Stiftung. Kiel and Leipzig: Lipsius and Tischer). Non-opening closing nets, opening closing nets (mostly messenger based), high-speed samplers, and planktobenthos net systems all had their start in his era-the late 1800s and early 1900s. This was also an era in which many of the fundamental questions about the structure and dynamics of the plankton in the worlds oceans were first posed. Fewer new systems were introduced between 1912 and 1950 apparently due in part to the two World Wars. The continuous plankton recorder stands out as a truly innovative device developed during this period (Hardy 1926b Nature, London 118, 630). Resurgence in development of mechanically-based instruments occurred during the 1950s and 1960s. A new lineage of high-speed samplers, the Gulf series, began in the 1950s and a number of variants were developed in the 1960s and 1970s. Net systems specifically designed to collect neuston first appeared in the late 1950s. During the 1960s, many focused field and experimental tank experiments were carried out to investigate the hydrodynamics of nets, and much of our knowledge concerning net design and construction criteria was developed. The advent of reliable electrical conducting cables and electrically-based control systems during this same period gave rise first to a variety of cod-end samplers and then to the precursors of the acoustically and electronically-control led multi-net systems and environmental sensors, which appeared in the 1970s. The decade of the 1970s saw a succession of multi-net systems based both on the 136 multiple plankton sampler and on the Tucker trawl. The advent of the micro-computer stimulated and enabled the development of sophisticated control and data logging electronics for these systems in the 1980s. In the 1990s, acoustic and optical technologies gave rise to sensor systems that either complement multiple net systems or are deployed without nets. Multi-sensor systems with high data telemetry rates through electro-optical cable are now being deployed in towed bodies and on remotely operated vehicles. In the offing are new molecular technologies to identify species in situ, and realtime data analysis, image processing, and 3D/4D display. In the near future, it is likely that the use of multi-sensor systems deployed on autonomous vehicles will yield world wide coverage of the distribution and abundance of zooplankton.

AB Objective: The objective was to quantify head injury metric sensitivity of the 50th percentile male Hybrid III, THOR, and Global Human Body Models Consortium simplified occupant (GHBMC M50-OS) to changes in loading conditions in loading regimes that may be experienced by occupants of spaceflight vehicles or highly autonomous vehicles (HAVs) with nontraditional seating configurations. Methods: A Latin hypercube (LHD) design of experiments (DOE) was employed to develop boundary conditions for 455 unique acceleration profiles. Three previously validated finite element (FE) models of the Hybrid III anthropomorphic test device (ATD), THOR ATD, and GHBMC M50-OS were positioned in an upright 90 degrees-90 degrees-90 degrees seat and with a 5-point belt. Acceleration pulses were applied to each of the three occupants in the +/- X, +Y, and +/- Z directions, with peak resultant acceleration magnitudes ranging from 5 to 20 G and times to peak ranging from 32.5 to 120.8 ms with duration 250 ms, resulting in 1,248 simulations. Head injury metrics included peak linear head acceleration, peak rotational head acceleration, head injury criteria (HIC15), and brain injury criteria (BrIC). Injury metrics were regressed against boundary condition parameters using 2nd order multiple polynomial regression, and compared between occupants using matched pairs Wilcoxon signed rank analysis. Results: Across the 416 matched-simulations that reached normal termination with all three models, HIC15 values ranged from 1.0-396.5 (Hybrid III), 1.2-327.9 (THOR), and 0.6-585.6 (GHBMC). BrIC ranged from 0.03-0.95 (Hybrid III), 0.03-1.21 (THOR), and 0.04-0.84 (GHBMC). Wilcoxon signed rank analysis demonstrated significant pairwise differences between each of the three occupant models for head injury metrics. For HIC15, the largest divergence between GHBMC and the ATDs was observed in simulations with components of combined underbody and rear impact loading. The three models performed most similarly with respect to BrIC output when loaded in a frontal direction. Both the GHBMC and the Hybrid III produced lower values of BrIC than the THOR on average, with the differences most pronounced in rear impact loading. Conclusion: In conclusion, observed differences between the occupant models' head injury metric output were quantified. Loading direction had a large effect on metric outcome and metric comparability across models, with frontal and rear impacts with low vertical acceleration tending to be the most similar. One explanation for these differences could be the differences in neck stiffness between the models that allowed more rotation in the GHBMC and THOR. Care should be taken when using ATDs as human volunteer surrogates in these low energy events.

AB Methane release from the seafloor is commonly associated with chemosynthesis-based cold seep ecosystems that facilitate the precipitation of authigenic carbonates. It has been proposed that carbonate growth results in self-sealing, but little is known regarding the evolution of cold seep structures in relation to fluid migration pathways. This study investigates structures resulting from gas seepage along ring faults peripheral to Venere mud volcano (1600 m water depth), based on multibeam bathymetry and seafloor backscatter data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle, together with photomosaics, video observations, and samples obtained by a remotely operated vehicle. Sites of focused fluid flow are identified by gas bubble streams rising from the seafloor while anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) over wider areas is indicated by the occurrence of chemosynthesis-based organisms (microbial mats, vesicomyid clams, vestimentiferan tube worms). At some sites, flakes of gas hydrate were observed in the water column during sampling. A range of carbonate structures exists at these sites: 1) flat and extensive pavements; 2) mounds with disseminated nodules or centimeter-thick crusts; 3) fractured mounds with exposed, decimeter-thick crusts; and 4) seafloor depressions lined by decimeter-thick crusts. The mineralogy and stable carbon isotopic compositions of the carbonates are consistent with anaerobic oxidation of methane from thermogenic sources, and possible near-seabed influence of gas hydrate formation and dissolution. The seafloor expressions of seepage are inferred to be controlled by the interaction of fluid flow due to carbonate precipitation and gas hydrate formation. A conceptual model for mound development is proposed in the context of the known timescales of seep-colonization and rates of carbonate precipitation: (A) the onset of hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage through hemipelagic sediments leads to (B) the establishment of microbial mats on flat seafloor over decadal timescales and is followed by (C) the growth of pavements cemented by carbonates that seal the seafloor; over longer timescales (centuries to millennia), carbonate growth and subsurface gas hydrate formation/dissolution lead to (D) upward doming and fracturing of carbonate mounds, re-sealing and stacking of carbonates and in some cases to (E) their collapse to form seafloor depressions. Gas migration through fractures in the carbonates allows re-sealing and fuels AOM to provide habitats for chemosynthesis-based fauna. This evolutionary scenario is argued to be broadly applicable to the development of ruptured mounds and collapse features described at other seepage sites in the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere.

AB Internet of underwater things (IoUT) for underwater monitoring is known worldwide for smart interlinked underwater things that exhibit the capacity to monitor the vast unexplored waters of the oceans. Concept of IoUT has been derived from Internet of Things (IoT) in order to acquire the exquisite benefits of networking in underwater environment. IOT standards and technologies do not work well in underwater environment, such as infrared, Wi-Fi, and radio frequency (RF) due to high channel errors and limited range up to few meters. Acoustic waves, however, can be used to communicate both in shallow and deep oceans due to their low frequency (kHZ) signal. In context of IoUT, communication based on acoustic links enables different applications such as underwater exploration, environmental monitoring, and disaster prevention even without availability of GPS facility like free space environment. In unpredictable and changing underwater environment, energy efficiency becomes a major challenge during data routing along multiple devices. Batteries of the sensor nodes, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) cannot be removed with easiness and difficult to recharge, and the only way out is efficient sensor node selection for relaying to save massive amount of energy. Energy aware channel routing protocol (ECARP) does not consider the depth of the node while selecting the relay nodes to forward the data. Relay node selection in underwater Internet of things (IOUT) is a primary problem addressed in this research based on channel state information (CSI) for establishing best path to relay information among IOUT devices. Our major focus was to develop better technique for the relay node selection using a CSI and select relay node by looking at its depth from ocean surface and residual energy in the proposed ED-CARP. Simulation results validate that proposed ED-CARP can decrease the communication cost and increase the network lifetime.

AB Compared to undisturbed areas, timber harvest activities, including road construction, skid trails, and stream crossings, exhibit the potential for causing erosion and sedimentation if forestry best management practices (BMPs) are not implemented. Forestry BMP monitoring serves as a tool to evaluate BMP implementation status. Conventional on-the-ground BMP monitoring has contributed substantially to assessing BMP implementation. However, conventional on-the-ground surveys can be time consuming. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been rapidly emerging as a new tool for local-scale monitoring. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and potential of UAVs for monitoring forestry BMPs in the coastal plain of southeastern United States. We compared the performance of UAV-live feed surveys and UAV-created map surveys with conventional on-the-ground surveys across major BMP categories on 30 study sites using BMP guidelines and implementation survey questions from Alabama, Georgia, and Florida for the sites specific to that state (10 sites in each state). The UAV-live feed surveys involved real-time assessments conducted using the live feed function, enabling on-the-spot evaluations. Whereas the UAV-created map surveys entailed autonomous UAV flight to collect imagery specifically for generating maps and facilitating subsequent assessments. We found that using a UAV for monitoring BMPs efficiently provided an overview of a timber harvest area from above. UAV-live feed surveys were as effective as conventional on-the-ground surveys across all major BMP categories. Specifically, the Cramer's V correlation between the responses from UAV-live feed and conventional on-the-ground surveys for all BMP categories, was 0.95 (p < 0.0001) for detecting implemented BMPs and 0.86 (p < 0.0001) for detecting when BMPs were not implemented but needed to be. UAV-created map survey results vs. conventional on-the-ground surveys were not as effective (V of 0.79 for detecting implemented BMPs and 0.46 for detecting BMPs not implemented but needed). Waste and stream crossing BMP implementation were the most difficult to verify using the map surveys, which was not an issue with the live feed surveys due to the capability to evaluate those BMPs at different camera angles. While UAV-created map surveys may be less effective, they provide an observation record that includes a map of the site. This project also developed a standardized framework for using UAVs to monitor forestry BMPs, including instructions and procedures for conducting UAV-live feed and map surveys. In conclusion, a UAV using the live feed function in the field is a feasible option to monitor forestry BMPs.

AB Plain Language Summary Understanding variability in annual net community production (NCP) and factors affecting its estimation are important priorities for the study of ocean biogeochemistry. The time evolution of dissolved oxygen is useful proxy for NCP if the physical tendency can be isolated and removed; a key challenge is the resolution of the terms contributing to this tendency. Here oxygen balances are examined in the upper 200m at Ocean Station Papa (50 degrees N, 145 degrees W) using data from Seaglider surveys June 2008 to January 2010. Sampling of horizontal gradients of oxygen, temperature, and salinity during these surveys allows the inference of monthly three-dimensional advection and turbulent diffusion of oxygen. The resulting monthly oxygen balances show strong variability with depth, with similarities to the temperature balances shallower than 100m and salinity balances deeper. The estimated annual NCP of 2.21.2molCm(-2)year(-1) in the top 120m is in agreement with contemporary studies in the subarctic North Pacific Ocean. Horizontal advection in the surface layer is found to be small as previously assumed but important at greater depths: Assuming zero horizontal advection in the top 120m would have resulted in an overestimate of annual NCP by 50%. Horizontal and vertical advection together dominated the oxygen balance in the permanent pycnocline. Results emphasize the three-dimensional nature of the oxygen balance, even in this relatively quiescent location, and further demonstrate the viability of autonomous spatial surveys for resolving physical oxygen transport terms.
   In the same manner as plants on land, small organisms in the surface of the ocean produce oxygen and organic carbon through photosynthesis. Some of this carbon sinks to the deep ocean in a process known as the ocean's biological pump. Over long periods of time, the biological pump is important for regulating the concentration of carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas, in the Earth's atmosphere. One way to measure the biological pump is by monitoring changes in ocean oxygen to determine how much is produced biologically. This study employs this method by deploying small robot submarines, known as ocean gliders, to monitor oxygen and ocean flows at a well-studied location in the Gulf of Alaska. The most important finding is that in certain conditions, ocean flows can produce changes in oxygen that are a large fraction of biological production; if they are unaccounted for, they could result in large errors or uncertainties. Encouragingly, results also suggest that gliderswhich are a relatively cost effective but still emerging observational technologyare a viable method for estimating such flows. Pairing gliders with other new technologies holds promise for more widespread measurements that could greatly increase our understanding of the biological pump.

   braking (AEB); collision warning; curve warning; evaluation
AB Objective: Motorcycles and mopeds, often referred to as powered 2-wheelers (PTWs), play an important role in personal mobility worldwide. Despite their advantages, including low cost, space occupancy, and fuel efficiency, the risk of sustaining serious or fatal injuries is higher than that for occupants of passenger cars. The development of safety systems specific for PTWs represents a potential way to reduce casualties among riders. With the proliferation of new active and passive safety technologies, the question as to which might offer the most value is important. In this context, a prioritization process was applied to a set of PTW active safety systems to evaluate their applicability to crash scenarios alone and in combination. The systems included in the study were antilock braking (ABS), autonomous emergency braking (AEB), collision warning, curve warning, and curve assist. Methods: With the functional performance of the 5 safety systems established, the relevance of each system to specific crash configurations and vehicle movements defined by a standardized accident classification system used in Victoria, Australia, was rated by 2 independent reviewers, with a third reviewer acting as a moderator where disagreements occurred. Ratings ranged from 1 (definitely not applicable) to 4 (definitely applicable). Using population-based crash data, the number and percentage of crashes that each safety system could potentially influence, or be relevant for, was defined. Applying accepted injury costs permitted the derivation of the societal economic cost of PTW crashes and the potential reductions associated with each safety system given a theoretical crash avoidance effectiveness of 100%. Results: In the 12-year period 2000-2011, 23,955 PTW riders and 1292 pillion passengers were reported to have been involved in a road crash, with over 500 killed and more than 10,000 seriously injured; only 3.5% of riders/pillion passengers were uninjured. The total economic cost associated with these injured riders and pillion passengers was estimated to be AU$11.1 billion (US$7.70 billion; euro6.67 billion). The 5 safety systems, as single solutions or in combination, were relevant to 57% of all crashes and to 74% of riders killed. Antilock braking was found to be relevant to the highest number of crashes, with incremental increases in coverage when combined with other safety systems. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that ABS, alone and in combination with other safety systems, has the potential to mitigate or possibly prevent a high percentage of PTW crashes in the considered setting. Other safety systems can influence different crash scenarios and are also recommended. Given the high cost of motorcycle crashes and the increasing number of PTW safety technologies, the proposed approach can be used to inform the process of selection of the most suitable interventions to improve PTW safety.

AB Purpose - This paper, a "Q&A interview" conducted by Joanne Pransky of Industrial Robot Journal, aims to impart the combined technological, business and personal experience of a prominent, robotic industry engineer-turned entrepreneur regarding the evolution, commercialization and challenges of bringing a technological invention to market.
   Design/methodology/approach - The interviewee is Dr Robert Ambrose, Chief, Software, Robotics and Simulation Division at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. As a young child, even before he started school, Dr Ambrose knew, after seeing the Apollo 11 moonshot, that he wanted to work for NASA. Dr Ambrose describes his career journey into space robotics and shares his teams' experiences and the importance of the development of Robonaut, a humanoid robotic project designed to work with humans both on Earth and in space.
   Findings - Dr Ambrose received his MS and BS degrees in mechanical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, and his PhD in mechanical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. Dr Ambrose heads the flight spacecraft software, space robotics and system simulations for human spaceflight missions. He oversees on-orbit robotic systems for the International Space Station (ISS), the development of software for the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and future human spaceflight systems, simulations for engineering development and training, hardware in the loop facilities for anomaly resolution and crew training and the technology branch for development of new robotic systems. Dr Ambrose also serves as a Principal Investigator for NASA's Space Technologies Mission Directorate, overseeing research and formulating new starts in the domains of robotics and autonomous systems. He co-chairs the Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) Robotics, Tele-Robotics and Autonomous Systems roadmap team for the agency's technology program, and is the robotics lead for the agency's human spaceflight architecture study teams. Working with the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), Dr Ambrose is the Technical Point of Contact for NASA's collaboration in the National Robotics Initiative (NRI).
   Originality/value - Dr Ambrose not only realized his own childhood dream by pursuing a career at NASA, but he also fulfilled a 15-year national dream by putting the first humanoid robot into space. After seeking a graduate university that would allow him to do research at NASA, it didn't take long for Dr Ambrose to foresee that the importance of NASA's future would be in robots and humans working side-by-side. Through the leadership of Dr Ambrose, NASA formed a strategic partnership with General Motors ( GM) and together they built Robonaut, a highly dexterous, anthropomorphic robot. The latest Robonaut version, R2, has nearly 50 patents available for licensing. One of the many technology spinoffs from R2 is the innovative Human Grasp Assist device, or Robo-Glove, designed to increase the strength of a human's grasp.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was primarily to evaluate inebriated fatally injured drivers (FIDs) according to blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in a 10-year period (2004-2013) in Autonomous Province (AP) of Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia, to analyze the efficacy of alcohol polices in the new law on road traffic safety through changes in the number of inebriated FIDs before and after implementation of the law, as well as to identify factors that influence the occurrence of FIDs with BACs above the legal limit.Methods: All data for this retrospective study were obtained from the Centre of Forensic Medicine, Toxicology and Molecular Genetics of Clinical Centre of Vojvodina, Novi Sad. Autopsy records for each case included age, gender, BAC, type of vehicle, and date of accident (year, month, and recalculated day of the week). BAC was determined by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. Statistical analysis was carried out by chi-square tests and Student's t test, with P < .05 as a statistical significance, and multiple binary logistic regression.Results: Of the 354 inebriated FIDs (60% of all FIDs), the majority had BACs between of 0.031 and 0.3mg/ml (28%), followed by those with BAC > 2.01mg/ml (23%). The average BAC of those driving under the influence of alcohol (DUIA) for the whole period was 1.235 1.00mg/ml and the average number of DUIA/year was 35. Among the total number of FIDs there were significantly more males (93.7%; P < .001) than females (6.3%), though the distribution of intoxicated men and women was not different (P > .05). There was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of sober and inebriated FIDs according to age (P < .001) with the predominance of inebriated FIDs between 21 and 30years. Although gender and age were found to be significant predictors of BAC above legal limit in FIDs, the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve showed that the model had poor discrimination (ROC = 0.673). Of all observed FIDs, 65 cases per year were attributed to the first 5-year period (2004-2009) and 49 to the second 5-year (2010-2013) period, which indicates that there was no statistically significant decrease in the number of FIDs after implementation of the new law.Conclusion: The highest number of intoxicated FIDs during the period in AP Vojvodina were mildly and completely inebriated. In the 4-year post-policy period (2010-2013), the number of FIDs and average BAC levels of inebriated FIDs did not significantly change. The abolition of a permissible BAC should be considered.

AB Many enterprise companies migrate their services and applications to the cloud to benefit from cloud computing advantages. Meanwhile, the rapidly increasing number of connected devices with the massive amount of generated data that use cloud services leads to high workload, congestion, and delay bottleneck in the centralized cloud architecture. Consequently, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is introduced as a new paradigm to expand cloud capabilities near the end devices. In addition, new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Autonomous Vehicles (AV), 5G, and Augmented Reality (AR) bring new demands and opportunities that MEC can make possible. Offloading delay-sensitive and computationally intensive tasks to nearby MEC nodes is an effective way that still is the most common open problem in MEC. The offloading problem in MEC has been widely studied in areas such as Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC), IoT, Radio Access Networks (RAN), and 5G but independently. Due to the high diversity of research areas, targeted issues, and adopted algorithms and tech-niques, finding the right research path in task offloading is highly demanding. To fill this gap, a comprehensive survey is conducted using the mixed-method systematic literature review involving qualitative and quantitative data from the studied papers. For each journal paper, the detailed information of the work area, targeted issue, formulation technique, optimization approach, adopted algorithms, evaluation techniques, performance matrices, dataset, utilized tools, and framework are extracted and analyzed using manual and automatic coding. Major offloading-related issues in MEC are investigated, and the taxonomy of journal papers based on adopted approaches is presented. For further future exploration, we suggest the potential areas of research, the contri-bution of the algorithms and technique, and the research direction in MEC. This review will give a quick and overall view of MEC's latest issues and solutions.

AB In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN)-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) is demonstrated using real-time experimental implementation. First, the emissions and performance of a 4.5-liter 4-cylinder Cummins diesel engine are modeled using a DNN model with seven hidden layers and 24,148 learnable parameters created by stacking six Fully Connected layers with one long-short term memory (LSTM) layer. This model is then implemented as the plant model in an NMPC. For real-time implementation of the LSTM-NMPC, an open-source package acados with the quadratic programming solver HPIPM (High-Performance Interior-Point Method) is employed. This helps LSTM-NMPC run in real time with an average turnaround time of 62.3 milliseconds. For real-time controller prototyping, a dSPACE MicroAutoBox II rapid prototyping system is used. A Field-Programmable Gate Array is employed to calculate the in-cylinder pressure-based combustion metrics online in real time. The developed controller was tested for both step and smooth load reference changes, which showed accurate tracking performance while enforcing all input and output constraints. To assess the robustness of the controller to data outside the training region, the engine speed is varied from 1200 rpm to 1800 rpm. The experimental results illustrate accurate tracking and disturbance rejection for the out-of-training data region. At 5 bar indicated mean effective pressure and a speed of 1200 rpm, the comparison between the Cummins production controller and the proposed LSTM-NMPC showed a 7.9% fuel consumption reduction, while also decreasing both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Particle Matter (PM) by up to 18.9% and 40.8%.

AB The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has transfigured the overlay of the physical world by superimposing digital information in various sectors, including smart cities, industry, healthcare, etc. Among the various shared information, visual data are an insensible part of smart cities, especially in healthcare. As a result, visual-IoT research is gathering momentum. In visual-IoT, visual sensors, such as cameras, collect critical multimedia information about industries, healthcare, shopping, autonomous vehicles, crowd management, etc. In healthcare, patient-related data are captured and then transmitted via insecure transmission lines. The security of this data are of paramount importance. Besides the fact that visual data requires a large bandwidth, the gap between communication and computation is an additional challenge for visual IoT system development. In this paper, we present SVIoT, a Secure Visual-IoT framework, which addresses the issues of both data security and resource constraints in IoT-based healthcare. This was achieved by proposing a novel reversible data hiding (RDH) scheme based on One Dimensional Neighborhood Mean Interpolation (ODNMI). The use of ODNMI reduces the computational complexity and storage/bandwidth requirements by 50 percent. We upscaled the original image from M x N to M +/- 2N, dissimilar to conventional interpolation methods, wherein images are upscaled to 2M x 2N. We made use of an innovative mechanism, Left Data Shifting (LDS), before embedding data in the cover image. Before embedding the data, we encrypted it using an AES-128 encryption algorithm to offer additional security. The use of LDS ensures better perceptual quality at a relatively high payload. We achieved an average PSNR of 43 dB for a payload of 1.5 bpp (bits per pixel). In addition, we embedded a fragile watermark in the cover image to ensure authentication of the received content.

AB Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding paths for multiple agents such that each agent reaches its goal and the agents do not collide. In recent years, variants of MAPF have risen in a wide range of real-world applications such as warehouse management and autonomous vehicles. Optimizing common MAPF objectives, such as minimizing sum-of-costs or makespan, is computationally intractable, but state-of-the-art algorithms are able to solve optimally problems with dozens of agents. However, most MAPF algorithms assume that (1) time is discretized into time steps and (2) the duration of every action is one time step. These simplifying assumptions limit the applicability of MAPF algorithms in real-world applications and raise non-trivial questions such as how to discretize time in an effective manner. We propose two novel MAPF algorithms for finding optimal solutions that do not rely on any time discretization. In particular, our algorithms do not require quantization of wait and move actions' durations, allowing these durations to take any value required to find optimal solutions. The first algorithm we propose, called Continuous-time Conflict-Based Search (CCBS), draws on ideas from Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP), a single-agent pathfinding algorithm designed to cope with dynamic obstacles, and Conflict-Based Search (CBS), a state-of-the-art search-based MAPF algorithm. SMT-CCBS builds on similar ideas, but is based on a different stateof-the-art MAPF algorithm called SMT-CBS, which applied a SAT Modulo Theory (SMT) problem-solving procedure. CCBS guarantees to return solutions that have minimal sum of-costs, while SMT-CCBS guarantees to return solutions that have minimal makespan. We implemented CCBS and SMT-CCBS and evaluated them on grid-based MAPF problems and general graphs (roadmaps). The results show that both algorithms can efficiently solve optimally non-trivial MAPF problems.& nbsp;(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Green Canyon Lease Block 600 is a well-documented cold seep site characterized by near-perennial oil and gas slicks large enough to reach the sea surface and to be detected on satellite imagery. This site has been selected by the Ecosystem Impact of Oil and Gas Inputs to the Gulf consortium to study the impacts of natural hydrocarbon seepage versus anthropogenic inputs of hydrocarbons into the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster that occurred in 2010. Here we present the first high-resolution characterization of the site. We investigated the seafloor and shallow subsurface combining autonomous underwater vehicle-borne seismo-acoustics with photo data. Our records show vigorous hydrocarbon flux occurring over a wide area of the complex seafloor morphology. Several mounds, which are the most prominent features of the site, are aligned along a ridge structure and are actively venting hydrocarbons. Detailed bathymetry of the mound's surface highlights the presence of numerous pockmarks, cones, and micro-mounds of variable sizes and shapes. High reflectivity seafloor backscatter characterizes the entire ridge surface; ground-truthing photo surveys confirm the presence of authigenic carbonate hardgrounds, gas hydrates, and chemosynthetic communities. The shallow stratigraphy indicates that the ridge represents the seafloor expression of normal faults, probably rooted to a deep salt body. Salt tectonics generated a complex network of normal faults, many of which displace the upper part of the Holocene sediments up to the seafloor, forming long linear scars. Acoustic anomalies, interpreted as active migration pathways, underlie mounds and venting structures, suggesting a link between the deep hydrocarbon reservoir and seafloor expulsion features.

AB The Vision Zero approach advocates for a road transport system designed with human injury tolerance and human fallibility as its basis. While biomechanical limits and the relationship between speed and injury outcome has been extensively investigated for car occupants and pedestrians, research analyzing this relationship for motorcyclists remains limited. The aim of this study was to address this issue by developing multivariate injury risk models for motorcyclists that estimate the relationship between speed and injury severity. For that purpose, motorcycle injury crashes from the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) database for the period 1999-2017 (n = 1037) were extracted. Different models were tested using logistic regression and backwards elimination of non-significant variables. The best fitting model in the current study included relative speed, type of crash opponent, impact location on the motorcycle and impact mechanism of the rider during the crash. A strong and significant relationship between relative speed and injury severity in motorcycle crashes was demonstrated. At 70 km/h, the risk for at least serious injuries in collisions with wide objects, crash barriers and narrow objects was 20%, 51%, and 64%, respectively. Further, it was found that head-on collisions between motorcycles and passenger cars, with both vehicles traveling at 60 km/h (a relative speed at 120 km/h), present 55% risk of at least serious injury to the motorcycle rider.
   More research is needed to fully understand the boundary conditions needed to design a safe road transport system for motorcyclists. However, this study provides important insights into the relationship between speed and injury severity for riders in various crash situations. The results may be useful in the discussion of appropriate speed limits and in determining the benefits of countermeasures which aim to reduce crash speed.

AB The Algerian Basin is a key component of the general circulation in the Western Mediterranean Sea. The presence of both fresh Atlantic water and more saline Mediterranean water gives the basin an intense inflow/outflow regime and complex circulation patterns. Energetic mesoscale structures that evolve from meanders of the Algerian Current into isolated cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies dominate the area, with marked repercussions on biological activity. Despite its remarkable importance, this region and its variability are still poorly known and basin-wide knowledge of its meso- and submesoscale features is still incomplete. Studying such complex processes requires a synergistic approach that involves integrated observing systems. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the advantages of combined use of autonomous underwater vehicles, such as gliders, with a new generation of satellite altimetry. In this context, we present results of an observational program conducted in the Algerian Basin during fall 2014 and 2015 that aimed to advance our knowledge of its main features. The study was carried out through analysis of high resolution glider observations, collected along the Algerian BAsin Circulation Unmanned Survey (ABACUS) chokepoint, in synergy with co-located SARAL/AltiKa altimetric products and CMEMS numerical simulations. Results show that glider-derived dynamic height and SARAL/AltiKa absolute dynamic topography have similar patterns, with RMS of the differences ranging between 1.11 and 2.90 cm. Even though larger discrepancies are observed near the Balearic and Algerian coasts, correlation coefficients between glider and satellite observations seem mostly to be affected by reduced synopticity between the measurements. Glider observations acquired during the four surveys reveal the presence of several water masses of Atlantic and Mediterranean origin (i.e., AW and LIW at different modification levels) with marked seasonal variability.

AB A fascinating challenge in robotics-human interaction is imitating the emotion recognition capability of humans to robots with the aim to make human-robotics interaction natural, genuine and intuitive. To achieve the natural interaction in affective robots, human-machine interfaces, and autonomous vehicles, understanding our attitudes and opinions is very important, and it provides a practical and feasible path to realize the connection between machine and human. Multimodal interface that includes voice along with facial expression can manifest a large range of nuanced emotions compared to purely textual interfaces and provide a great value to improve the intelligence level of effective communication. Interfaces that fail to manifest or ignore user emotions may significantly impact the performance and risk being perceived as cold, socially inept, untrustworthy, and incompetent. To equip a child well for life, we need to help our children identify their feelings, manage them well, and express their needs in healthy, respectful, and direct ways. Early identification of emotional deficits can help to prevent low social functioning in children. In this work, we analyzed the child's spontaneous behavior using multimodal facial expression and voice signal presenting multimodal transformer-based last feature fusion for facial behavior analysis in children to extract contextualized representations from RGB video sequence and Hematoxylin and eosin video sequence and then using these representations followed by pairwise concatenations of contextualized representations using cross-feature fusion technique to predict users emotions. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we have performed experiments with the different pairwise concatenations of contextualized representations that showed significantly better performance than state-of-the-art method. Besides, we perform t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding visualization to visualize the discriminative feature in lower dimension space and probability density estimation to visualize the prediction capability of our proposed model.

TI PSiamRML: Target Recognition and Matching Integrated Localization
   Algorithm Based on Pseudo-Siamese Network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING

DT Article
ID ROBUST; NAVIGATION; FEATURES; UAVS
AB The positioning function of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging and fundamental research topic and is the premise for UAVs to realize autonomous navigation. The disappearance of satellite signals makes it challenging to achieve accurate positioning. Thus, visual positioning algorithms based on computer vision have been proposed in recent years and these algorithms have produced good results. However, these algorithms have relatively simple functions and cannot perceive the environment. Their versatility is poor, and mismatching often occurs, which affects the positioning accuracy. Aiming to address the need for integrated target recognition, target matching, and positioning of UAVs, we propose an algorithm that integrates the target recognition, matching, and positioning functions by combining the single-shot multibox detector (SSD) algorithm with the deep feature matching algorithm. This algorithm is based on the idea of pseudo-Siamese networks and the SSD algorithm, introducing a deep feature matching method to directly calculate the correspondence between two images. The main idea is to use the VGG network trained by the SSD target recognition algorithm to extract deep features, without any special training for feature matching. Finally, by sharing neural network weights, the integrated design of target recognition and image-matching localization algorithms is achieved. Mismatches between the real-time and reference images are addressed by introducing the grid-based motion statistics algorithm to optimize the matching result and improve the correct matching efficiency of the target. The University-Release dataset was used to compare and analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm to verify its superiority and feasibility. The results show that the matching accuracy of the PSiamRML algorithm is generally good and that it significantly compensates for changes in the contrast, scale, brightness, blur, deformation, and so on, apart from improving the stability and robustness. Finally, a matching test scenario with aerial images captured by an S1000 six-rotor UAV served to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the PSiamRML algorithm.

AB The high-speed mobile networks offer great potentials to many future intelligent applications, such as autonomous vehicles in smart transportation systems. Such networks provide the possibility to interconnect mobile devices to achieve fast knowledge sharing for efficient collaborative learning and operations, especially with the help of distributed machine learning, e.g., Federated Learning (FL), and modern digital technologies, e.g., Digital Twin (DT) systems. Typically, FL requires a fixed group of participants that have Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data for accurate and stable model training, which is highly unlikely in real-world mobile network scenarios. In this paper, in order to facilitate the lightweight model training and real-time processing in high-speed mobile networks, we design and introduce an end-edge-cloud structured three-layer Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, incorporated with an edge-cloud structured DT system. A dual-Reinforcement Learning (dual-RL) scheme is devised to support optimizations of client node selection and global aggregation frequency during FL via a cooperative decision-making strategy, which is assisted by a two-layer DT system deployed in the edge-cloud for real-time monitoring of mobile devices and environment changes. A model pruning and federated bidirectional distillation (Bi-distillation) mechanism is then developed locally for the lightweight model training, while a model splitting scheme with a lightweight data augmentation mechanism is developed globally to separately optimize the aggregation weights based on a splitted neural network structure (i.e., the encoder and classifier) in a more targeted manner, which can work together to effectively reduce the overall communication cost and improve the non-IID problem. Experiment and evaluation results compared with three baseline methods using two different real-world datasets demonstrate the usefulness and outstanding performance of our proposed FRL model in communication-efficient model training and non-IID issue alleviation for high-speed mobile network scenarios.

AB The rhythmic and stable operation of trolleybuses and autonomous trolleybuses or urban electric buses, depends to a large extent on the reliability of the equipment installed on the trolleybus. The actual operational reliability of trolleybus electrical equipment (EE) depends on its technical condition. Under the influence of external factors and specific operating modes, the technical condition of the equipment is continuously deteriorating, reliability indicators are decreasing, and the number of failures is increasing. Using the mathematical theory of reliability, probability theory and mathematical statistics, numerical methods of solving nonlinear and transcendental equations, this article defines the conditions of diagnostics depending on the intensity of failures and the given probability of failure-free operation of the equipment. Additionally, the inverse problem of determining the current reliability of electrical engineering systems depends on the terms of diagnostics and the intensity of failures being solved. As a result of the processing of statistical information on failures it is established that for the electrical equipment of a trolleybus, after a number of repair measures, the maximum density of failures occurs at a lower mileage, and the probability of failure-free operation can vary depending on the degree of wear of the equipment, i.e., on the number of previous failures. It is theoretically substantiated and experimentally confirmed that the reliability of trolleybus electrical equipment changes according to the exponential law of distribution of a random variable. It has been established that the real averaged diagnostic terms regulated by instructions are not optimal in most cases and differ several times from those defined in this paper. The dependence of switching equipment run-in on time has been clarified, which served as a prerequisite for specifying the inter-repair period for various types of trolleybus electrical equipment. A method of adjustment of the inter-repair time for the electrical equipment of trolleybuses is proposed.

AB In this paper, we propose new normal guided depth completion from sparse LiDAR data and single color image, named NNNet. Sparse depth completion often uses normal maps as a constraint for model training. However, direct construction of a normal map from the color image causes a lot of noise in the normal map and reduces the model performance. Thus, we use a new normal map as an intermediate constraint to promote the fusion of multi-modal features. We generate the new normal map from the sparse LiDAR depth data to use it as a constraint for network training. The new normal map is generated by converting the input depth into a grayscale image, constructing a normal map, replacing the Z channel of the normal map with the original depth, and finally adding a mask. Based on the new normal map, we construct an end-to-end network NNNet for sparse depth completion guided by its corresponding color image. NNNet consists of two branches. The one branch generates the new normal map from the depth image and its corresponding color image, while the other branch constructs a dense depth image from the sparse depth and the predicted new normal map. The two branches fully merge the features through skip connection. In loss function, we use L2 loss to ensure that the new normal map plays a restrictive role. Finally, we generate the dense depth image by refining it with a spatial propagation network. Experimental results show that the new normal map provides effective constraints for sparse depth completion. Moreover, NNNet achieves 724.14 in terms of RMSE and outperforms most of the current state-of-the-art methods.

AB Surface-rupturing strong earthquakes will leave evidence distributed along fault zones. The combination of paleoearthquake trench excavation and faulted microgeomorphic analysis at the same site provides more comprehensive knowledge of paleoearth-quakes than either method could accomplish alone. In this article, we report on our use of trench excavation and dating, together with a 5-cm resolution digital elevation model obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle based on the structure from motion photogrammetry technology, to investigate the timing and size of strong paleoearth-quake events in the Dashagou site near the west end of the Haiyuan fault, which rup-tured in the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake. The result reveals that at least four strong paleoearthquake events with the same or even higher magnitude (including the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake) have occurred along the west end of the Haiyuan fault since the mid-Holocene. Event IV occurred shortly before 6.0 ka with a horizontal displace-ment of 4.27 +/- 1.50 m and a vertical displacement of 0.70 +/- 0.39 m. Event III occurred at approximately 4.65 +/- 0.45 ka with a horizontal displacement of 5.45 +/- 1.25 m and a vertical displacement of 0.38 +/- 0.23 m. Event II occurred at approximately 1.0 ka with a horizontal displacement of 3.86 +/- 0.90 m and a vertical displacement of 0.55 +/- 0.27 m. The most recent event was the 1920 Haiyuan earthquake, with a horizontal displace-ment of 2.15 +/- 0.82 m and a vertical displacement of 0.26 +/- 0.12 m. From the results of these four events, we can certainly conclude that the fault has mainly maintained the strike-slip kinematic pattern over the past 6 ka. These observations highlight the benefits of combining trench excavation and faulted microgeomorphology to gain a more complete understanding of paleoearthquakes.

AB Due to the limitations of drones and satellites to obtain aerial images of the crops in real time, the time to flight delay, the problems caused by adverse weather conditions and other issues, the use of fixed cameras placed on the regions of interest is essential to get closer, periodic and on-demand images. Water management in agriculture is one of the most important applications of these images. Top view images of a crop can be processed for determining the percentage of green cover (PGC), and 2D images from different viewing angles can be applied for obtaining 3D models of the crops. In both cases, the obtained data can be managed for calculating several parameters such as crop evapotranspiration, water demand, detection of water deficit and indicators about solute transport of fertilizers in the plant. For this purpose, a remote image capture system has been developed for an application in lettuce crops. The system consists of several capture nodes and a local processing base station which includes image processing algorithms to obtain key features for decision-making in irrigation and harvesting strategies. Placing multiple image capture nodes allows obtaining different observation zones that are representative of the entire crop. The nodes have been designed to have autonomous power supply and wireless connection with the base station. This station carries out irrigation and harvesting decisions using the results of the processing of the images captured by the nodes and the information of other local sensors. The wireless connection is made using the ZigBee communication architecture, supported by XBee hardware. The two main benefits of this choice are its low energy consumption and the long range of the connection.

AB Long-term monitoring of seismicity and deformation has provided constraints on the eruptive behavior and internal structure and dynamics of subaerial volcanoes, but until recently, such monitoring of submarine volcanoes has not been feasible. Little is known about the formation of oceanic crust or seamounts, and we have therefore developed a stand-alone long-baseline tiltmeter to record deformation on active seafloor volcanoes. The instrument is a differential pressure, two-fluid sensor adapted for use on the seafloor, combined with an autonomous data logger and acoustic navigation/release system. The tiltmeter can be Installed without use of remotely operated vehicles or manned submersibles and, to first order, is insensitive to noise driven by temperature or pressure gradients. We recorded 65 days of continuous data from one of these tiltmeters on Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge during a multidisciplinary experiment that included ocean bottom seismographs, magnetotelluric instruments, and short-baseline tiltmeters. After instrument equilibration the 100-m-long tiltmeter provided a record with long-term drift rates of 0.5-5 mu rad day(-1) and higher frequency variations of the order of 5-10 mu rad. Comparison with records of subaerial volcanic tilt shows that this instrument can discriminate volcanic deflation events, though none occurred during our deployment, a conclusion supported by nearby short-baseline tilt and bottom pressure recordings. The short-and long-baseline data constrain volcanic inflation of Axial Seamount to be below 0.5-1 mu rad day(-1) during mid-1994. Analysis of the long-baseline tilt data in conjunction with electric field, temperature, and short-baseline tiltmeter data shows that high-frequency signals are largely driven by ocean currents. Improved coupling between the tiltmeter and seafloor should reduce this noise, improve stability and drift, and further enhance our ability to record tilt related to active submarine volcanism.

AB The growth of integrated photonics has driven the need for efficient, high-bandwidth electrical-to-optical (EO) signal conversion over a broad range of frequencies (MHz-THz), together with efficient, high bandwidth photodetection. Efficient signal conversion is needed for applications including fiber/wireless telecom, data centers, sensing/imaging, metrology/spectroscopy, autonomous vehicle platforms, etc., as well as cryogenic supercomputing/quantum computing. Diverse applications require the ability to function over a wide range of environmental conditions (e.g., temperatures from 400 K). Active photonic device footprints are being scaled toward nanoscopic dimensions for size compatibility with electronic elements. Nanophotonic devices increase optical and RF field confinement via small feature sizes, increasing field intensities by many orders of magnitude, enabling high-performance Pockels effect materials to be ultimately utilized to their maximum potential (e.g., in-device voltage-length performance =0.005 V mm). Organic materials have recently exhibited significant improvements in performance driven by theory-guided design, with realized macroscopic electro-optic activity (r(33)) exceeding 1000 pm/V at telecom wavelengths. Hybrid organic/semiconductor nanophotonic integration has propelled the development of new organic synthesis, processing, and design methodologies to capture this high performance and has improved understanding of the spatial distribution of the order of poled materials under confinement and the effects of metal/semiconductor-organic interfaces on device performance. Covalent coupling, whether from in situ crosslinking or sequential synthesis, also provides a thermally and photochemically stable alternative to thermoplastic EO polymers. The alternative processing techniques will reduce the attenuation of r(33) values observed in silicon organic hybrid and plasmonic organic hybrid devices arising from chromophore-electrode electrostatic interactions and material conductance at poling temperatures. The focus of this perspective is on materials, with an emphasis on the need to consider the interrelationship between hybrid device architectures and materials.

AB Prognostics and health management (PHM) has become a crucial aspect of the management of engineering systems and structures, where sensor hardware and decision support tools are deployed to detect anomalies, diagnose faults and predict remaining useful lifetime (RUL). Methodologies for PHM are either model-driven, data-driven or a fusion of both approaches. Data-driven approaches make extensive use of large-scale datasets collected from physical assets to identify underlying failure mechanisms and root causes. In recent years, many data-driven PHM models have been developed to evaluate system's health conditions using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to condition monitoring data. The field of AI is fast gaining acceptance in various areas of applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and smart devices. With advancements in the use of AI technologies in Industry 4.0, where systems consist of multiple interconnected components in a cyber-physical space, there is increasing pressure on industries to move towards more predictive and proactive maintenance practices. In this paper, a thorough state-of-the-art review of the AI techniques adopted for PHM of engineering systems is conducted. Furthermore, given that the future of inspection and maintenance will be predominantly AI-driven, the paper discusses the soft issues relating to manpower, cyber-security, standards and regulations under such a regime. The review concludes that the current systems and methodologies for maintenance will inevitably become incompatible with future designs and systems; as such, continued research into AI-driven prognostics systems is expedient as it offers the best promise of bridging the potential gap.

AB Purpose The manufacturing domain presently focusing on Industry 4.0 (I4.0). One such domain is the automotive sector. The purpose of this study is to analyse the I4.0 research studies with a focus on the automotive sector using a systematic literature review (SLR). Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a SLR of previous studies on I4.0 characteristics from its inception to performance measures focusing on the automotive sector. A total of 90 papers published in reputed journals during 2014-2020 were collected from major publishers, namely, Elsevier, Springer, Taylor and Francis, Emerald, Institute of Electrical and Electronics, MDPI, etc. Findings The findings of the study provided vital insights on various perspectives of I4.0 in an automotive organization. Moreover, this systematic analysis would help the automotive industry policymakers in implementing I4.0 in an organization. Based on the SLR, a conceptual framework is established to guide industry practitioners towards I4.0 implementation. The review findings could be used to carry out future studies in assessing the readiness of I4.0 in the organization with the help of a survey Research limitations/implications The limitation of the study is in the adoption of the sampling approach. In the present study, conference papers and refereed journals have been considered based on the relevance of I4.0 in the automotive industry. As I4.0 is a growing concept, non-refereed articles, book chapters and white papers may cover practical aspects regarding I4.0 implementation that need to be considered for depth analysis. Moreover, the framework needs to be validated with various automotive industries for ensuring practical validity. Originality/value The unique contribution of the study is the SLR of I4.0 in manufacturing with a focus on the automotive sector.

AB The design and implementation of a real-time breakdown voltage and on-chip temperature monitoring system for single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) is described in this work. In the system, an on-chip shaded (active area of the detector covered by a metal layer) SPAD is used to provide a dark count rate for the breakdown voltage and temperature calculation. A bias circuit was designed to provide a bias voltage scanning for the shaded SPAD. A microcontroller records the pulses from the anode of the shaded SPAD and calculates its real-time dark count rate. An algorithm was developed for the microcontroller to calculate the SPAD's breakdown voltage and the on-chip temperature in real time. Experimental results show that the system is capable of measuring the SPAD's breakdown voltage with a mismatch of less than 1.2%. Results also show that the system can provide real-time on-chip temperature monitoring for the range of -10 to 50 degrees C with errors of less than 1.7 degrees C. The system proposed can be used for the real-time SPAD's breakdown voltage and temperature estimation for dual-SPADs or SPAD arrays chip where identical detectors are fabricated on the same chip and one or more dummy SPADs are shaded. With the breakdown voltage and the on-chip temperature monitoring, intelligent control logic can be developed to optimize the performance of the SPAD-based photon counting system by adjusting the parameters such as excess bias voltage and dead-time. This is particularly useful for SPAD photon counting systems used in complex working environments such as the applications in 3D LIDAR imaging for geodesy, geology, geomorphology, forestry, atmospheric physics and autonomous vehicles.

AB The distribution of organisms is related to both environmental factors and interactions between organisms. However, such associations between organisms across an abyssal megafaunal community have not previously been investigated at landscape scale because of a lack of positional data on specimens over such scales. We quantified spatial distributions and investigated interspecific associations in benthic megafaunal communities in three contrasting habitats on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain, two on the abyssal plain and one on the flank of a modest abyssal hill (similar to 50 m above the plain). We used a Bayesian Network Inference Algorithm approach, which considers the ecosystem as a network, facilitated by robust positioning of specimens determined through seabed photography captured with an autonomous underwater vehicle. We found non-random intraspecific distributions of most morphotypes in all areas. The organisms in two interspecific networks on the abyssal plain had high connectance and link density, while the network at the Hill site was notable in the lack of inter-dependencies and highly dependent on one morphotype - Ophiuroidea. The reduced connectance of the hill community suggests that it is operating under a different regime and potentially more vulnerable to perturbation than those on the plain. Interspecific dependencies on the abyssal plain occurred across broad taxonomic groupings, and were thought to be a result of similar relationships between pairs of organisms and the substrate, and competition for detrital resource. In addition, some intraspecific pairs changed dependency direction at different scales. Our results suggest that the scales of inter- and intraspecific aggregation will be important considerations in the design of community assessments, and in spatial planning for their conservation.

AB Advancing our understanding of ocean biogeochemistry, biology, and ecosystems relies on the ability to make observations both in the ocean and at the critical boundaries between the ocean and other earth systems at relevant spatial and temporal scales. After decades of advancement in ocean observing technologies, one of the key remaining challenges is how to cost-effectively make measurements at the increased resolution necessary for illuminating complex system processes and rapidly evolving changes. In recent years, biogeochemical in situ sensors have been emerging that are threefold or more lower in cost than established technologies; the cost reduction for many biological in situ sensors has also been significant, although the absolute costs are still relatively high. Cost savings in these advancements has been driven by miniaturization, new methods of packaging, and lower-cost mass-produced components such as electronics and materials. Recently, field projects have demonstrated the potential for science-quality data collection via large-scale deployments using cost-effective sensors and deployment strategies. In the coming decade, it is envisioned that ocean biogeochemistry and biology observations will be revolutionized by continued innovation in sensors with increasingly low price points and the scale-up of deployments of these in situ sensor technologies. The goal of this study is therefore to: (1) provide a review of existing sensor technologies that are already achieving cost-effectiveness compared with traditional instrumentation, (2) present case studies of cost-effective in situ deployments that can provide insight into methods for bridging observational gaps, (3) identify key challenge areas where progress in cost reduction is lagging, and (4) present a number of potentially transformative directions for future ocean biogeochemical and biological studies using cost-effective technologies and deployment strategies.

AB Efficient monitoring of organisms is at the foundation of protected area and biodiversity management. Such monitoring programs are based on a systematically selected set of survey locations that, while able to track trends at those locations through time, lack inference for the overall region being "monitored". Advances in spatially-balanced sampling approaches offer alternatives but remain largely untested in marine ecosystems. This study evaluated the merit of using a two-stage, spatially-balanced survey framework, in conjunction with generalized additive models, to estimate epifauna cover at a reef-wide scale for mesophotic reefs within a large, cross-shelf marine park. Imagery acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle was classified using a hierarchical scheme developed under the Collaborative and Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery (CATAMI). At a realistic image subsampling intensity, the two-stage, spatially-balanced framework provided accurate and precise estimates of reef-wide cover for a select number of epifaunal classes at the coarsest CATAMI levels, in particular bryozoan and porifera classes. However, at finer hierarchical levels, accuracy and/or precision of cover estimates declined, primarily because of the natural rarity of even the most common of these classes/morphospecies. Ranked predictor importance suggested that bathymetry, backscatter and derivative terrain variables calculated at their smallest analysis window scales (i.e. 81 m(2)) were generally the most important variables in the modeling of reef-wide cover. This study makes an important step in identifying the constraints and limitations that can be identified through a robust statistical approach to design and analysis. The two-stage, spatially-balanced framework has great potential for effective quantification of epifaunal cover in cross-shelf mesophotic reefs. However, greater image subsampling intensity than traditionally applied is required to ensure adequate observations for finer-level CATAMI classes and associated morphospecies.

AB Triiodothyronine (T3) is an important modulator of cardiac metabolism and function, often through modulation of gene expression. The cardiomyocyte circadian clock is a transcriptionally based molecular mechanismcapable of regulating cardiac processes, in part bymodulating responsiveness of the heart to extra-cardiac stimuli/stresses in a time-of-day (TOD)-dependent manner. Although TOD-dependent oscillations in circulating levels of T3 (and its intermediates) have been established, oscillations in T3 sensitivity in the heart is unknown. To investigate the latter possibility, euthyroid male Wistar rats were treated with vehicle or T3 at distinct times of the day, after which induction of known T3 target genes were assessed in the heart (4-h later). The expression of mRNA was assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Here, we report greater T3 induction of transcript levels at the end of the dark phase. Surprisingly, use of cardiomyocyte-specific clockmutant (CCM) mice revealed that TOD-dependent oscillations in T3 sensitivity were independent of this cell autonomous mechanism. Investigation of genes encoding for proteins that affect T3 sensitivity revealed that Dio1, Dio2 and Thrb1 exhibited TOD-dependent variations in the heart, while Thra1 and Thra2 did not. Of these, Dio1 and Thrb1 were increased in the heart at the end of the dark phase. Interestingly, we observed that T3 acutely altered the expression of core clock components (e.g. Bmal1) in the rat heart. To investigate this further, rats were injected with a single dose of T3, after which expression of clock genes was interrogated at 3-h intervals over the subsequent 24-h period. These studies revealed robust effects of T3 on oscillations of both core clock components and clock-controlled genes. In summary, the current study exposed TOD-dependent sensitivity to T3 in the heart and its effects in the circadian clock genes expression.

AB High-resolution data collected from several programs have greatly increased the spatiotemporal resolution of pCO(2)(sw) data in the Bering Sea, and provided the first autumn and winter observations. Using data from 2008 to 2012, monthly climatologies of sea-air CO2 fluxes for the Bering Sea shelf area from April to December were calculated, and contributions of physical and biological processes to observed monthly sea-air pCO(2) gradients (pCO(2)) were investigated. Net efflux of CO2 was observed during November, December, and April, despite the impact of sea surface cooling on pCO(2). Although the Bering Sea was believed to be a moderate to strong atmospheric CO2 sink, we found that autumn and winter CO2 effluxes balanced 65% of spring and summer CO2 uptake. Ice cover reduced sea-air CO2 fluxes in December, April, and May. Our estimate for ice-cover corrected fluxes suggests the mechanical inhibition of CO2 flux by sea-ice cover has only a small impact on the annual scale (<2%). An important data gap still exists for January to March, the period of peak ice cover and the highest expected retardation of the fluxes. By interpolating between December and April using assumptions of the described autumn and winter conditions, we estimate the Bering Sea shelf area is an annual CO2 sink of approximate to 6.8 Tg C yr(-1). With changing climate, we expect warming sea surface temperatures, reduced ice cover, and greater wind speeds with enhanced gas exchange to decrease the size of this CO2 sink by augmenting conditions favorable for greater wintertime outgassing.

AB Four wave-propelled autonomous vehicles (Wave Gliders) instrumented with a variety of oceanographic and meteorological sensors were launched from San Francisco, CA in November 2011 for a trans-Pacific (Pac-X) voyage to test platform endurance. Two arrived in Australia, one in Dec 2012 and one in February 2013, while the two destined for Japan both ran into technical difficulties and did not arrive at their destination. The gliders were all equipped with sensors to measure temperature, salinity, turbidity, oxygen, and both chlorophyll and oil fluorescence. Here we conduct an initial assessment of the data set, noting necessary quality control steps and instrument utility. We conduct a validation of the Pac-X dataset by comparing the glider data to equivalent, or near-equivalent, satellite measurements. Sea surface temperature and salinity compared well to satellite measurements. Chl fluorescence from the gliders was more poorly correlated, with substantial between glider variability. Both turbidity and oil CDOM sensors were compromised to some degree by interfering processes. The well-known diel cycle in chlorophyll fluorescence was observed suggesting that mapping physiological data over large scales is possible. The gliders captured the Pacific Ocean's major oceanographic features including the increased chlorophyll biomass of the California Current and equatorial upwelling. A comparison of satellite sea surface salinity (Aquarius) and glider-measured salinity revealed thin low salinity lenses in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. One glider survived a direct passage through a tropical cyclone. Two gliders traversed an open ocean phytoplankton bloom; extensive spiking in the chlorophyll fluorescence data is consistent with aggregation and highlights another potential future use for the gliders. On long missions, redundant instrumentation would aid in interpreting unusual data streams, as well as a means to periodically image the sensor heads. Instrument placement is critical to minimize bubble-related problems in the data.

AB A major obstacle to the investigation of deep-sea biology is the lack of instrumentation to retrieve deep-sea organisms from their habitat alive, particularly fishes with physoclistous swimbladders. To perform physiological experiments on deep-sea fishes under in situ but controlled conditions, we constructed a high-pressure fish trap-respirometer to capture deep-water fishes at depth and return them to the surface alive at in situ pressure and temperature. Pumps and instrumentation connected aboard ship or in the laboratory are used for maintenance of the animal and experimentation. The trap was designed so that respiration rates, pressure tolerance, and metabolic responses to various gas concentrations (CO2 and O-2) could be examined in a controlled environment. The trap is deployed as an autonomous lander or free vehicle to depths of 4000 m. Once on the seafloor, a fish is captured on a baited hook that triggers the reeling of the fish into the pressure vessel and closure of its sealing door. Two fish, Coryphaenoides acrolepis, have been recovered live from 1450 m and maintained in the laboratory. Both fish were retrieved at similar to 95% of their in situ pressure and at temperatures of similar to 6 degrees C. Oxygen consumption rates of these fish were 54.99 mu mol O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) (1.158 kg, 65.0 cm total length, 23.5 cm pre-anal fin length) and 79.43 mu mol O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) (1.305 kg, 66.5 cm total length, 24.5 cm pre-anal fin length). The latter fish was maintained for 3.5 d, and it survived gradual decompression to 76% of the pressure at its capture depth.

AB Harnessing the energy of deep ocean currents to power deep-sea observation equipment has emerged as a significant focus in recent years. Given the extremely low flow speeds in the deep sea, hydrokinetic turbines need to demonstrate reliable self-starting ability. A novel flexible oscillating hydrokinetic turbine is proposed in the present study to address this challenge. The advantage of the flexible oscillating hydrokinetic turbine lies in the ability to adjust the posture of the flexible blades to create optimal attack angles at different positions. Particle Image Velocimetry measurements are employed to reveal the internal flow field. The results indicate that the incoming flow through the turbine cavity induces two substantial deflections in the inflow and outflow regions, contributing to the generation of significant positive torque. The flexible blades can achieve suitable attack angles at various positions as per the expectations. Especially in the downstream region, the blades adopt a diversion state, thereby avoiding the generation of excessive negative torque. The parametric study was conducted through a water flume and a dynamic testing platform. The results indicate that when the number of blades is six and the installation angle of the blade frame is 20 degrees, the power coefficient of the flexible oscillating hydrokinetic turbine reaches its maximum, exceeding 0.18. A full-process interdisciplinary simulation platform test showed that a flexible oscillating hydrokinetic turbine with a radius of 1 m can self-start in conditions as low as 0.1 m/s. At a flow speed of 0.5 m/s, the turbine can generate over 900 Wh of power per day, enough to power sensors or support an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle's monthly cruise.

AB The late-stage evolution of seamounts is widespread in the West Pacific and may control the distribution of manganese nodules on the lower seamount flanks and adjacent debris aprons. However, due to the paucity of near-bottom observational data, little research exists specifically focused on the late-stage evolution of seamount structures. To fill this knowledge gap, we systematically investigated the tectonic features and evolution of Suda Seamount based on rock samples, satellite gravity data, and high-resolution magnetic and topographic data surveyed by Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We found that the central area of the seamount summit exhibits a negative magnetic anomaly related to a group of minor volcanic structures, while the collapse of volcanic structures on the northeast seamount flank is associated with an extensive positive magnetic anomaly. Surprisingly, a late-stage intrusive dyke with significantly high magnetic susceptibility originates from the lower part of a minor group of volcanic structures but cannot be clearly distinguished below the main summit volcanic structure (hereinafter referred to as the main mound complex). These results demonstrate that at least two latestage periods of intense magmatic activity occurred during the evolution of the seamount, one centered on the main mound complex and one on the margin of the summit platform. By combining fine-scale topographic and satellite gravity data, we deduce that gravitational slip caused by magma intrusion along a fracture was the main cause of the seamount flank collapse. The late-stage processes resulted in a change in the seamount morphology and distributed clastic rock debris widely along the flanks, which contributed to the uneven distribution of manganese nodules along the lower seamount flanks and determined the distribution of subsequently formed nodules.

AB Cloud computing and edge computing models are popularly applied in emerging applications, such as smart homes, smart parks, and connected autonomous vehicles for large-scale live video analytics. Cloud computing-based models transfer all data to the cloud for video analytics, which burdens network bandwidth and increases the data transmission overhead. Edge computing mode enables video data to be processed at the edge node, thereby reducing the bandwidth overhead. Existing edge computing-based models optimize the performance, but they still have defects in three perspectives: 1) enabling end users to control video content in a real-time format; 2) efficiently locating and transferring the user region of interest (ROI) video data in the video stream; and 3) adapting to various network conditions. To tackle these challenges, we proposed an intelligent elastic edge framework for live video analytics, known as ElasticEdge. ElasticEdge enables the interaction between the end user and the edge node. Elasticity is reflected in two perspectives: 1) the dynamic changes of user requirements and 2) the dynamic changes in network conditions. In addition, ElasticEdge transmits the video stream to the end users based on the tradeoff between the amount of video data and users' ROI to meet various network conditions. To validate ElasticEdge, we conducted experiments to study its performance in comparison to RTFace. The experimental results show that ElasticEdge has a significant edge over RTFace in terms of data transmission. Using 1/16 reserved images, ElasticEdge saves 75% bandwidth and reduces latency by approximately 10% compared with RTFace. We also find that ElasticEdge adapts to various network conditions when streaming videos, i.e., it can reliably obtain essential information with low latency even when the network condition is poor.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor is attracting significant attention in the field of smart transportation because of its ability to give depth information. It is already extensively used for obstacle detection. The inertial navigation system (INS) with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) gives the global position, orientation, and velocity of a given object in real time. In autonomous driving, LiDAR point clouds are segmented to find out the positions of various objects in the surrounding of the vehicle of interest. However, the obstacle position is determined in local east-north-up (ENU) coordinates. In this article, an end-to-end framework has been presented, which takes input from LiDAR and INS/GNSS systems and gives the obstacle position in universal coordinates (latitude, longitude) in real time. The proposed framework includes ground point removal from raw LiDAR data, obstacle segmentation, and LiDAR data fusion with INS/GNSS data for georeferencing. For LiDAR data processing, a novel method for removing ground points has been presented, in which the entire point cloud is divided into square grids in the horizontal plane. Based on the statistics of the vertical distribution of the points in each grid, ground points are identified. Two ground point datasets were also created for testing the proposed algorithm. These datasets contain point clouds of ground with varying inclination from various multichannel LiDARs. The proposed ground removal method was tested on the Paris-Lille-3D dataset and the dataset created. An F1-score of greater than 0.99 and 0.98 was achieved on our dataset and the Paris Lille-3D dataset, respectively. The framework is tested on different hardware configurations and found to be suitable for real-time applications.

AB The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has allowed for unprecedented data collection, automation, and remote sensing and actuation, transforming autonomous systems and bringing smart command and control into numerous cyber physical systems (CPS) that our daily lives depend on. Simultaneously, dramatic improvements in machine learning and deep neural network architectures have enabled unprecedented analytical capabilities, which we see in increasingly common applications and production technologies, such as self-driving vehicles and intelligent mobile applications. Predictably, these technologies have seen rapid adoption, which has left many implementations vulnerable to threats unforeseen or undefended against. Moreover, such technologies can be used by malicious actors, and the potential for cyber threats, attacks, intrusions, and obfuscation that are only just being considered, applied, and countered. In this paper, we consider the good, the bad, and the ugly use of machine learning for cybersecurity and CPS/IoT. In detail, we consider the numerous benefits (good use) that machine learning has brought, both in general, and specifically for security and CPS/IoT, such as the improvement of intrusion detection mechanisms and decision accuracy in CPS/IoT. More pressing, we consider the vulnerabilities of machine learning (bad use) from the perspectives of security and CPS/IoT, including the ways in which machine learning systems can be compromised, misled, and subverted at all stages of the machine learning life-cycle (data collection, pre-processing, training, validation, implementation, etc.). Finally, the most concerning, a growing trend has been the utilization of machine learning in the execution of cyberattacks and intrusions (ugly use). Thus, we consider existing mechanisms with the potential to improve target acquisition and existing threat patterns, as well as those that can enable novel attacks yet to be seen.

ID EFFICIENT DATA-COLLECTION; MAC PROTOCOL
AB With the booming development of marine exploration technology, new studies such as the oceanix city, smart coastal city, and underwater smart cities have been proposed, and the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has received a lot of attention. Data collection is an important application of the IoUT. The common method is to collect data by traversing the network using underwater intelligent devices, such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). However, traditional data collection methods focus more on issues, such as path planning or the task assignment of AUVs. It is commonly known that the MAC protocol plays a crucial role in data transmission, which is designed to solve the competition issue for shared channels. However, the research on MAC is very challenging owing to the characteristics of hydroacoustic communication, e.g., the low bandwidth, high error rate, and long transmission latency. Hence, this paper proposes a MAC protocol based on an Interference Cancellation Graph (ICG-MAC) for AUV-assisted IoUT. It ensures that AUVs can join the network for data transmission immediately after arriving at the target area and they do not interfere with the normal work of other sensor nodes. Firstly, the target area to be reached by an AUV for data collection is defined according to the node degree and residual energy; then the interference model between neighboring nodes is analyzed and an Interference Cancellation Graphx is established, based on which the time slots are allocated for sensor nodes; and finally, the AUV moves to the target area for conflict-free data collection. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithms in terms of the network throughput and energy consumption. With the assistance of an AUV, better network connectivity and higher network traffic can be obtained.

AB This paper examines how tactical-grade Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), aided by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) modules, vary from a survey-grade system in the bath-ymetric mapping in depths less than 20 m. The motivation stems from the advancements in sensor developments, measurement processing algorithms, and the proliferation of autonomous and uncrewed surface vehicles often seeking to use tactical-grade systems for high-quality bathymetric products. While the performance of survey-grade GNSS + INS is well-known to the hydrographic and marine science community, the performance and limitations of the tactical-grade micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) and tactical-grade fiber-optic-gyro (FOG) INS aided with GNSS require some study to answer the following questions: (1) How close or far is the tactical-grade GNSS + INS performance from the survey-grade systems? (2) For what survey order (IHO S-44 6th ed.) can a user deploy them? (3) Can we use them for navigation chart production? We attempt to answer these questions by deploying two tactical-grade GNSS + INS units (MEMS and FOG) and a survey-grade GNSS + INS on a survey boat. All systems collected data while operating a multibeam system with the lever-arm offsets accurately determined using a total station. The tactical-grade GNSS + INSs shared one pair of antennas for heading, while the survey-grade system used an independent antenna pair. We analyze the GNSS + INS results in sequence, examine the patch-test results, and the sensor-specific SBET-integrated bathymetric surfaces as metrics for determining the tactical-grade GNSS + INSs' reliability. In addition, we evaluate the multibeam's sounding uncertainties at different beam angles. The bathymetric surfaces using the tactical-grade navigation solutions are within 15 cm of the surface generated with the survey-grade solutions.

DT Article
ID IDENTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB The goal of my 40th Alexander A. Nikolsky Honorary Lecture and journal paper is to highlight the key flight control technology advances of the past 50 years and demonstrate how these advances are being applied and extended to the new family of rotorcraft: modern high-speed military rotorcraft, eVTOL urban air mobility, and advanced air mobility aircraft. The first part of this journal paper reviews flight control technologies drivers that are unique to rotorcraft and highlights key advances of the past 50 years in the areas of handling-qualities requirements (ADS-33), physics-based models, system identification, and flight control. A central theme is the shift from time-domain to frequency-domain based characterization of the closed-loop response and design methods for rotorcraft that have become increasingly dependent on sophisticated feedback control systems to achieve closed-loop stability, disturbance rejection, and most importantly closed-loop handling -qualities response for all-weather operations. Frequency-domain analysis, design, and test methods of the past 50 years are highlighted relating key advances in each discipline and two integrated example success stories. In the second part of this paper, we consider the key challenges, advancements, and needed future research for four new classes of rotorcraft: the military future vertical lift family of high-speed rotorcraft, unmanned autonomous systems/urban air mobility based on fielded conventional helicopters, small electric VTOL unmanned aerial vehicle rotorcraft, and larger eVTOL urban air mobility rotorcraft. The next sections look across the challenges and solution spaces that are common to these four new classes of rotorcraft as a blueprint for needed research advances. Finally, this paper takes a step back and considers the lessons-learned and key takeaways from the author's perspective as a career-long flight control engineer/researcher, Flight Control Technology Group leader, and senior technologist.

AB With the increasing stringent QoS constraints (e.g., latency, bandwidth, jitter) imposed by novel applications (e.g., e-Health, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, etc.), as well as the rapidly increasing number of connected IoT (Internet of Things) devices, the core network is becoming increasingly congested. To cope with those constraints, Edge Computing (EC) is emerging as an innovative computing paradigm that leverages Cloud computing and brings it closer to the customer. "EC" refers to transferring computing power and intelligence from the central Cloud to the network's Edge. With that, EC promotes the idea of processing and caching data at the Edge, thus reducing network congestion and latency. This paper presents a detailed, thorough, and well-structured assessment of Edge Computing and its enabling technologies. Initially, we start by defining EC from the ground up, outlining its architectures and evolution from Cloudlets to Multi-Access Edge Computing. Next, we survey recent studies on the main cornerstones of an EC system, including resource management, computation offloading, data management, network management, etc. Besides, we emphasized EC technology enablers, starting with Edge Intelligence, the branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that integrates AI models at resource-constrained edge nodes with significant heterogeneity and mobility. Then, moving on to 5G and its empowering technologies, we explored how EC and 5G complement each other. After that, we studied virtualization and containerization as promising hosting runtime for edge applications. Further to that, we delineated a variety of EC use-case scenarios, e.g., smart cities, e-Health, military applications, etc. Finally, we concluded our survey by highlighting the role of EC integration with future concerns regarding green energy and standardization.

AB Featured Application This work is used for the unmanned driving of vehicles. The safety of unmanned ship berthing is of paramount importance. In order to explore the influence of wind and wave coupling, a berthing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was established, and the characteristics of speed field, pressure field, and vortex have been obtained under different speed, wind direction, and the quay wall distances. The results show that the total resistance of the hull against the current can be about 1.60 times higher compared to the downstream resistance, water flow resistance is the dominant factor, accounting for more than 80% of the total resistance. When changing the distance between ship and shore at fixed speed, the results found that the torque is small, but the growth rate is very large when driving below 2 m/s, and the torque growth rate is stable above 2 m/s. Based on the established coupling model, a multi-factor berthing safety study is carried out on an actual unmanned ship. The results show that when the speed increases from 4 m/s to 12 m/s, the curve slope is small, the resistance increases from 3666 N to 18,056 N, and the rear slope increases. The pressure increases with the speed, and when the speed is 24 m/s, the maximum pressure is up to 238,869 Pa. When the wind speed is fixed, the vertical force of the unmanned ship increases first and then decreases to zero and then reverses the same law change, and the maximum resistance is about 425 N at the wind angle of about 45 degrees; At 90 degrees, the maximum lateral force on an unmanned boat is about 638 N. The above results can provide control strategy for unmanned ship berthing safety, and provide theoretical basis for unmanned ship route planning and obstacle avoidance, safety design, etc.

AB Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) has been introduced in 5G new radio for new applications that have strict reliability and latency requirements such as augmented/virtual reality, industrial automation and autonomous vehicles. The first full set of the physical layer design of 5G release, Release 15, was finalized in December 2017. It provided a foundation for URLLC with new features such as flexible sub-carrier spacing, a sub-slot-based transmission scheme, new channel quality indicator, new modulation and coding scheme tables, and configured-grant transmission with automatic repetitions. The second 5G release, Release 16, was finalized in December 2019 and allows achieving improved metrics for latency and reliability to support new use cases of URLLC. A number of new features such as enhanced physical downlink (DL) control channel monitoring capability, new DL control information format, sub-slot physical uplink (UL) control channel transmission, sub-slot-based physical UL shared channel repetition, enhanced mobile broadband and URLLC inter-user-equipment multiplexing with cancellation indication and enhanced power control were standardized. This article provides a detailed overview of the URLLC features from 5G Release 15 to Release 16 by describing how these features allow meeting URLLC target requirements in 5G networks. The ongoing Release 17 targets further enhanced URLLC operation by improving mechanisms such as feedback, intra-user-equipment multiplexing and prioritization of traffic with different priority, support of time synchronization and new quality of service related parameters. In addition, a fundamental feature targeted in URLLC Release 17 is to enable URLLC operation over shared unlicensed spectrum. The potential directions of URLLC research in unlicensed spectrum in Release 17 are presented to serve as a bridge from URLLC in licensed spectrum in Release 16 to URLLC in unlicensed spectrum in Release 17.

AB The article considers the approach to solving the problems of precision agriculture based on the concept of the Internet of Things. The aim of the study is developing a theoretical approach to the use of field sensors, agro-robots and unmanned aerial vehicles in solving problems of precision agriculture using the paradigm of the Internet of Things. The authors introduced and proved the position that every agricultural thing can be represented as a service. It description contains a standardized description of the functionality and conditions of its use. The article shows, that things can work with a variety of sensors that can communicate with each other. The article proposes to use of service-oriented architectures to build appropriate solutions. It was confirmed that in the process of solving problems, several autonomous and independent services of agricultural things could exchange messages with other things that have different functional and information capabilities. The choreography of services of agricultural things is used to organize the processes of precision agriculture. The orchestration of such services is used to ensure the information needs of individual things. We have developed a general scenario of typical agricultural things operating in the paradigm of the Internet of Agricultural Things (IoAgT) in solving the problem of active field monitoring. The monitoring process is described as sequential movement along the selected routes of ground agrirobots and drones to commit together with the field sensors of the current situation in the field in different periods of agricultural production - from sampling soil to detect critical situations related to plant diseases, the presence of weeds, pests, and eliminate them. The article shows potential applicability of the proposed approach to a concrete example of solving the problems of monitoring a field sown with grain culture. The article recommends using service-oriented architectures in the implementation of precision farming processes, building algorithms for choreography and orchestration of agricultural things services.

AB The crossing behaviors modeling of non-networked road users can improve Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)'s awareness of the imminent hazards in shared space while planning routes. In this study, an agent-based microsimulation model is utilized to simulate the crossing behavior of e-bikes which is difficult to model due to their greater maneuverability. To deeply understand the crossing mechanism of e-bikes, a customized neural network-based nonlinear reward function is developed from five dimensions, including travel efficiency, travel direction, travel destination, risk avoidance, and travel location. A Deep Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning(Deep MEIRL), which can recover the nonlinear reward function, is introduced to predict trajectories of e-bikes from the real drone-based video dataset, collected at the intersection of Jixiangcun, Xi'an (China). The results reveal that the Deep MEIRL can simulate the e-bike crossing trajectory more precisely, particularly in the microscopic behaviors of riders. Comparing Deep MEIRL with the baseline model MEIRL, it can be found that the nonlinear reward function designed in this paper is more advantageous in terms of continuous space modeling, with an improvement of 19.77%. Notably, Deep MEIRL outperforms MEIRL in modeling distance to potentially risk target states for left-and right-turn crossing behavior, improving Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 71% and 30%, respectively. It means that the Deep MEIRL with a designed neural network is of great value to provide a logical result in modeling e-bike interaction with other road users. Therefore, the research is conducive to CAVs to understand e-bike behaviors in complex traffic scenarios, thereby assisting CAVs in making decisions efficiently.

AB Intelligent energy management in renewable-based power distribution applications, such as microgrids, smart grids, smart buildings, and EV systems, is becoming increasingly important in the context of the transition toward the decentralization, digitalization, and decarbonization of energy networks. Arguably, many challenges can be overcome, and benefits leveraged, in this transition by the adoption of intelligent autonomous computer-based decision-making through the introduction of smart technologies, specifically artificial intelligence. Unlike other numerical or soft computing optimization methods, the control based on artificial intelligence allows the decentralized power units to collaborate in making the best decision of fulfilling the administrator's needs, rather than only a primitive decentralization based only on the division of tasks. Among the smart approaches, reinforcement learning stands as the most relevant and successful, particularly in power distribution management applications. The reason is it does not need an accurate model for attaining an optimized solution regarding the interaction with the environment. Accordingly, there is an ongoing need to accomplish a clear, up-to-date, vision of the development level, especially with the lack of recent comprehensive detailed reviews of this vitally important research field. Therefore, this paper fulfills the need and presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art successful and distinguished intelligent control strategies-based RL in optimizing the management of power flow and distribution. Wherein extensive importance is given to the classification of the literature on emerging strategies, the proposals based on RL multiagent, and the multiagent primary secondary control of managing power flow in micro and smart grids, particularly the energy storage. As a result, 126 of the most relevant, recent, and non-incremental have been reviewed and put into relevant categories. Furthermore, salient features have been identified of the major positive and negative, of each selection.

AB The ability to anticipate human actions is critical to many cyber-physical systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles. Computer vision and sensing algorithms to date have focused on extracting and predicting visual features that are explicit in the scene, such as color, appearance, actions, positions, and velocities, using video and physical measurements, such as object depth and motion. Human actions, however, are intrinsically influenced and motivated by many implicit factors such as context, human roles and interactions, past experience, and inner goals or intentions. For example, in a sport team, the team strategy, player role, and dynamic circumstances driven by the behavior of the opponents, all influence the actions of each player. This article proposes a holistic framework for incorporating visual features, as well as hidden information, such as social roles, and domain knowledge. The approach, relying on a novel dynamic Markov random field (DMRF) model, infers the instantaneous team strategy and, subsequently, the players' roles that are temporally evolving throughout the game. The results from the DMRF inference stage are then integrated with instantaneous visual features, such as individual actions and position, in order to perform holistic action anticipation using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The approach is demonstrated on the team sport of volleyball, by first training the DMRF and MLP offline with past videos, and, then, by applying them to new volleyball videos online. These results show that the method is able to infer the players' roles with an average accuracy of 86.99%, and anticipate future actions over a sequence of up to 46 frames with an average accuracy of 80.50%. Additionally, the method predicts the onset and duration of each action achieving a mean relative error of 14.57% and 15.67%, respectively.

AB Visual feature extraction is a key technology of computer vision for intelligent video processing. Efficient feature extraction is a fundamental problem in computer vision applications. Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is one of the most popular feature extraction algorithms because SIFT features are invariant to image scale and rotation and robust to changes in illumination and noise. However, SIFT is a computationally-intensive and power-hungry algorithm, which needs to be accelerated by efficient hardware design to achieve both high-speed feature extraction and high energy efficiency for many high frame-rate video applications at Artificial-intelligent Internet of Things edges. In this work, an energy-efficient SIFT based feature extraction accelerator is proposed. In the Gaussian pyramid and Differences of Gaussian (DoG) pyramid construction process, three design methods are proposed to reduce power consumption and improve information fidelity: a fast and slow dual clock domain design method with a reconfigurable design strategy is proposed to reduce the computation resources; a partial sum reuse design method is proposed to further reduce the computation resources and the amount of computation; a dynamic padding design method is proposed to solve the problem of information loss at image edges and corners after convolution operation. In the keypoint descriptor generation process, an optimized algorithm using circular region and polar coordinates is proposed to parallelize the main orientation assignment and descriptor generation to achieve high-speed processing, while maintaining a comparable matching accuracy with the state-of-the-art designs. The experiment results show that the proposed SIFT hardware accelerator is able to extract features by up to 162 frames per second (640 x 480 pixels) under 100 MHz, with the power consumption of 364.26 mW and energy efficiency of 2.25 mi/frame based on 180 nm technology, which is suitable for many high frame-rate AIoT applications including autonomous driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles.

AB In recent years, integrated polarized light/inertial heading measurement systems have been widely used to obtain autonomous heading measurements of small unmanned combat platforms in the case of satellite navigation rejection. However, existing polarized light/inertial heading measurement systems have certain limitations. For example, they can only measure the heading angle in environments where continuous observations can be obtained. When encountering a complex environment with trees and/or tall buildings, the measured heading angle will contain sharp noise which greatly affects its accuracy. In particular, when encountering an underpass, it will lead to the complete loss of lock of the polarized light compass signal. Therefore, for the problem of sharp noise arising from a complex environment, a robust Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) data-fusion algorithm is proposed and verified by experiments. It is proved that the robust CKF algorithm has a certain ability to filter out the effects of poor measurements. After application of the robust CKF algorithm, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the heading angle reaches 0.3612 degrees. This method solves the problem of low precision and poor stability of the polarized light/inertial system when high buildings and/or trees are contained in a complex environment. Next, in view of the problem that the polarized light compass signal is completely lost due to passing through an underground passage, a random forest regression (RFR) neural network model is established and introduced into the combined system. Simulated and outdoor experiments are carried out to verify the designed model using data obtained with a vehicle. The RMSE of the heading angle obtained in the experiment is 1.1894 degrees, which solves the problem that the polarized light/inertial system cannot utilize discontinuous observations when attempting to detect the carrier heading angle.

AB While the attempts to deploy drones in the foodservice industry focus on the technical aspects, research studies from behavioral perspectives that support service substantially are still in their infancy. When new technology-based services are introduced, it is crucial to examine and understand consumers' perceptions by identifying a set of actions that influence acceptance and fulfilling their target. Therefore, service providers of drone food delivery (DFD) services need to identify significant factors that influence potential consumers to use drone delivery. Although a few existing models are significant, these models lack a comprehensive basic theory that addresses factors which influence consumers' intention and behavior. To overcome this limitation and propose a more comprehensive model, relevant research studies from the domain of drone delivery services and other emerging technology such as IoT, Autonomous Vehicles, and Mobile Banking are identified, reviewed, and analyzed, and ten potential factors are subsequently extracted. This study's data were collected from 209 participants who regularly order food online for delivery and were analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, reliability, Pearson correlation, regression analysis, r-squared, and standardized beta coefficient analyses are carried out to present the study's findings. The results show that there is a significant relationship between behavioral intention and the user behavior of DFD. Although the participants in this study are yet to experience drone technology in the foodservice domain, the identified factors explain around 32.9% of the variation in the use behavior of DFD services. In the early stage of adoption, it is highly recommended for stakeholders to conduct marketing campaigns through media channels such as television and different social media platforms to bring awareness of this technology.

AB Deterministic and low end-to-end latency communication is an urgent demand for many safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and automated industries. The time-sensitive network (TSN) is introduced as Ethernet-based amendments in IEEE 802.1 TSN standards to support time-triggered (TT) traffic in these applications. In the presence of TT flows, TSN is designed to integrate Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) and Best Effort (BE) traffic types. Although AVB traffic has a lower priority than TT, it still requires low and deterministic latency performance, which may not be guaranteed under strict predefined TT scheduling constraints. For this reason, a window-overlapping scheduling algorithm is recently proposed in different works as analytical forms for TT latency under overlapping-windows based. But worst-case AVB latency evaluation under overlapped TT windows is also essential for critical optimizations and tradeoffs. In this paper, a worst-case end-to-end delay (WCD) for AVB traffic under overlapping-based TT windows (AVB-OBTTW) algorithm is proposed. Separate analytical models are derived using the network calculus (NC) approach for AVB-OBTTW with both non-preemption and preemption mechanisms. Using an actual vehicular use case, the proposed models are evaluated with back-to-back and porosity configurations under light and heavy loading scenarios. For specific AVB credit bounds, a clear WCD reduction has been achieved by increasing the overlapping ratio (OR), especially under back-to-back configuration. Preemption and non-preemption modes are compared under different loading conditions, resulting in lower WCDs using preemption mode than non-preemption, especially with porosity style. Compared to the latest related works, AVB-OBTTW reduces WCD bounds and increases unscheduled bandwidth, leading to the highest enhancements with the maximum allowable OR.

AB The safety of signalized intersections has traditionally been evaluated at an aggregate level by relating historical collision records for several years to the annual traffic volume and the geometric characteristics of the intersection. This is a reactive and macroscopic approach that gives little insight into how important dynamic signal cycle-related variables can affect intersection safety such as the arrival type and the shock wave characteristics. The objective of this study is to develop traffic conflict-based real-time safety models for signalized intersections using several state-of-the-art techniques. Traffic conflicts were measured by multiple indicators including time to-collision (TTC), modified time-to-collision (MTTC), and deceleration rate to avoid collision (DRAC). Traffic conflict rate was employed as independent variable while traffic volume, queue length, shock wave area, shock wave speed, and platoon ratio of each cycle were used as covariates in the safety models. Four candidate Tobit models were developed and compared under the Bayesian framework: conventional Tobit model, grouped random parameters Tobit (GRP-Tobit) model, random intercept Tobit (RI-Tobit) model, and random parameters Tobit (RP-Tobit) model. The results showed that the GRP-Tobit model performs best with lowest Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), indicating that accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity across sites can significantly improve the model fit. The model estimation results showed that higher conflict rates were associated with various shock wave characteristics (positive sign for shock wave area, shock wave speed, and queue length) and higher traffic volume. Lower conflict rates were related with higher platoon ratio (favorable arrival patterns). The developed models can have potential applications in real-time safety evaluation, real-time optimization of signal control, and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) trajectories planning.

AB It is no secret that robotic systems are expanding into many human roles or are augmenting human roles. The Robot Operating System is an open-source standard for the robotic industry that enables locomotion, manipulation, navigation, and recognition tasks by integrating sensors, motors, and controllers into reusable modules over a distributed messaging architecture. As reliance on robotic systems increases, these systems become high value targets, for example, in autonomous vehicles where human life is at risk. As Robot Operating System has become a de facto standard for many robotic systems, the security of Robot Operating System becomes an important consideration for deployed systems. The original Robot Operating System implementations were not designed to mitigate the security risks associated with hostile actors. Robot Operating System 2, the next generation of the Robot Operating System, addresses this shortcoming, leveraging Data Distributed Services for its messaging architecture and Data Distributed Services security extension for its data protection in motion. This article provides a systematic review of Robot Operating System 2 and identifies potential risks for this new robotic system paradigm. A Robot Operating System 2 robotic system is viewed as a series of layers from the hardware that include sensors, motors, and controllers to the software layers, which include the operating system, security services, protocols, messaging, and the cognitive layer for observation, learning, and action. Since Robot Operating System 2 and security are new considerations for robotics systems as they move into mainstream, many questions emerge. For example, can some portions be secure and other portions be non-secure? Does everything need to be secure? What are the trade-offs between, security, performance, latency and throughput? What about real-time robotic systems? This article provides an overview of the Robot Operating System 2 paradigm and represents a first step toward answering these questions.

AB Pedestrian tracking is a challenging task in the area of visual object tracking research and it is a vital component of various vision-based applications such as surveillance systems, human-following robots, and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we proposed a single pedestrian tracking (SPT) framework for identifying each instance of a person across all video frames through a tracking-by-detection paradigm that combines deep learning and metric learning-based approaches. The SPT framework comprises three main modules: detection, re-identification, and tracking. Our contribution is a significant improvement in the results by designing two compact metric learning-based models using Siamese architecture in the pedestrian re-identification module and combining one of the most robust re-identification models for data associated with the pedestrian detector in the tracking module. We carried out several analyses to evaluate the performance of our SPT framework for single pedestrian tracking in the videos. The results of the re-identification module validate that our two proposed re-identification models surpass existing state-of-the-art models with increased accuracies of 79.2% and 83.9% on the large dataset and 92% and 96% on the small dataset. Moreover, the proposed SPT tracker, along with six state-of-the-art (SOTA) tracking models, has been tested on various indoor and outdoor video sequences. A qualitative analysis considering six major environmental factors verifies the effectiveness of our SPT tracker under illumination changes, appearance variations due to pose changes, changes in target position, and partial occlusions. In addition, quantitative analysis based on experimental results also demonstrates that our proposed SPT tracker outperforms the GOTURN, CSRT, KCF, and SiamFC trackers with a success rate of 79.7% while beating the DiamSiamRPN, SiamFC, CSRT, GOTURN, and SiamMask trackers with an average of 18 tracking frames per second.

AB With the acceleration of the investigation and development of marine resources, the detection and lo-cation of submarine pipelines have become a necessary part of modern marine engineering. Submarine pipelines are a typical weak magnetic anomaly target, and their magnetic anomaly detection can only be realized within a certain distance. At present, a towfish or an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is mainly used as the platform to equip magnetometers close to the submarine pipelines for magnetic anomaly detection. However, the mother ship directly affects the towfish, thus causing control interfer-ence. The AUV cannot detect in real time, which affects the magnetic anomaly detection and creates prob-lems regarding detection efficiency. Meanwhile, a two-part towed platform has convenient control, thus reducing the interference of the towed mother ship and real-time detection. If the platform can main-tain constant altitude sailing through the controller, the data accuracy in the actual magnetic anomaly detection can be guaranteed. On the basis of a two-part towed platform, a magnetic detection system with constant altitude sailing ability for submarine pipelines was constructed in this study. In addition, experimental verification was conducted. The experimental verification research shows that the constant altitude sailing experiment of the two-part towed platform verifies that the platform has good constant altitude sailing ability in both a hydrostatic environment and the actual marine environment. Meanwhile, the offshore magnetic anomaly detection experiment of submarine pipelines verifies the stable measure-ment function of the magnetic field and the function of the system to detect magnetic anomaly of sub-marine pipelines.(c) 2022 Shanghai Jiaotong University.

AB Objects obscured by occluders are considered lost in the images acquired by conventional camera systems, prohibiting both visualization and understanding of such hidden objects. Non-line-of-sight methods (NLOS) aim at recovering information about hidden scenes, which could help make medical imaging less invasive, improve the safety of autonomous vehicles, and potentially enable capturing unprecedented high-definition RGB-D data sets that include geometry beyond the directly visible parts. Recent NLOS methods have demonstrated scene recovery from time-resolved pulse-illuminated measurements encoding occluded objects as faint indirect reflections. Unfortunately, these systems are fundamentally limited by the quartic intensity fall-off for diffuse scenes. With laser illumination limited by eye-safety limits, recovery algorithms must tackle this challenge by incorporating scene priors. However, existing NLOS reconstruction algorithms do not facilitate learning scene priors. Even if they did, datasets that allow for such supervision do not exist, and successful encoder-decoder networks and generative adversarial networks fail for real-world NLOS data. In this work, we close this gap by learning hidden scene feature representations tailored to both reconstruction and recognition tasks such as classification or object detection, while still relying on physical models at the feature level. We overcome the lack of real training data with a generalizable architecture that can be trained in simulation. We learn the differentiable scene representation jointly with the reconstruction task using a differentiable transient renderer in the objective, and demonstrate that it generalizes to unseen classes and unseen real-world scenes, unlike existing encoder-decoder architectures and generative adversarial networks. The proposed method allows for end-to-end training for different NLOS tasks, such as image reconstruction, classification, and object detection, while being memory-efficient and running at real-time rates. We demonstrate hidden view synthesis, RGB-D reconstruction, classification, and object detection in the hidden scene in an end-to-end fashion.

AB Subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layers are prevalent throughout the Arctic Ocean under stratified conditions and are observed both in the wake of retreating sea ice and in thermally stratified waters. The importance of these layers on the overall productivity of Arctic pelagic ecosystems has been a source of debate. In this study, we consider the three principal factors that govern productivity within SCMs: the shape of the chlorophyll profile, the photophysiological characteristics of phytoplankton and the availability of light in the layer. Using the information on the biological and optical parameters describing the vertical structure of chlorophyll, phytoplankton absorption and photosynthesis-irradiance response curves, a spectrally resolved model of primary production is used to identify the set of conditions under which SCMs are important contributors to water-column productivity. Sensitivity analysis revealed systematic errors in the estimation of primary production when the vertical distribution of chlorophyll was not taken into account, with estimates of water-column production using a non-uniform profile being up to 97% higher than those computed using a uniform one. The relative errors were shown to be functions of the parameters describing the shape of the biomass profile and the light available at the SCM to support photosynthesis. Given that SCM productivity is believed to be largely supported by new nutrients, it is likely that the relative contribution of SCMs to new production would be significantly higher than that to gross primary production. We discuss the biogeochemical and ecological implications of these findings and the potential role of new ocean sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles in furthering the study of SCMs in such highly heterogeneous and remote marine ecosystems. This article is part of the theme issue 'The changing Arctic Ocean: consequences for biological communities, biogeochemical processes and ecosystem functioning'.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the interactions between the road situational risk and angry driving style on lane-changing decisions in drivers and the allocation of visual attention of angry-driving-style drivers based on video clips of driving. We employed the Tobii eye tracker to collect the eye movement markers and reaction time data of 35 drivers. First, the road type and distances of neighboring cars were used to classify situations in the video clips into high- and low-risk situations. The revised Chinese version of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI-C) was used to measure the driving style of drivers. The eye movement heatmap of drivers was used to classify the areas of interest into the front view and side mirror. We found that the angry driving style and the total fixation duration on the front view of drivers in high-risk situations were predictors of the relative lane-changing decision time. Angry-driving-style drivers' relative lane-changing decision time is shorter than that of other drivers. In high-risk driving situations, the longer the total fixation duration on the front view, the shorter the relative lane-changing decision time. We also found that the angry driving style and eye movement areas of interest interacted with the mean search durations and total fixation durations of the drivers. Angry-driving-style drivers were more focused on the front view. Our study has significance for the improvement of the improvement of the allocation of visual attention of angry-driving-style drivers and the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).

AB In order to realize real-time 3D environment perception of UAVs and autopilot in low-altitude complex road scenes, a neural network model RobNet based on SqueezeNet and cyclic CRF for real-time 3D point cloud segmentation is proposed to segment the road objects in real time. Firstly, the unordered, scattered 3D point cloud data are preprocessed into a standard data format similar to an image by a spherical mapping method. Then, at the macro-level of the model design, the SqueezeNet network with the residual connection optimization is selected as the basic network of the model, and then, the conditional random field (CRF) algorithm which is processed into the cyclic network structure is used to refine the segmentation result. Finally, the construction of the basic network, the cyclic network and the network parameter settings in the model is elaborated at the micro-level. The experimental results show that the RobNet model proposed in this paper can segment the target in the road scene better. The segmentation callback rate of the three types of vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists is increased by 28, 2 and 17%, respectively, compared with the VoxelNet network. The higher callback rate is in line with the safe movement specifications for drones and autonomous driving. At the same time, the proposed model parameters are small, 98.5% smaller than the classic network AlexNet, and are easy to deploy on a platform with limited computing resources. The RobNet model in the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework engineering deployment and implementation experimental data shows that the model meets the real-time and stability requirements of the drone and automatic driving application, engineering code can run in real time at 12 Hz, the standard deviation of each frame's running time is around 4.5 ms.

AB A 2-D laser rangefinder (LRF) and a camera are widely applied in various mobilized systems, such as autonomous robot and unmanned ground vehicle. Integration of these two types of sensors promotes a new measurement technology. Extrinsic calibration is crucial and basically the first step to fuse image and laser data. The chessboard-plane-based method is one of the most popular ones, which requires at least five plane-input (five shots). Vasconcelos et al. recently reduced the number of shots from five to three and derived the minimal solution. However, it requires solving a sophisticated perspective-three-point (P3P) problem with eight solutions. This paper first introduces a virtual trihedron from three plane-input and reformulates the P3P problem directly in 3-D space rather than in 3-D dual space to derive the minimal solution for extrinsic calibration. Based on this, we propose a novel and flexible method for extrinsic calibration of an LRF-camera with a trirectangular trihedron (or a cube). One unique feature is that the method requires only a single shot of the target, which can greatly simplify the calibration procedure. The proposed calibration method involves solving simplified P3P and perspective-three-line (P3L) problems separately. In particular, computation of LRF pose is formulated as a simplified P3P problem, which is easily solved and has unique solution from single-shot laser data only. It also avoids the degeneration problem. Camera pose computation is formulated as a simplified P3L problem from image data. The proposed calibration method has been tested with both simulation and real data. The results show that the method is both accurate and flexible for extrinsic calibration of a 2-D LRF and a camera.

DT Article
DE GNSS; DGNSS; double -difference; machine -learning; deep learning
AB Recently, Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) po-sitioning has been widely used in various applications (e.g. car navigation system, smartphone map application, autonomous driving). In GNSS po-sitioning, coordinates are calculated from observed satellite signals. The observed signals contain various errors, so the calculated coordinates also have some errors. Double-difference is one of the widely used ideas to re-duce the errors of the observed signals. Although double-difference can remove many kinds of errors from the observed signals, some errors still remain (e.g. multipath error). In this paper, we define the remaining error as "double-difference-error (DDE)" and propose a method for estimating DDE using machine learning. In addition, we attempt to improve DGNSS positioning by feeding back the estimated DDE. Previous research apply-ing machine learning to GNSS has focused on classifying whether the sig-nal is LOS (Line Of Sight) or NLOS (Non Line Of Sight), and there is no study that attempts to estimate the amount of error itself as far as we know. Furthermore, previous studies had the limitation that their dataset was recorded at only a few locations in the same city. This is because these studies are mainly aimed at improving the positioning accuracy of vehi-cles, and collecting large amounts of data using vehicles is costly. To avoid this problem, in this research, we use a huge amount of openly available stationary point data for training. Through the experiments, we confirmed that the proposed method can reduce the DGNSS positioning error. Even though the DDE estimator was trained only on stationary point data, the proposed method improved the DGNSS positioning accuracy not only with stationary point but also with mobile rover. In addition, by comparing with the previous (detect and remove) approach, we confirmed the effectiveness of the DDE feedback approach.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to technologies which support the execution of tasks normally requiring human intelligence (e.g., visual perception, speech recognition, or decision-making). Examples for AI systems are chatbots, robots, or autonomous vehicles, all of which have become an important phenomenon in the economy and society. Determining which AI system to trust and which not to trust is critical, because such systems carry out tasks autonomously and influence human-decision making. This growing importance of trust in AI systems has paralleled another trend: the increasing understanding that user personality is related to trust, thereby affecting the acceptance and adoption of AI systems. We developed a framework of user personality and trust in AI systems which distinguishes universal personality traits (e.g., Big Five), specific personality traits (e.g., propensity to trust), general behavioral tendencies (e.g., trust in a specific AI system), and specific behaviors (e.g., adherence to the recommendation of an AI system in a decision-making context). Based on this framework, we reviewed the scientific literature. We analyzed N = 58 empirical studies published in various scientific disciplines and developed a "big picture" view, revealing significant relationships between personality traits and trust in AI systems. However, our review also shows several unexplored research areas. In particular, it was found that prescriptive knowledge about how to design trustworthy AI systems as a function of user personality lags far behind descriptive knowledge about the use and trust effects of AI systems. Based on these findings, we discuss possible directions for future research, including adaptive systems as focus of future design science research.

AB In this paper we propose a deep learning model, which we call step attention, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. The proposed model has a special architecture which consists of recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and an augmented attention mechanism. Rather than developing architectures to model factors that may affect the walking behavior, the proposed model learns trajectory patterns directly from input sequences. We evaluate the performance of the step attention model using TrajNet-a publicly available benchmark dataset collected from diverse real-world crowded scenarios. We compare the performance of step attention with three existing state-of-the-art algorithms, including social LSTM, social GAN, and occupancy LSTM on the TrajNet benchmark dataset. Our experiments show that the average displacement error (ADE) of step attention for a 4.8-seconds-long prediction horizon is about 0.53 m. The final displacement error (FDE) is 1.72 m. Both average and final displacement errors are favorable compared to the benchmark methods. We conduct a second set of experiments using data collected from a four-way intersection through roadside camera sensor platforms to study the effectiveness of the proposed model in uncrowded environments. On this dataset, the proposed model has an ADE of 0.74 m and a FDE of about 1.40 m for a 6-seconds-long prediction horizon. A complementary set of experiments is conducted to further investigate model performance in a real-world intersection. In these experiments, the model gains an ADE/FDE of 0.76/1.70 m. The proposed model also produces accurate prediction results on different scenarios composed of different walking patterns (e.g., straight and curvy) and different environments (e.g., sidewalk and street). The average displacement errors on all investigated datasets are within the length of a single step of an adult. The experiments also indicate that the displacement error grows almost linearly with the prediction horizon.

DT Article
DE autonomous driving; traffic control hand signal; deep learning
AB Gesture understanding is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision. Among them, traffic hand signal recognition requires the consideration of speed and the validity of the commanding signal. The lack of available datasets is also a serious problem. Most classifiers approach these problems using the skeletons of target actors in an image. Extracting the three-dimensional coordinates of skeletons is simplified when depth information accompanies the images. However, depth cameras cost significantly more than RGB cameras. Furthermore, the extraction of the skeleton needs to be performed in prior. Here, we show a hand signal detection algorithm without skeletons. Instead of skeletons, we use simple object detectors trained to acquire hand directions. The variance in the time length of gestures mixed with random pauses and noise is handled with a recurrent neural network (RNN). Furthermore, we have developed a flag sequence algorithm to assess the validity of the commanding signal. In whole, the computed hand directions are sent to the RNN, which identifies six types of hand signals given by traffic controllers with the ability to distinguish time variations and intermittent randomly appearing noises. We constructed a hand signal dataset composed of 100 thousand RGB images that is made publicly available. We achieved correct recognition of the hand signals with various backgrounds at 91% accuracy. A processing speed of 30 FPS in FHD video streams, which is a 52% improvement over the best among previous works, was achieved. Despite the extra burden of deciding the validity of the hand signals, this method surpasses methods that solely use RGB video streams. Our work is capable of performing with nonstationary viewpoints, such as those taken from moving vehicles. To accomplish this goal, we set a higher priority for the speed and validity assessment of the recognized commanding signals. The collected dataset is made publicly available through the Korean government portal under the URL "data.go.kr/data/15075814/fileData.do."

AB The birth of mass production started in the early 1900s. The manufacturing industries were transformed from mechanization to digitalization with the help of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Now, the advancement of ICT and the Internet of Things has enabled smart manufacturing or Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 refers to the various technologies that are transforming the way we work in manufacturing industries such as Internet of Things, cloud, big data, AI, robotics, blockchain, autonomous vehicles, enterprise software, etc. Additionally, the Industry 4.0 concept refers to new production patterns involving new technologies, manufacturing factors, and workforce organization. It changes the production process and creates a highly efficient production system that reduces production costs and improves product quality. The concept of Industry 4.0 is relatively new; there is high uncertainty, lack of knowledge and limited publication about the performance measurement and quality management with respect to Industry 4.0. Conversely, manufacturing companies are still struggling to understand the variety of Industry 4.0 technologies. Industrial standards are used to measure performance and manage the quality of the product and services. In order to fill this gap, our study focuses on how the manufacturing industries use different industrial standards to measure performance and manage the quality of the product and services. This paper reviews the current methods, industrial standards, key performance indicators (KPIs) used for performance measurement systems in data-driven Industry 4.0, and the case studies to understand how smart manufacturing companies are taking advantage of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, this article discusses the digitalization of quality called Quality 4.0, research challenges and opportunities in data-driven Industry 4.0 are discussed.

AB Hydrocarbon seepage plays an essential role in defining seafloor morphology and increasing habitat heterogeneity in the deep sea whereby asphalt volcanism ranks among the most complex and proliferous hydrocarbon discharge systems that have been described to date. In this study, seepage of hydrocarbon gas and oil as well as asphalt deposits were investigated at Mictlan Knoll in the southern Gulf of Mexico. A multi-disciplinary approach was used including hydroacoustic surveys and visual seafloor observations to study the seafloor manifestations of hydrocarbon seepage. Mictlan Knoll is an asphalt volcano characterized by a crater-like depression surrounded by an elevated rim. Asphalt deposits are widespread in the depression where a large area of extensive asphalt deposits correlates with a high backscatter area (similar to 75,000 m(2)). Numerous asphalt deposits appear relatively fresh and probably extruded recently, as oil bubbles were seen to emanate locally within areas covered by extensive asphalt deposits. An area of more irregular seafloor morphology occurring in the northern part of the depression is interpreted to be related to the active extrusion of asphalt below or within older surficial deposits. Additionally, 25 hydroacoustic anomalies indicative for gas bubble emissions were detected. Gas volume quantifications conducted during seafloor inspections with a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) at a single gas escape site situated above a gas hydrate outcrop revealed up to 0.1 x 10(6) mol CH4/yr. Gas emission at this site, monitored by an autonomous scanning sonar device, indicated a highly variable bubble release activity. Based on our findings, it is proposed that Mictlan Knoll hosts the most extensive asphalt deposits known to date in the Gulf of Mexico.

TI Measurements from the RV <i>Ronald H</i>. <i>Brown</i> and related
   platforms as part of the Atlantic Tradewind Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale
   Interaction Campaign (ATOMIC)
SO EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
LA English
DT Article; Data Paper
AB The Atlantic Tradewind Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Interaction Campaign (ATOMIC) took place from 7 January to 11 July 2020 in the tropical North Atlantic between the eastern edge of Barbados and 51ffi W, the longitude of the Northwest Tropical Atlantic Station (NTAS) mooring. Measurements were made to gather information on shallow atmospheric convection, the effects of aerosols and clouds on the ocean surface energy budget, and mesoscale oceanic processes. Multiple platforms were deployed during ATOMIC including the NOAA RV Ronald H. Brown (RHB) (7 January to 13 February) and WP-3D Orion (P-3) aircraft (17 January to 10 February), the University of Colorado's Robust Autonomous Aerial Vehicle-Endurant Nimble (RAAVEN) uncrewed aerial system (UAS) (24 January to 15 February), NOAA- and NASA-sponsored Saildrones (12 January to 11 July), and Surface Velocity Program Salinity (SVPS) surface ocean drifters (23 January to 29 April). The RV Ronald H. Brown conducted in situ and remote sensing measurements of oceanic and atmospheric properties with an emphasis on mesoscale oceanic-atmospheric coupling and aerosol-cloud interactions. In addition, the ship served as a launching pad for Wave Gliders, Surface Wave Instrument Floats with Tracking (SWIFTs), and radiosondes. Details of measurements made from the RV Ronald H. Brown, ship-deployed assets, and other platforms closely coordinated with the ship during ATOMIC are provided here. These platforms include Saildrone 1064 and the RAAVEN UAS as well as the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO) and Barbados Atmospheric Chemistry Observatory (BACO). Inter-platform comparisons are presented to assess consistency in the data sets. Data sets from the RV Ronald H. Brown and deployed assets have been quality controlled and are publicly available at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) data archive (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/archive/accession/ATOMIC-2020, last access: 2 April 2021). Point-of-contact information and links to individual data sets with digital object identifiers (DOIs) are provided herein.

AB Vehicular positioning systems are necessary for the development of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). In recent years, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have been included in proposals for multi-sensor positioning system architectures in order to take advantage of their cost and size. The measurement errors propagation to the positioning solution have limited its application for long-term positioning solution. However, it can play a key role in those applications where tri-axial attitude and accelerations can be indicators of curves, slopes, cants, etc. and it can be used as diagnostic of other sensors measurements. This work is focused on the use of IMUs for diagnostic applications and it compares medium-end (xSens MTi-100) and low-end (Bosch BMI160) grade MEMS-based IMUs in an experimental road test using a fusion of a high-end IMU (KVH GEO-FOG), GNSS and wheel speed sensor as reference. In addition, a research question about whether the calibration is the main reason between different grade IMUs has been formulated. Thus, a simple, manufacturable and cost-efficient calibration technique is applied to the low-end IMU in order to compare its performance improvement with the medium-end one. The raw measurements (angular rates and specific forces) and navigation states (tri-axial attitude and accelerations) are considered for diagnosis and they are statistically compared to evaluate the performance of each IMU. It is concluded that the calibration technique used makes the low-end IMU performance similar to that of the medium-end one. Consequently, this work contributes to optimizing the cost of land vehicular positioning systems when choosing the most appropriate sensor based on the accuracy and precision required for the application.

AB This paper compares two shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) configurations developed on travel policy of shuttles in the systems. Specifically, we compare two system configurations of SBS/RS: SBS/RS with tier-captive shuttles and SBS/RS with tier-to-tier shuttles. In a tier-captive SBS/RS warehouse design, there is a dedicated shuttle in each tier that cannot travel between tiers. Due to a large number of shuttles in such a configuration, lifts are always bottlenecks and the utilizations of shuttles are very low. In this study, we propose an alternative SBS/RS design with tier-to-tier shuttles in which shuttles can travel between tiers by using a separate lifting mechanism dedicated for them. The advantage of this design would be reduction in investment cost due to the decreased number as well as higher utilizations of shuttles in the system. The two configurations were compared on the following performance metrics: initial investment costs, throughput rates per hour, and average energy consumption per transaction when there is a regeneration mechanism in the system. In a tier-to-tier SBS/RS design, allowing shuttles to travel between tiers increases operational complexity of the system. Thus, we simulate the two system designs and compare their performance metrics by conducting several rack design experiments based on the number of aisles, tiers, and bays. The results of this study suggest that there may be a better configuration in terms of total investment cost and throughput rate in a newly proposed tier-to-tier SBS/RS design that could be considered as an alternative to a tier-captive SBS/RS design.

AB This paper proposes a framework for automatic classification of mobile laser scanner (MLS) point cloud using multi-faceted multi-object convolutional neural network (MMCN). The proposed method takes a full three-dimensional (3D) point cloud as input and outputs a class label for each point. Unlike other existing classification methods for MLS data, the proposed method is not dependent on any parameter or its tuning. The proposed MMCN uses multiple objects of a sample, defined by different sizes of the sample, in addition to the different facets obtained by rotating about the various axes, thus adding more information during the training and testing stages. The proposed framework uses manually extracted samples for training the MMCN. Automatically extracted multiple regions based on the various radii of spherical neighbourhoods around MLS points are passed through the trained MMCN for determining their probabilities of belonging to different classes. The class probabilities of different sized regions are then used as a feature vector to train a support vector machine (SVM), and the final decision for the class of a point is based on the SVM output. The proposed framework has been trained for five classes, viz., Ground, House, Pole, Tree, and Car and has been tested on Oakland and Paris-Lille 3D MLS datasets. The total accuracy and kappa coefficient (kappa) reach up to 96.5% and 93.8%, respectively, for the framework. The MMCN together with the SVM is able to achieve parameter-free classification of MLS data, thereby eliminating the need for manual parameter tuning as in the existing methods. Therefore, besides the use for classification of MLS data for mapping purpose, the approach is also suitable for classification of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data resulting from autonomous vehicle sensors. The accuracy of this work can be further improved by incorporating more and varied training samples and deeper convolutional neural network (CNN) with better hardware resources.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to verify the correctness and feasibility of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm based on red-green-blue depth (RGB-D) camera in high precision navigation and localization of celestial exploration rover. Design/methodology/approach First, a positioning algorithm based on depth camera is proposed. Second, the realization method is described from the five aspects of feature detection method, feature point matching, point cloud mapping, motion estimation and high precision optimization. Feature detection: taking the precision, real-time and motion basics as the comprehensive consideration, the ORB (oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF) features extraction method is adopted; feature point matching: solves the similarity measure of the feature descriptor vector and how to remove the mismatch point; point cloud mapping: the two-dimensional information on RGB and the depth information on D corresponding; motion estimation: the iterative closest point algorithm is used to solve point set registration; and high precision optimization: optimized by using the graph optimization method. Findings The proposed high-precision SLAM algorithm is very effective for solving high precision navigation and positioning of celestial exploration rover.
   Research limitations/implications - In this paper, the simulation validation is based on an open source data set for testing; the physical verification is based on the existing unmanned vehicle platform to simulate the celestial exploration rover.
   Practical implications - This paper presents a RGB-D camera-based navigation algorithm, which can be obtained by simulation experiment and physical verification. The real-time and accuracy of the algorithm are well behaved and have strong applicability, which can support the tests and experiments on hardware platform and have a better environmental adaptability.
   Originality/value The proposed SLAM algorithm can deal with the high precision navigation and positioning of celestial exploration rover effectively. Taking into account the current wide application prospect of computer vision, the method in this paper can provide a study foundation for the deep space probe.

AB The digital world is expanding rapidly and advances in networking technologies such as 4G long-term evolution (LTE), wireless broadband (WiBro), low-power wide area networks (LPWAN), 5G, LiFi, and so on, all of which are paving the way for the emergence of sophisticated services. The number of online applications is increasing along with more computation, communication, and intelligent capabilities. Although current devices in use today are also getting more powerful in terms of features and capabilities, but they are still incapable of executing smart, autonomous, and intelligent tasks such as those often required for smart healthcare, ambient assisted living (AAL), virtual reality, augmented reality, intelligent vehicular communication, as well as in many services related to smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), Tactile Internet, Internet of Vehicles (boy), and so on. For many of these applications, we need another entity to execute tasks on behalf of the user's device and return the results - a technique often called offloading, where tasks are outsourced and the involved entities work in tandem to achieve the ultimate goal of the application. Task offloading is attractive for emerging IoT and cloud computing applications. It can occur between IoT nodes, sensors, edge devices, or fog nodes. Offloading can be performed based on different factors that include computational requirements of an application, load balancing, energy management, latency management, and so on. We present a taxonomy of recent offloading schemes that have been proposed for domains such as fog, cloud computing, and IoT. We also discuss the middleware technologies that enable offloading in a cloud-IoT cases and the factors that are important for offloading in a particular scenario. We also present research opportunities concerning offloading in fog and edge computing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE batoids pectoral fin; cartilage structure; kinematics

AB Growing interest in the development of bio-inspired autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has motivated research in understanding the mechanisms behind the propulsion systems of marine animals. For example, the locomotive behavior of rays (Batoidea) by movement of the pectoral fins is of particular interest due to their superior performance characteristics over contemporary AUV propulsion systems. To better understand the mechanics of pectoral fin propulsion, this paper introduces a biomechanical model that simulates how batoid skeletal structures function to achieve the swimming locomotion observed in nature. Two rays were studied, Dasyatis sabina (Atlantic ray), and Rhinoptera bonasus (cownose ray). These species were selected because they exhibit very different swimming styles (undulation versus oscillation), but all use primarily their pectoral fins for propulsion (unlike electric rays or guitarfishes). Computerized tomography scans of each species were taken to image the underlying structure, which reveal a complex system of cartilaginous joints and linkages. Data collected from these images were used to quantify the complete skeletal morphometry of each batoid fin. Morphological differences were identified in the internal cartilage arrangement between each species including variations in the orientation of the skeletal elements, or radials, and the joint patterns between them, called the inter-radial joint pattern. These data were used as the primary input into the biomechanical model to couple a given ray skeletal structure with various swimming motions. A key output of the model is an estimation of the uniaxial strain that develops in the skeletal connective tissue in order for the structure to achieve motions observed during swimming. Tensile load tests of this connective tissue were conducted to further investigate the implications of the material strain predictions. The model also demonstrates that changes in the skeletal architecture (e.g., joint positioning) will effect fin deformation characteristics. Ultimately, the results of this study can be used to guide the design of optimally performing bio-inspired AUVs.

ID HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM; ANALOG MODELS; MINERALIZATION
AB A survey of the Brothers caldera volcano (Kermadec arc) with the autonomous underwater vehicle ABE has revealed new details of the morphology and structure of this submarine frontal arc caldera and the geologic setting of its hydrothermal activity. Brothers volcano has formed between major SW-NE-trending faults within the extensional field of the Havre Trough. Brothers may be unique among known submarine calderas in that it has four active hydrothermal systems, two high-temperature sulfide-depositing sites associated with faulting on the northwestern and western walls (i.e., the NW caldera and W caldera hydrothermal sites, respectively), and gas-rich sites on the summits of the constructional cones that fill most of the southern part of the caldera (i.e., the Upper and Lower cone sites). The 3.0- x 3.4-km caldera is well defined by a topographic rim encompassing similar to 320 degrees of its circumference and which lies between the bounds of two outer half-graben-shaped faults in the northwest and southeast sectors. There is not a morphologically well defined continuous ring fault (at the map resolution), although near-vertical scarps are present discontinuously at the base of sections of the wall. The width of the wall varies from <200 m at its southwest portion to similar to 750 m on its northern section. The widest part of the wall is its northwest sector, which also has the largest documented area of hydrothermal alteration and where sea-floor magnetization is lowest. In addition to primary northwest-southeast elongation and southwest-northeast structures caused by faulting within the regional back-arc strain field, there are also less well developed west-southwest-north-northeast regional structures intersecting the volcano that is apparent on the ABE bathymetry and at outcrop scale from submersible observations. Asymmetrical trap-door-style caldera collapse is considered a possible mechanism for the formation of the Brothers caldera.

AB Getting precise aspects of road through segmentation from remote sensing imagery is useful for many real world applications such as autonomous vehicles, urban development and planning, and achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs).1 Roads are only a small part of the image, and their appearance, type, width, elevation, directions, etc. exhibit large variations across geographical areas. Furthermore, due to differences in urbanization styles, planning, and the natural environments; regions along the roads vary significantly. Due to these variations among the train and test domains (domain shift), the road segmentation algorithms fail to generalize to new geographical locations. Unlike the generic domain alignment scenarios, road segmentation has no scene structure and generic domain adaptive segmentation methods are unable to enforce topological properties like continuity, connectivity, smoothness, etc., thus resulting in degraded domain alignment. In this work, we propose a topology-aware unsupervised domain adaptation approach for road segmentation in remote sensing imagery. During domain adaptation for road segmentation, we predict road skeleton, an auxiliary task to enforce the topological constraints. To enforce consistent predictions of road and skeleton, especially in the unlabeled target domain, the conformity loss is defined across the skeleton prediction head and the road-segmentation head. Furthermore, for self-training, we filter out the noisy pseudo-labels by using a connectivity-based pseudo-labels refinement strategy, on both road and skeleton segmentation heads, thus avoiding holes and discontinuities. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, for SpaceNet to DeepGlobe adaptation, the proposed approach outperforms the competing methods by a minimum margin of 6.6%, 6.7%, and 9.8% in IoU, F1-score, and APLS, respectively.

AB In this paper, we address the most pressing challenges faced by the manufacturing sector, particularly the manufacturing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), where the transition towards high-mix low-volume production and the availability of cost-effective solutions are crucial. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents 14 innovative solutions that can be utilized to support the introduction of agile manufacturing processes in SMEs. These solutions encompass a wide range of key technologies, including reconfigurable fixtures, low-cost automation for printed circuit board (PCB) assembly, computer-vision-based control, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) simulations, predictive maintenance based on Internet of Things (IoT), virtualization for operator training, intuitive robot programming using virtual reality (VR), autonomous trajectory generation, programming by demonstration for force-based tasks, on-line task allocation in human-robot collaboration (HRC), projector-based graphical user interface (GUI) for HRC, human safety in collaborative work cells, and integration of automated ground vehicles for intralogistics. All of these solutions were designed with the purpose of increasing agility in the manufacturing sector. They are designed to enable flexible and modular manufacturing systems that are easy to integrate and use while remaining cost-effective for SMEs. As such, they have a high potential to be implemented in the manufacturing industry. They can be used as standalone modules or combined to solve a more complicated task, and contribute to enhancing the agility, efficiency, and competitiveness of manufacturing companies. With their application tested in industrially relevant environments, the proposed solutions strive to ensure practical implementation and real-world impact. While this paper presents these solutions and gives an overview of their methodologies and evaluations, it does not go into their details. It provides summaries of comprehensive and multifaceted solutions to tackle the evolving needs and demands of the manufacturing sector, empowering SMEs to thrive in a dynamic and competitive market landscape.

AB Depth sensors have emerged as a cornerstone sensor modality with diverse applications in personal hand-held devices, robotics, scientific imaging, autonomous vehicles, and more. In particular, correlation Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors have found widespread adoption for meter-scale indoor applications such as object tracking and pose estimation. While they offer high depth resolution at competitive costs, the precision of these indirect ToF sensors is fundamentally limited by their modulation contrast, which is in turn limited by the effects of photo-conversion noise. In contrast, optical interferometric methods can leverage short illumination modulation wavelengths to achieve depth precision three orders of magnitude greater than ToF, but typically find their range is restricted to the sub-centimeter.
   In this work, we merge concepts from both correlation ToF design and interferometric imaging; a step towards bridging the gap between these methods. We propose a computational ToF imaging method that optically computes the GHz ToF correlation signal in free space before photo-conversion. To acquire a depth map, we scan a scene point-wise and computationally unwrap the collected correlation measurements. Specifically, we repurpose electro-optical modulators used in optical communication for ToF imaging with centimeter-wave signals, and achieve all-optical correlation at 7.15 GHz and 14.32 GHz modulation frequencies. While GHz modulation frequencies increase depth precision, these high modulation rates also pose a technical challenge. They result in dozens of wraps per meter which cannot be estimated robustly by existing phase unwrapping methods. We tackle this problem with a proposed segmentation-inspired phase unwrapping network, which exploits the correlation of adjacent GHz phase measurements to classify regions into their respective wrap counts. We validate this method in simulation and experimentally, and demonstrate precise depth sensing using centimeter wave modulation that is robust to surface texture and ambient light. Compared to existing analog demodulation methods, the proposed system outperforms all of them across all tested scenarios.

AB Cameras and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors are commonly used together in autonomous vehicles to provide rich color and texture information and information on the location of objects, respectively. However, fusing image and point-cloud information remains a key challenge. In this article, we propose D-S augmentation as a 3-D object detection method based on point-cloud density and semantic augmentation. Our proposed approach first performs 2-D bounding box detection and instance segmentation on an image. Then, a LiDAR point cloud is projected onto an instance segmentation mask, and a fixed number of random points are generated. Finally, a global N-nearest neighbor clustering is used to associate random and projected points to give depth to virtual points and complete point-cloud density augmentation (P-DA). Then, point-cloud semantic augmentation (P-SA) is performed, in which the instance segmentation mask of an object is used to associate it with the point cloud. The instance-segmented class labels and segmentation scores are assigned to the projected cloud, and the projection points added with 1-D features are inversely mapped to the point-cloud space to obtain a semantically augmented point cloud. We conducted extensive experiments on the nuScenes (Caesar et al., 2020) and KITTI (Geiger et al., 2012) datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Notably, D-S augmentation outperformed a LiDAR-only baseline detector by +7.9% in terms of mean average precision (mAP) and +5.1% in terms of nuScenes detection score (NDS) and outperformed the state-of-the-art multimodal fusion-based methods. We also present the results of ablation studies to show that the fusion module improved the performance of a baseline detector.

AB Automatic driving has led to a great demand for global instantaneous high-precision precise point positioning (PPP). To achieve global instantaneous high-precision PPP, such as centimeter-level accuracy, global single-epoch narrow-lane (NL) ambiguity resolution (AR) is needed, which is quite difficult due to the limited accuracy of global atmospheric corrections. Multi-constellation and multi-frequency PPP wide-lane (WL) AR (PPP-WAR) provides a new approach to global single-epoch NL AR without atmosphere corrections because the instant NL ambiguity accuracies will be improved by fixing many WL ambiguities instantaneously. In this article, the uncombined PPP cascading WL/NL AR method (PPP-CAR) was extended to GPS, Galileo, BDS-2, and BDS-3 all-frequency signals to investigate global single-epoch NL AR with global public stations. The test results indicated that the instant positioning accuracies improved substantially with increasing frequencies for the single-epoch multi-frequency PPP-CARs, attributed to the contribution of the additional frequency observations. However, the same fixing rates of the NL ambiguities of 99.8% in all epochs were achieved for the single-epoch multi-frequency PPP-CARs, demonstrating that more reliable single-epoch NL ARs were reached with increasing frequencies. Only decimeter-level instant positioning accuracies were achieved for the dual-frequency, triple-frequency, and quad-frequency PPP-CARs. A centimeter-level global horizontal instant positioning accuracy of 0.07 and 0.08 m in the east and north components, respectively, was achieved by the five-frequency PPP-CAR for the first time. These results are very encouraging because better positioning is expected for global autonomous driving vehicles by integrating the multi-constellation all-frequency signals with other sensors, such as an inertial sensor.

AB Truck platooning is expected to significantly affect road freight transport performances, although in the long term due to technological and operational issues still to address. Furthermore, truck platooning could be introduced with increasing levels of automation, corresponding to different technologies and operational costs. In parallel, various Countries promote freight-related infra -structural plans pursuing a modal shift from the road towards more sustainable modes (railways, sea shipping, inland waterways). The planning horizon of such infrastructures probably overlaps, at least partially, with a non-negligible market penetration of truck platooning. In this framework, the paper aims to explore the extent of a system-wide competition between existing freight modes and truck platooning, through an exploratory analysis of the potential market of truck platooning in Italy. The study is based on a comparative analysis of the cost of various freight modes, leveraging a multimodal nationwide freight supply model. Forty different scenarios have been modelled, with different assumptions on the input variables including three levels of automation. Results show that truck platooning could be highly competitive with respect to rail transport for medium to large distances. Competition with conventional road transport is significant as well, with a large contestable market share between truck platooning and traditional road freight, especially on medium to long distances, whilst maritime transport starts competing with truck platooning only in the case of (at least partially) unmanned truck platooning operations. The size of truck platoons impacts appreciably on results only with a manned leader truck and unmanned followers. Based on the above results it would be appropriate to consider track platooning as a new freight transport mode.

AB On-road behavior analysis is a crucial and challenging problem in the autonomous driving vision-based area. Several endeavors have been proposed to deal with different related tasks and it has gained wide attention recently. Much of the excitement about on-road behavior understanding has been the labor of advancement witnessed in the fields of computer vision, machine, and deep learning. Remarkable achievements have been made in the Road Behavior Understanding area over the last years. This paper reviews 100+ papers of on-road behavior analysis related work in the light of the milestones achieved, spanning over the last 2 decades. This review paper provides the first attempt to draw smart mobility researchers' attention to the road behavior understanding field and its potential impact on road safety to the whole road agents such as: drivers, pedestrians, stuffs, etc. To push for an holistic understanding, we investigate the complementary relationships between different elementary tasks that we define as the main components of road behavior understanding to achieve a comprehensive understanding of approaches and techniques. For this, five related topics have been covered in this review, including situational awareness, driver-road interaction, road scene understanding, trajectories forecast, driving activities, and status analysis. This paper also reviews the contribution of deep learning approaches and makes an in-depth analysis of recent benchmarks as well, with a specific taxonomy that can help stakeholders in selecting their best-fit architecture. We also finally provide a comprehensive discussion leading us to identify novel research directions some of which have been implemented and validated in our current smart mobility research work. This paper presents the first survey of road behavior understanding-related work without overlap with existing reviews.

AB The current development of artificial intelligence is largely based on deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Especially in the computer vision field, DNNs now occur in everything from autonomous vehicles to safety control systems. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is based on DNNs mostly used in different computer vision applications, especially for image classification and object detection. The CNN model takes the photos as input and, after training, assigns it a suitable class after setting traceable parameters like weights and biases. CNN is derived from Human Brain's Part Visual Cortex and sometimes performs even better than Haman visual system. However, recent research shows that CNN Models are much vulnerable against adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are input image huts that are deliberately modified, which are imperceptible to humans, but a CNN model strongly misrepresents them. This means that adversarial attacks or examples are a serious threat to deep learning models, especially for CNNs in the computer vision field. The methods which are used to create adversarial examples are called adversarial attacks. We have proposed an easy method that restores adversarial examples, which are created due to different adversarial attacks and misclassified by a CNN model. Our reconstructed adversarial examples are correctly classified by a model again with high probability and restore the prediction of a CNN model. We will also prove that our method is based on image arithmetic operations, simple, single-step, and has low computational complexity. Our method is to reconstruct all types of adversarial examples for correct classification. Therefore, we can say that our proposed method is universal or transferable. The datasets used for experimental evidence are MNIST, FASHION-MNIST, CIFAR10, and CALTECH-101. In the end, we have presented a comparative analysis with other state-of-the methods and proved that our results are better.

AB Moving object detection (MOD) is a fundamental step in many high-level vision-based applications, such as human activity analysis, visual object tracking, autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and security. Most of the existing MOD algorithms observe performance degradation in the presence of complex scenes containing camouflage objects, shadows, dynamic backgrounds, and varying illumination conditions, and captured by static cameras. To appropriately handle these challenges, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based on a moving object detection algorithm, called MOD_GAN. In the proposed algorithm, scene-specific GANs are trained in an unsupervised MOD setting, thereby enabling the algorithm to learn generating background sequences using input from uniformly distributed random noise samples. In addition to adversarial loss, during training, norm-based loss in the image space and discriminator feature-space is also minimized between the generated images and the training data. The additional losses enable the generator to learn subtle background details, resulting in a more realistic complex scene generation. During testing, a novel back-propagation based algorithm is used to generate images with statistics similar to the test images. More appropriate random noise samples are searched by directly minimizing the loss function between the test and generated images both in the image and discriminator feature-spaces. The network is not updated in this step; only the input noise samples are iteratively modified to minimize the loss function. Moreover, motion information is used to ensure that this loss is only computed on small-motion pixels. A novel dataset containing outdoor time-lapsed images from dawn to dusk with a full illumination variation cycle is also proposed to better compare the MOD algorithms in outdoor scenes. Accordingly, extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets and comparison with 30 existing methods demonstrate the strength of the proposed algorithm.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to show the potentials of a cost-effective unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) system for agriculture industry. The current population growth rate is so vast that farming industry must be highly efficient and optimized. As a response for high quality food demands, the new branch of the agriculture industry has been formed - the precision agriculture. It supports farming process with sensors, automation and innovative technologies. The UAV advantages over regular aviation are withering. Not only they can fly at lower altitude and are more precise but also offer same high quality and are much cheaper.
   Design/methodology/approach - The main objective of this project was to implement an exemplary cost-effective UAV system with electronic camera stabilizer for gaining useful data for agriculture. The system was based on small, unmanned flying wing able to perform fully autonomous missions, a commercially available camera and an own-design camera stabilizer. The research plan was to integrate the platform and run numerous experimental flights over farms, fields and woods collecting aerial pictures. All the missions have been planned to serve for local farming and forest industries and cooperated with local business authorities.
   Findings - In preliminary flight tests, the variety of geodetic, forest and agriculture data have been acquired, placed for post processing and applied for the farming processes. The results of the research were high quality orthophoto maps, 3D maps, digital surface models and images mosaics with normalized difference vegetation index. The end users were astonished with the high-quality results and claimed the high importance for their business.
   Originality/value - The case study results proved that this kind of a small UAV system is exceptional to manage and optimize processes at innovative farms. So far only professional, high-cost UAV platforms or traditional airships have been applied for agriculture industry. This paper shows that even simple, commercially available equipment could be used for professional applications.

AB This brief investigates fault-tolerant cooperative control (FTCC) strategies for multiple differentially driven autonomous wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) in the presence of actuator faults during formation operation. First, for normal/fault-free cases and for preparation to the faults occurrence cases, an integrated approach combining input-output feedback linearization and distributed linear model predictive control techniques is designed and implemented on a team of WMRs to accomplish a formation task. Second, when actuator faults occur in one of the robots of the team, two cases are explicitly considered: 1) if the faulty robot cannot complete its assigned task due to a severe fault, then the faulty robot has to get out from the formation mission, and an FTCC strategy is designed such that the tasks of the WMRs team are reassigned to the remaining healthy robots to complete the mission with graceful performance degradation and 2) if the faulty robot can continue the mission with degraded performance, then the other team members reconfigure their controllers considering the capability of the faulty robot. Thus, the FTCC strategy is designed to re-coordinate the motion of each robot in the team. Within the proposed scheme, a fault detection and diagnosis unit using a two-stage Kalman filter to detect and diagnose actuator faults is presented. Then, the FTCC problem is formulated as an optimal assignment problem, where a Hungarian algorithm is applied. Moreover, a collision avoidance algorithm based on mechanical impedance principle is proposed to avoid the potential collision between the healthy robots and the faulty ones. Formation operation of the robot team is based on a leader-follower approach, while the control algorithm is implemented in a distributed manner. The results of real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FTCC scheme in different fault scenarios.

AB Terahertz (THz)-band communications have been envisioned as a key technology to support ultra-high-data-rate applications in 5G-beyond (or 6G) wireless networks. Compared to the microwave and mmWave bands, the main challenges with the THz band are in its i) large path loss hence limited network coverage and ii) visible-light-like propagation characteristics hence poor support of mobility in blockage-rich environments. This paper studies quantitatively the applicability of THz-band communications in blockage-rich mobile environments, focusing on a new network scenario called FlyTera. In FlyTera, a set of hotspots mounted on flying drones collaboratively provide data streaming services to ground users, in the microwave, mmWave and THz bands. We first provide a mathematical formulation of the FlyTera control problem, where the objective is to maximize the network spectral efficiency by jointly controlling the flight of the drone hotspots, their association to the ground users, and the spectrum bands used by the users. To solve the resulting problem, which is shown to be a mixed integer nonlinear nonconvex programming (MINLP) problem, we design distributed solution algorithms based on a combination of echo state learning and reinforcement learning. An extensive simulation campaign is then conducted with SimBAG, a newly developed Simulator of Broadband Aerial-Ground wireless networks. It is shown that no single spectrum band can meet the requirements of high data rate and wide coverage simultaneously. Moreover, from the network-level point of view, THz-band communications can significantly benefit from the mobility of the flying drones, and on average 4 - 6 times higher (rather than lower) throughput can be achieved in mobile than in static environments.

DT Article

AB In this work, we propose a novel one-stage and keypoint-based framework for monocular 3D object detection using only RGB images, called KM3D-Net. 2D detection only requires a deep neural network to predict 2D properties of objects, as it is a semanticity-aware task. For image-based 3D detection, we argue that the combination of a deep neural network and geometric constraints are needed to synergistically estimate appearance-related and spatial-related information. Here, we design a fully convolutional model to predict object keypoints, dimension, and orientation, and combine these with perspective geometry constraints to compute position attributes. Further, we reformulate the geometric constraints as a differentiable version and embed this in the network to reduce running time while maintaining the consistency of model outputs in an end-to-end fashion. Benefiting from this simple structure, we propose an effective semi-supervised training strategy for settings where labeled training data are scarce. In this strategy, we enforce a consensus prediction of two shared-weights KM3D-Net for the same unlabeled image under different input augmentation conditions and network regularization. In particular, we unify the coordinate-dependent augmentations as the affine transformation for the differential recovering position of objects, and propose a keypoint-dropout module for network regularization. Our model only requires RGB images, without synthetic data, instance segmentation, CAD model, or depth generator. Extensive experiments on the popular KITTI 3D detection dataset indicate that the KM3D-Net surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in both efficiency and accuracy. And also, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of semi-supervised learning in monocular 3D object detection. We surpass most of the previous fully supervised methods with only 13% labeled data on KITTI.

AB Traditionally, bathymetry mapping of ponds, lakes, and rivers have used techniques which are low in spatial resolution. Waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) are utilized worldwide for wastewater treatment, and throughout their operation require periodic sludge surveys. Sludge accumulation in WSPs can impact performance by reducing the effective volume of the pond, and altering the pond hydraulics and wastewater treatment efficiency. Traditionally, sludge heights, and thus sludge volume, have been measured using techniques such as the "sludge judge" and the "white towel" test. Both of these methods have low spatial resolution, are subjective in terms of precision and accuracy, are labor intensive, and require a high level of safety precautions. A sonar device fitted to a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) can improve the resolution and accuracy of sludge height measurements, as well as reduce labor and safety requirements. This technology is readily available; however, despite its applicability, it has not been previously assessed for use on WSPs. This study aimed to design, build, and assess the performance of an ROV to measure sludge height in WSPs. Profiling of several WSPs has shown that the ROV with autonomous sonar device is capable of providing bathymetry with greatly increased spatial resolution in a greatly reduced profiling time. To date, the ROV has been applied on in excess of 400 WSPs across Australia, several large lakes, stormwater retention ponds, river beds, and drinking water reservoirs. ROVs, such as the one built in this study, will be useful for not only determining sludge profiles, but also in calculating sludge accumulation rates and in evaluating pond hydraulic efficiency. As demonstrated, this technology is not limited to application in wastewater management, with the potential for wider application in the monitoring of other small to medium-sized water bodies, including reservoirs, lakes, channels, recreational water bodies, river beds, mine tailing dams and commercial ports.

AB The erosion, transport and deposition of sediments in small valley reservoirs represent a significant impact on their operations, mainly with regard to reducing the volume of their accumulation. The aim of this study is a comparison and uncertainty analysis of two modelling concepts for assessment of soil loss and sediment transport in a small agricultural catchment, with an emphasis on estimating the off-site effects of soil erosion resulted in sedimentation of a small water reservoir. The small water reservoir (polder) of Svacenicky Creek which was built in 2012, is a part of the flood protection measures in Tura Utica and is located in the western part of Slovakia, close to the town of Myjava. The town of Myjava in recent years has been threatened by frequent floods, which have caused heavy material losses and significantly limited the quality of life of the local residents. To estimate the amount of soil loss and sediments transported from the basin, we applied two modelling concepts based on the USLE/SDR and WaTEM/SEDEM erosion models and validated the results with the actual bathymetry of the polder. The measurements were provided by a modern Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) hydrographic instrument. From the sediment data measured and the original geodetic survey of the terrain conducted at the time of the construction of the polder, we calculated changes in the storage volume of the polder during its four years of operation. The results show that in the given area, there has been a gradual clogging of the bottom of the polder caused by water erosion. We estimate that within the four years of the acceptance run, 10,494 m(3) of bottom sediments on the Svacenicky Creek polder have accumulated. It therefore follows that repeated surveying of the sedimentation is very important for the management of the water reservoir.

AB Fast object tracking on embedded devices is of great importance for applications such as autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicle, and intelligent monitoring. Whereas, most of previous general solutions failed to reach this goal due to the facts that (i) high computational complexity and heterogeneous operation steps in the tracking models and (ii) parallelism-limited and bloated hardware platforms (e.g., CPU/GPU). Although previously proposed devices leverage neural dynamics and near-data processing for efficient tracking, their flexibility is limited due to the tight integration with vision sensor and the effectiveness on various video datasets is yet to be fully demonstrated. On the other side, recently the many-core architecture with massive parallelism and optimized memory locality is being widely applied to improve the performance for flexibly executing neural networks. This motivates us to adapt and map an object tracking model based on attractor neural networks with continuous and smooth attractor dynamics onto neural network chips for fast tracking. In order to make the model hardware friendly, we add local-connection restriction. We analyze the tracking accuracy and observe that the model achieves comparable results on typical video datasets. Then, we design a many-core neural network architecture with several computation and transformation operations to support the model. Moreover, by discretizing the continuous dynamics to the corresponding discrete counterpart, designing a slicing scheme for efficient topology mapping, and introducing a constant-restricted scaling chain rule for data quantization, we build a complete mapping framework to implement the tracking model on the many-core architecture. We fabricate a many-core neural network chip to evaluate the real execution performance. Results show that a single chip is able to accommodate the whole tracking model, and a fast tracking speed of nearly 800 FPS (frames per second) can be achieved. This work enables high-speed object tracking on embedded devices which normally have limited resources and energy.

AB Despite the significance of marine habitat-forming organisms, little is known about their largescale distribution and abundance in deeper waters, where they are difficult to access. Such information is necessary to develop sound conservation and management strategies. Kelps are main habitat-formers in temperate reefs worldwide; however, these habitats are highly sensitive to environmental change. The kelp Ecklonia radiate is the major habitat-forming organism on subtidal reefs in temperate Australia. Here, we provide large-scale ecological data encompassing the latitudinal distribution along the continent of these kelp forests, which is a necessary first step towards quantitative inferences about the effects of climatic change and other stressors on these valuable habitats. We used the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) facility of Australia's IntegratedMarine Observing System (IMOS) to survey 157,000 m(2) of seabed, of which ca 13,000 m(2) were used to quantify kelp covers at multiple spatial scales (10100 m to 100-1,000 km) and depths (15-60 m) across several regions ca 2-6 degrees latitude apart along the East and West coast of Australia. We investigated the large-scale geographic variation in distribution and abundance of deep-water kelp (>15 m depth) and their relationships with physical variables. Kelp cover generally increased with latitude despite great variability at smaller spatial scales. Maximum depth of kelp occurrence was 40-50 m. Kelp latitudinal distribution along the continent was most strongly related to water temperature and substratum availability. This extensive survey data, coupled with ongoing AUV missions, will allow for the detection of long-term shifts in the distribution and abundance of habitat-forming kelp and the organisms they support on a continental scale, and provide information necessary for successful implementation and management of conservation reserves.

AB 5th Generation(5G)-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) connects billions of devices for high -speed data transfer. The data collected fuel many automation applications such as smart cities, industrial automation 5.0, autonomous vehicles and healthcare sectors. However, the critical challenges concerning such an environment are Open Web Security and Mutual Authentication. The recent security protocols of IoT are based on hard mathematical cryptographic structures. Nevertheless, dependency on the security of classical cryptographic primitives is at risk of being broken by Quantum Computing. Recent Quantum attacks on IoT security have motivated us to survey Quantum-resistant solutions comprehensively. Therefore in this paper, we analysed how the technology shifts from classical cryptographic techniques towards quantum-enabled solutions to achieve end-to-end security. The main objective of this survey is to provide a systematic roadmap in the area of Quantum secured 5G-enabled IoT communication by covering current research on 5G-enabled IoT with its key enabling technologies, threats imposed on 5G-enabled IoT applications, state-of-the-art quantum-based solutions and initiatives. A detailed overview of the quantum computing preliminaries, Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) schemes, Quantum Cryptography (QC), and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with their significant advantage in securing IoT-enabled communication over classical scenarios are also presented. Particularly, we emphasize Post-Quantum resistant techniques that must be used soon to secure 5G-enabled IoT communications. The comparative analysis of quantum-resistant schemes with classical cryptographic schemes in terms of key size, data size, time complexity and impact of quantum computers on these schemes are discussed. This paper identifies the technical challenges in Quantum-based schemes and provides future research directions to enable Post-Quantum resistant cryptography for secure communication in 5G-enabled IoT.

AB This article considers the cooperative search and track of moving targets by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over some regions of interest (RoIs). The RoI contains obstacles that may partly hide the targets. UAVs are not aware of the obstacles' locations and cannot determine when an obstacle limits their field of view. In this article, no map of the RoI is built. This reduces the computational complexity but makes the selection of an appropriate point of view to observe a specific part of the RoI difficult. Showing the absence of a target at a given location of the RoI is then challenging. To address this problem, we introduce a detectability set for each point of the RoI as the set of all UAV locations from where that point is visible. The detectability sets are unknown to the UAVs and evolve with time when the environment is time varying. We assume that each detectability set contains at least one half-cone with a minimal aperture, which translates the fact that targets are never fully occluded by the environment. We prove that a finite number of L simultaneous observations are sufficient to guarantee the presence or absence of targets at a given location. This leads to a partition of the fleet into groups of L UAVs that simultaneously collect measurements on a specific zone of the RoI. Assuming that state perturbations and measurement noises are bounded, a distributed set-membership estimator is used to evaluate set estimates for potential target locations. The trajectories of the UAVs are designed using a model-predictive control approach to reduce the estimation uncertainty. Simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed approach in the presence of unknown static or moving obstacles.

AB Toward human is always one of the critical missions for any cyber physical system (CPS). Autonomous robots perceive embarrassing behavior when treating humans as conventional obstacles. In the context of flexible manufacturing or intelligent production, smart CPSs have an important role, since they contributes to the achievement of higher productivity and greater efficiency. In this paper, for intelligent human-machine interaction, a novel approach to safety, comfortability, and anti-collision using the four strategies of emergency break (EMB), slow-down break (SLB), slow-down break then emergency break (SLEMB), and emergency break then emergency break (EM2B) based on visual computation is presented. First, a dynamic model of whole CPS consisting of a vehicle's body and freight was established. To guarantee comfortable motion and social collaboration, an interactive framework that includes human information was integrated in order to adjust the proper actions of the robot. For the actively and highly computational method, fusing data from both sensing modules and digital cameras provides an efficient technique to estimate a human's pose and launch reasonable behavior for the movement of the robot. Later, for more intelligent and adaptive performance, a switching mechanism considering the human state was introduced. Based on the results of computer-based simulation and experiments, our approach is valuable for socially human-aware navigation in front of humans with respect to actively safe constraints. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (i) dynamical analysis, including the smooth profiles, was studied to suppress residual vibration; (ii) vision-based computation of reaching humans due to the socially interactive model was implemented; and (iii) the switching mechanism provides an alternative method for choosing the proper solution.

AB A deeper understanding of cloud computing is required to accelerate its adoption and leverage its cost, performance, reliability, and security. However, information about the combined effect of factors influencing cloud computing adoption using traditional statistical methods is limited. Based on a literature review of firms' adoption of cloud computing, we identified 12 determinants to explore how antecedent factors influence cloud computing adoption by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We used symmetric and asymmetric techniques to analyze data from 203 Chinese SMEs. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) assessed the net impact of each antecedent, and the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) provided a supplementary analysis by highlighting the configurations of the causal conditions associated with cloud computing adoption. The PLS-SEM results show that security concerns, top management support, IT competence, competitive pressure, trading partner pressure, and provider support influence SMEs' decisions to adopt cloud computing. Interestingly, fsQCA provides a deeper understanding of the complex causality that PLS-SEM does not capture. That is, fsQCA revealed seven configurations resulting in high-level cloud computing adoption and eight causal paths leading to the negation of cloud computing adoption. These findings indicate that several conditions with no significant influence in PLS-SEM were adequate when combined with other conditions in the configurations. The results of the complementary analysis provide theoretical and practical insights.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. on behalf of Journal of Innovation & Knowledge.

AB The road sign recognition (RSR) system is used to complete two tasks: localizing the traffic sign in an image and then classifying it according to the image features. Some of the applications of such system are incorporated into the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. However, the accuracy of the model decreases when changes in lighting or weather occurs, and the lack of training samples taken in rainy condition causes the model to be sub-optimal. The research was conducted with the focus on solving two problems, the accuracy of an object detection model decreases when changes in lighting or weather occurs, and the lack of training data, especially images taken under adverse condition. In this work, we compare and analyze three methods; automatic white balance (AWB), policy augmentations and Image-to-Image-translation (I2IT) technique on their performance to detect traffic signs in raining conditions. All methods were built upon the pre-trained SSD-MobileNetV2 model and using the TensorFlow2 framework. The images from the Malaysia Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD) are used to train all models. Finally based on the result of the three model a final combination model is proposed that achieved the best performance in rainy condition. Experimental results showed that AWB was not that effective in detecting road sign in raining condition, while the other two techniques were highly effective. The final proposed model was implemented by combining policy augmentation and I2IT, obtained an mAP of 0.7967 in clear images and mAP of 0.7160 when rainy images were added to the testing dataset. These corresponds to mAP at 50% IoU of 0.8921mAP@0.5 during clear weather and 0.8340mAP@0.5 in raining images, which outperformed other models. Thus, a road sign detection and classification system that can perform well in rainy condition with limited training dataset has been successfully developed.

AB The high production of sugarcane in Brazil and its application of ethanol and sugar production results in a higher generation of vinasse and bagasse. The treatment of these residues can be carried out using anaerobic co-digestion procedures. Besides promoting waste treatment, it enables energy exploration through biogas and hydrogen generation. Bioenergy use can also generate steam in sugar and alcohol plants by burning, sugarcane milling, fueling vehicles for the transport of products, among others. These energy applications allow total and efficient, energetic exploring of sugarcane. Hence, this study estimated the production of methane, hydrogen, thermal and electrical energy generated from vinasse and bagasse in the autonomous and annexed Brazilian ethanol and sugar plants. Three scenarios present the use of biogas generated: Scenario 1: energy use of all methane from biogas; Scenario 2: hydrogen production from the remaining methane, after considering the energy autonomy of the ethanol plants; Scenario 3: hydrogen production from all the methane generated. All the scenarios which considered the use of methane led to energy self-sufficiency in the sector. However, only annexed plants present economic feasibility for implementing the project. Scenario 2 is highlighted in this study, once beyond the sectors energetic self-sufficiency, the operational conditions enabled the storage of 9.26E+07 Nm(3).d(-1) of hydrogen, equal 3.04E+08 ton per year. CH4 and H-2 production seen in a global scenario of circular economy and energy security have high benefits, contributing to the gradual transformation of an economy dependent on nonrenewable resources into a circular and renewable economy.

AB The purpose of this article is threefold. We first show that the second-order post-Newtonian (p-N) equations for the Earth exterior Schwarzschild field introduced in this article are the equations that, unlike those of the first p-N order, allow the space-based pointing, acquisition, and tracking laser systems to substantially reduce the size of the p-N corrections to the Newtonian location from the systems of middle size targets in orbit about the Earth. To achieve this goal the trackers must be endowed with very narrow laser beams and atomic clocks. Second, we show that these corrections can be used to speed up the trackers' shooting systems in any scenario where this kind of beam may be involved. In fact, since the first step in any procedure aimed to achieve this goal is to accurately determine the ranging and shooting directions to the targets from the lines of sight, the computation of the second p-N relative orbits of the targets with respect to the trackers must be carried out in real time. Then, the solution of these equations for the target of interest can be uploaded in the closed-loop control system on board the tracker involved, in order to initiate the control process of the respective ranging and shooting direction, as well as to reinitiate it, as soon as the target ceases to be hidden for the tracker due to the Earth. Third, we to show that these equations will be very useful for autonomous trackers to carry out two demanding tasks, namely 1) to steadily maintain intersatellite optical links and 2) to perform laser ablation of middle size LEO debris objects at operative distances.

AB Nonlethal human recreational activities have been confirmed to have negative effect on wild animals in a number of ways, including changes in behaviors, avoidance of suitable habitats and declines in breeding success. Studies on the anti-disturbance mechanism of wild animals to human disturbance can provide valuable knowledge to the management of wild animals and the evolutionary mechanisms of behavioral adaptation to their habitats. To evaluate how blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) would react to nonlethal human recreational disturbance, we studied their anti-disturbance strategy towards human disturbance in Suyukou National Forest Park (SNFP), Helan Mountains, Yinchuan of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Using multinomial logistic regression models (MLRMs), we sought to answer two questions: (1) which kind of human recreational behavior would evoke the most serious anti-disturbance behaviors in blue sheep; and (2) how would various ecological factors influence the anti-disturbance strategy of blue sheep to human recreational disturbance? We collected 10 habitat and population variables and evaluated three kinds of reaction of blue sheep-no response, vigilance and flight. A total of 921 observations qualified to enter MLRMs. We found that habitat type (HT), gender (GEN), head direction (HD), visibility index (VI), and disturbance source (DS) were the five variables that significantly influenced the intensity of reactions of blue sheep. Blue sheep were more alert to tourists than to vehicles, and roads were the habitat type that caused the most intensive reaction of alertness where human disturbance was the highest. Females were more vigilant than males. Blue sheep might feel safer when staying in open habitat, and taking a front head direction provided them with the highest vigilance. Based on these results, we present suggestions to SNFP for the management of ecotourism and blue sheep conservation.

AB The legacy grid is developing into an intelligently rooted grid system that can enhance and adapt its performance to learning experiences in its architectural components. Due to the evolution of artificial intelligence and in-depth learning techniques, decision-making and execution can become autonomous activities in intelligent power grids throughout the years. 3D visualization plays a vital role in simplifying monitoring, analysis, and reaction to events in the smart grid. The visualization of the 3D models for various energy system applications is first summarized, including the smart grid, power vehicles, and energy consumption of buildings. Accordingly, design principles are provided for wide-screen, personal computer, or mobile interfaces. Visualization technology for geographical information systems is described. 3D technology, animations, and AR&VR to visualize the energy system is discussed. In this article, a coherent 3D visualization approach for the control and monitoring of intelligent power grids (P.G.) via the deep learning (DL) method is examined in industry literature (3D-PGDL). Data visualization is gaining significance with improved measurement systems and Big Data Analytics in intelligent grids and low carbon energy systems. No data design study, accompanying technology, or visualization tools have been conducted. The analysis and practice of data viewing on energy and power systems are thoroughly addressed here. Because of the intrinsic properties of intelligent grids, all collected and processed data are heterogeneous to provide a more comprehensive, multifaceted control viewpoint for the energy sector by creating new ICT instruments and platforms. This section's experiment resulted in a 95.3 % prediction rate and improved data management ratio of 95.7 %, a lower energy consumption ratio of 18.2%, a lower probability of 18.4 %, a lower CO2 emission level of 15.6 % and a humidity rate of 93.1 %.

AB Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drone technologies, with their high spatial resolution, temporal flexibility, and ability to repeat photogrammetry, afford a significant advancement in other remote sensing approaches for coastal mapping, habitat monitoring, and environmental management. However, geographical drone mapping and in situ fieldwork often come with a steep learning curve requiring a background in drone operations, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing and related analytical techniques. Such a learning curve can be an obstacle for field implementation for researchers, community organizations and citizen scientists wishing to include introductory drone operations into their work. In this study, we develop a comprehensive drone training program for research partners and community members to use cost-effective, consumer-quality drones to engage in introductory drone mapping of coastal seagrass monitoring sites along the west coast of North America. As a first step toward a longer-term Public Participation GIS process in the study area, the training program includes lessons for beginner drone users related to flying drones, autonomous route planning and mapping, field safety, GIS analysis, image correction and processing, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification and regulations. Training our research partners and students, who are in most cases novice users, is the first step in a larger process to increase participation in a broader project for seagrass monitoring in our case study. While our training program originated in the United States, we discuss our experiences for research partners and communities around the globe to become more confident in introductory drone operations for basic science. In particular, our work targets novice users without a strong background in geographic research or remote sensing. Such training provides technical guidance on the implementation of a drone mapping program for coastal research, and synthesizes our approaches to provide broad guidance for using drones in support of a developing Public Participation GIS process.

AB The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) was designed almost three decades ago and has many limitations relating to its fully distributed nature, policy enforcement capabilities, scalability, security and complexity. For example, the control plane can take several minutes to converge after a routing change; this may be unacceptable for real-time network services. Despite many research proposals for incremental improvements and clean-slate redesigns of how inter-domain routing should work, BGP is likely one of the most ossified protocols of the Internet architecture and it has not retrofitted the proposed ideas. In this work, we propose a radical, incrementally deployable Internet routing paradigm in which the control plane of multiple networks is logically centralized. This follows the Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm, although at the inter-domain level involving multiple Autonomous Systems (AS). Multi-domain SDN centralization can be realized by outsourcing routing functions to an external contractor, which provides inter-domain routing services facilitated through a multi-AS network controller. The proposed model promises to become a vehicle for evolving BGP and uses the bird's eye view over several networks to benefit aspects of inter-domain routing, such as convergence properties, policy conflict resolution, inter-domain troubleshooting, and collaborative security. In addition to the proposed paradigm, we introduce a publicly available emulation platform built on top of Mininet and the Quagga routing software, for experimenting on hybrid BGP-SDN AS-level networks. As a proof of concept, we focus specifically on exploiting multi-domain centralization to improve BGP's slow convergence. We build and make publicly available a first multi-AS controller tailored to this use case and demonstrate experimentally that SDN centralization helps to linearly reduce BGP convergence times and churn rates with expanding SDN deployments.

TI Markov Chain Approach to Probabilistic Guidance for Swarms of Autonomous
   Agents
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE Swarm control; probabilistic methods; Markov chains
ID COORDINATION; AVOIDANCE
AB Motivated by biological swarms occurring in nature, there is recent interest in developing swarms comprised completely of engineered agents. The main challenge for developing swarm guidance laws compared to earlier formation flying and multi-vehicle coordination approaches is the sheer number of agents involved. While formation flying applications might involve up to 10 to 20 agents, swarms are desired to contain hundreds to many thousands of agents. In order to deal with the sheer size, the present paper makes a break with past deterministic methods, and considers the swarm as a statistical ensemble for which guidance can be performed from a probabilistic point of view. The probability-based approach takes advantage of the law of large numbers, and leads to computationally tractable and implementable swarm guidance laws. Agents following a probabilistic guidance algorithm make statistically independent probabilistic decisions based solely on their own state, which ultimately guides the swarm to the desired density distribution in the configuration space. Two different synthesis methods are introduced for designing probabilistic guidance laws. The first is based on the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm, and the second is based on using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The M-H approach ensures convergent swarm behavior subject to enforced desired motion constraints, while the LMI approach additionally ensures exponential convergence with a prescribed decay rate, and allows minimization of a cost function that reflects fuel expenditure. In addition, both algorithms endow the swarm with the property of self-repair, and the capability to strictly enforce zero-probability keep-out regions. This last property requires a slight generalization of the Perron-Frobenius theory, and can be very useful in swarm applications that contain regions where no agents are allowed to go. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the methods and demonstrate desired properties of the guided swarm.

AB By combining information communication technology with power grid, the smart grid-oriented Power Internet of Things (PIoT) has become a critical technology to guarantee the safe and reliable power grid operation and improve system energy efficiency. Nevertheless, PIoT devices have only limited communication and computing resources since they are mostly deployed in remote areas that may be out of service coverage of existing terrestrial 5G networks. To overcome the resource limitation, we leverage Air-Ground Integrated C-NOMA Heterogeneous PIoT Networks (PAGIC HetNets), and study the core challenges in PAGIC HetNets. As PIoT devices are normally powered by battery, we aim at minimizing the energy consumption of PIoT devices and thoroughly investigate the problem of task offloading and resource allocation with minimal energy consumption. This problem belongs to a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) with extra difficulty that the long-term queuing delay and short-term constraints are coupled. To tackle the difficulty, we use Lyapunov optimization to transform this hard problem into three subproblems. The first subproblem is task splitting and local computing resource assignment at the PAGIC user side, which we solve with the Lagrangian multiplier method. The second subproblem is queue-aware channel reusing, and matching theory is adopted to solve it. The third subproblem is optimizing the aerial server resource allocation, for which we propose a greedy-based solution. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach can obtain excellent performance in terms of energy consumption, spectrum efficiency, task backlog, and queuing delay with lower complexity compared with several benchmark methods.

AB Nowadays, pervasive vision through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensors is a crucial part of air-borne and space-borne platforms to reach the concept of internet of multimedia things over satellites and visual flying ad-hoc networks. SAR sensors always need high-performance data reconstruction techniques to provide quality of experience for end-users of the distributed surveillance nodes and ensuring reliable decision-making in the autonomous vehicles. Using prior information in SAR image reconstruction, improves the quality of reconstructed image. Many sparse regularization methods use pre information terms in which the image is sparsely presented based on a predefined dictionary. However, if the desired features of the real image have not a sparse representation based on the predefined dictionary, image reconstruction with enhanced interested features will be failed. Dictionary learning to better adapt with the underlying scene can lead to better image reconstruction. On the other hand, using the idea of dictionary learning in the image reconstruction problem, and considering that the data used to train the dictionary may be incomplete and noisy, will create limitations for this method. In this paper, a new idea based on the use of an overcomplete dictionary consisting of a learned dictionary and a predefined dictionary (pre-learned dictionary) for SAR image reconstruction problem is presented. Developing the necessary mathematical relations and providing the framework for SAR image reconstruction based on the use of the overcomplete pre-learned dictionary, to simultaneously enhance the features considered in advance and the features associated with the image, from incomplete and noisy SAR raw data is presented in this article. We also present an iterative algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Simulation results based on the real data of TerraSAR-X and the Lynx airborne system show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Underwater connectivity has been a leading field of study in undersea navigation, deep-sea investigation and autonomous underwater vehicle control (AUVs). Because of the low attenuation (signal reduction) of sound in water, acoustic communication is the most versatile and broadly used tool in underwater network. Factors such as long propagation delay, restricted usable bandwidth, large Doppler range, time-varying channel conditions, pressure and various salinity conditions make the application of the underwater acoustic communication (UWAC) system difficult. Underwater naval monitoring and underwater exploration are the basic uses of Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN). The outline of sensor networks has been resurrected into a new age of global physical object tracking with the latest advancement of innovation. This advances in design paved the way for new unopened insider information to be revealed in the area of underwater ecosystems, deep water conditions and discovery of ice sheets. This work provides a proficient packet transmitting technique in a selective frequency to increase the coverage, synchronisation and connectivity between sensor AUVs that are under secluded ocean contour observation. The theoretical model is used to represent the complex dynamics in the sea. Taking into account all the channel properties below the sea, the channel model was created. The AUVs are connected to a cluster-based network and the 3-D location of the AUVs is transmitted using an appropriate depth-based cluster-based routing protocol (DB-CBRP). Through choosing the optimal frequency for the transmission of routing packets, the network's total life is extended with the least delay in routing. As a result of its strength against overly reduced transmission capability and recurrence reuse, the CBRP approach is used to restrict channel impairments. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm reveal that the surveillance AUVs have greater communication, coverage and share their position with each other.

AB Introduction: Immunization supply chains (iSC) are essential for ensuring access to vaccines that prevent diseases. Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger initiated iSC system design efforts to conduct analysis of alternative supply chain scenarios to identify areas for improvement.
   Methodology: Key stakeholders from Ministries of Health and immunization programs identified bottlenecks in the current iSC and prioritized five general design scenarios to model in each country. Scenarios included aspects of integration, changing supply chain levels and delivery frequency, ignoring administrative boundaries, and direct delivery. Primary and secondary data were collected and cleaned. Analysis was completed using Supply Chain Guru (Madagascar and Niger) and AnyLogistix (Guinea) modeling software to build a virtual representation of the iSC physical components and operating policies.
   Results: Modeling results were compared using both quantitative and qualitative criteria (total operating costs, cost per dose, cold chain capacity, risk of mishandling, logistics burden on healthcare workers, feasibility to implement, and equity). Using a Stop Light Analysis for user-friendly understanding of positive, negative or minimal impact on scenarios, cost savings were realized in most scenarios in Madagascar (except using autonomous aerial vehicles); proposed scenarios in Guinea increased costs or had minimal impact; in Niger, eliminating regional tiers reduced costs. Facility level cold chain was sufficient in all countries. Effect on qualitative indicators largely depended on the scenario and country context.
   Discussion: Similarities in scenarios selected were seen across the three countries. Results suggest that efficiencies can be found through changes to the iSC design, but the benefits of each scenario must be considered in the country context. Results of the analysis do not provide "the right answer" but rather options and guidance which then must be grounded in the country context and used as evidence for decision making to ensure reliable availability of vaccines.

AB Purpose - The authors aim to investigate the observability properties of the process of simultaneous localization and mapping of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), a challenging and important problem in marine robotics, and illustrate the derived results through computer simulations and experimental results with a real AUV.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors address the single/multiple beacon observability analysis of the process of simultaneous localization and mapping of an AUV by deriving the nonlinear mathematical model that describes the process; then applying a suitable coordinate transformation, and subsequently a time-scaling transformation to obtain a linear time varying (LTV) system. The AUV considered is equipped with a set of inertial sensors, a depth sensor, and an acoustic ranging device that provides relative range measurements to a set of stationary beacons. The location of the beacons does not need to be necessarily known and in that case, the authors are also interested to localize them. Numerical tests and experimental results illustrate the derived theoretical results.
   Findings - The authors show that if either the position of one of the beacons or the initial position of the AUV is known, then the system is at least locally weakly observable, in the sense that the set of indistinguishable states from a given initial configuration contains a finite set of isolated points. The simulations and experiments results illustrate the findings.
   Originality/value - In the single and multiple beacon case and for manoeuvres with constant linear and angular velocities both expressed in the body-frame, known as trimming or steady-state trajectories, the authors derive conditions under which it is possible to infer the state of the resulting system (and in particular the position of the AUV). The authors also describe the implementation of an advanced continuous time constrained minimum energy observer combined with multiple model techniques. Numerical tests and experimental results illustrate the derived theoretical results.

AB The use of traditional medicinal plants plays an important role especially in remote rural and marginalized landscapes at different latitudes. In the development of nature conservation strategies based on local knowledge and sustainable resource management, medicinal herbs have been hypothesized to be cultural key stone species. Environmental education is a crucial driver for fostering environmental literacy and preserving local knowledge across generations. We conducted semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the Autonomous Province of Bozen-South Tyrol (N Italy) to gain insights into, and reflections on, the cultural value of traditional medicinal plants and their interplay within the local landscape, nature conservation and their role in environmental education and knowledge transfer across generations. We also used a combination of purposive and snowball sampling to identify relevant actors. The different voices collected in the study clearly highlight the role of medicinal herbs in healthcare, for cultural identity of local communities and demonstrate a growing commercial market niche that maintains the local economy and services, including widespread offers related to environmental education, that have not, unfortunately, been used yet in the formal curricula of local schools. The latter is crucial for a holistic approach taking medicinal plants as an ideal vehicle to connect especially children with nature and history of South Tyrol, strengthening health education and overall environmental literacy, including species knowledge. However, the revival of herbal medicine and related knowledge do not prevent the continuous loss of local traditional knowledge regarding medicinal plants, recipes and use. More species and their uses are being forgotten due to superficialisation of knowledge and of mainstreaming and homogenization of the global market of herbal medicine. Safeguarding the natural and cultural treasures of South Tyrol for future generations is in the hands of the local communities.

AB Objective: The objective of the current study was to compare the GHBMC female model responses with in-house sled test data for three small female post mortem human surrogates (PMHS) at 32 km/h and a seatback recline angle of 45 degrees. The kinematics and the seatbelt forces were used to compare the female PMHS and model responses. The study aimed to identify updates that may be needed to the model. Methods: In-house experimental sled test kinematic and seatbelt response data for the small females were obtained. The 5(th) female GHBMC was simulated with the same boundary conditions as in the experiments. In addition, using the PMHS computed tomography (CT) and test environment scans, the female model geometry was updated to a subject-specific model for one of the specimens, and the models were simulated to obtain 5(th) female and subject-specific model responses. The kinematic response and the seatbelt forces for the two models were compared with the average of the three experimental data. Results: The head, T8 and L4 excursions, head and pelvis accelerations and seatbelt forces for the two female models were compared with the experimental data. The model responses were in agreement with the PMHS; however, the subject-specific model showed a closer agreement with the kinematic response. The subject-specific model did not submarine as in the experiments, whereas the 5(th) female model submarined. However, the subject-specific model showed 20% higher seatbelt forces than the PMHS. Conclusion: This study showed that anthropometric differences may significantly alter occupant kinematics in reclined posture and need to be incorporated to investigate kinematics and injury mechanisms. The next step of the study involves incorporating age-specific material changes and investigating the subject-specific injury mechanisms. The results will be useful to develop countermeasures for autonomous vehicles.

TI Design and Implementation of UAVs for Bird's Nest Inspection on

LA English

DE transmission line; bird's nest detection; deep learning; UAV application
AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been increasingly used in power line inspections. Birds often nest on transmission line towers, which threatens safe power line operation. The existing research on bird's nest inspection using UAVs mainly stays at the level of image postprocessing detection, which has poor real-time performance and cannot obtain timely bird's nest detection results. Considering the above shortcomings, we designed a power inspection UAV system based on deep learning technology for autonomous flight, positioning and photography, real-time bird nest detection, and result export. In this research, 2000 bird's nest images in the actual power inspection environment were shot and collected to create the dataset. The parameter optimization and test comparison for bird's nest detection are based on the three target detection models of YOLOv3, YOLOv5-s, and YOLOX-s. A YOLOv5-s bird's nest detection model optimized for bird's nest real-time detection is proposed, and it is deployed to the onboard computer for real-time detection and verification during flight. The DJI M300 RTK UAV was used to conduct a test flight in a natural power inspection environment. The test results show that the mAP of the UAV system designed in this paper for bird's nest detection is 92.1%, and the real-time detection frame rate is 33.9 FPS. Compared with the previous research results, this paper proposes a new practice of using drones for bird's nest detection, dramatically improving the real-time accuracy of bird's nest detection. The UAV system can efficiently complete the task of bird's nest detection in the process of electric power inspection, which can significantly reduce manpower consumption in the power inspection process.

AB Loop closure detection (LCD) is of significant importance in simultaneous localization and mapping. It represents the robot's ability to recognize whether the current surrounding corresponds to a previously observed one. In this paper, we conduct this task in a two-step strategy: candidate frame selection and loop closure verification. The first step aims to search semantically similar images for the query one using features obtained by Key.Net with HardNet. Instead of adopting the traditional Bag-of-Words strategy, we utilize the aggregated selective match kernel to calculate the similarity between images. Subsequently, based on the potential property of motion field in the LCD scene, we propose a novel feature matching method, i.e., exploiting the smoothness prior and learning the motion field for an image pair in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), to implement loop closure verification. Concretely, we formulate the learning problem into a Bayesian framework with latent variables indicating the true/false correspondences and a mixture model accounting for the distribution of data. Furthermore, we propose a locality-driven mechanism to enhance the local relevance of motion vectors and term the algorithm as locality-driven accurate motion field learning (LAL). To satisfy the requirement of efficiency in the LCD task, we use a sparse approximation and search a suboptimal solution for the motion field in the RKHS, termed as LAL*. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets for feature matching and LCD tasks. The quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over the current state-of-the-art, meanwhile showing its potential for long-term visual localization. The codes of LAL and LAL* are publicly available at https://github.com/KN-Zhang/LAL.

AB Small-scale investigations of physical and biogeochemical parameters have been carried out with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) at a moving ice edge in the Fram Strait. The AUV was equipped with various sensors to study the complex interactions between physical and ecological processes along the ice edge and the associated meltwater front. The AUV covered two cross-front sections of 9 km and recorded high resolution vertical profiles of the physical and biogeochemical properties between 0 and 50 m water depth at a horizontal station spacing of 800-1000 m.
   In both physical and biogeochemical terms, the measurements revealed a complex structure of the water column. The distribution of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) and nutrients was highly in homogeneous. Chlorophyll a concentrations of 5 mu g l(-1) were detected at the frontal interface in a small corridor just 2-4 km wide and only 5 m deep. Nutrients at the surface were depleted, yet, compared to previous studies of this region, were still present in the euphotic zone. Below the euphotic zone, nitrate concentrations of 8 mu mol l(-1) and oxygen saturation values of 100% resulted in a "dome-like" pattern suggestive of vertical transport processes. Based on these measurements, three different zones featuring individual biogeochemical characteristics were identified in the cross-front sections. Atmospheric forcing and the presence of the melt water front are assumed to be mainly responsible for the complexity of the water column. Localized vertical transport events seem to have occurred before our investigations. Furthermore, wind driven frontogenesis likely contributed to vertical water movements. All processes had an effect on the biological processes along the observed meltwater front. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Smart agriculture - i.e., the increasing use of information technologies, sensors, autonomous vehicles, data an-alytics, predictive modelling, and other digital technologies related to agricultural activities - has been strongly argued for as a means to significantly contribute to increased food security, reduced water consumption, reduced fertilizer and pesticide input, and increased farm profitability. Despite this, the adoption rate of smart agricul-tural technologies is still low and varies significantly according to the specific technology and the geographical area considered. The goals of this paper are to: (1) propose a conceptual framework for smart agriculture and digital twins, which takes into account the needs and characteristics of the farms; (2) present the application of the proposed conceptual framework as a case study; and (3) shed light on the challenges of and the future perspectives on smart agriculture. We first propose a framework for the design of farm information systems consisting of four key phases (i.e., data collection, data processing, data analysis and evaluation, and information use) based on the infological approach. We then apply the framework to present and discuss a field application of smart agriculture and digital twins on crop nitrogen (N) fertilization. The case study, along with the cited literature, highlights the need to specify the optimal N fertilizer input as well as defining the spatial variability of the land area, the soil characteristics and crop yield, and the integration of these with temporal variability. Finally, we discuss challenges and future perspectives, with particular focus on geographical areas characterized by small average farm size. We argue that, thanks to digital twins, the wide set of data collected can enable predictive (and stability) analyses that if implemented can benefit the farmer and the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of the agricultural system.

AB This study describes the development of a long-range hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for ocean turbulence measurement. It is a unique instrument, combining the characteristics of the conventional AUV and the buoyancy-driven glider, with a variety of flexible motion modes, such as cruise mode, glider mode, drift mode, and combination of multiple motion modes. The hybrid AUV was used for continuous turbulence measurement in the continental slope of the northern South China Sea in 2020. A total of ten continuous profiles were completed covering a horizontal span of 25 Km and a depth of 200 m. The hybrid AUV was operated in the combined glider and cruise mode. The hybrid AUV's flight performance was stable and satisfied the requirement for turbulence observation. The measured velocity shears from both probes were in good agreement, and the noise-reduced shear spectra were in excellent agreement with the Nasmyth spectrum. The water column in the study area was highly stratified, with a thick thermocline. The dissipation rate (epsilon) varied from 1.41 x 10(-10) to 4.18 x 10(-7) W center dot kg(-1). In the surface mixed layer, high values of epsilon (10(-9)similar to 10(-8) W center dot kg(-1)) were observed toward the water surface. In the thermocline, epsilon was 10(-9.5)similar to 10(-9) W center dot kg(-1), which was smaller than the level of the surface mixed layer. This result was mainly because of the strong "barrier"-like thermocline, which damped the transmission of wind and heat energy from the surface mixed layer to the deep layer. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of hybrid AUVs for collecting oceanic turbulence measurements. They are a powerful addition to traditional turbulence instruments, as they make it possible to survey large areas to obtain high-quality and high-resolution data in both vertical and horizontal directions over long durations.

AB A fluid-structure interaction study on free-stream flow across a NACA0012 hydrofoil, with a traveling wave-based surface undulation, is numerically studied at a constant wave number K = 10 of the traveling wave and phase difference of 180o between the top and bottom surface undulations. Effect of phase speed c* (1-10) of the wave, local amplitude-thickness ratio A(L) (0.05-0.25), and Reynolds number Re on the near-wake flow characteristics and propulsive performance are investigated. For the various values of the nondimensional governing parameters, the present results revealed two types of vortex patterns: an almost steady vortex sheet and periodic vortex street. Further, forward and reverse types of both vortex sheets and vortex streets are found behind the hydrofoil. A novel two-pair of reverse vortex streets and reverse vortex sheets are found at larger values of c*, A(L), and Re. Surface undulations cause a high-pressure and high-velocity zone near the troughs of the wave. Consequently, a pressure-suction mechanism in the leeward and forward side of each wavy section produces a spatially varying thrust. The spatial variation of the thrust is attributed to the variation of wave amplitude along the foil. A threshold value of c*, Re, and A(L) exists to produce thrust. A scaling analysis is presented with a power-law scaling for the mean thrust coefficient (C-T) as a function of K, c*, A(L), with 3, 2, and 3 as the respective exponents. The proposed scaling is found to be consistent with the computations. The present biomimetic fish-inspired study can lead to design and development of a need-based autonomous underwater vehicle or energy harvesting device.

AB The network model, especially the network model constructed by network operation, is an important tool to study complex networks. Many topological and dynamic properties of complex networks can be studied in this way. In this article, the m-fission operation is constructed based on the phenomenon of node splitting in the network, which is quite common in complex networks. Many network models, including dual Sierpinski gaskets, are built based on this operation, but it has never been systematically studied. Then, the topological and dynamic properties of the m-fission operation and the corresponding iterative fission network model are studied, and the influence of the operation on the network structure is revealed. Among them, the topological properties of the network include diameter, degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average distance, and modularity. By studying these properties, it can be concluded that the iterative fission network is a fractal homogeneous network with high clustering and high community characteristics. Since the dynamic properties are closely related to the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix corresponding to the network, the iterative relation of the spectrum in operation is studied, and the complete solution of the spectrum of the iterative fission network is obtained. Based on the above results, we calculate the analytical expressions of the characteristic quantities related to the dynamic properties on the network, including the Kirchhoff index and the average of hitting times. Finally, due to the close connection between the network model and the system, we further analyzed the consensus problems on the system corresponding to the network, including convergence rate, delay robustness, first-order noise coherence, and second-order noise coherence.

AB The impact of load growth on electricity peak demand is becoming a vital concern for utilities. To prevent the need to build new power plants or upgrade transmission lines, power companies are trying to design new demand response programs. These programs can reduce the peak demand and be beneficial for both energy consumers and suppliers. One of the most popular demand response programs is the building load scheduling for energy-saving and peak-shaving. This paper presents an autonomous incentive-based multi-objective nonlinear optimization approach for load scheduling problems (LSP) in smart building communities. This model's objectives are three-fold: minimizing total electricity costs, maximizing assigned incentives for each customer, and minimizing inconvenience level. In this model, two groups of assets are considered: time-shiftable assets, including electronic appliances and plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging facilities, and thermal assets such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and electric water heaters. For each group, specific energy consumption and inconvenience level models were developed. The designed model assigned the incentives to the participants based on their willingness to reschedule their assets. The LSP is a discrete-continuous problem and is formulated based on a mixed-integer nonlinear programming approach. Zoutendijk's method is used to solve the nonlinear optimization model. This formulation helps capture the building collaboration to achieve the objectives. Illustrative case studies are demonstrated to assess the proposed model's effect on building communities consisting of residential and commercial buildings. The results show the efficiency of the proposed model in reducing the total energy cost as well as increasing the participants' satisfaction. The findings also reveal that we can shave the peak demand by 53% and have a smooth aggregate load profile in a large-scale building community containing 500 residential and commercial buildings.

AB In this study, we report the successful demonstration of an intermediate-frequency-over-fiber (IFoF)-based radio access network (RAN) for 28 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave)-based 5G mobile communication. In order to increase the network coverage of the mmWave-based 5G networks, we propose a distributed antenna system (DAS) that uses the IFoF technology. An IFoF-based DAS with 2 x 2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration was deployed in the PyeongChang area to provide 5G trial demonstration during the Winter Olympics. 5G trial services such as high-speed data transfer and autonomous vehicle driving were offered to the public through the IFoF-based DAS. A downlink throughput of similar to 1 Gb/s and uplink throughput of similar to 200 Mb/s were achieved in the DAS-deployed area. We also present an IFoF-based 5G mobile fronthaul that can overcome the bandwidth bottleneck in RANs. We performed real-time transmission of mmWave-based 5G wireless access networks using the IFoF-based mobile fronthaul. The real-time downlink throughput achieved per 5G terminal was approximately 9 Gb/s, when using a 4x 4 MIMO configuration. An outdoor demonstration was performed to verify the technical feasibility of the 5G fronthaul based on IFoF technology. When moving the 5G terminal between remote radio heads at a speed less than 60 km/h, 5G mobile broadband services could be provided with real-time throughput more than 5 Gb/s. Thus, we confirmed that the IFoF technology was capable of supporting RANs for mmWave-based 5G networks and providing real-time multi-Gb mobile services.

AB In most areas, estimating the presence and distribution of cryptic marine mammal species, such as beaked whales, is extremely difficult using traditional observational techniques such as ship-based visual line transect surveys. Because acoustic methods permit detection of animals underwater, at night, and in poor weather conditions, passive acoustic observation has been used increasingly often over the last decade to study marine mammal distribution, abundance, and movements, as well as for mitigation of potentially harmful anthropogenic effects. However, there is demand for new, cost-effective tools that allow scientists to monitor areas of interest autonomously with high temporal and spatial resolution in near-real time. Here we describe an autonomous underwater vehicle - a glider - equipped with an acoustic sensor and onboard data processing capabilities to passively scan an area for marine mammals in near-real time. The glider was tested extensively off the west coast of the Island of Hawai'i, USA. The instrument covered approximately 390 km during three weeks at sea and collected a total of 194 h of acoustic data. Detections of beaked whales were successfully reported to shore in near-real time. Manual analysis of the recorded data revealed a high number of vocalizations of delphinids and sperm whales. Furthermore, the glider collected vocalizations of unknown origin very similar to those made by known species of beaked whales. The instrument developed here can be used to cost-effectively screen areas of interest for marine mammals for several months at a time. The near-real-time detection and reporting capabilities of the glider can help to protect marine mammals during potentially harmful anthropogenic activities such as seismic exploration for sub-sea fossil fuels or naval sonar exercises. Furthermore, the glider is capable of under-ice operation, allowing investigation of otherwise inaccessible polar environments that are critical habitats for many endangered marine mammal species.

AB In this paper, we describe a new application domain for intelligent autonomous systems-intelligent buildings (IB). In doing so we present a novel approach to the implementation of IB agents based on a hierarchical fuzzy genetic multi-embedded-agent architecture comprising a low-level behaviour based reactive layer whose outputs are co-ordinated in a fuzzy way according to deliberative plans. The fuzzy rules related to the room resident comfort are learnt and adapted online using our patented fuzzy-genetic techniques (British patent 99-10539.7). The learnt rule base is updated and adapted via an iterative machine-user dialogue. This learning starts from the best stored rule set in the agent memory (Experience Bank) thereby decreasing the learning time and creating an intelligent agent with memory. We discuss the role of learning in building control systems, and we explain the importance of acquiring information from sensors, rather than relying on pre-programmed models, to determine user needs. We describe how our architecture, consisting of distributed embedded agents, utilises sensory information to learn to perform tasks related to user comfort, energy conservation, and safety. We show how these agents, employing a behaviour-based approach derived from robotics research, are able to continuously learn and adapt to individuals within a building, whilst always providing a fast, safe response to any situation. In addition we show that our system learns similar rules to other offline supervised methods but that our system has the additional capability to rapidly learn and optimise the learnt rule base. Applications of this system include personal support (e.g. increasing independence and quality of life for older people), energy efficiency in commercial buildings or living-area control systems for space vehicles and planetary habitation modules.

AB White-light detection from the visible to the near-infrared region is central to many applications such as high-speed cameras, autonomous vehicles, and wearable electronics. While organic photodetectors (OPDs) are being developed for such applications, several challenges must be overcome to produce scalable high-detectivity OPDs. This includes issues associated with low responsivity, narrow absorption range, and environmentally friendly device fabrication. Here, an OPD system processed from 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) sets a record in light detectivity, which is also comparable with commercially available silicon-based photodiodes is reported. The newly designed OPD is employed in wearable devices to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen saturation using a flexible OPD-based finger pulse oximeter. In achieving this, a framework for a detailed understanding of the structure-processing-property relationship in these OPDs is also developed. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin films processed from 2-MeTHF are characterized at different length scales with advanced techniques. The BHJ morphology exhibits optimal intermixing and phase separation of donor and acceptor moieties, which facilitates the charge generation and collection process. Benefitting from high charge carrier mobilities and a low shunt leakage current, the newly developed OPD exhibits a specific detectivity of above 1012 Jones over 400-900 nm, which is higher than those of reference devices processed from chlorobenzene and ortho-xylene.
   Organic photodetectors processed from a biomass-derived solvent, namely 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, which simultaneously exhibits a remarkably high detectivity and surpasses the performances of devices processed from conventional chlorinated solvents, are developed. Furthermore, such devices can also be used as smart wearable devices for medical applications, such as heart pulse rate monitoring and blood oxygen saturation assessment.image

AB Due to the volatile nature of renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage systems (ESS) are the primary impetus for increased dependence on RES in current power networks. Because of their quick responsiveness and rapid transition from charge to discharge in less than 1 ms, batteries are necessary even in the presence of alternative storage devices. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have demonstrated their viability as ESS for RES. Given the significance of LIBs, it was vital to correctly and effectively quantify their costs in energy systems. Most studies did not offer a true real-world assessment of these batteries' aging but instead averaged their performance indices, which vary substantially depending on the system's working circumstances such as temperature, voltage, state of charge, and current level. Failure to use precise values for each charging/discharging operation might result in disastrous judgments and future techno-economic issues. This paper provides a novel and highly accurate piecewise modeling of LIBs for each charging and discharging operation based on real-world operational conditions. This novel aging model is used for calculating hourly aging and its impact on energy costs. The musical chair algorithm (MCA) is used to determine the optimal parameters' values of the LIB's model and the appropriate size of autonomous hybrid RES. When compared to other optimization techniques, the findings of optimal parameter determination using MCA revealed an 80% reduction in convergence time and better accuracy. The novel proposed aging model of the batteries predicts a 60% cost share of the battery, meanwhile, the existing strategy predicts 51% only. The levelized cost of energy is $0.1291/kWh and $0.0731/kWh for the new proposed aging model and existing strategy, respectively.

AB The potential of precision viticulture has been highlighted since the first studies performed in the context of viticulture, but especially in the last decade there have been excellent results have been achieved in terms of innovation and simple application. The deployment of new sensors for vineyard monitoring is set to increase in the coming years, enabling large amounts of information to be obtained. However, the large number of sensors developed and the great amount of data that can be collected are not always easy to manage, as it requires cross-sectoral expertise. The preliminary section of the review presents the scenario of precision viticulture, highlighting its potential and possible applications. This review illustrates the types of sensors and their operating principles. Remote platforms such as satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and proximal platforms are also presented. Some supervised and unsupervised algorithms used for object-based image segmentation and classification (OBIA) are then discussed, as well as a description of some vegetation indices (VI) used in viticulture. Photogrammetric algorithms for 3D canopy modelling using dense point clouds are illustrated. Finally, some machine learning and deep learning algorithms are illustrated for processing and interpreting big data to understand the vineyard agronomic and physiological status. This review shows that to perform accurate vineyard surveys and evaluations, it is important to select the appropriate sensor or platform, so the algorithms used in post-processing depend on the type of data collected. Several aspects discussed are fundamental to the understanding and implementation of vineyard variability monitoring techniques. However, it is evident that in the future, artificial intelligence and new equipment will become increasingly relevant for the detection and management of spatial variability through an autonomous approach.

AB Detection of multiple lane markings on road surfaces is an important aspect of autonomous vehicles. Although a number of approaches have been proposed to detect lanes, detecting multiple lane markings, particularly across a large number of frames and under varying lighting conditions, in a consistent manner is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting multiple lanes across a large number of frames and under various lighting conditions. Instead of resorting to the conventional approach of processing each frame to detect lanes, we treat the overall problem as a multitarget tracking problem across space and time using the integrated probabilistic data association filter (IPDAF) as our basis filter. We use the intensity of the pixels as an augmented feature to correctly group multiple lane markings using the Hough transform. By representing these extracted lane markings as splines, we then identify a set of control points, which becomes a set of targets to be tracked over a period of time, and thus across a large number of frames. We evaluate our approach on two different fronts, covering both model- and machine-learning-based approaches, using two different datasets, namely the Caltech and TuSimple lane detection datasets, respectively. When tested against model-based approach, the proposed approach can offer as much as 5%, 12%, and 3% improvements on the true positive, false positive, and false positives per frame rates compared to the best alternative approach, respectively. When compared against a state-of-the-art machine learning technique, particularly against a supervised learning method, the proposed approach offers 57%, 31%, 4%, and 9x improvements on the false positive, false negative, accuracy, and frame rates. Furthemore, the proposed approach retains the explainability, or in other words, the cause of actions of the proposed approach can easily be understood or explained.

AB The optimal operation of active distribution systems in the presence of private renewable-based entities is one of the primary challenges of future power networks. In this regard, developing a practical framework to deal with this kind of issue is essential. Hence, in this paper, a novel bi-level stochastic programming approach is presented for optimal energy and reserve scheduling of the active distribution system in the presence of different eco-efficient autonomous players. In the proposed model, the distribution system operator, as a leader, attempts to minimize its total operating costs. At the same time, the renewable-based microgrid owner, as an independent follower, tends to maximize its profit from exchanging energy and reserve with the distribution system operator. The suggested scheme is a nonlinear bi-level problem which is transformed into a non-linear single-level problem through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. In order to find the global optima, the non-linear single-level problem is linearized by utilizing the Big-M method. Finally, to investigate the effectiveness of the provided model, it is tested on the modified IEEE 15-Bus active distribution system under different cases and scenarios. Obtained results indicate that the operation cost of the distribution system operator can be reduced up to 134.09$, from 10710.11$ to 10576.02$, and the profit of the microgrid owner can be increased significantly 906.93$, from 659.455$ to 1566.39$, by considering both environmentally friendly units, IPL and CAES.

AB Recent advancement of remote sensing technologies has brought in accurate, dense, and inexpensive city-scale Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, which can be utilized to model city objects (e.g., buildings, roads, and automobiles) for creating Digital Twin Cities (DTCs). However, processing such unstructured point clouds is very challenging, epitomized by high cost, movable objects, limited object classes, and high information inadequacy/redundancy. We noticed that many city objects are not in random shapes; rather, they have invariant cross-sections following the Gestalt design principles, including proximity, connectivity, symmetry, and similarity. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised method, called Clustering Of Symmetric Cross-sections of Objects (COSCO), to process urban LiDAR point clouds to a hierarchy of objects based on their characteristic cross-sections. First, city objects are segmented as connected patches of proximate 3D points. Then, symmetric cross-sections are detected for symmetric city objects. Finally, the taxonomy and groups of city objects are recognized from a hierarchical clustering analysis of the dissimilarity matrix. Experimental results showed that COSCO detected the correct taxonomy and types of 12 cars from 24,126 LiDAR points in 8.28 s. Based on the cross-sections and taxonomy, a digital twin was created by registering online free 3D car models in 29.58 s. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents an effective unsupervised method for understanding and developing DTC objects in LiDAR point clouds by harnessing innate Gestalt design principles. Secondly, COSCO can be an efficient LiDAR pre-processing tool for recognizing symmetric city objects' cross-sections, positions, heading directions, dimensions, and possible types for smart city applications in GIScience, Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO), and autonomous vehicles.

AB In order to navigate a mobile robot or an autonomous vehicle in indoor environment, which includes several kinds of obstacles such as walls, furniture, and humans, the distance between the mobile robot and the obstacles have to be determined. These obstacles can be considered as walls with complicated edges. This paper proposes a mobile-robot-navigation method by using the polar coordinate transformation from an omnidirectional image. The omnidirectional image is obtained from a hyperboloidal mirror, which has the prominent feature in sensing the surrounding image at the same time. When the wall image from the camera is transformed by the transformation, the straight lines between the wall and the floor appear in the curve line after transformation. The peak point represents the distance and the direction between the robot and the wall. In addition, the wall types can be classified by the pattern and number of peak points. They arc one side wall, corridor and corner. To navigate the mobile robot, in this paper, it starts with comparing a peak point obtained from the real image with the reference point determined by designed distance and direction. If there is a difference between the two points, the system will compute appropriate wheel angle to adjust the distance and direction against the wall by keeping the peak point in the same position as the reference point. The experiments are performed on the prototype mobile robot. The results show that for the determining distance from the robot to the wall between 70-290 cm, the average error is 6.23 percent. For three types of thc wall classification, this method can correctly classify 86.67 percent of 15 image samples. In the robot movement alongside the wall, the system approximately consumes the 3 frame/s processing time at 10 cm/s motion speed. The mobile robot can maintain its motion alongside the wall with the average error 12 cm from reference distance.

AB Path planning is widely used in many domains, and it is crucial for the advancement of map navigation, autonomous driving, and robot path planning. However, existing path planning methods have certain limitations for complex field scenes with undulating terrain and diverse landcover types. This paper presents an energy-efficient 3D path planning algorithm based on an improved A* algorithm and the particle swarm algorithm in complex field scenes. The evaluation function of the A* algorithm was improved to be suitable for complex field scenes. The slope parameter and friction coefficient were respectively used in the evaluation function to represent different terrain features and landcover types. The selection of expanding nodes in the algorithm depends not only on the minimum distance but also on the minimum consumption cost. Furthermore, the turning radius factor and slope threshold factor of vehicles were added to the definition of impassable points in the improved A* algorithm, so that the accessibility of path planning could be guaranteed by excluding some bends and steep slopes. To meet the requirements for multi-target path planning, the improved A* algorithm was used as the fitness function of the particle swarm algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm is capable of multi-target path planning in complex field scenes. Furthermore, the path planned by this algorithm is more passable and more energy efficient. In this experimental environment model, the average energy-saving efficiency of the path planned by the improved algorithm is 14.7% compared to the traditional A* algorithm. This would be beneficial to the development of ecotourism and geological exploration.

AB For orchard plant protection, conventional large machines and small sprayers are practically restricted by either narrow planting intervals with dense leaves or their inadequate penetration power, which leads to an unsatisfactory effect of spray. This paper proposes a stereoscopic plant-protection strategy that integrates unmanned air and ground sprayers to spray different parts of canopies to improve uniformity. In order to verify the proposal, a stereoscopic plant-protection system (SPS) was developed, consisting of a small swing-arm sprayer and a T16 plant-protection Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Then, optimal operation parameters were determined by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and orthogonal experiments, and the uniformity was finally quantified by trials. CFD and orthogonal experiments showed that a swing-arm angle of 60 degrees and a forward speed of 0.4 m/s were optimal for the ground sprayer, whilst a height of 2.0 m from the top of canopies and a forward speed of 1.0 m/s were appropriate for the UAV. The trial results showed that the density of vertical droplet deposition varied from 90 to 107 deposits/cm(2) in canopies, and the uniformity was 38.3% higher than conventional approaches. The uniformity of top, bottom, inside and outside canopies was significantly improved. Meanwhile, the density of droplet deposition on both sides of leaves in all test points exceeded 25 deposits/cm(2), able to meet the standard of spray. This study provides a practical approach for uniform pesticide spray to large-canopy fruit trees. Moreover, the high flexibility of plant-protection UAVs and the significant trafficability of small swing-arm sprayers can solve the problem of large machine entering and leaving orchards.

AB Seismic lines have an extensive footprint in Canada's western boreal forest that alter habitat conditions for many species. Seismic lines exist within a range of seral states due to changing practices and regulations related to operational needs. Forest regeneration is often hindered on seismic lines as they are frequently repurposed for recreational or alternative industrial uses. The Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) is a Neotropical migrant songbird that relies on Canada's boreal region for breeding habitat. As a species at risk both federally (Threatened) and provincially within Alberta (Sensitive), their response to seismic lines has been a significant gap in our understanding of human impacts on the boreal breeding grounds. We used playback surveys along seismic lines within Canada Warbler habitat to identify individual territories. Arrays of autonomous recording units (ARU) were deployed to conduct acoustic source localization (ASL) and map the locations of territorial singing events. Canada Warblers avoided seismic lines with little to no woody vegetation but were more likely to be observed near seismic lines when shrub cover on the line increased. Canada Warblers used the seismic line and the edge environment but did not select for the line when compared to its availability. Use was more evenly distributed across the seismic line as shrub density on the line increased. However, even the most overgrown seismic lines were still perceived as a feature and influenced Canada Warbler space use and behavior. For Canada Warblers, ensuring that seismic lines in old-growth deciduous forests are allowed to recover by reducing reuse of lines should mitigate population level impacts, but more work is needed to assess how population dynamics are influenced by seismic lines and other energy sector disturbances.

AB This paper concerns modeling, simulations and control design of turbo-electric distributed propulsion (TeDP) systems needed to power future hybrid aircraft systems. The approach taken is the one of control co-design by which the sizing and hardware selection of components and the TeDP architecture design are pursued so that potential effects of control and automation are accounted for from the very beginning. Unique to this approach is a multi-layered modular modeling and control approach in which technology-specific modules comprising the complex dynamical system are characterized using unified interaction variables at their interfaces with the rest of the system. The dynamical performance of the interconnected system is assessed using these technology-agnostic interface variable specifications and, as such, can be applied to any candidate architecture of interest. Importantly, even the inputs to the TeDP system coming from pilot commands are modeled using such interface variables. This new multi-layered modeling captures the dynamics of energy and power as interactions. It also has a rather straightforward physical interpretation. The paper builds on our earlier results introduced for terrestrial power systems, including small micro-grids. We show how system feasibility and stability can be checked in real-time operations by modules exchanging the information about their interaction variables and adjusting in a near-autonomous manner so that, as system conditions vary, the interconnected system still functions. No such systematic control co-design exists to the best of our knowledge, but it is needed as both new technologies and more complex, often conflicting performance objectives emerge. We illustrate the approach on a representative TeDP architecture and compare it to today's state-of-the-art. We close with a discussion on the generalization of the method for any given candidate architecture. Having such an approach dramatically reduces the R&D&D of novel candidate architectures.

AB With an exponential increase in the utilization of intellective appliances, meeting the energy demand of consumers by traditional power grids is a significant challenge. In integration, the amalgamation of electric vehicles, industrial Internet-of-Things (IoT), and smart communities with power grids has escalated the global energy demand. Consequently, the desideratum for a reliable energy supply and resilient energy ecosystem has incentivized the evolution of Smart Grids (SG). Such intelligent grids are equipped with autonomous controllers and advanced technologies like advanced metering infrastructure, smart sensors, and accounting management software. However, the existing demand response management and energy supply techniques are lagging behind in meeting the desired objectives in the SG ecosystem. In order to handle these challenges, a Demand Replication Optimization Scheme (DROpS) for the smart energy ecosystem is designed in this paper. In addition, a Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg game is formulated in this paper to operate with the proposed scheme. However, the success of DROpS depends heavily on real-time communication between the consumers and the suppliers. Hence, dynamic and scalable network architecture is required to handle the seamless data generated by a sizably voluminous number of connected sensors, devices, and smart appliances deployed in the SG. For the successful operation of the architecture, a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled control scheme for flow management is additionally developed. In the proposed scheme, the SG ecosystem is divided into multiple zones such that the dedicated virtual SDN controllers are deployed for network resource utilization in an optimized manner. The proposed scheme is evaluated using a real smart home test bed and data traces from the Haryana power grid. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in terms of significant gains observed for load variation and latency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Initiating flight is challenging, and considerable effort has focused on understanding the energetics and aerodynamics of take-off for both machines and animals. For animal flight, the available evidence suggests that birds maximize their initial flight velocity using leg thrust rather than wing flapping. The smallest birds, hummingbirds (Order Apodiformes), are unique in their ability to perform sustained hovering but have proportionally small hindlimbs that could hinder generation of high leg thrust. Understanding the take-off flight of hummingbirds can provide novel insight into the take-off mechanics that will be required for micro-air vehicles. During take-off by hummingbirds, we measured hindlimb forces on a perch mounted with strain gauges and filmed wingbeat kinematics with high-speed video. Whereas other birds obtain 80-90% of their initial flight velocity using leg thrust, the leg contribution in hummingbirds was 59% during autonomous take-off. Unlike other species, hummingbirds beat their wings several times as they thrust using their hindlimbs. In a phylogenetic context, our results show that reduced body and hindlimb size in hummingbirds limits their peak acceleration during leg thrust and, ultimately, their takeoff velocity. Previously, the influence of motivational state on take-off flight performance has not been investigated for any one organism. We studied the full range of motivational states by testing performance as the birds took off: (1) to initiate flight autonomously, (2) to escape a startling stimulus or (3) to aggressively chase a conspecific away from a feeder. Motivation affected performance. Escape and aggressive take-off featured decreased hindlimb contribution (46% and 47%, respectively) and increased flight velocity. When escaping, hummingbirds foreshortened their body movement prior to onset of leg thrust and began beating their wings earlier and at higher frequency. Thus, hummingbirds are capable of modulating their leg and wingbeat kinetics to increase take-off velocity.

AB With the development of renewable energy and the changes in the characteristics of power grid, it is becoming increasingly difficult to balance power supply and demand in space and time. In addition, the requirement for improved dispatching capability of power grid is increasing. Therefore, the potential of flexible load dispatching should be realized, which can promote the large-scale consumption of renewable energy and the construction of new power grid. Based on the analysis of existing load dispatching studies and the differences in the characteristics of domestic and foreign load dispatchings, a technical architecture and several key technologies are proposed for load resources to participate in power grid dispatching under the new situation, i.e., the autonomous collaborative control system of load dispatching. This system implements the multi-layer coordinated control of main, distribution and micro grids (load aggregators). Adjustable load resources are aggregated through an aggregator operation platform and connected with a dispatcher load regulator platform to realize real-time data interaction with dispatching agencies as well as the monitoring, control, and marketing of aggregators. It supports the load resources to participate in network-wide dispatching optimization via continuous power adjustment. Several key technologies such as the control mode, load modeling, dispatching strategy, and safety protection are also elaborated. Through the closed-loop control of orderly charging piles and energy storage clusters in the North China Power Grid, the feasibility of the proposed architecture and key technologies is verified. This route has successively supported multiple adjustable load aggregators to participate in the ancillary services market of North China Power Grid for peak-shaving. Finally, the technical challenges of load resources participating in power grid dispatching under the dual carbon goals are discussed and prospected.

AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) are integrated into security-critical infrastructures such as medical devices, autonomous vehicles and smart grids. Unfortunately, the pervasiveness and network accessibility of these systems and their relative lack of security measures make them attractive targets for attacks. This makes building Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for CPSes a necessity. However, detecting intrusions requires collecting information about a system's internal workings; this can be expensive both in runtime and memory consumption. According to prior research, fine-grain monitoring of a CPS maximizes the chance of intrusion detection but incurs overhead that can exceed the resource constraints of these systems. The objective of this study is to propose a solution for adapting IDSes for deployment on resource-limited CPSes without losing detection accuracy.
   We propose ARTINALI#; a Bayesian-based search and score technique that identifies the critical points at which to instrument a CPS. Given a set of security monitors that observe run-time behavior of the system, a set of specifications that verify the correct behavior of the system, and statistics gathered from fault injection, ARTINALI# discovers a small set of locations and a rich set of specifications that yield full attack coverage with low (memory and time) overhead. We deploy ARTINALI# to construct an IDS for two CPSes: a smart meter and a smart artificial pancreas. We demonstrate that our technique reduces the number of security monitors by 64% on average, leading to 52% and 69% reductions in memory and runtime overhead respectively, while still detecting over 98% of emulated attacks, on average. ARTINALI# enables the IDSes to be applicable to a wide range of CPS systems with different resource capacities. In addition, it accelerates the attack detection process which is significantly essential for safety-critical systems.

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) has made ubiquitous computing a reality by extending Internet connectivity in various applications deployed across the globe. IoT connect billions of objects together for high speed data transfer especially in 5G-enabled industrial environment during information collection and processing. Most of the issues such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices and protocols used may not be applicable infor future applications as these protocols are based upon a centralized architecture. This centralized architecture may have a single point of failure alongwith the computational overhead. So, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors IoT-enabled industrial automation. In such an environment, security and privacy preservation are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon the centralized architecture. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art proposals having 5G-enabled IoT as a backbone for blockchain-based industrial automation for the applications such as-Smart city, Smart Home, Healthcare 4.0, Smart Agriculture, Autonomous vehicles and Supply chain management. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that blockchain can revolutionize most of the current and future industrial applications in different sectors by providing a fine-grained decentralized access control. Various transactions and database logs can be traced efficiently using blockchain for consistency and preivacy preservation in the aforementiioned industrial sectors. The open issues and challenges of 5G-enabled IoT for blockchain-based Industrial automation are also analyzed in the text. Finally, a comparison of existing proposals with respect to various parameters is presented which allows the end users to select one of the proposals in comparison to its merits over the others.

AB Direct-sequence (DS) code-division multiple access (CDMA) is considered for future wideband mobile underwater acoustic networks, where a typical configuration may include several autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating within a few kilometers of a central receiver. Two receivers that utilize multichannel (array) processing of asynchronous multiuser signals are proposed: the symbol decision feedback (SDF) receiver and the chip hypothesis feedback (CHF) receiver. Both receivers use a chip-resolution adaptive front end consisting of a many-to-few combiner and a bank of fractionally-spaced feedforward equalizers. In the SDF receiver, feedback equalization is implemented at symbol resolution, and receiver filters, including a decision-directed phase-locked loop, are adapted at the symbol rate. This limits its applicability to the channels whose time variation is slow compared to the symbol rate. In a wideband acoustic system, which transmits at maximal chip rate, the symbol rate is down-scaled by the spreading factor, and an inverse effect may occur by which increasing the spreading factor results in performance degradation. To eliminate this effect, feedback equalization, which is necessary for the majority of acoustic channels, is performed in the CHF receiver at chip resolution and receiver parameters are adjusted at the chip rate. At the price of increased computational complexity (there are as many adaptive filters as there are symbol values), this receiver provides improved performance for systems where time variation cannot be neglected with respect to the symbol rate [e.g., low probability of detection (LPD) acoustic systems]. Performance of the two receivers was demonstrated in a four-user scenario, using experimental data obtained over a 2-km shallow-water channel. At the chip rate of 19.2 kilochips per second (kc/s) with quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation, excellent results were achieved at an aggregate data rate of up to 10 kb/s.

AB The new wave of Industry 4.0 is transforming manufacturing factories into data-rich environments. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to feed large amounts of sensing data collected from the physical factory into the construction of digital twin (DT) in cyberspace. However, little has been done to fully utilize the DT technology to improve the smartness and autonomous levels of small and medium-sized manufacturing factories. Indeed, only a small fraction of small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) has considered implementing DT technology. There is an urgent need to exploit the full potential of data analytics and simulation-enabled DTs for advanced manufacturing. Hence, this paper presents the design and development of DT models for simulation optimization of manufacturing process flows. First, we develop a multi-agent simulation model that describes nonlinear and stochastic dynamics among a network of interactive manufacturing things, including customers, machines, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), queues, and jobs. Second, we propose a statistical metamodeling approach to design sequential computer experiments to optimize the utilization of AGV under uncertainty. Third, we construct two new graph models-job flow graph and AGV traveling graph-to track and monitor the real-time performance of manufacturing jobshops. The proposed simulation-enabled DT approach is evaluated and validated with experimental studies for the representation of a real-world manufacturing factory. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology effectively transforms a manufacturing jobshop into a new generation of DT-enabled smart factories. The sequential design of experiments effectively reduces the computation overhead of expensive simulations while optimally scheduling the AGV to achieve production throughput cost-effectively. This research is strongly promised to help SMMs fully utilize big data and DT technology for gaining competitive advantages in the global marketplace.

AB volcanoes and other extensive hard tar seafloor accumulations are known from the Gulf of Mexico, off Angola, and in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC), Southern California. There are two major volcano features in the SBC: Il Duomo (about 20 m high, cresting at a bottom depth of 115 m) and Il Duomito (about 15 m high, cresting at 185 m). While the geology of these features has been well studied, their fish assemblages have not been well documented. Using an autonomous underwater vehicle, we surveyed the fishes that live on the volcanoes and on the surrounding mud. We observed 1836 fishes, which represented a minimum of 43 species. Of these species, at least 23 (53.5%) were of rockfishes (genus Sebastes). Most of the species were entirely or primarily associated with a specific habitat type, either asphalt or mud. The most abundant primarily asphalt-associated species were greenblotched, swordspine, greenspotted, and flag rockfishes, and bocaccio, cowcod, and bank rockfish. The most abundant mud-associated species included Pacific sanddab, slender, Dover, and English soles, and unidentified poachers. A few taxa (shortspine combfish, greenstriped rockfish, and spotted ratfish) were found both on the mud and over the edges of the asphalt. We observed relatively low densities of all fishes on the volcanoes compared to densities on many Southern California natural reefs within the same depth range. We suggest that this is due to specialIntscript a lack of cobble fields around the volcanoes, creating limited habitat for either dwarf species or juvenile fishes, specialIntscript a lack of complex habitat (volcanoes are relatively smooth) creating very limited habitat for adults that need to shelter, and specialIntscript fishing pressure targeting economically important species. Given the unique nature of these tar volcanoes off California, we also suggest the state consider protecting this habitat and the organisms within it.

AB The task of strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) initial alignment is to calculate the attitude transformation matrix from body frame to navigation frame. In this paper, such attitude transformation matrix is divided into two parts through introducing the initial inertially fixed navigation frame as inertial frame. The attitude changes of the navigation frame corresponding to the defined inertial frame can be exactly calculated with known velocity and position provided by GNSS. The attitude from body frame to the defined inertial frame is estimated based on the SINS mechanization in inertial frame. The attitude, velocity and position in inertial frame are formulated together as element of the group of double direct spatial isometries (). It is proven that the group state model in inertial frame satisfies a particular "group affine" property and the corresponding error model satisfies a "log-linear" autonomous differential equation on the Lie algebra. Based on such striking property, the attitude from body frame to the defined inertial frame can be estimated based on the linear error model with even extreme large misalignments. Two different error state vectors are extracted based on right and left matrix multiplications and the detailed linear state-space models are derived based on the right and left errors for SINS mechanization in inertial frame. With the derived linear state-space models, the explicit initial alignment procedures have been presented. Extensive simulation and field tests indicate that the initial alignment based on the left error model can perform quite well within a wide range of initial attitude errors, although the used filter is still a type of linear Kalman filter. This method is promising in practical products abandoning the traditional coarse alignment stage.

AB In this paper, we consider the source localization problem with an underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN) consisting of a number of platforms each equipped with an array, such as an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Direct position determination (DPD) has been a promising topic in recent years. Existing DPD methods can be divided into two categories: global coherent processing and non-coherent processing. The former is easy to implement in practical tasks but the coherence between the received signals at different nodes are not exploited, while the requirements for coherent processing may not be fulfilled in real environments. A multi-cluster array model is constructed considering the deployment of the nodes with the intention to exploit the available coherence in the UASN and avoiding the side effects of imperfect spatial coherence. A weighted MUSIC direct source localization approach is proposed based on this model. The arrays within a cluster work coherently as a large array and contribute a MUSIC spectrum. The final source position estimate is obtained from a weighted combination of these spectra, and the weights are dependent on the eigenstucture and noise variance of each cluster. We first investigate the theoretical gain of inter-array coherence exploitation on localization accuracy by means of Cramer-Rao bound analysis. Then the model for imperfect spatial coherence is generalized to the multi-cluster system to examine the performance of the proposed approach when the inherent constraints for intra-cluster coherent processing can not be guaranteed. Numerical results demonstrate the superior resolution capability of the proposed approach and its robustness to imperfect spatial coherence.

AB Decision analysis and risk analysis have grown up around a set of organizing questions: what might go wrong, how likely is it to do so, how bad might the consequences be, what should be done to maximize expected utility and minimize expected loss or regret, and how large are the remaining risks? In probabilistic causal models capable of representing unpredictable and novel events, probabilities for what will happen, and even what is possible, cannot necessarily be determined in advance. Standard decision and risk analysis questions become inherently unanswerable ("undecidable") for realistically complex causal systems with "open-world" uncertainties about what exists, what can happen, what other agents know, and how they will act. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques enable agents (e.g., robots, drone swarms, and automatic controllers) to learn, plan, and act effectively despite open-world uncertainties in a host of practical applications, from robotics and autonomous vehicles to industrial engineering, transportation and logistics automation, and industrial process control. This article offers an AI/machine learning perspective on recent ideas for making decision and risk analysis (even) more useful. It reviews undecidability results and recent principles and methods for enabling intelligent agents to learn what works and how to complete useful tasks, adjust plans as needed, and achieve multiple goals safely and reasonably efficiently when possible, despite open-world uncertainties and unpredictable events. In the near future, these principles could contribute to the formulation and effective implementation of more effective plans and policies in business, regulation, and public policy, as well as in engineering, disaster management, and military and civil defense operations. They can extend traditional decision and risk analysis to deal more successfully with open-world novelty and unpredictable events in large-scale real-world planning, policymaking, and risk management.

AB The historical record of large subduction earthquakes in Guerrero, Mexico, reveals the existence of an similar to 230-km length segment below the coast where no major rupture has occurred in the past 60 years. Reliable quantification of the hazard associated with such a seismic gap is urgently needed for risk mitigation purposes by means of state-of-the-art observations and modeling. In this article, we introduce and quantitatively assess the first seismogeodetic amphibious network deployed in Mexican and Central American soils that will provide the opportunity to achieve this goal in the near future. Deployed in 2017, the network is the result of a collaborative effort between Mexican and Japanese scientists. It consists of 15 onshore broadband and 7 ocean-bottom seismometers, 33 Global Positioning System (GPS) stations, 7 ocean-bottom pressure gauges, and 2 GPS-acoustic sites, most of them installed within the Guerrero seismic gap. Initial data from the network revealed the occurrence of a 6-month-long slow-slip event in Guerrero, starting in May and ending in October 2017. To illustrate the performance of the various instruments, we also present the first ocean-bottom pressure and GPS-acoustic measurements in Mexico; the latter was obtained by means of an autonomous Wave Glider vehicle. The ground motion of the devastating 19 September 2017 M-w 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico is presented as well. Nominal resolution of the seismogeodetic network is estimated through different synthetic inversion tests for tomographic imaging and the seismic coupling (or slow-slip) determination on the plate interface. The tests show that combined onshore and offshore instruments should lead to unprecedented results regarding the seismic potential (i.e., interface coupling) of the seismic gap and the Earth structure from the Middle America trench up to 70-km depth across the Guerrero state.

AB Robotic mobile fulfillment systems (RMFS) have seen many implementations in recent years, due to their high flexibility and low operational cost. Such a system stores goods in movable shelves and uses movable robots to transport the shelves. The robot is battery powered and the battery depletes during operations, which can seriously affect the performance of the system. This study focuses on battery management problem in an RMFS, considering a battery swapping and a battery charging strategy with plug-in or inductive charging. We build a semi-open queueing network (SOQN) to estimate system performance, modeling the battery charging process as a single queue and the battery swapping process as a nested SOQN. We develop a decomposition method to solve the analytical models and validate them through simulation. Our models can be used to optimize battery recovery strategies and compare their cost and throughput time performance. The results show that throughput time performance can be significantly affected by the battery recovery policy, that inductive charging performs best, and that battery swapping outperforms plug-in charging by as large as 4.88%, in terms of retrieval transaction throughput time. However, the annual cost of the RMFS using the battery swapping strategy is generally higher than that of the RMFS using the plug-in charging strategy. In the RMFS that uses the inductive charging strategy, a critical price of a robot can be found, for a lower robot price and a small required retrieval transaction throughput time, inductive charging outperforms both plug-in charging and battery swapping strategies in terms of annual cost. We also find that ignoring the battery recovery will underestimate the number of robots required and the system cost for more than 15%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is emerging as a valuable resolution to distant monitoring and control issues. These are used to keep an eye on the remote, hazardous, antagonistic, and large-scale target regions. Random dispersion of Sensor Nodes (SNs) from air is the most suited technique to set up WSN in such regions, but it endure various imperfections, i.e., a large number of SNs are needed to attain preferred coverage level. Moreover, its randomness may be hampered by atmospheric winds while dropping from air. In this research article three models for the precise placement of SNs have been proposed. Each successive model is an enhancement and refinement of its base model. The proposed models utilize the potential attained as a result of high falling height to position the SNs on their preferred locations (PLs). All the PLs are computed initially and SNs are equipped with a small sized economical carrier glider (CG) which floats them to their PL. The movement of a glider is controlled by the piloting SN. The first model defines the significance of a virtual path and the technique used by a CG to follow it to reach its PL. But, it suffers from a path swerving problem. The second model incorporates the virtual-path updating mechanism in the basic model. This rectifies the problem of path swerving and makes it resistant to the winds. The third model further refines its base model by introducing a radius reduction technique to enhance its precision and energy efficiency. The proposed models use an obstinate technique to maintain the direction of movement of a floating CG towards the PL in order to deal with atmospheric winds. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The stellar refraction navigation is a type of autonomous celestial navigation method for satellites that uses high-accuracy star sensors to obtain the stellar refraction. The apparent height and the stellar refraction angle are two kinds of measurements for the satellite stellar refraction navigation system. A better navigation performance can be achieved by the stellar refraction angle rather than the refraction apparent height. However, the measurement model of the stellar refraction angle is an implicit function, which needs an implicit filter method. A new implicit unscented Kalman filter (UKF) method is proposed and applied to the satellite stellar refraction navigation system in this paper. The main difference between the classical UKF and the implicit UKF lies in the measurement update. First, since the implicit measurement model can be rearranged into an equation whose one side is zero, the vector of zeros is regarded as the equivalent measurement, and the difference between the predicted measurement and its true value is utilized for updating the predicted state and its covariance matrix. Second, the measurement noise and its covariance matrix are transformed based on the unscented transformation principle. In addition, the implicit UKF is compared with the implicit extended Kalman filter (IEKF), the iterative IEKF, and the UKF. Simulations show that the proposed implicit UKF method can obtain about 19.0% and 17.5% improvements in three-dimensional root mean square position estimation compared to the IEKF and the iterative IEKF, respectively. Although the navigation performance of the UKF is close to the implicit UKFs, the computational time of the implicit UKF is much shorter than the UKFs. In addition, the sensitivities of the four different Kalman filters to the star sensor's faults and the atmosphere perturbation are compared, respectively.

AB Repeatable and accurate seagrass mapping is required for understanding seagrass ecology and supporting management decisions. For shallow (<5m) seagrass habitats, these maps can be created by integrating high spatial resolution imagery with field survey data. Field survey data for seagrass are often collected via snorkelling or diving. However, these methods are limited by environmental and safety considerations. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are used increasingly to collect field data for habitat mapping, albeit mostly in deeper waters (>20m). Here, we demonstrate and evaluate the use and potential advantages of AUV field data collection for calibration and validation of seagrass habitat mapping of shallow waters (<5m), from multispectral satellite imagery. The study was conducted in the seagrass habitats of the Eastern Banks (142km(2)), Moreton Bay, Australia. In the field, georeferenced photographs of the seagrass were collected along transects via snorkelling or an AUV. Photographs from both collection methods were analysed manually for seagrass species composition and then used as calibration and validation data to map seagrass using an established semi-automated object-based mapping routine. A comparison of the relative advantages and disadvantages of AUV and snorkeller-collected field data-sets and their influence on the mapping routine was conducted. AUV data collection was more consistent, repeatable and safer in comparison with snorkeller transects. Inclusion of deeper water AUV data resulted in mapping of a larger extent of seagrass (~7km(2), 5% of study area) in the deeper waters of the site. Although overall map accuracies did not differ considerably, inclusion of the AUV data from deeper water transects corrected errors in seagrass mapped at depths to 5m, but where the bottom is visible on satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that further development of AUV technology is justified for the monitoring of seagrass habitats in ongoing management programmes.

AB Motion sickness is a physiological condition that negatively impacts a person's comfort and will be an emerging condition in autonomous vehicles without proper countermeasures. The vestibular system plays a key role in the origin of motion sickness. Understanding the susceptibility and (mal) adaptive mechanisms of the highly integrated vestibular system is a prerequisite for the development of countermeasures. We hypothesize a differential association between motion sickness and vestibular function in healthy individuals with and without susceptibility for motion sickness. We quantified vestibular function by measuring the high-frequency vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) using video head impulse testing (vHIT) in 17 healthy volunteers before and after a 11 min motion sickness-inducing naturalistic stop-and-go car ride on a test track (Dekra Test Oval, Klettwitz, Germany). The cohort was classified as motion sickness susceptible (n = 11) and non-susceptible (n = 6). Six (out of 11) susceptible participants developed nausea symptoms, while a total of nine participants were free of these symptoms. The VOR gain (1) did not differ significantly between participant groups with (n = 8) and without motion sickness symptoms (n = 9), (2) did not differ significantly in the factor time before and after the car ride, and showed no interaction between symptom groups and time, as indicated by a repeated measures ANOVA (F(1,15) = 2.19, p = 0.16. Bayesian inference confirmed that there was "anecdotal evidence" for equality of gain rather than difference across groups and time (BF10 < 0.77). Our results suggest that individual differences in VOR measures or adaptation to motion sickness provocative stimuli during naturalistic stop-and-go driving cannot predict motion sickness susceptibility or the likelihood of developing motion sickness.

AB The fish-like robot is one of the typical underwater robots, which has the advantage of high maneuverability with low noise due to its bioinspired structure and biomimetic locomotion. However, it is challenging to efficiently design motion controllers for such robots to achieve satisfactory performance on specific control tasks in the real underwater environment, since the complex fluid-structure interaction exists during their swimming and exact dynamic models are absent. In this article, we propose a learning framework, incorporating a simulation system and a training methodology, to autonomously and fast train in simulation to create control policies that are capable of directly applying to a type of physical fish-like robots to perform motion control tasks. First, we construct a simulation system combining a data-driven environment and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based environment, thus well balancing the simulation accuracy and the calculation speed. Second, we design a training methodology to train deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based policies for the robot in our constructed simulation system to perform a specific control task. Then, we use two typical motion control tasks to verify our proposed framework. One is the path-following control task, which is a one-objective problem with dense rewards, while the other is the pose control task which is a two-objective problem with sparse rewards. For each task, the DRL-based control policy trained by our learning framework is directly deployed on the physical fish-like robot to perform the task in the real world. Experimental results show that the policies trained in simulation still work well in the real world, and perform even better in terms of control accuracy and stability compared with the traditional control methods, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our learning framework.

AB Social Network Analysis (SNA) has proven itself to embody the complex relationships between actors of groups inside out. Not only that, but it has also emerged as a new paradigm to investigate the structure of ties and its role on relationships between the actors. This research aims to investigate the patterns of relationships between authors and institutions working in Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) research area. LIDAR has been in the limelight during recent years, especially autonomous vehicles for map-making and objection detection tasks. Researchers need insight into the current contributors and research areas to devise policies and set future targets for this important technology. Current study performs SNA to identify potential institutions and researchers that can help to achieve those goals. National and international co-authorship is analysed separately. A total of 4274 papers from Web of Science (WOS) database are collected from 1998 to September 2017. SNA measures of degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality along with descriptive analysis are employed to study the patterns. Analysis reveals that the United States of America (USA) is the most central and significant country in terms of international co-authorship. China, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada are ranked 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th in this list respectively. For co-institution network, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), University of Idaho and California Institute of Technology USA occupy 1st, 2nd, and 5th position respectively when top 5 institutions are considered. Consiglio NazionaleDelle Ricerche of Italy occupies 3rd position while Chinese Academy of Science, China, secures 4th place concerning betweenness centrality. Descriptive analysis reveals that during the last decade, co-author collaboration in scientific research has been elevated. Results show that research articles with 6 or more authors have higher citations than those with two to five authors. In addition, journals producing a higher number of papers and their corresponding citations are also discussed.

AB By achieving their purposes through interactions with the physical world, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) pose new challenges in terms of dependability. Indeed, the evolution of the physical systems they control with transducers can be affected by surrounding physical processes over which they have no control and which may potentially hamper the achievement of their purposes. While it is illusory to hope for a comprehensive model of the physical environment at design time to anticipate and remove faults that may occur once these systems are deployed, it becomes necessary to evaluate their degree of effectiveness in vivo. In this paper, the degree of effectiveness is formally defined and generalized in the context of the measure theory. The measure is developed in the context of the Transferable Belief Model (TBM), an elaboration on the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence so as to handle epistemic and aleatory uncertainties respectively pertaining the users' expectations and the natural variability of the physical environment. The TBM is used in conjunction with the Input/Output Hidden Markov Modeling framework we denote by Ev-IOHMM to specify the expected evolution of the physical system controlled by the CPS and the tolerances towards uncertainties. The measure of effectiveness is then obtained from the forward algorithm, leveraging the conflict entailed by the successive combinations of the beliefs obtained from observations of the physical system and the beliefs corresponding to its expected evolution. The proposed approach is applied to autonomous vehicles and shows how the degree of effectiveness can be used for bench-marking their controller relative to the highway code speed limitations and passengers' well-being constraints, both modeled through an Ev-IOHMM.

TI Uncertainty estimation of a CFD-methodology for the performance analysis

SO APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Numerical uncertainty; CFD; Collective and cyclic pitch propeller
AB Estimation and analysis of the uncertainty introduced by using a numerical model for the investigation and study of any type of flow problem have become common industry practice. Through understanding and evaluation of the uncertainty introduced by a numerical model, the accuracy and applicability of the model itself are evaluated. In this paper, the numerical uncertainty of a CFD-methodology developed to analyse the hydrodynamic performance of a collective and cyclic pitch propeller (CCPP) is estimated and analysed. The CCPP is a novel propulsion and manoeuvring concept for autonomous underwater vehicles, aimed to generate both propulsion and manoeuvring forces through advanced control of the propeller's blade pitch. The numerical uncertainty is established for three performance parameters, the generated propulsive force, the side-force magnitude, and the side-force orientation, by conducting a grid and time-step refinement study over three operational conditions. Additionally, the influence of the oscillatory uncertainty, introduced by the periodic nature of the problem, is investigated although shown to have a minimal effect when properly monitored. Based on a least-squares regression analysis of the refined simulation results, the numerical uncertainty is proven to be dominated by the introduced discretisation errors. In the case of the propulsive and side-force magnitude, the total uncertainty is dictated by the time discretisation uncertainty under bollard pull conditions, while the total uncertainty of the captive cases is mainly a result of the spatial discretisation uncertainty. The total uncertainty in the side-force orientation is observed to be primarily a consequence of the time discretisation uncertainty for all simulated cases. Overall, the total uncertainty for captive cases can be considered satisfactory for all three performance parameters, while further work is needed to reduce the observed uncertainty of the simulations under bollard pull conditions.

ID FLIGHT CONTROL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to design linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based Luenberger observer for the estimation of unknown states of aircraft.
   Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the LQR-based Luenberger observer is deliberated for autonomous level flight of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which has been attained productively. Various modes like phugoid and roll modes are exploited for controlling the rates of UAV. The Luenberger observer is exploited for estimation of the mysterious states of the system. The rates of roll, yaw and pitch are used as an input to the observer, while the remaining states such as velocities and angles have been anticipated. The main advantage of using Luenberger observer was to reduce the cost of the system which has been achieved lucratively. The Luenberger observer proposes sturdiness at the rate of completion to conquest over the turmoil and insecurities to overcome the privileged recital. The FlightGear simulator is exploited for the endorsement of the recital of the Luenberger observer-based autopilot. The level flight has been subjugated lucratively and has been legitimated by exploiting the FlightGear simulator. The authenticated and the validated results are offered in this paper. Microsoft Visual Studio has been engaged as a medium between the MATLAB and FlightGear Simulator.
   Findings The suggested observer based on LQR ensures the lucrative approximation of the unknown states of the system as well as the successful level flight of the system. The Luenberger observer is used for approximation of states while LQR is used as controller.
   Originality/value In this research work, not only the estimation of unknown states of both longitudinal and lateral model is made but also the level flight is achieved by using those estimated states and the autopilot is validated by using the FlightGear, while in most of the research work only the estimation is made of only longitudinal or lateral model.

AB The MUSES-C mission is the world's first sample and return attempt to/from the near Earth asteroid Nereus (4660). It is the ISAS (The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Ministry of Education) which manages the mission that started in 1996 scheduling to be launched in January of 2002. The mission is built asa kind of technology demonstration, however, it is aiming at not only the in-situ observation but also the touch-down sampling of the surface fragments. The sample collected is returned to the Earth in January of 2006. The mission is a four year journey. The major purpose of it originally consists of the following four subjects: 1)The Ion thruster propulsion performed in interplanetary field as-a primary means, 2) Autonomous guidance, navigation and control during the rendezvous and touch down phase, 3) The sample collection mechanism and 4) The hyperbolic reentry capsule with the asteroid sample contained inside it. The current primary objective is extended to carry the joint small rover with NASA/JPL, which is supposed to be placed on the surface and to look into the crater created by the sampling shot of the projectile. The rover is designated as the Small Science Vehicle (SSV) that weighs about 1 kg carrying three kinds of in-situ instruments: I) A Visible Camera, 2) Near Infra-Red Spectrometer and potentially 3) Alpha-Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) similar to that delivered on the Mars Path Finder.
   During the fiscal 1998, the spacecraft undergoes the PM tests ana the FM fabrication starts from next year, 1999. The paper presents the latest mission description around the asteroid and shows the current status of the spacecraft as well as the instruments and so on. The mission will be the good example of an international collaboration in the small interplanetary exploration. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and the digitization and automation of manufacturing processes have created a demand for designing smart warehouses to support manufacturing processes. Warehousing is one of the fundamental processes in the supply chain, and is responsible for handling inventory. Efficient execution of warehouse operations often determines the effectiveness of realized goods flows. Therefore, digitization and its use in exchanging information between partners, especially real-time inventory levels, is critical. For this reason, the digital solutions of Industry 4.0 have quickly found application in internal logistics processes and enabled the design of smart warehouses, also known as Warehouse 4.0. The purpose of this article is to present the results of the conducted review of publications on the design and operation of warehouses using the concepts of Industry 4.0. A total of 249 documents from the last 5 years were accepted for analysis. Publications were searched for in the Web of Science database using the PRISMA method. The article presents in detail the research methodology and the results of the biometric analysis. Based on the results, a two-level classification framework was proposed, which includes 10 primary categories and 24 subcategories. Each of the distinguished categories was characterized based on the analyzed publications. It should be noted that in most of these studies, the authors' attention primarily focused on the implementation of (1) Industry 4.0 technological solutions, such as IoT, augmented reality, RFID, visual technology, and other emerging technologies; and (2) autonomous and automated vehicles in warehouse operations processes. Critical analysis of the literature also allowed us to identify the current research gaps, which will be the subject of further research by the authors.

AB The advanced functionality requirements of modern embedded and Internet of Things (IoT) devices - from autonomous vehicles, to city and power-grid management - are driving an ever-increasing software complexity. At the same time, the pervasive internet connections of these systems necessitate the fundamental design of security into these devices. The isolation of complex features from those that are critical through protection domains is an effective means to constrain the scope of faults and security breaches. Common hardware-provided memory facilities to enforce protection domains through memory access control - including Memory Management Units (MMUs) usually found in microprocessors, and Memory Protection Units (MPUs) usually found in microcontrollers - must meet the goals of enabling flexible, efficient and dynamic management of memory, and must enable tight bounds on the worst-case execution of critical code. Unfortunately, current system memory management facilities are ill-prepared to handle this challenge: MMUs that use extensive caches to achieve strong average-case performance suffer from debilitating worst-case and even average-case behavior under hefty interference, while MPUs struggle to provide flexible memory management.
   This paper details MxU, a memory protection and allocation abstraction that integrates temporal specifications into the memory management subsystem, to enable portable code to achieve both predictable, tightly-bounded execution and dynamic management across both MMU- and MPU-based systems. We implement MxU in the Composite microkernel, and evaluate its flexibility and predictability over two different architectures: a MPU-based Cortex-M7 microcontroller and a MMU-based Cortex-A9 microprocessor using a suite of modern applications including neural network-based inference, SQLite, and a javascript runtime.
   For MMU-based systems, MxU reduces application TLB stall by up to 68.0%. For MPU-based systems, MxU enables flexible dynamic memory management often with application overheads of 1%, increasing to 6.1% under significant interference.

AB Robotic compact storage and retrieval systems (RCSRS) have seen many implementations over the last few years. In such a system, the inventory items are stored in bins, organized in a grid. In each cell of the grid, a certain number of bins are stored on top of each other. Robots with transport and lifting capabilities move on the grid roof to transport bins between manual workstations and storage stacks. We estimate performance and evaluate storage policies of RCSRS, considering both dedicated and shared storage policies coupled with random and zoned storage stacks. Semi-open queuing networks (SOQNs) are built to estimate the system performance, which can handle both immediate and delayed reshuffling processes. We approximate the models by reduced SOQNs with two load-dependent service nodes and use the matrix-geometric method to solve them. Both simulations and a real case are used to validate the analytical models. Assuming a given number of stored products, our models can be used to optimize not only the length-to-width ratio of the system but also the stack height, depending on the storage strategy used. For a given inventory and optimal system configuration, we demonstrate that the dedicated storage policy outperforms the shared storage policy when the objective is to minimize dual command throughput time. However, from a cost perspective, with a maximum dual command throughput time as a constraint, we show that shared storage substantially outperforms dedicated storage. The annualized costs of dedicated storage are up to twice as large as those of shared storage, as a result of the larger number of storage positions required by dedicated storage and the relatively lower filling degree of storage stacks.

AB Ocean wastewater dischargers in southern California maintain extensive water quality monitoring programs to assess their effects on coastal receiving waters, but there is no shared protocol to analyze these measurements for compliance with California Ocean Plan standards. Here we present an assessment methodology that we apply regionally to determine discharge effects on dissolved oxygen (DO). The methodology was developed using an optimization algorithm to determine the following: (1) the most appropriate number of reference sites to capture natural variability among sites without moving so far from the potentially affected site to confound the comparison with natural latitudinal and offshore gradients; (2) the thickness of depth slices for comparing profiles between reference and potentially affected sites that minimizes false positives from natural vertical variability while not being so large as to average out plume-caused deviations; and (3) an allowable difference from the reference mean associated with variability among reference profiles. The algorithm was based on maximizing the chance of detecting DO outranges in the effluent plume, while simultaneously minimizing the chance to falsely identify outranges at reference sites outside of the plume zone. The assessment methodology also differentiates DO outranges resulting from physical upward entrainment of deep, low-oxygen water by rising of lower density plume water, as opposed to outranges resulting from low-oxygen and oxygen demanding properties of the effluent, using temperature-oxygen relationships as a tracer of water masses. When the algorithm was applied to a ten year monitoring record from four discharge monitoring programs along the southern California coast, 11% of effluent sites were found to contain DO outranges, with about half of them resulting from deep water entrainment.

AB Manufactures of automotive parts are struggling to secure redundancy in various ways. An alternative is to configure the system via a dual-winding motor and two electronic control units (ECUs). The dual-winding motor contains different winding arrangements according to poles/slots, and when only one of the two circuits is used owing to a failure, the electrical and mechanical characteristics differ depending on the winding arrangement. In this study, the electrical and mechanical characteristics were analyzed and compared according to the winding arrangement when the failure occurs. In particular, the winding arrangement of the motor is divided into line symmetry, point symmetry, and alternating symmetry. For each winding arrangement, the back-electromotive force, torque, and torque ripple were compared and analyzed through simulation and test. Also, vibration caused by electromagnetic force was analyzed. Here, to consider the tooth modulation effect, concentrated force was investigated and tangential force as well as radial force were considered. Additionally, the thermal characteristics were analyzed during fault operation using a lumped parameter thermal network with piecewise stator-housing modules. Lastly, the mechanical design characteristics of the motor hardware size that need to be changed according to the winding arrangement of the brake motor are explained. This study provides guidelines for the winding arrangement selection of a dual-winding motor with a similar magnetic field distribution suitable for the design purpose, by analyzing the electromechanical characteristics and size according to the winding arrangement during fault operation. The characteristics of other motor types or pole and slot number combinations can also be inferred from the results of this study, since the magnetic flux density distribution will be determined with line, point and alternating symmetry.

AB With its superiorities of low cost, high flexibility and deployment convenience, small-size autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been extensively applied to perform a variety of undersea missions. While underwater acoustic (UWA) communication provides a practical way to establish a wireless link, it still poses a significant challenge due to the strict limitations of a small-size AUV platform in terms of load capacity, energy supply and cost. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has drawn extensive attention due to its high data rate capability and relative robustness to multipath, the performance of which is unfortunately sensitive to the widespread Doppler effect. While efficient Doppler compensation is significantly crucial for UWA OFDM mobile communication, most of the conventional approaches are conducted using software resampling, thus rendering a huge burden on memory and calculation capability as well as a considerable processing delay. In this paper, from the perspective of hardware completion an UWA OFDM communication payload based on STM32F407 processor is designed and implemented to facilitate agile Doppler compensation with low computational overhead. In particular, after estimating Doppler by calculating the time compression or extension of the preamble signal, Doppler compensation is performed by directly adjusting the direct digital frequency synthesizer (DDS)-driven sampling rate of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). As the Doppler is compensated parallel to the ADC acquisition, processing delay and memory requirement can be avoided. Finally, hardware-in-loop (HIP) simulation is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system. The results show that the designed system has the potential to achieve an effective communication rate of 3.19 kbps with the admissible implementation overhead. Future work will entail the integration and performance evaluation of the proposed UWA OFDM communication payload on a practical small-size AUV platform.

AB With the continuous growth of the population, with the expansion of the urban area. Human activities and behavior are depleting limited resources, a large number of these private vehicles occupy our roads, it also causes various environmental problems. With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, the way of green travel has gradually become the way of travel advocated by people who living in the metropolis. Convenience and environmental protection are a major advantage of public transport, but unfortunately, the functions, services and environment of many bus stops are not convenient and friendly; Therefore, the smart bus stop was born, it can not only provide real-time bus information, but also provide a safe and comfortable waiting space. However, with the upgrading of service functions, the problem of energy consumption has become increasingly prominent. Powering through solar panels can naturally provide a sustainable energy source for smart bus stops, but many studies have found that solar panels themselves are not environmentally friendly, regardless of their materials and recyclability. The author's investigation found that relevant studies have confirmed that spraying an aqueous solution containing carbon nanotubes or graphene on mulberry leaves for feeding silkworms doubles the toughness of the silk spit, and the conductivity of carbonized silk is 10 times higher. In addition, the robotic fiber spinning technology will allow silkworms to independently complete the production of silk objects without killing the silkworms. Through the research on graphene silk materials and robotic fiber spinning technology, this paper proposes a biologically autonomous solution to the production of graphene silk thin-film solar panels, so as to seek to solve the pollution problem of solar panels in the smart stop.

AB Over the past years, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been utilized for the Internet of Things (IoT) in applications such as remote assistance based on augmented reality (AR) in smart factories, as well as powerline inspection and precision agriculture missions performed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to the limited battery capacity and computing power of these devices (e.g., AR glasses and UAVs), edge computing is recognized as a means to empower the Internet of Things (IoT) with AI. Considering that multiple AI model inference tasks (e.g., point cloud classification and fault detection) are typically performed on the same stream of sensory data (e.g., UAV camera feed), we propose TORC (Tasks-Oriented Edge Computing) to reduce the bandwidth requirement. By incorporating AI into data transmission, the lightweight framework of TORC preserves edge computing servers' ability to reconstruct/restore data into the original form, ensuring the proper coexistence of AI inference tasks and traditional non-AI tasks like human inspection, as well as simultaneous localization and mapping. It encodes and decodes sensory data with neural networks, whose training is driven by the AI inference tasks, in order to reduce bandwidth consumption and latency without impairing the accuracy of the AI inference tasks. Additionally, taking into account the mobility of the IoT and changes in the environment, TORC can adapt to variation in the bandwidth budget, as well as the temporally dynamic importance of AI inference tasks, without the need to train multiple neural networks for each setting. As a demonstration, empirical results conducted on the Cityscapes dataset and tasks related to autonomous driving show that, at the same level of accuracy, TORC reduces the bandwidth consumption by up to 48% and latency by up to 26%.

AB Wireless powered edge computing system (WPECS) enhances the computing power and extends the lifetime of wireless devices (WDs). This paper studies the WPECS with multiple WDs, in which the access point (AP) provides some transmission channels which differ from each other in the channel gain, and the WD powered through the wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has some indivisible tasks and adopts binary task-offloading actions. More energy harvested strengthens the WDs with more computing power, while corresponding to more energy consumption. Therefore, how to make the optimal tradeoff between computation rate and energy harvested arises as an interesting issue. To address this issue, this paper first formulates the switch process of transmission channel as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and then proposed an effective algorithm to maximize the sum of computation rates of all WDs in terms of task data bits computed, within the required level of accumulative energy harvested. Theoretical analysis, simulations and field experiments jointly document and illustrate its performance. Note to Practitioners-This paper addresses the interesting tradeoff between computation rate and energy harvested in a wireless powered edge computing system that operates in the environments with limited available energy. It helps to improve the operation efficiency of the edge computing systems in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) or Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that employ wireless power transfer technology to power the wireless devices through the access point over the air to maximize the sum of computations rates of all WDs in terms of task data bits computed, while keeping the accumulative energy harvested within a range. Simulations and experimental investigations show that the solution proposed here outperforms existing solutions.

AB Sea turtles complete migrations across vast distances, covering entire ocean basins. To track these migrations, satellite tracking tags are attached to their shells. The impact of these tags must be considered to ensure that turtles' natural behavior is not artificially and adversely impacted through tag-related drag, and that the data collected by a small sample of sea turtles accurately represents the larger population. Additionally, it can be difficult to study animal energetics in the field over large migration distances. In this work, we modify a computational behavior model to study how satellite tracking tags affect turtle migration behavior. Our agent based model contains synthetic magnetic field environments that are used for navigation cues, an ocean current, resource distributions that represent locations of food, and an agent that attempts to migrate to several different goals. The agent loses energy as it progresses, and searches for the resource distributions to replenish itself. Our novel simulation framework demonstrates the relationship between an agent's available energy capacity, its energy consumption based on mechanical power expended, and its ability to navigate to all migratory goal points. This study can be utilized to (1) probe the impacts of an animal's energy capacity and foraging behavior on its resulting navigation and ecology, (2) guide future satellite tag designs, and (3) develop usage recommendations for a suitable tracking tag based on the type of experiment being conducted. Our model can be expanded beyond sea turtles to study other marine species (e.g., sharks, whales). Additionally, this model could be expanded to other domains within the marine environment. For example, it could be modified to examine design trade-offs in remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), which share many of the same operational constraints as sea turtles and other migratory species.

AB Conventional Internet of Things (IoT) applications involve data capture from various sensors in environments, and the captured data then is processed in remote clouds. However, some critical IoT applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles) require a much lower response latency and more secure guarantees than those offered by remote clouds today. Mobile edge clouds (MEC) supported by the network function virtualization (NFV) technique have been envisioned as an ideal platform for supporting such IoT applications. Specifically, MECs enable to handle IoT applications in edge networks to shorten network latency, and NFV enables agile and low-cost network functions to run in low-cost commodity servers as virtual machines (VMs). One fundamental problem for the provisioning of IoT applications in an NFV-enabled MEC is where to place virtualized network functions (VNFs) for IoT applications in the MEC, such that the operational cost of provisioning IoT applications is minimized. In this paper, we first address this fundamental problem, by considering a special case of the IoT application placement problem, where the IoT application and VNFs of each service request are consolidated into a single location (gateway or cloudlet), for which we propose an exact solution and an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio. We then develop a heuristic algorithm that controls the resource violation ratios of edge clouds in the network. For the IoT application placement problem for IoT applications where their VNFs can be placed to multiple locations, we propose an efficient heuristic that jointly places the IoT application and its VNFs. We finally study the performance of the proposed algorithms by simulations and implementations in a real test-bed, Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms outperform their counterparts by at least 10 percent.

TI Deep Reinforcement Learning for Drone Delivery
SO DRONES

DT Article

AB Drones are expected to be used extensively for delivery tasks in the future. In the absence of obstacles, satellite based navigation from departure to the geo-located destination is a simple task. When obstacles are known to be in the path, pilots must build a flight plan to avoid them. However, when they are unknown, there are too many or they are in places that are not fixed positions, then to build a safe flight plan becomes very challenging. Moreover, in a weak satellite signal environment, such as indoors, under trees canopy or in urban canyons, the current drone navigation systems may fail. Artificial intelligence, a research area with increasing activity, can be used to overcome such challenges. Initially focused on robots and now mostly applied to ground vehicles, artificial intelligence begins to be used also to train drones. Reinforcement learning is the branch of artificial intelligence able to train machines. The application of reinforcement learning to drones will provide them with more intelligence, eventually converting drones in fully-autonomous machines. In this work, reinforcement learning is studied for drone delivery. As sensors, the drone only has a stereo-vision front camera, from which depth information is obtained. The drone is trained to fly to a destination in a neighborhood environment that has plenty of obstacles such as trees, cables, cars and houses. The flying area is also delimited by a geo-fence; this is a virtual (non-visible) fence that prevents the drone from entering or leaving a defined area. The drone has to avoid visible obstacles and has to reach a goal. Results show that, in comparison with the previous results, the new algorithms have better results, not only with a better reward, but also with a reduction of its variance. The second contribution is the checkpoints. They consist of saving a trained model every time a better reward is achieved. Results show how checkpoints improve the test results.

AB It is necessary for autonomous robotics in agriculture to provide real time feedback, but due to a diverse array of objects and lack of landscape uniformity this objective is inherently complex. The current study presents two implementations of the multiple-expert colour feature extreme learning machine (MEC-ELM). The MEC-ELM is a cascading algorithm that has been implemented along side a summed area table (SAT) for fast feature extraction and object classification, for a fully functioning object detection algorithm. The MEC-ELM is an implementation of the colour feature extreme learning machine (CF-ELM), which is an extreme learning machine (ELM) with a partially connected hidden layer; taking three colour bands as inputs. The colour implementation used with the SAT enable the MEC-ELM to find and classify objects quickly, with 84% precision and 91% recall in weed detection in the Y'UV colour space and in 0.5 s per frame. The colour implementation is however limited to low resolution images and for this reason a colour level co-occurrence matrix (CLCM) variant of the MEC-ELM is proposed. This variant uses the SAT to produce a CLCM and texture analyses, with texture values processed as an input to the MEC-ELM. This enabled the MEC-ELM to achieve 78-85% precision and 81-93% recall in cattle, weed and quad bike detection and in times between 1 and 2 s per frame. Both implementations were benchmarked on a standard i7 mobile processor. Thus the results presented in this paper demonstrated that the MEC-ELM with SAT grid and CLCM makes an ideal candidate for fast object detection in complex and/or agricultural landscapes.

AB In the absence of any direct observations of an active submarine eruption at a mid-ocean ridge (MOR), our understanding of volcanic processes there is based on the interpretation of eruptive products. Submarine lava flow morphology serves as a primary indicator of eruption and emplacement processes; however, there is typically a lack of visual observations and bathymetric data at a scale and extent relevant to submarine lava flows, which display meter to submeter-scale morphological variability. In this paper, we merge submersible-based visual observations with high-resolution multibeam bathymetry collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and examine the fine-scale geomorphology of Ninos, a submarine lava flow field at the Galapagos Spreading Center (GSC).We identify separate morphological facies (i.e., morphofacies) within the lava flow field, each having distinct patterns of lava flow morphology and volcanic structures. The spatial and stratigraphic arrangement of morphofacies suggests that they were emplaced sequentially as the eruption progressed, implying that the Ninos eruption consisted of at least three eruptive phases. We estimate eruption parameters and develop a chronological model that describes the construction of the Ninos lava flow field. An initial phase with high effusion rates emplaced sheet flows, then an intermediate phase emplaced a platform of lobate lavas, and then an extended final phase with low effusion rates emplaced a discontinuous row of pillow lava domes. We then compare this model to mapped lava flow fields at other MORs. Despite disparities in scale, the morphological similarities of volcanic features at MORs with different spreading rates suggest common emplacement processes that are primarily controlled by local magma supply.

AB This paper presents an empirical study of a spark-ignition internal combustion engine with modifications made to increase its effectiveness. The modification was implemented bi-directionally in terms of changes to the compression ratio and changes to the engine's valve train. The compression ratio was increased by 2.3 units by design and a hybrid intake valve opening control was used in the engine's valve train. The hybrid control involved autonomous control of one of the inlet valves with a dedicated electromagnetic actuator. The designed electromagnetic actuator was mounted downstream of the single-cylinder engine's intake system's modified camshaft to control the effective compression pressure build-up. Field calculations were carried out for the electromagnetic actuator's design variants and its current characteristics were determined. The multivariate calculations were carried out in order to find the quasi-optimal geometry of the actuator. The width and height of magnetic field coils and the dimensions of the stator poles were changed, while maintaining the same external dimensions of the actuator to enable its mounting in the cylinder head system. In the next step, the prototype of the actuator was made and placed on the combustion engine in order to conduct the experimental investigations. The work was aimed at improving the internal combustion engine's efficiency at the low load range, as this is load range in which it has low efficiency despite it being the most often used during normal vehicle operation. The original measurement stand was prepared, and many tests were carried out in order to investigate the influence of the electromagnetic valve on the combustion engine characteristic. This improved the internal combustion engine's efficiency at its low-load range by up to 25%. Both calculation and measurement results are presented in form of graphs.

AB To reveal the profound impact of dispatching strategy and route of autonomous mobile robot (AMR) on scheduling in the flexible job shop with AMRs, this study presents the bi-level programming model for integrated scheduling with machines and AMRs (ISMV), subdividing distributed shared dispatching strategy (DSDS) and following dispatching strategy (FDS) for AMRs. The integrated scheduling model is developed at the upper level with the objective of minimizing the makespan, and the AMR conflict-free route planning (CFRP) model is formulated at the lower level to minimize travel time. To solve the model, a novel algorithmic framework (SLGA-D) composed of the self-learning genetic algorithm (SLGA) and Dijkstra with time window (DijkstraTW) is designed. The SLGA is formed by embedding the Q-learning into genetic algorithm to intelligently adjust crossover probability and mutation probability. Several experiments are implemented to validate the SLGA-D and the model proposed in this study. The results of experiments prove that reinforcement learning mechanism within Q-learning successfully enhances the global search ability of the algorithm, and production scheduling and distribution route are optimized synergistically by the model. Sensitivity analyses reveal that, as the number of AMRs rises, the makespan tends to stabilize after decreasing rapidly to a threshold value. Once the number of AMRs exceeds a certain threshold ( w = 5 in this study), it is not significant to shorten the makespan by continuing to invest AMRs. When the number of production tasks to be processed does not exceed the number of AMRs, following dispatching strategy of AMR is more favorable; conversely, distributed shared dispatching strategy is superior. The results provide guideline and inspiration for managers who are committed to manufacturing schedule and control.

AB This paper outlines some of the challenges and opportunities facing the space biomedical community and how CubeSats may (and indeed already are) supporting this research area. A review of current space and microgravity platforms capable of supporting biomedical research is presented alongside a summary of the vital research that this enables. This paper presents biomedical CubeSat enabling technology alongside the critical technology gaps is given, alongside analysis of relevant logistical and bureaucratic factors in the space sector. An overview of the general design requirements for biomedical CubeSat missions is presented to help support potential new developers, alongside a small review of some of the technology gaps and innovations that are present and of importance to the sector's maturity. Finally, we demonstrate that CubeSats do have the potential to become a mature and high-fidelity niche in the NewSpace infrastructure, that could support professionally-credible space biomedical research, complementing traditional platforms such as crewed vehicles, autonomous biosatellites and free-flyers. Biomedical CubeSats have been validated through a well-documented programme of NASA missions, as well as successful flights from at least one commercial company to date, and now these trail-blazers are being followed by a new "mini-space race" among Universities and other groups. This report aims to review the status and estimate in which scenarios a biomedical CubeSat mission would provide cost-effective, worthwhile science return, versus (arguably) the most common current route to space for biomedical payloads - the ISS. It aims to act as a primer and provide information for potential mission planners or scientists that are newer to the space sector and want a ground-up analysis of some of the routes to space. Importantly, this paper compares the biomedical CubeSat versus a payload hosted on a platform like the ISS, and not any of the other high-profile, and potentially very popular, current or developing platforms that are only briefly referenced.

AB When talking about automation, "autonomous vehicles", often abbreviated as AVs, come to mind. In transitioning from the "driver" mode to the different automation levels, there is an inevitable need for modeling driving behavior. This often happens through data collection from experiments and studies, but also information extraction, a key step in behavioral modeling. Particularly, naturalistic driving studies and field operational trials are used to collect meaningful data on drivers' interactions in real-world conditions. On the other hand, information extraction methods allow to predict or mimic driving behavior, by using a set of statistical learning methods. In simple words, the way to understand drivers' needs and wants in the era of automation can be represented in a data-information cycle, starting from data collection, and ending with information extraction. To develop this cycle, this research reviews studies with keywords "data collection", "information extraction", "AVs", while keeping the focus on driving behavior. The resulting review led to a screening of about 161 papers, out of which about 30 were selected for a detailed analysis. The analysis included an investigation of the methods and equipment used for data collection, the features collected, the size and frequency of the data along with the main problems associated with the different sensory equipment; the studies also looked at the models used to extract information, including various statistical techniques used in AV studies. This paved the way to the development of a framework for data analytics and fusion, allowing the use of highly heterogeneous data to reach the defined objectives; for this paper, the example of impacts of AVs on a network level and AV acceptance is given. The authors suggest that such a framework could be extended and transferred across the various transportation sectors.

TI LIO-CSI: LiDAR inertial odometry with loop closure combined with
   semantic information
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Accurate and reliable state estimation and mapping are the foundation of most autonomous driving systems. In recent years, researchers have focused on pose estimation through geometric feature matching. However, most of the works in the literature assume a static scenario. Moreover, a registration based on a geometric feature is vulnerable to the interference of a dynamic object, resulting in a decline of accuracy. With the development of a deep semantic segmentation network, we can conveniently obtain the semantic information from the point cloud in addition to geometric information. Semantic features can be used as an accessory to geometric features that can improve the performance of odometry and loop closure detection. In a more realistic environment, semantic information can filter out dynamic objects in the data, such as pedestrians and vehicles, which lead to information redundancy in generated map and map-based localization failure. In this paper, we propose a method called LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) with loop closure combined with semantic information (LIO-CSI), which integrates semantic information to facilitate the front-end process as well as loop closure detection. First, we made a local optimization on the semantic labels provided by the Sparse Point-Voxel Neural Architecture Search (SPVNAS) network. The optimized semantic information is combined into the front-end process of tightly-coupled light detection and ranging (LiDAR) inertial odometry via smoothing and mapping (LIO-SAM), which allows us to filter dynamic objects and improve the accuracy of the point cloud registration. Then, we proposed a semantic assisted scan-context method to improve the accuracy and robustness of loop closure detection. The experiments were conducted on an extensively used dataset KITTI and a self-collected dataset on the Jilin University (JLU) campus. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is better than the purely geometric method, especially in dynamic scenarios, and it has a good generalization ability.

DE map definition; cartography theory; navigation application; LBS; HD maps
AB In the face of strikingly intense technological development, there have been significant discrepancies in the understanding of the concept of the map; an understanding that is fundamental to cartography and, more broadly, GIScience. The development of electronic products based on geoinformation has caused a growing need for the systematization of basic concepts, including defining what a map is. In particular, the modification of the idea of the map may profoundly influence the future development of cartography. The comprehensive and innovative use of maps, for example, in location-based service (LBS) applications, may contribute to more in-depth analyses in this area. This article examines how the concept of how the map is used in technological or scientific literature about the latest geoinformation applications, as well as analyzing the survey results that confirm the change in social perception of the concept of the map in cartography. The article also refers to the role of the map in the process of indirect cognition and understanding of geographical space-cognition realized through maps. A social understanding of mapping concepts is evolving and covers the entire spectrum of geoinformation products. It seems that the latest geoinformation solutions, such as navigation applications and, in particular, applications supporting the movement of autonomous vehicles (e.g., self-driving cars), have had a particular impact on the concept of the map. This is confirmed by the results of a survey conducted by the authors on a group of nearly 900 respondents from a variety of countries. The vast majority of users are convinced that the contemporary understanding of the concept of the map is a long way from the classic definition of this concept. Therefore, in the opinion of the authors of this article, it is worth undertaking research that will become a starting point for a discussion about the broader definition of the map in GIScience.

AB Owing to small size, sensing capabilities and autonomous nature, the Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have enormous applications in various areas e.g., remote sensing, navigation, archaeology, journalism, environmental science, and agriculture. However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM.

AB The fate of inflows into lakes has been extensively studied during summer stratification but has seen relatively little focus during the weak winter stratification, with or without ice-cover. Field observations are presented of groundwater inflow into a shallow bay of a subarctic lake. Atmospheric forcing of the bay during the study period was extremely variable and coincided with spring ice-cover break-up. Two dominant wind regimes were identified; (1) weak wind-forcing (wind speed <5 m s(-1) or land-fast ice-cover), and (2) strong wind-forcing (wind speed >5 m s(-1) and open water). At a relatively constant temperature of similar to 3.3 degrees C, the groundwater inflow was closer to the temperature of maximum density than the water in the main body of the lake, which during the observed winter stratification is similar to 1.2 degrees C. During weak wind-forcing, the stratification within Silfra Bay approximated two-layers as this denser groundwater formed a negatively buoyant underflow. A calculated underflow entrainment rate of 2.8 x 10(-3) agrees well with other underflow studies. During strong wind-forcing, the water column out to the mouth of the bay became weakly stratified as the underflow was entrained vertically by wind-stirring. Observed periods of mixing can be predicted to occur when turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production by wind stirring integrated over the underflow hydraulic residence time in the bay exceeds the potential energy associated with the stratification. A decrease of ice cover, as observed in the studied subarctic lake over the last decade, will result in the underflow being more frequently exposed to the strong wind-forcing regime during winter, thereby altering the winter distribution of groundwater inflow within the lake.

TI Investigation of THUNDER™ actuators as underwater propulsors
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Piezoelectric actuators have been used for active vibration control, noise suppression, health monitoring, etc. The large appeal in using smart material actuators stems from their high mechanical energy density. A relatively new actuator Thin Layer Composite Unimorph Ferroelectric Driver and Sensor (THUNDER) has overcome the displacement hurdles that have plagued traditional piezoelectric based actuators. It is capable of providing a displacement of the order of 0.5 cm. This allows the actuator to be used in some underwater applications, such as propulsion. To date the electrical power consumption and electromechanical efficiency of these actuators has not been quantified; specifically, applied as underwater propulsors. Some of the challenges in obtaining this information stems from the actuator's nontraditional actuating architecture, high voltage requirements, and its electrical nonlinearity. This work experimentally determines the mechanical displacement and the electrical power consumption of the THUNDER actuators used as underwater propulsors. An estimate of a lower bound of the thrust that can be generated by the clamshell actuator is obtained. It is found that the actuator has a peak flow rate of approximately 1500 cm(3)/s and can generate a peak thrust greater than approximately 4.5 N. This preliminary analysis neglected the pressure forces acting on the actuator and therefore, the actual thrust is not computed. It is found that the average electrical power consumed by two THUNDER actuators placed in a clamshell configuration operating at similar to14 Hz is approximately 8 W, which is significantly less than that consumed by other autonomous underwater vehicles. The displacement response and the current draw of the actuators are determined to be nonlinear. The result of this work indicates that the use of THUNDER actuators has great potential to create an underwater propulsor that has low power consumption, can operate at great depths, and eliminates the need for seals, bearings and a propeller.

AB Modeling and simulation of telecommunication networks have captivated significant interdisciplinary attention, notably since the release of the fifth-generation (5G) technology and the heavy public interest associated with its Non-Standalone (NSA) and eventual Standalone (SA) architecture deployment. However, 5G and beyond (5G+) network simulation is rather challenging as the complexity of networks has massively multiplied, given the manifold network intricacies demanded by stringent 5G requirements like mobile mmWave, Massive Multiple Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), Advanced Channel Coding, and more. Furthermore, the arrival of 5G marks a turning point in the evolution of mobile networks as it progresses towards the softwarization of networks and paves the path for future Artificial Intelligence (AI) native 6G and beyond networks. Consequently, classical simulation techniques have a high risk of becoming insufficient to model the demands of such drastically changing network dynamics, prompting researchers to view 5G+ networks from the perspective of Complex System Science (CSS). We move in that direction as we shed light on Agent-based modeling and simulation as a pragmatic and powerful tool to model 5G+ communication networks. Our approach involves a comprehensive survey of Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) and 5G+ networks, utilizing its insights to dissect the advantages, potential, and challenges of ABS in the context of 5G+ networks. Through proposing a prospective architecture for a simulator and its envisioned evolution into a Digital Twin (DT), we not only offer insights into the lessons learned but also chart out future research pathways in the flourishing domain of 5G+ modeling and simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that tackles the complexities of modeling and simulating 5G+ networks, by adopting an ABS approach.

AB Unmanned clusters can realize collaborative work, flexible configuration, and efficient operation, which has become an important development trend of unmanned platforms. Cluster positioning is important for ensuring the normal operation of unmanned clusters. The existing solutions have some problems such as requiring external system assistance, high system complexity, poor architecture scalability, and accumulation of positioning errors over time. Without the aid of the information outside the cluster, we plan to construct the relative position relationship with north alignment to adopt formation control and achieve robust cluster relative positioning. Based on the idea of bionics, this paper proposes a cluster robust hierarchical positioning architecture by analyzing the autonomous behavior of pigeon flocks. We divide the clusters into follower clusters, core clusters, and leader nodes, which can realize flexible networking and cluster expansion. Aiming at the core cluster that is the most critical to relative positioning in the architecture, we propose a cluster relative positioning algorithm based on spatiotemporal correlation information. With the design idea of low cost and large-scale application, the algorithm uses intra-cluster ranging and the inertial navigation motion vector to construct the positioning equation and solves it through the Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Multiple Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithms. The cluster formation is abstracted as a mixed direction-distance graph and the graph rigidity theory is used to analyze localizability conditions of the algorithm. We designed the cluster positioning simulation software and conducted localizability tests and positioning accuracy tests in different scenarios. Compared with the relative positioning algorithm based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the algorithm proposed in this paper has more relaxed positioning conditions and can adapt to a variety of scenarios. It also has higher relative positioning accuracy, and the error does not accumulate over time.

AB Through the continuous development of intellectualization, considering the lifecycle of ships, the future of a waterborne traffic system is bound to be a mixed scenario where intelligent ships of different autonomy levels co-exist, i.e., mixed waterborne traffic. According to the three modules of ships' perception, decision-making, and execution, the roles of humans and machines under different autonomy levels are analyzed. This paper analyzes and summarizes the intelligent algorithms related to the three modules proposed in the last five years. Starting from the characteristics of the algorithms, the behavior characteristics of ships with different autonomous levels are analyzed. The results show that in terms of information perception, relying on the information perception techniques and risk analysis methods, the ship situation can be judged, and the collision risk is evaluated. The risk can be expressed in two forms, being graphical and numerical. The graphical images intuitively present the risk level, while the numerical results are easier to apply into the control link of ships. In the future, it could be considered to establish a risk perception system with digital and visual integration, which will be more efficient and accurate in risk identification. With respect to intelligent decision-making, currently, unmanned ships mostly use intelligent algorithms to make decisions and tend to achieve both safe and efficient collision avoidance goals in a high-complexity manner. Finally, regarding execution, the advanced power control devices could improve the ship's maneuverability, and the motion control algorithms help to achieve the real-time control of the ship's motion state, so as to further improve the speed and accuracy of ship motion control. With the upgrading of the autonomy level, the ship's behavior develops in a safer, more efficient, and more environment-friendly manner.

AB This paper proposes a novel method for synchronizing a high frame-rate (HFR) camera with an HFR projector, using a visual feedback-based synchronization algorithm for streaming video sequences in real time on a visible-light communication (VLC)-based system. The frame rates of the camera and projector are equal, and their phases are synchronized. A visual feedback-based synchronization algorithm is used to mitigate the complexities and stabilization issues of wire-based triggering for long-distance systems. The HFR projector projects a binary pattern modulated at 3000 fps. The HFR camera system operates at 3000 fps, which can capture and generate a delay signal to be given to the next camera clock cycle so that it matches the phase of the HFR projector. To test the synchronization performance, we used an HFR projector-camera-based VLC system in which the proposed synchronization algorithm provides maximum bandwidth utilization for the high-throughput transmission ability of the system and reduces data redundancy efficiently. The transmitter of the VLC system encodes the input video sequence into gray code, which is projected via high-definition multimedia interface streaming in the form of binary images 590 x 1060. At the receiver, a monochrome HFR camera can simultaneously capture and decode 12-bit 512 x 512 images in real time and reconstruct a color video sequence at 60 fps. The efficiency of the visual feedback-based synchronization algorithm is evaluated by streaming offline and live video sequences, using a VLC system with single and dual projectors, providing a multiple-projector-based system. The results show that the 3000 fps camera was successfully synchronized with a 3000 fps single-projector and a 1500 fps dual-projector system. It was confirmed that the synchronization algorithm can also be applied to VLC systems, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance applications.

AB Due to challenges involved in mapping the seafloor at high-resolution (e.g., <2 m), data are lacking to understand processes that control the evolution of submarine normal fault scarps, which cover large parts of the global seafloor. Here, we use data from autonomous deep-sea vehicles to quantify local erosion and deposition associated with a pronounced tectonic surface scarp formed by slip on the submarine Roseau normal fault (Lesser Antilles). We use high-resolution video imagery, photomosaics, and high-resolution bathymetric data (0.1-10 m/pixel) to identify active erosional features on the scarp including channels, steep gullies, small scarps, and debris cones. We compare volumes of erosion and deposition and find that under certain depositional conditions, debris cones effectively record the erosion signal of mass wasting from the footwall with a ratio of hanging wall deposition to footwall erosion of 0.80. We use eroded volumes to estimate earthquake-induced landslide erosion rates for the Roseau fault of 14-46 m Myr(-1). Assuming mass wasting of the Roseau fault scarp is mostly coseismic, the erosion rates for the Roseau fault imply that submarine earthquake induced mass-wasting can occur at similar rates to various terrestrial lithological and tectonic settings. We present a process-based model of submarine scarp degradation via retrogressive erosion in basement lithology where scarps have a gravitational stability threshold height of 20-40 m and a long-term average slope of 30 degrees-40 degrees. More generally, the results presented here may be applicable to develop models of submarine landscape evolution based on degradation of normal fault scarps on the seafloor.

AB Bathymetric gradients in the deep sea are known to affect key benthic community characteristics such as diversity. However, most studies investigate large-scale bathymetric variation, while habitat heterogeneity related to modest bathymetric variation has generally been overlooked because of limitations to sampling technology. We investigate the role of modest bathymetric variation (similar to 10 m water depth intervals) on an abyssal hill, and horizontal variation at the 0.1-10 km scale, in the structuring of abyssal megafaunal assemblages. We assess numerical density, biomass density, diversity, and assemblage composition using seabed photographs captured with an autonomous underwater vehicle and sediment characteristics determined from cores. We detect significant differences in sediment particle size and organic carbon content, in relation to modest topographic elevation, with a greater fraction of fine particles and organic carbon on the abyssal plain than the hill. Total megafaunal numerical and biomass density, diversity, and the numerical densities of feeding groups were significantly different with modest topographic elevation; similarly, megafaunal composition varied significantly between similar to 10 m depth intervals. In relation to mesoscale horizontal variation, we also record significant differences between megabenthic communities in two abyssal plain areas with no significant differences in measured sedimentary characteristics and only a 2 m difference in water depth. Differences in these communities were detected in terms of dominance, assemblage composition by density and biomass, and numerical densities of feeding groups. These observations strongly indicate that previous general concepts of the abyssal environment greatly underestimate this mesoscale heterogeneity, such that beta- and gamma-diversity in the abyss may be higher than estimated. Importantly, these results also have clear implications for the design and interpretation of environmental survey and monitoring programmes in the abyss.

AB Autonomous underwater gliders with customized sensors were deployed in October 2011 on the central West Florida Shelf to measure a Karenia brevis bloom, which was captured in satellite imagery since late September 2011. Combined with in situ taxonomy data, satellite measurements, and numerical circulation models, the glider measurements provided information on the three-dimensional structure of the bloom. Temperature, salinity, fluorescence of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and chlorophyll-a, particulate backscattering coefficient, and K. brevis-specific chlorophyll-a concentrations were measured by the gliders over >250 km from the surface to about 30-m water depth on the shallow shelf. At the time of sampling the bloom was characterized by uniform vertical structures, with relatively high chlorophyll-a and CDOM fluorescence, low temperature, and high salinity. Satellite data extracted along the glider tracks demonstrated coherent spatial variations as observed by the gliders. Further, the synoptic satellite observations revealed the bloom evolution during the 7 months between late September 2011 and mid April 2012, and showed the maximum bloom size of similar to 3000 km(2) around 23 November. The combined satellite and in situ data also confirmed that the ratio of satellite-derived fluorescence line height (FLH) to particulate backscattering coefficient at 547 nm (b(bp)(547)) could be used as a better index than FLH alone to detect K. brevis blooms. Numerical circulation models further suggested that the bloom could have been initiated offshore and advected onshore via the bottom Ekman layer. The case study here demonstrates the unique value of an integrated coastal ocean observing system in studying harmful algal blooms (HABs). (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Alaska Ocean Observing System and the Oil Spill Recovery Institute developed a demonstration project over a 5 year period in Prince William Sound. The primary goal was to develop a quasi-operational system that delivers weather and ocean information in near real time to diverse user communities. This observing system now consists of atmospheric and oceanic sensors, and a new generation of computer models to numerically simulate and forecast weather, waves, and ocean circulation. A state of the art data management system provides access to these products from one Internet portal at http://www.aoos.org. The project culminated in a 2009 field experiment that evaluated the observing system and performance of the model forecasts. Observations from terrestrial weather stations and weather buoys validated atmospheric circulation forecasts. Observations from wave gages on weather buoys validated forecasts of significant wave heights and periods. There was an emphasis on validation of surface currents forecasted by the ocean circulation model for oil spill response and search and rescue applications. During the 18 day field experiment a radar array mapped surface currents and drifting buoys were deployed. Hydrographic profiles at fixed stations, and by autonomous vehicles along transects, were made to acquire measurements through the water column. Terrestrial weather stations were the most reliable and least costly to operate, and in situ ocean sensors were more costly and considerably less reliable. The radar surface current mappers were the least reliable and most costly but provided the assimilation and validation data that most improved ocean circulation forecasts. We describe the setting of Prince William Sound and the various observational platforms and forecast models of the observing system, and discuss recommendations for future development.

AB Study Objectives: Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is the major activator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system and orchestrates the neuroendocrine, autonomous as well as behavioral responses to stress. Many studies suggest an influence of CRH on sleep-wake regulation even in the absence of stressors. However, none of these studies yet clearly distinguished between central and peripheral effects of CRH. Therefore, we investigated in CNS-specific CRH receptor type 1 deficient mice whether centrally administered CRH could induce its sleep-wake modulatory effects without peripheral induction of HPA activity.
   Design: Male mice (C57BL/6J, CNS-specific CRH-R1 knockout [CKO] mice and their control littermates [CL]) were intracerebroventricularily (i.c.v.) injected with vehicle or 3 different doses of CRH shortly before the beginning of the light period. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) were monitored to compare the effects of CRH on vigilance states with or without presence of central CRH-R1. To quantify HPA-axis reactivity to CRH injections in CKO and CL animals, blood samples were analyzed to determine plasma corticosterone concentrations.
   Results: I.c.v, injections of CRH promoted wakefulness while decreasing NREMS in C57BL/6J and CRH-R1 CL animals, whereas such changes were not exerted in CKO mice. However, REMS suppression after CRH application persisted in all animals. I.c.v. injected CRH increased plasma corticosterone levels in both CL and CKO mice.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrated that CRH has a major impact on wake and NREMS regulation which is predominantly mediated through central CRH-R1. Peripheral actions of CRH, i.e., elevated HPA activity, may interfere with its central effects on REMS but not on NREMS suppression.

TI CONTROL OF PERCEPTUAL ATTENTION IN ROBOT DRIVING
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEARCH
AB Computer vision research aimed at performing general scene understanding has proven to be conceptually difficult and computationally complex. Active vision is a promising approach to solving this problem. Active vision systems use optimized sensor settings, reduced fields of view, and relatively simple algorithms to efficiently extract specific information from a scene. This approach is only appropriate in the context of a task that motivates the selection of the information to extract. While there has been a fair amount of research that describes the extraction processes, there has been little work that investigates how active vision could be used for a realistic task in a dynamic domain. We are studying such a task: driving an autonomous vehicle in traffic.
   In this paper we present a method for controlling visual attention as part of the reasoning process for driving, and analyze the efficiency gained in doing so. We first describe a model of driving and the driving environment, and estimate the complexity of performing the required sensing with a general driving-scene understanding system. We then introduce three programs that use increasingly sophisticated perceptual control techniques to select perceptual actions. The first program, called Ulysses-1, uses perceptual routines, which use known reference objects to guide the search for new objects. The second program, Ulysses-2, creates an inference tree to infer the effect of uncertain input data on action choices, and searches this tree to decide which data to sense. Finally, Ulysses-3 uses domain knowledge to reason about how dynamic objects will move or change over time; objects that do not move enough to affect the robot's decisions are not selected as perceptual targets. For each technique we have run experiments in simulation to measure the cost savings realized by using selective perception. We estimate that the techniques included in Ulysses-3 reduce the computational cost of perception by 9 to 12 orders of magnitude when compared to a general perception system.

AB Container Drayage Problem (CDP) refers to the optimization problem of routing and scheduling a set of container trucks around a container terminal. Conventionally, a driver is stuck to one container truck and allowed to perform multiple trips (multi-trip) to the terminal within their working time. The recent development of automation technologies enables semi-autonomous trucks to follow the leading human-driven truck as a platoon on the road; therefore, truck platooning can save human labor and reduce the fuel cost of following trucks through aero-dynamic drag reduction. In this paper, we study a multi-trip container drayage problem with truck platooning (MT-CDP-TP), where multi-trip, truck platooning, and fuel cost reduction are simultaneously considered in a CDP. Despite the operational benefits brought by the MT-CDP-TP, the problem is challenging to solve due to its NP-hardness when formulated as a multi-trip pickup and delivery problem with load-dependent cost. We propose a Branch-and-Price-and-Cut (BPC) algorithm, with a route-based set partitioning model and tight linear relaxations, to yield the exact solutions. Valid inequalities are generated based on a graph structure, where each node represents a feasible route, and each arc stands for the conflict between two routes. Moreover, we design a tailored pulse propagation algorithm with novel pruning procedures based on the dual information from the master problem and valid inequalities to solve the pricing problem efficiently. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted for performance validation, and the computational results show that the proposed exact algorithm can solve instances with up to 100 task nodes (i.e., 50 customers) and facilitate reducing the labor cost and fuel consumption by a wide margin in container drayage operations.

AB Real-time time-optimal trajectory planning exists in a wide range of applications such as computer numerical control (CNC) manufacturing, robotics and autonomous vehicles. Generally, the methods to generate time-optimal trajectory can be categorized as non-real-time methods and real-time methods. Non-real-time methods such as direct optimization method tend to generate time-optimal trajectory through nonlinear or linear programming while it is computationally prohibitive for high frequency real-time applications. Current real-time methods are computationally efficient but either deal with the sparse waypoint trajectories or sacrifice the time optimality a lot. This paper innovatively proposed a time-optimal switching trajectory index coordination (TOS-TIC) framework to solve the real-time time-optimal planning problem for continuous multi-axis trajectories. The proposed method is able to generate time-optimal trajectory for continuous geometric paths while considering the axial velocity and acceleration constraints. The time-optimality of the trajectory planned by TOS-TIC is nearly the same as the offline planned optimal results. Meanwhile, the proposed method is computationally efficient for even 5 kHz real-time applications. The main idea of TOS-TIC is coordinating several one -axis time-optimal switching controls to generate a modified control that decreases the state deviation from the desired trajectory. Several comparative experiments are carried out on an industrial biaxial linear motor stage. And the experimental results consistently verify that the proposed TOS-TIC real-time planner generates faster trajectory compared with the real-time lookahead method. In addition, the trajectory running time and final tracking error of the proposed method are nearly the same as the offline direct optimization method.(c) 2022 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms allow us to obtain a unique 3D shape and 3D sensor trajectory by combining partial scans obtained by moving a 3D scanner. The performances of these algorithms are significantly affected by experimental conditions, characteristics of the target and values of the parameters of the reconstruction algorithm. Therefore, the uncertainty and reliability of SLAM techniques need to be assessed before their application, e.g. for robot navigation, autonomous vehicles or industrial fields. To evaluate the uncertainty of these algorithms, specific datasets containing 3D scans, with the possibility to control different conditions, e.g. sensor trajectory, depth or color noise, sensor velocity and framerate, are necessary. In this article, we present a procedure to obtain virtual datasets with complete control of the environment, 3D sensor and trajectory conditions, starting from any real 3D dataset acquisition, characterized by a sufficiently low uncertainty. These datasets can be generated to test the effect of SLAM algorithm parameters to determine the best parameters to be used to exploit the algorithm characteristics to obtain the best result in each operating context. The advantage of this procedure is the possibility to perfectly control each condition and to evaluate its effect on the final result. This procedure was applied to two reconstruction algorithms as examples; namely, the Open3D reconstruction tool and ElasticFusion. The results demonstrate that the setting of algorithm parameters, e.g. the tolerance on depth correspondence between frames or the number of fragments, or the change in number of frames acquired, can have a strong influence on the resulting 3D reconstruction and trajectory. Moreover, the effect of not closing the loop trajectory on reconstruction performance is quantified for different application scenarios.

AB Safety regulation of safety-critical agent-based cyber-physical systems (CPS) which are manufactured in large scale such as next-gen aircrafts, autonomous driving vehicles, and medical devices is a multifaceted problem. CPS deployments can be presented with new safety-critical scenarios and novel inputs. Hence, operational characteristics of the CPS can be quite different from its safety approved design. This article considers a safety assurance solution where operational data from the sensors and actuators in the field of deployment is fed back to the manufacturing process through the Internet of Things infrastructure to assure and improve operational safety. It considers two cases: 1) model-aware, where the safety assured CPS design is fully specified; 2) model-agnostic, where limited specifications exist. For both the cases, it presents a data science based approach, N-HyMn, that learns a hybrid automaton model of the operational characteristics of the CPS from the inputioutput (I/O) traces of the observable parameters. For the model-aware case, it investigates the presence of inconsistencies between the learned model and the specifications model provided by the manufacturer, thus facilitating the detection of safety problems that may have been overlooked. For the model-agnostic case, it can detect potential safety failures. We show the usage of N-HyMn on the Medtronic Minimed 670 G system. N-HyMn correctly infers the hybrid automaton specifications of the Minimed 670 G and was able to detect a self-adaptation mechanism that is not declared explicitly in the certification documents of the U Food and Drug Administration. N-HyMn has a computational complexity of O(kn(2)), where k is the number of samples in the I/O trace, and n is the number of continuous variables.

AB From the last few years, we have witnessed the fourth generation industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), impact of which will be seen in the years to come in various disciplines such as healthcare, transportation, IoT, smart grid, autonomous vehicles, and image processing. These applications in Industry 4.0 may have data in the form of images, speech signals, videos having high dimensions containing multiple dimensions to represent data along different axis. So, the complexity of data processing increases with an increase in the dimensions of the dataset. Complexity can be viewed in terms of detecting and exploiting the relationships among different features of the dataset. These complexities among different attributes can be reduced with the help of dimensionality reduction techniques. These techniques reduce the dimensions from the original input dataset to a lower dimensional dataset. Dimensionality reduction methods are broadly categorized into two types asfeature extraction and feature selection. In feature selection method, out of the original set, a subset of features are identified to get a smaller subset which can be used to build the model whereas, the feature extraction method reduces the dataset of high dimensions to a lower dimension space, that is, a space with a less number of features having different values in comparison to the original dataset. Keeping focus on these points, in this article, we have compared and analyzed different data dimensionality reduction techniques which reduce the dimensions of a large and complex dataset during data processing. In addition, we have discussed various data dimensionality reduction techniques and compared these techniques with respect to various parameters. The comparison among various techniques provides insights to the readers about the applicability of a specific technique to the stand-alone or a group of applications.

AB The idea of robots that possess autonomous capabilities and intelligence and are ungoverned by human directions or supervision dates as far back as several decades ago. These (then) futuristic ideas were steadily incorporated into very real and current technology. Combined with Artificial Intelligence ("AI") technology, products and machines disrupt the idea of agency and the involvement of human beings in manufacturing and provision of services. How should liability be constructed when there is no apparent agency or personhood or when actions are almost inherently unforeseeable? More specifically, in the context of AI-based robots, do models of products liability or other tort liability fit the new framework? This Article seeks to explain why current law and doctrine, such as products liability and negligence, cannot provide an adequate framework for these technological advancements, mainly due to the lack of personhood, agency, and the inability to predict and explain robot behavior. Zooming out from specific doctrines, the Article also suggests that none of the three main liability regimes-strict liability, negligence, and no-fault mandatory insurance-adequately resolves the challenges of AI-based robots. Ultimately, this Article aims at suggesting supplementary rules that, together with existing liability models, could provide better legal structures that fit AI-based robots. Such supplementary rules will function as quasi-safe harbors or predetermined levels of care. Meeting them would shift the burden back to current tort doctrines. Failing to meet such rules would lead to liability. Such safe harbors may include a monitoring duty, built-in emergency brakes, and ongoing support and patching duties. The argument is these supplementary rules could be used as a basis for presumed negligence that complements the existing liability models. If adopted, they could establish clear rules or best practices that determine the scope of potential liability of designers, operators, and end-users of AI-based robots.

AB Biomass is a key variable for understanding the stocks and flows of carbon and energy in the environment. The quantification of megabenthos biomass (body size a >= 1 cm) has been limited by their relatively low abundance and the difficulties associated with quantitative sampling. Developments in robotic technology, particularly autonomous underwater vehicles, offer an enhanced opportunity for the quantitative photographic assessment of the megabenthos. Photographic estimation of biomass has typically been undertaken using taxon-specific length-weight relationships (LWRs) derived from physical specimens. This is problematic where little or no physical sampling has occurred and/or where key taxa are not easily sampled. We present a generalised volumetric method (GVM) for the estimation of biovolume as a predictor of biomass. We validated the method using fresh trawl-caught specimens from the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Sustained Observatory (northeast Atlantic), and we demonstrated that the GVM has a higher predictive capability and a lower standard error of estimation than the LWR method. GVM and LWR approaches were tested in parallel on a photographic survey in the Celtic Sea. Among the 75% of taxa for which LWR estimation was possible, highly comparable biomass values and distribution patterns were determined by both methods. The biovolume of the remaining 25% of taxa increased the total estimated standing stock by a factor of 1.6. Additionally, we tested inter-operator variability in the application of the GVM, and we detected no statistically significant bias. We recommend the use of the GVM where LWRs are not available, and more generally given its improved predictive capability and its independence from the taxonomic, temporal, and spatial, dependencies known to impact LWRs.

AB Micro unmanned aircraft systems (micro UAS)-related technical research is important because micro UAS has the advantage of being able to perform missions remotely. When an omnidirectional camera is mounted, it captures all surrounding areas of the micro UAS. Normal field of view (NFoV) refers to a view presented as an image to a user in a 360-degree video. The 360-degree video is controlled using an end-to-end controls method to automatically provide the user with NFoVs without the user controlling the 360-degree video. When using the end-to-end controls method that controls 360-degree video, if there are various signals that control the 360-degree video, the training of the deep learning model requires a considerable amount of training data. Therefore, there is a need for a method of autonomously determining the signals to reduce the number of signals for controlling the 360-degree video. This paper proposes a method to autonomously determine the output to be used for end-to-end control-based deep learning model to control 360-degree video for micro UAS controllers. The output of the deep learning model to control 360-degree video is automatically determined using the K-means algorithm. Using a trained deep learning model, the user is presented with NFoVs in a 360-degree video. The proposed method was experimentally verified by providing NFoVs wherein the signals that control the 360-degree video were set by the proposed method and by user definition. The results of training the convolution neural network (CNN) model using the signals to provide NFoVs were compared, and the proposed method provided NFoVs similar to NFoVs of existing user with 24.4% more similarity compared to a user-defined approach.

AB High-resolution vector magnetic measurements were performed on an inactive ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal vent field, called Yokoniwa Hydrothermal Field (YHF), using a deep-sea manned submersible Shinkai6500 and an autonomous underwater vehicle r2D4. The YHF has developed at a non-transform offset massif of the Central Indian Ridge. Dead chimneys were widely observed around the YHF along with a very weak venting of low-temperature fluids so that hydrothermal activity of the YHF was almost finished. The distribution of crustal magnetization from the magnetic anomaly revealed that the YHF is associated with enhanced magnetization, as seen at the ultramafic-hosted Rainbow and Ashadze-1 hydrothermal sites of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The results of rock magnetic analysis on seafloor rock samples (including basalt, dolerite, gabbro, serpentinized peridotite, and hydrothermal sulfide) showed that only highly serpentinized peridotite carries high magnetic susceptibility and that the natural remanent magnetization intensity can explain the high magnetization of Yokoniwa. These observations reflect abundant and strongly magnetized magnetite grains within the highly serpentinized peridotite. Comparisons with the Rainbow and Ashadze-1 suggest that in ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems, strongly magnetized magnetite and pyrrhotite form during the progression of hydrothermal alteration of peridotite. After the completion of serpentinization and production of hydrogen, pyrrhotites convert into pyrite or nonmagnetic iron sulfides, which considerably reduces their levels of magnetization. Our results revealed origins of the magnetic high and the development of subsurface chemical processes in ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems. Furthermore, the results highlight the use of near-seafloor magnetic field measurements as a powerful tool for detecting and characterizing seafloor hydrothermal systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sequences of images from urban environments are increasing in number as well as their potential applications. They are being taken (from stationary and dynamic cameras) for applications such as traffic surveillance, or for autonomous driving, or for security applications, etc. The literature presents several different approaches for each application. For object detection, a common disadvantage is that they only consider images obtained from a stationary, or a dynamic, camera to train the detectors. This can lead to poor performances when the detectors are used in sequences of images from different types of cameras, or even a cross camera testing. e.g., training with data from a dynamic camera and testing with sequences from a stationary camera. Another disadvantage is that some approaches use several models for each point of view of the car, generating a lot of models and, in some cases, one classifier for each point of view. In this paper, we approach the problem of car detection using a model of the class car created with a dataset of static images and we use the model to detect cars in sequence of images that were collected from static and dynamic cameras, i.e., in a totally different setting than used for training. The creation of the model is done by an off-line learning phase, using an image database of cars in several points of view, PASCAL 2007. The model is based on a mixture of deformable part models that have been shown to give state of the art results for detection in static images. The results show that the proposed approach achieves better results than the state of the art approaches in sequence of images obtained from a stationary, or a dynamic camera. Another contribution of our paper is a ground truth of a large sequence of images available in the Internet. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Structural fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials consisting of a polymer matrix reinforced with layers of high-strength fibers are used in numerous applications, including but not limited to spacecraft, vehicles, buildings, and bridges. Researchers in the past few decades have suggested the necessary integration of sensors (e.g., fiber optic sensors) in polymer composites to enable health monitoring of composites' performance over their service lives. This work introduces an innovative cognizant composite that can self-sense, compute, and implement decisions based on sensed values. It is a critical step towards smart, resilient infrastructure. We describe a method to fabricate textile sensors with flexible circuitry and a microcontroller within the polymer composite, enabling computational operations to take place in the composite without impacting its integrity. A microstructural investigation of the sensors showed that the amount of oxidative agent and soaking time of the fabric play a major role in the adsorption of polypyrrole (PPy) on fiberglass (FG). XPS results showed that the 10 g ferric chloride solution with 6 h of soaking time had the highest degree of protonation (28%) and, therefore, higher adsorption of PPy on FG. A strain range of 30% was achieved by examining different circuitry and sensor designs for their resistance and strain resolution under mechanical loading. A microcontroller was added to the circuit and then embedded within a composite material. This composite system was tested under flexural loading to demonstrate its self-sensing, computing, and actuation capabilities. The resulting cognizant composite demonstrated the ability to read resistance values and measure strain using the embedded microcontroller and autonomously actuate an LED light when the strain exceeds a predefined limit of 2000 mu epsilon. The application of the proposed FRP system would provide in situ monitoring of structural composite components with autonomous response capabilities, as well as reduce manufacturing, production, and maintenance costs.

ID SYNCHRONIZATION; FRAMEWORK
AB With the increasing presence of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), like autonomous vehicle systems and digital twins, the future of software engineering is predicated on the importance of designing and developing data-centric software systems that can adapt intelligently at run time. CPSs consist of complex heterogeneous software components. Model-driven engineering advocates using software models to tame such complexity, capturing the relevant design concerns of such systems at different levels of abstraction. Yet most of the existing CPSs are engineered without considering MDE practices and tools, facing fundamental challenges when working with data: monitoring the program data at run time, syncing updates between program and model, dealing with heterogeneous data sources, and representing such observed data at run time to facilitate automated analysis. In this work, we introduce the notion of view models to explicitly represent parts of the domain knowledge implicitly embedded in the source code of a software system. This notion is equipped with a scalable bidirectional syncing mechanism that extracts view model instances from program snapshots at run time. The syncing mechanism is proposed from a conceptual point of view, independently of specific implementations and supports incremental view model update and view model maintenance. We show how this syncing mechanism is flexible enough to facilitate the non-intrusive adoption of MDE technology over existing MDE-agnostic heterogeneous data-centric systems. We study the run-time cost implied by the EMF-Syncer , the tool implementing this syncing mechanism for Java applications and view models atop the eclipse modeling framework (EMF) when executing data analytic and transformation tasks over large volumes of data in the presence of data updates at run time. An empirical evaluation of the EMF-Syncer has been conducted with an industry-targeted benchmark for decision support systems, analyzing performance and scalability. The novel syncing mechanism enables new opportunities to adopt MDE technology in heterogeneous data-centric systems.

ID INFORMATION
AB A method of positioning a location on a specific object using a wireless sensor has been developed for a long time. However, due to the error of wavelengths and various interference factors occurring in three-dimensional space, accurate positioning is difficult, and predicting future locations is even more difficult. It uses IoT-based node pattern recognition technology to overcome positioning errors or inaccurate predictions in wireless sensor networks. It developed a method to improve the current positioning accuracy in a sensor network environment and a method to learn a pattern of position data directly from a wavelength receiver. The developed method consists of two steps: The first step is a method of changing location data in 3D space to location data in 2D space in order to reduce the possibility of positioning errors in 3D space. The second step is to reduce the range of the moving direction angle in which the data changed in two dimensions can be changed in the future and to predict future positions through pattern recognition of the position data. It is to calculate the expected position in the future. In conclusion, three-dimensional positioning accuracy was improved through this method, and future positioning accuracy was also improved. The core technology was able to reduce inevitable errors by changing the spatial dimension from 3D to 2D and to improve the accuracy of future location prediction by reducing the range of the movable direction angle of the location data changed to 2D. It was also possible to obtain the result that the prediction accuracy increases in proportion to the amount of data accumulated in the wavelength receiver and the learning time. In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, this method is expected to be utilized in various places, such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and disaster prediction.

AB The Tactile Internet (TI) is an emerging area of research involving 5G and beyond (B5G) communications to enable real-time interaction of haptic data over the Internet between tactile ends, with audio-visual data as feedback. This emerging TI technology is viewed as the next evolutionary step for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is expected to bring about a massive change in Healthcare 4.0, Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicles to resolve complicated issues in modern society. This vision of TI makes a dream into a reality. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey of TI, focussing on design architecture, key application areas, potential enabling technologies, current issues, and challenges to realise it. To illustrate the novelty of our work, we present a brainstorming mind-map of all the topics discussed in this article. We emphasise the design aspects of the TI and discuss the three main sections of the TI, i.e., master, network, and slave sections, with a focus on the proposed application-centric design architecture. With the help of the proposed illustrative diagrams of use cases, we discuss and tabulate the possible applications of the TI with a 5G framework and its requirements. Then, we extensively address the currently identified issues and challenges with promising potential enablers of the TI. Moreover, a comprehensive review focussing on related articles on enabling technologies is explored, including Fifth Generation (5G), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Cloud/Edge/Fog Computing, Multiple Access, and Network Coding. Finally, we conclude the survey with several research issues that are open for further investigation. Thus, the survey provides insights into the TI that can help network researchers and engineers to contribute further towards developing the next-generation Internet.

AB The increasing demand for automation and instant solution leads the technological world towards massive applications such as the Internet of drones, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), border surveillance, telesurgery, and Augmented Reality (AR), which requires a vast upgrade in technology with improved processing and computation capabilities. The Centralized Cloud Server (CCS) provides the facility to compute critical tasks at the central data server, but it consumes more time due to the distance between CSS and edge device. In this article, we discuss the advantages of edge computing over cloud computing to overcome latency and reliability issues in critical applications. Moreover, the idea of processing and analyzing massive applications at the edge comes up with the requirement of building intelligence at the edge to compute complex tasks within a negligible time. Edge intelligence offers intelligence at the edge to process large datasets for critical computations and to overcome storage issues. Also, the performance tolerant connectivity and low-speed rate issues with 4G and 5G can be solved using a 6G wireless network. The 6G connected edge intelligence application offers ultra-low-latency, security, and reliability mechanisms that could be helpful in COVID-19 pandemic situations. We have also discussed the demonstration of aforementioned massive application in the form of a case study on combating COVID-19 situations using 6G-based edge intelligence. The case study depicts the benefits of using 6G (latency: 10 - 100 mu s) over 4G (latency: < 10ms) and 5G (latency: < 5ms) communication networks. The proposed 6Genabled scheme is compared against the traditional 4G and 5G networks to designate its efficiency in terms of communication latency and network mobility. Eventually, we then analyzed various open issues and research challenges in this emerging research area for future gains and insights.

AB The Ultra-wideband (UWB) system for indoor positioning and tracking with the characteristics of arbitrary target orientation, optimal anchor location, and adaptive non-line-of-sight (NLOS) mitigation characteristics is proposed and implemented by introducing the circularly polarized antenna, the genetic algorithm (GA), and the machine learning method. The time-domain characteristic of the UWB system using the proposed circularly polarized antennas with wide bandwidth and omnidirectional radiation is investigated by transient response. Contrary to UWB system using the conventional linearly polarized antenna, the pulse distortion is insignificant and is verified by the measured antenna performance with high signal fidelity (>0.98) and low standard deviation (STD) of time delay (<0.05 ns). By considering the NLOS electromagnetic wave propagation models, the locations of the anchors in the UWB system are effectively optimized by using the proposed GA to minimize the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of each tag location in the dense multipath area. By optimizing the three anchor locations, the average RMSE of tag location is minimized to 36.72 cm for a 45 m(2) area with concrete walls and pillars. The adaptive NLOS mitigation is investigated by using and optimizing machine learning models, including deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The three-anchor UWB system for a 45 m(2) area is established to track an autonomous vehicle in severe NLOS environment by using the proposed circularly polarized antenna combined with the optimized LSTM model, achieving the measured positioning error of 26.1 cm. Moreover, the measured result of 20-30 cm positioning error with concrete walls, pillars and walking humans is demonstrated and analyzed.

AB This paper proposes a framework for automatic classification of mobile laser scanner (MLS) point cloud using multi-faceted multi-object convolutional neural network (MMCN). The proposed method takes a full three-dimensional (3D) point cloud as input and outputs a class label for each point. Unlike other existing classification methods for MLS data, the proposed method is not dependent on any parameter or its tuning. The proposed MMCN uses multiple objects of a sample, defined by different sizes of the sample, in addition to the different facets obtained by rotating about the various axes, thus adding more information during the training and testing stages. The proposed framework uses manually extracted samples for training the MMCN. Automatically extracted multiple regions based on the various radii of spherical neighbourhoods around MLS points are passed through the trained MMCN for determining their probabilities of belonging to different classes. The class probabilities of different sized regions are then used as a feature vector to train a support vector machine (SVM), and the final decision for the class of a point is based on the SVM output. The proposed framework has been trained for five classes, viz., Ground, House, Pole, Tree, and Car and has been tested on Oakland and Paris-Lille 3D MLS datasets. The total accuracy and kappa coefficient (kappa) reach up to 96.5% and 93.8%, respectively, for the framework. The MMCN together with the SVM is able to achieve parameter-free classification of MLS data, thereby eliminating the need for manual parameter tuning as in the existing methods. Therefore, besides the use for classification of MLS data for mapping purpose, the approach is also suitable for classification of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data resulting from autonomous vehicle sensors. The accuracy of this work can be further improved by incorporating more and varied training samples and deeper convolutional neural network (CNN) with better hardware resources.

AB Knowledge of the spatial variation of soil is important in modern agricultural management. To attain this knowl-edge, ground-based samples are required in combination with many ground-based, air-borne and space-borne sensors from the Internet of Things. Compared to traditional grid and simple random sampling that are designed for fixed sensors, adaptive sampling is not well studied. In this study, we propose a prior-based adaptive sampling scheme to collect soil samples for estimation of ground-based Gamma-ray potassium across an 80-ha field in a semi-arid landscape, in New South Wales, Australia. We compare the performance of the sampling algorithm via a linear mixed model between various adaptive sampling schemes with prior information of varying quality (e.g. ground apparent electrical conductivity, air-borne Gamma -ray potassium, and a legacy map of clay content). We also compare the model performance of the adaptive sampling scheme with more conventional grid and sim-ple random sampling schemes. Results show that the adaptive sampling scheme was superior to the grid and simple random sampling schemes in terms of the accuracy of the linear mixed model when the sampling size was small (<15 additional samples) due to the use of prior information. The accuracy of the linear mixed models associated with the adaptive sampling schemes deteriorated when the quality (correlation with the target soil variable) of the prior information decreases. We conclude that the algorithm has the potential to be applied gen- erally for automated adaptive sampling design (e.g., on an autonomous vehicle) when sampling cost is large and travelling time of the sensor is relatively small.

AB On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologiessuch as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud and Fog computingis helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual use cases' that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of FMoD and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.

AB The current mathematical models for the storage assignment problem are generally established based on the traveling salesman problem(TSP), which has been widely applied in the conventional automated storage and retrieval system(AS/RS). However, the previous mathematical models in conventional AS/RS do not match multi-tier shuttle warehousing systems(MSWS) because the characteristics of parallel retrieval in multiple tiers and progressive vertical movement destroy the foundation of TSP. In this study, a two-stage open queuing network model in which shuttles and a lift are regarded as servers at different stages is proposed to analyze system performance in the terms of shuttle waiting period (SWP) and lift idle period (LIP) during transaction cycle time. A mean arrival time difference matrix for pairwise stock keeping units(SKUs) is presented to determine the mean waiting time and queue length to optimize the storage assignment problem on the basis of SKU correlation. The decomposition method is applied to analyze the interactions among outbound task time, SWP, and LIP. The ant colony clustering algorithm is designed to determine storage partitions using clustering items. In addition, goods are assigned for storage according to the rearranging permutation and the combination of storage partitions in a 2D plane. This combination is derived based on the analysis results of the queuing network model and on three basic principles. The storage assignment method and its entire optimization algorithm method as applied in a MSWS are verified through a practical engineering project conducted in the tobacco industry. The applying results show that the total SWP and LIP can be reduced effectively to improve the utilization rates of all devices and to increase the throughput of the distribution center.

AB Traditional fishery resource assessment methods using trawl gear are unable to sample rocky substratum and are prone to underestimating the biomass of species having partial or strong association with rocky reefs. This study successfully used an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and image-yielding methods to estimate size, abundance and habitat preference of an abundant and commercially important 'rockfish' - the Ocean Perch (Helicolenus percoides) - in rocky habitats on the continental shelf off Tasmania, SE Australia. More than half (53%) of the Ocean Perch observed were photogrammetrically measured with known accuracy using a stereo camera system yielding length-frequency distributions. Observations of juvenile and adult H. percoides across a depth gradient showed that adults preferred rocky substrates over soft substrates, whereas juveniles preferred soft substrate over hard substrate. We found a positive relationship between rockfish abundance and increasing depth in most habitat types. These results demonstrate the utility of image-based methods for determining size composition and habitat preferences of some reef-associated species. However, there is scope to improve image-based methods using length estimation procedures that enable higher proportions of individuals to be measured (compared to the proportion achieved in this study), and by incorporating automated image annotation to decrease image analysis times, particularly when examining species/habitat relationships. The importance of analytical procedures that account for autocorrelation in non-independent image data on habitats and associated species is discussed. We conclude that rapidly maturing image-based observational methods have potential utility in complementing fishery stock assessments of some reef-associated species. Image-based methods are also well-suited to simultaneously provide additional quantitative measures of benthic habitats, invertebrate fauna and fishery environments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Network macroscopic fundamental diagrams (NMFD) and related network-level traffic dynamics models have received both theoretical support and empirical validation with the emergence of new data collection technologies. However, the extent to which network-level macroscopic traffic models may be ready for practical implementation remains to be ascertained. This paper aims to shed light on this matter by reviewing the 50-year history of macroscopic modeling of urban networks and assessing remaining gaps and opportunities for further development of both theory and applications. To this end, the existing literature's chronology is mapped onto three eras of development, and the corresponding theories, assumptions, and limitations are outlined and discussed in two streams, equilibrium relations and traffic dynamics. Among the topics pertaining to equilibrium relations, the highlighted gaps include the lack of empirical studies on the hysteresis and bifurcation phenomena, the existence of multi-modal NMFD (3D-NMFD) in different traffic conditions, the factors that might affect the (3D-) NMFD shape, the accuracy of speed-NMFDs in particular different bus speed NMFDs, and the passenger-oriented NMFDs. Research gaps pertaining to traffic dynamics include the analytical solution of trip-based models, the FIFO violation in the delay-based models, the definition of outflow and entrance functions, the notion of active network length, the trip length distribution, and the path flow distribution. Future research directions targeting topics that might shape the potential next era include the practical implementation of NMFD-based control strategies, the application of NMFD in quality of service assessments, and NMFD in the presence of new technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).

AB The development of the 5G network is envisioned to offer various types of services like virtual reality/augmented reality and autonomous vehicles applications with low-latency requirements in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has become a promising solution for enhancing the computation capacity of mobile devices at the edge of the network in a 5G wireless network. Additionally, multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs) have been verified with the potential in lowering the transmission latency and energy consumption, while improving the Quality of Services (QoS). Benefiting from the cooperation of multi-RATs, large latency-sensitive computing service tasks (L2SC) can be offloaded by different RATs simultaneously, which has great practical significance for data partitioned oriented applications with large task sizes. In this article, to enhance the L2SC offloading services for satisfying low-latency requirements with low energy consumption, we investigate the energy-latency tradeoff problem for partial task offloading in the MEC-enhanced multi-RAT network, considering the limitation of energy and computing in capability-constrained end devices in IoT networks. Specifically, we formulated the L2SC task computation offloading problem to minimize the weighted sum of the latency cost and the energy consumption by jointly optimizing the local computing frequency, task splitting, and transmit power, while guaranteeing the stringent latency requirement and the residual energy constraint. Due to the nonsmoothness and nonconvexity of the formulated problem with high complexity, we convert the tradeoff problem into a smooth biconvex problem and propose an alternate convex search-based algorithm, which can greatly reduce the computational complexity. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with various performance parameters.

AB Wave Glider is an autonomous surface vehicle that directly uses wave energy to generate forward power and has been widely used in marine survey and observation. Wave Glider is composed of surface vessel, submersible propeller and the connection structure between them. Connection types are thought to be related to the performance of Wave Glider closely. In this paper, the effects of the connection structure between the surface vessel and the submersible propeller on the motion performance of the Wave Glider are studied. Several connection types such as rigid rod, cable, multi-link chain and elastic rod are applied to connect the surface vessel and the submersible propeller. The models of connection structures are developed respectively. Among them, cable model is established with a finite number of small cylinders, which connected by spring and damping elements; multi-link chain can be seen as hinged by multiple rigid rods; elastic rod model can be looked on as several segments linked with elastic components. Considering the connection characteristics, the integrated dynamic models are established by applying multi-body dynamics software ADAMS (Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems) with consideration of the hydrodynamic forces on different components of Wave Glider. The propulsion performance of the Wave Glider is calculated by using numerical method, and the simulation results showed that the difference of propulsion performance with different connection types of the Wave Glider is slightly. But serious impacts can occur on the connections of rigid rod and multi-link chain. They can lead to serious extra load on the structure of Wave Glider. From the engineering practice of Wave Glider application, the cable connection is more convenient to transport, deploy, recover and store. It is also the generous connection type for wave glider.

Blockchain solutions are currently being explored for: (1) securing patient and provider identities; (2) managing pharmaceutical and medical device supply chains; (3) clinical research and data monetisation; (4) medical fraud detection; (5) public health surveillance; (6) enabling truly public and open geo-tagged data; (7) powering many Internet of Things-connected autonomous devices, wearables, drones and vehicles, via the distributed peer-to-peer apps they run, to deliver the full vision of smart healthy cities and regions; and (8) blockchain-enabled augmented reality in crisis mapping and recovery scenarios, including mechanisms for validating, crediting and rewarding crowdsourced geo-tagged data, among other emerging use cases. Geospatially-enabled blockchain solutions exist today that use a crypto-spatial coordinate system to add an immutable spatial context that regular blockchains lack. These geospatial blockchains do not just record an entry's specific time, but also require and validate its associated proof of location, allowing accurate spatiotemporal mapping of physical world events. Blockchain and distributed ledger technology face similar challenges as any other technology threatening to disintermediate legacy processes and commercial interests, namely the challenges of blockchain interoperability, security and privacy, as well as the need to find suitable and sustainable business models of implementation. Nevertheless, we expect blockchain technologies to get increasingly powerful and robust, as they become coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) in various real-word healthcare solutions involving AI-mediated data exchange on blockchains.

AB Welding mechanics of large-scale complex-shaped structures is generally either disregarded or implicitly presumed due to high complexity and time consumption - even in the case of numerical analysis, typically it is limited to local thermo-mechanical models of straight butt or tee welded joints. Nevertheless, not only is this study aimed at presenting a time-saving global thermo-mechanical model of a curved outside corner joint but also at exploiting combined effects of welding parameters to mitigate deformation and residual stress. The global thermo-mechanical model is thereby constructed by combination of shell and solid finite elements providing Thermal-Elastic-Plastic (TEP) analysis for an aluminum Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) of which novel hull shape inspired by catfish morphology results in a longitudinal curved outside corner welded joint. A suitable polynomial mathematical function enabled the welding heat source to move steadily along the curved path of the joint. Saving up computational time 3.5 times greater than conventional full 3D method, the global shell/3D TEP FEM is validated well against experimental temperature, distortion and residual stress distributions when locating the boundary between shell and solid elements with the size of solid zone up to the 3 times thickness of base metal based on accuracy of molten metal penetration, deformation and residual stress prediction. A stark difference of about 120% in maximum amount of longitudinal residual stress is observed between global and local models. Finally, optimal outcomes are employed in production of the AUV so that 33% reduction in welding speed mitigated residual stress by 22% whereas welding length and sequence were more effective on distortion.

AB Human drivers are capable of recognizing places from a previous journey even when viewing them from the opposite direction during the return trip under radically different environmental conditions, without needing to look back or employ a 360 degrees camera or LIDAR sensor. Such navigation capabilities are attributed in large part to the robust semantic scene understanding capabilities of humans. However, for an autonomous robot or vehicle, achieving such human-like visual place recognition capability presents three major challenges: (1) dealing with a limited amount of commonly observable visual content when viewing the same place from the opposite direction; (2) dealing with significant lateral viewpoint changes caused by opposing directions of travel taking place on opposite sides of the road; and (3) dealing with a radically changed scene appearance due to environmental conditions such as time of day, season, and weather Current state-of-the-art place recognition systems have only addressed these three challenges in isolation or in pairs, typically relying on appearance-based, deep-learnt place representations. In this paper, we present a novel, semantics-based system that for the first time solves all three challenges simultaneously. We propose a hybrid image descriptor that semantically aggregates salient visual information, complemented by appearance-based description, and augment a conventional coarse-to-fine recognition pipeline with keypoint correspondences extracted from within the convolutional feature maps of a pre-trained network. Finally, we introduce descriptor normalization and local score enhancement strategies for improving the robustness of the system. Using both existing benchmark datasets and extensive new datasets that for the first time combine the three challenges of opposing viewpoints, lateral viewpoint shifts, and extreme appearance change, we show that our system can achieve practical place recognition performance where existing state-of-the-art methods fail.

AB The years we are experiencing are often identified as those of the Age of Smart Technologies. Smart is now a very popular term, with the meaning of clever, intelligent, sharp, quick on the uptake. Its extensive meaning can be grasped if we consider it as an acronym for Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology to indicate the essential features of the innovative technologies that characterize today's society in its daily life. Thus, the advent of the Smart Age, which is therefore the era of smart technologies, has heavily characterized and modified many aspects of today's society compared to the past. In this panorama, some arising questions regard transport infrastructure systems and, first of all, road transport. This research proposes a focus on one main issue: how roads fit into this smart revolution? Actually, the paper aims to offer an overview of the smart approach in road engineering by proposing a broad discussion about the current state of innovation in the smart roads field, i.e. the roads of the Smart Age. After defining the key functions of a smart road, the paper reviews some innovative technologies that make these items effective. These are studied in depth both with regard to motorway-type infrastructures and urban roads and intersections, with attention to the various technological aspects and to the benefits perceivable by management, users and the community. The paper, therefore, offers a bird's eye view of this extremely dynamic sector with innovative technologies for a new intelligent and connected mobility, and discusses some of their criticalities and strengths allowing for optimization and development of new transport functions and services, improving energy efficiency and promoting social, economic and environmental sustainability.

AB Purpose Unmanned aerial vehicles are commonly known as UAVs and drones. Nowadays, industries have begun to realise the operational and economic benefits of drone-enabled tasks. The Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, drones, etc., represent implementable advanced technologies intended to accomplish Industry 4.0. The purpose of this study is to discuss the significant contributions of drones for Industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach Nowadays, drones are used for inspections, mapping and surveying in difficult or hazardous locations. For writing this paper, relevant research papers on drone for Industry 4.0 are identified from various research platforms such as Scopus, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and ScienceDirect. Given the enormous extent of the topic, this work analyses many papers, reports and news stories in an attempt to comprehend and clarify Industry 4.0. Findings Drones are being implemented in manufacturing, entertainment industries (cinematography, etc.) and machinery across the world. Thermal-imaging devices attached to drones can detect variable heat levels emanating from a facility, trigger the sprinkler system and inform emergency authorities. Due partly to their utility and adaptability in industrial areas such as energy, transportation, engineering and more, autonomous drones significantly impact Industry 4.0. This paper discusses drones and their types. Several technological advances and primary extents of drones for Industry 4.0 are diagrammatically elaborated. Further, the authors identified and discussed 19 major applications of drones for Industry 4.0. Originality/value This paper's originality lies in its discussion and exploration of the capabilities of drones for Industry 4.0, especially in manufacturing organisations. In addition to improving efficiency and site productivity, drones can easily undertake routine inspections and check streamlines operations and maintenance procedures. This work contributes to creating a common foundation for comprehending Industry 4.0 outcomes from many disciplinary viewpoints, allowing for more research and development for industrial innovation and technological progress.

AB Motorcycle rider steer responses to unexpected collision emergencies have not been studied experimentally. We used a motorcycle simulator with elastic steer mechanism and modified car driving model to simulate the input-output counter steering response of two-wheeled vehicles in combination with a car pop-up paradigm from driving studies to evaluate rider responses to unexpected collision hazards. We manipulated time-to-crash - either 1 s or 1.5 s- to probe the threshold between not enough and just enough time to respond. The median response time of 570 ms was similar to previously recorded latencies for motorcycle emergency braking responses. Although median response time and steer torque did not depend on time-to-crash (ITC), the distribution and variability of response measures were increased when TTC was shorter. Riders showed improved lateral displacement toward the road centerline by the third TTC1.5 trial and were almost 8 times more likely to produce a successful virtual swerve avoidance maneuver in TTC1.5 rather than TTC1 trials. With 1.5 s to respond, riders were more consistent, with net steering inputs more congruent with the maneuvering goal compared to when they had only 1 s to respond. Comparisons of 'safe' versus 'crash' outcomes show that average response times across trials and riders are not different, but the variance in timing is lower across successful trials. We have shown than it is possible to safely study rider reactions to an emergency and observe a realistic range of steer responses to a traffic conflict using a motorcycle riding simulator. The results have relevance for the design of automatic rider assistive systems, rider behavior prediction and decision logic algorithms, PTW rider modeling and targeted training interventions.

AB Cables are critical components for a variety of structures such as stay cables and suspenders of cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges. When in operational service, they are vulnerable to cumulative fatigue damage induced by dynamic loads (e.g., the cyclic vehicle loads and wind excitation). To accurately analyze and predict their dynamics behaviors and performance that could be spatially local and temporal transient, it is essential to perform high-resolution vibration measurements, from which their dynamics properties are identified and, subsequently, a high spatial resolution, full-modal-order dynamics model of cable vibration can be established. This study develops a physics-guided, unsupervised machine learning-based video processing approach that can blindly and efficiently extract the full-field (as many points as the pixel number of the video frame) modal parameters of cable vibration using only the video of an operating (output-only) cable. In particular, by incorporating the physics of cable vibration (taut string model), a novel automated modal motion filtering method is proposed to enable autonomous identification of full-order (as many modes as possible) dynamic parameters, including those weakly excited modes that used to be challenging to identify in operational modal analysis. Therefore, a full-field, full-order modal model of cable vibration is established by the proposed method. Furthermore, this new approach provides a low-cost and noncontact technique to estimate the cable tension using only the video of the vibrating cable where the fundamental frequency is automatically and efficiently estimated to compute the cable tension according to the taut string equation. Laboratory experiments on a bench-scale cable are conducted to validate the developed approach.

AB Emergency situations during car driving sometimes force the driver to make a sudden decision. Predicting these decisions will have important applications in updating risk analyses in insurance applications, but also can give insights for drafting autonomous vehicle guidelines. Studying such behavior in experimental settings, however, is limited by ethical issues as it would endanger peoples' lives. Here, we employed the potential of virtual reality (VR) to investigate decision-making in an extreme situation in which participants would have to sacrifice others in order to save themselves. In a VR driving simulation, participants first trained to complete a difficult course with multiple crossroads in which the wrong turn would lead the car to fall down a cliff. In the testing phase, obstacles suddenly appeared on the "safe" turn of a crossroad: for the control group, obstacles consisted of trees, whereas for the experimental group, they were pedestrians. In both groups, drivers had to decide between falling down the cliff or colliding with the obstacles. Results showed that differences in personality traits were able to predict this decision: in the experimental group, drivers who collided with the pedestrians had significantly higher psychopathy and impulsivity traits, whereas impulsivity alone was to some degree predictive in the control group. Other factors like heart rate differences, gender, video game expertise, and driving experience were not predictive of the emergency decision in either group. Our results show that self-interest related personality traits affect decision-making when choosing between preservation of self or others in extreme situations and showcase the potential of virtual reality in studying and modeling human decision-making.

AB One way of guiding autonomous vehicles through the field is using a vision based row detection system. A new approach for row recognition is presented which is based on grey-scale Hough transform on intelligently merged images resulting in a considerable improvement of the speed of image processing. A colour camera was used to obtain images from an experimental sugar beet field in a greenhouse. The colour images are transformed into grey scale images resulting in good contrast between plant material and soil background. Three different transformation methods were compared. The grey scale images are divided in three sections that are merged into one image, creating less data while still having information of three rows. It is shown that the algorithm is able to find the row at various growth stages. It does not make a difference which of the three colour to grey scale transformation methods is used. The mean error between the estimated and real crop row per measurement series varied from 5 to 198 mm. The median error from the crop row detection was 22 mm. The higher errors are mainly due to factors that do not occur in practice or that can be avoided, such as a limited number and a limited size of crop plants, overexposure of the camera, and the presence of green algae due to the use of a greenhouse. Inaccuracies created by footprints indicate that linear structures in the soil surface in a real field might create problems which should be considered in additional investigations. In two measurement series that did not suffer from these error sources, the algorithm was able to find the row with mean errors of 5 and 11 mm with standard deviations of 6 and 11 mm. The image processing time varied from 0. 5 to 1.3 s per image. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Acoustic surveys to estimate fish biomass and abundance are a major component of many fisheries monitoring programs. An important bias in acoustic surveys is that fish may avoid the survey vessel. Here, we utilized quiet uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) equipped with 120 kHz split beam echosounders to evaluate fish responses to motorized survey vessels. Two of these USVs were deployed in Lakes Michigan and Huron in summer 2021 and compared against three motorized vessels used in conventional fisheries acoustic surveys. Paired comparisons employed vessel-drone passes that provided the opportunity to observe fish response as vessels approached and then overtook their quiet USV counterparts. Sound originating from the vessels was primarily in the 10-1000 Hz range. Overall received sound pressure levels for ships at the closest pass were 100 dB (re 1 mu Pa @ 1 m) for one and 133-134 dB for the other two vessels. In contrast, sound originating from the USV was not detectable over ambient noise. We examined acoustic data from the USVs for potential changes in total acoustic backscatter, average target depth, and average in situ target strength as vessels approached. We observed weak evidence of an avoidance response by fish to the vessel with the loudest noise profile and highest survey speed but not for the other two vessels. We also compared acoustic data from 33 2-km transects surveyed by both vessels and the USVs, finding few differences between vessel and USV data for water depths between 5 and 80 m. Results from this work suggest that acoustics estimates of fishes in Lakes Michigan and Huron (primarily alewife, rainbow smelt, and bloater) are largely consistent among the vessels used in these two lakes for standard acoustic surveys and that fish avoidance is minimal in water depths > 5 meters.

AB Underwater wireless sensor networks possess considerable potential to monitor large and hostile under-water environments by reliably sensing, collecting, and forwarding data toward the surface sinks. Although the research community has made promising efforts, barriers such as continuous node mobility, longer delays, unavailability of location information, and energy limitations must be addressed. Taking this into account, this research aims to develop a hybrid and intelligent data collection scheme that con-siders node position and network characteristics during data forwarding. To accomplish the objective, the network is divided into two layers. The top layer, considered more dynamic, follows a hop-by-hop data forwarding scheme. The lower layer, experiencing stable water currents, follows a clustering-based data collection method. The proposed scheme, called Multilayer Dynamic Data Forwarding (MD2F), is suitable for large and deep underwater areas. MD2F is scalable as it uses a multi-sink architecture, while single or multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can be utilized depending on the area being moni-tored. Implementing hop-by-hop transmission and clustering-based data collection at different layers balances the network load, thereby increasing the network life. Results show that MD2F exhibits better performance when compared with Multilayer Cluster-based Energy Efficient (MLCEE) and Energy effi-cient and link reliable routing (E2LR) schemes, both are very close in working behavior. The results are encouraging in terms of delivery ratio, network throughput, and end-to-end delays. Alongside achieving these targets, the network also exhibits less energy consumption through load balancing.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB Compared to unfailed sediments, mass-transport deposits are often characterised by a low-amplitude response in single-channel seismic reflection images. This "acoustic transparency" amplitude signature is widely used to delineate mass-transport deposits and is conventionally interpreted as a lack of coherent internal reflectivity due to a loss of preserved internal structure caused by mass-transport processes. In this study we examine the variation in the singlechannel seismic response with changing heterogeneity using synthetic 2-D elastic seismic modelling. We model the internal structure of mass-transport deposits as a two-component random medium, using the lateral correlation length (ax) as a proxy for the degree of internal deformation. The average internal reflectivity is held approximately constant with increasing deformation by fixing the two component sediment lithologies to have realistic P-wave velocity and density based on sediment core measurements from the study area. For a controlled single-source synthetic model a reduction in observed amplitude with reduced ax is consistently observed across a range of vertical correlation lengths (az). For typical autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subbottom profiler acquisition parameters, in a simulated mass transport deposit with realistic geostatistical properties, we find that when ax approximate to 1 m, recorded seismic amplitudes are, on average, reduced by similar to 25% relative to unfailed sediments ( ax >> 103 m). We also observe that deformation significantly larger than core scale ( ax > 0 :1 m) can generate a significant amplitude decrease. These synthetic modelling results should discourage interpretation of the internal structure of mass-transport deposits based on seismic amplitudes alone, as acoustically transparent mass-transport deposits may still preserve coherent, metre-scale internal structure. In addition, the minimum scale of heterogeneity required to produce a significant reduction in seismic amplitudes is likely much larger than the typical diameter of sediment cores, meaning that acoustically transparent mass-transport deposits may still appear well stratified and undeformed at core scale.

AB This paper presents a new scalable 8 x 8 single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) based vision sensor with integrated spiking neuromorphic system on a single chip. The proposed vision sensing system adopts the benefits of SPAD's high quantum efficiency and energy efficiency of memristive spiking neuromorphic processing. The SPAD based vision sensor includes biologically inspired address event representation (AER) readout to generate asynchronous digital address events at the output reducing computation and making it suitable to process directly with integrated on-chip spiking neuromorphic system in a faster and more energy efficient way. A novel on-chip interface is designed to convert the output events of a SPAD-based event sensor into temporally coded spikes (TCS) that enable on-chip processing with integrated spiking neuromorphic system. We have tested the prototype vision sensing system for imaging characters by SPAD based vision sensor and recognizing them using the integrated memristive spiking neuromorphic system. To help with the evaluation, we have built a complete temporal pulses data set from simulating the SPAD vision sensor with AER readout in imaging characters and applied directly to integrated spiking neuromorphic system via designed novel on-chip interface. The achieved accuracy is 89.54% with a power consumption of 316 mu W for the memristive neuromorphic processor. The SPAD based vision sensor exhibits array-level dynamic range of 148 dB with a power consumption of 2.8 mW. The designed SPAD-based vision sensing system with an integrated spiking neuromorphic system on a single chip shows great promise for robotics, autonomous vehicles, health, and security applications.

AB Laser Doppler vibrometers (LDVs) have been widely adopted due to their large number of benefits in comparison to traditional contacting vibration transducers. Their high sensitivity, among other unique characteristics, has also led to their use as optical microphones, where the measurement of object vibration in the vicinity of a sound source can act as a microphone. Recent work enabling full correction of LDV measurement in the presence of sensor head vibration unlocks new potential applications, including integration within autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, the common AV challenge of object classification is addressed by presenting and evaluating a novel, non-contact vibro-acoustic object recognition technique. This technique utilises a custom set-up involving a synchronised loudspeaker and scanning LDV to simultaneously remotely solicit and record responses to a periodic chirp excitation in various objects. The 864 recorded signals per object were pre-processed into spectrograms of various forms, which were used to train a ResNet-18 neural network via transfer learning to accurately recognise the objects based only on their vibro-acoustic characteristics. A five-fold cross-validation optimisation approach is described, through which the effects of data set size and pre-processing type on classification accuracy are assessed. A further assessment of the ability of the CNN to classify never-before-seen objects belonging to groups of similar objects on which it has been trained is then described. In both scenarios, the CNN was able to obtain excellent classification accuracy of over 99.7%. The work described here demonstrates the significant promise of such an approach as a viable non-contact object recognition technique suitable for various machine automation tasks, for example, defect detection in production lines or even loose rock identification in underground mines.

AB Future wireless networks (5G and beyond), also known as Next Generation or NextG, are the vision of forthcoming cellular systems, connecting billions of devices and people together. In the last decades, cellular networks have dramatically grown with advanced telecommunication technologies for high-speed data transmission, high cell capacity, and low latency. The main goal of those technologies is to support a wide range of new applications, such as virtual reality, metaverse, telehealth, online education, autonomous and flying vehicles, smart cities, smart grids, advanced manufacturing, and many more. The key motivation of NextG networks is to meet the high demand for those applications by improving and optimizing network functions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a high potential to achieve these requirements by being integrated into applications throughout all network layers. However, the security concerns on network functions of NextG using AI-based models, i.e., model poisoning, have not been investigated deeply. It is crucial to protect the next-generation cellular networks against cybersecurity threats, especially adversarial attacks. Therefore, it needs to design efficient mitigation techniques and secure solutions for NextG networks using AI-based methods. This paper proposes a comprehensive vulnerability analysis of deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation models trained with the dataset obtained from MATLAB's 5G toolbox for adversarial attacks and defensive distillation-based mitigation methods. The adversarial attacks produce faulty results by manipulating trained DL-based models for channel estimation in NextG networks while mitigation methods can make models more robust against adversarial attacks. This paper also presents the performance of the proposed defensive distillation mitigation method for each adversarial attack. The results indicate that the proposed mitigation method can defend the DL-based channel estimation models against adversarial attacks in NextG networks.

ID MODEL
AB In this article, we investigate the transient behavior of a sequence of packets/bits traversing a multi-hop wireless network under static routing. Our work is motivated by novel applications from the domain of process automation, MachineType Communication (MTC) and cyber- physical systems, where short messages are communicated and statistical guarantees need to be provided on a per-message level. In order to optimize such a network, apart from understanding the stationary system dynamics, an understanding of the short-term dynamics (i.e. transient behavior) is also required. To this end, we derive novel Wireless Transient Bounds (WTB) for end-to-end delay and backlog in a multi-hop wireless network using stochastic network calculus approach. We start by analyzing a single end-toend path, i. e. a line topology, and then we show how the obtained results can be applied to a mesh network with static routing using a concept called 'leftover service'. WTB depends on the initial backlog at each node as well as the instantaneous channel states. We numerically compare WTB with Kernel-Based-Transient Bound ( KBTB), which can be obtained by adapting existing stationary bound, as well as simulated end-to- end delay of the investigated network. While KBTB and stationary bounds are not able to capture the short-term system dynamics well, WTB provides relatively tight upper bound and has a decay rate that closely matches the simulation. This is achieved by WTB only with a slight increase in the computational complexity, by a factor of O(T + N), where T is the duration of the arriving sequence and N is the number of hops in the network. We believe that the presented analysis and the bounds are necessary tools for future work on transient network optimization for many important emerging applications, e.g., massive MTC, critical MTC, edge computing and autonomous vehicle.

AB How do emotions like happiness, pain, stress, sadness and fatigue vary during travel and by travel mode? Understanding the relationship between how we travel and how we feel offers insight into ways of improving existing transportation services, prioritizing investments and theorizing and modeling the costs and benefits of travel. Drawing on the American Time Use Survey's well-being module, which surveyed over 13,000 respondents about mood during randomly selected activities, we address these questions using pooled ordinary least squares and fixed-effects panel regression. Controlling for demographics and other individual-specific attributes, we find that, contrary to the common perception that travel is an onerous, derived demand, mood is generally no worse during travel than on average. However, compared to other influences, travel has only a small total impact on how we feel. The estimated relationship between mood and mode tends to be weak and often not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we find that bicyclists have the most positive affect. Next happiest are car passengers, and then car drivers, though when controlling for the pleasure typically derived from interacting with others drivers are at least as happy as passengers. Bus and train riders experience the most negative emotions, though a small part of this can be attributed to the fact that transit is disproportionately used for the unloved work trip. Our findings suggest that bicycle use may have benefits beyond the typically cited health and transportation ones, and that improving transit riders' emotional experience may be as important as improving traditional service features such as headways and travel speeds. Our findings are ambiguous as to whether the joy of driving will limit the appeal of autonomous vehicles.

SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Contracting; Primary health care; Basic health units; Pakistan
AB Background: Since a decade, low and middle income countries have a rising trend of contracting their primary healthcare services to NGOs. In Pakistan, public sector often lacks capacity to effectively & equitably manage the healthcare services. It led the government to outsource the administration of primary health care services to a semi-autonomous government entity i.e. Peoples' Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI). This small scale study has assessed the quality of healthcare services at the contracted Basic Health Units (BHUs) with the PPHI and compared it with those managed by the local district government in the province of Sindh.
   Methods: A cross-sectional mix methods survey was conducted in November 2011. Two BHUs of each type were selected from the districts Karachi and Thatta in Sindh province. BHUs were selected randomly and a purposive sampling technique was used to recruit the study participants at the two study sites. Focus group discussions were conducted with patients visiting the facility while in-depth interviews were conducted with service providers. An observation based resource availability checklist was also administered.
   Results: There was a significant difference between the PPHI and the district government administered BHUs with regard to infrastructure, availability of essential medicines, basic medical appliances, mini-lab facilities and vehicles for referrals. These BHUs were found to have sufficient number of trained clinical staff and no punctuality and retention issues whatsoever. The district government administered BHUs presented a dismal picture in all the aspects.
   Conclusion: Out-sourcing of primary healthcare facilities has resulted in significantly improved certain aspects quality and responsiveness of primary healthcare services. This strategy is likely to achieve an efficient and perhaps an equitable healthcare delivery in low and middle income countries where governments have limited capacity to manage healthcare services.

AB Cluster formation and task processing are standard features for leveraging the performance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). As the UAV network is aided by sensors, functions such as clustering, reformation, and autonomous working are adaptively used for dense task processing. In consideration of the distributed nature of the UAV network coupled with wireless sensors, this article introduces a Rational Clustering Method (RCM) using dense task neighbor information exchange. The Rational Clustering Method (RCM) is an algorithm for dense task neighbor information exchange that can be used to cluster objects according to their shared properties. Each object's task neighbors, and the similarities between them, are calculated using this method. Starting with the task density of its neighbors, the RCM algorithm gives each object in the dataset a weight. This information exchange process identifies a UAV units' completing tasks and free slots. Using this information, high-slot UAVs within the communication range can be grouped as clusters. Unlike wireless sensor clusters, task allocation is performed on the basis of available slots and UAV longevity within the cluster; this prevents task incompletion/failures and delays in a densely populated UAV scenario. Cluster sustainability or dispersion is recommended when using distributed state learning. State learning transits between the pending task and UAV longevity; an intermediate state is defined for task reassignment amid immediate cluster deformation. This triple feature-based distributed method balances tasks between failures, overloading, and idle UAVs. The RCM was verified using task processing rate, completion ratio, reassignment, failures, and delay. Task processing rate was increased by 8.16% and completion ratio was increased by 10.3% with the proposed RCM-IE. Reassignment, failure, and delay were all reduced by 12.5%, 9.87%, and 11.99%, respectively, using this method.

AB This study analyses the technical and economic aspects of a novel subsea freight glider (SFG). The SFG is an excellent replacement for tanker ships and submarine pipelines transporting liquefied CO2. The main aim of the SFG is to ship CO2 from an offshore facility to an underwater well where the gas can be injected; as an advantage, the SFG vehicle may be used to transport all kinds of cargo. The SFG travels below the sea surface, making the vessel weather-independent. The research is divided into two steps. Firstly, the technical feasibility analysis is performed by designing a baseline design with a length of 56.5 m, a beam of 5.5 m, and a cargo volume of 1194 m(3). The SFG is developed using DNVGL-RU-NAVAL-Pt4Ch1, which was initially created for military submarine designs. Two additional half-scaled 469 m(3) and double-scaled 2430 m(3) models are created when the baseline design fulfils the technical requirements. Secondly, the economic analysis is carried out using the freely accessible MUNIN D9.3 and ZEP reports. The economic feasibility analysis is illustrated through a case study with a CO2 transport capacity range of 0.5 to 2.5 mtpa (million tons per annum) and a transport length range of 180 km to 1500 km. The prices of CO2 per ton for the SFG, crew and autonomous tankers, and offshore pipelines are comprehensively compared. According to the results, SFGs with capacities of 469 m(3), 1194 m(3), and 2430 m(3) are technically possible to manufacture. Moreover, the SFGs are competitive with a smaller CO2 capacity of 0.5 mtpa at distances of 180 and 500 km and a capacity of 1 mtpa at a distance of 180 km.

AB The next frontier of maritime networking will see the deployment of large-scale buoy-based mesh networks, with an equal emphasis on both high-speed data transfer and energy-efficiency. One such challenging application is the operation of maritime seismic surveys for oil/gas exploration and academic studies. Large amounts of seismic data are generated at a rate of several Gigabits per second, by nearly 10,000-30,000 seismic sensors that are deployed on the seabed across an area of several hundred square kilometers in offshore oceanic environments. The task of monitoring existing reservoirs and identifying new oil and gas deposits require subsurface images of superior quality, which in turn are dependent on high-quality data for processing. Wireless technology can unlock real-time data transfer for rapid image-viewing, enhanced productivity, and reduced logistical costs. This interdisciplinary article outlines the challenges of marine seismic acquisition and the design of a buoy-based wireless backhaul network for high-rate data transfer over the ocean surface. Based on off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11 systems, a standards-compliant wireless buoy network architecture called Wi-buoy is proposed for real-time, scalable, and energy-efficient data delivery. In order to attain optimal power conservation, a Buoy-Based Power-Saving Backhaul (B-PSB) scheme is also proposed for specifying the operating parameters across all layers of the protocol stack. Essential aspects of the marine propagation environment are reviewed, and the performance of the proposed system is evaluated as a function of the antenna height, wind speed, compression ratio, and various flavors of the IEEE 802.11 standard. Furthermore, the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is analyzed as an integral component of upcoming high-speed buoy-based networks in the maritime environment.

AB Warehouse automation is increasingly adopted to manage throughput fluctuations in e-commerce order fulfillment. This work develops queuing network models and solution methodologies for performance analysis of a stock-to-picker system that connects an upstream automated storage system to a downstream pick station. We focus on the pick station process, quantifying the throughput differences between a pick station that employs a static versus dynamic batching strategy. We consider a waveless order release environment where the item totes are requested from the storage system only when an order arrives. We capture throughput performance in this environment for single as well as multi-line orders with/without item commonality by developing closed-queuing network models. The consolidation of multiple product-lines for a multi-line order is modeled using fork-join synchronization stations within the closed queuing network. For analyzing such queuing networks, we develop a network-decomposition based solution methodology. We validate the models using a simulation model of the upstream storage and downstream order-picking system. We find that in waveless order release environment, dynamic batching always outperforms static batching in terms of system throughput. However, for single-line orders, the percentage gain in the throughput (by implementing dynamic batching) decreases for smaller item tote inter-arrival times. For multi-line orders, dynamic batching increases the system throughput by 37-43%. We also analyze the effect of batch size on the throughput performance. The results indicate that the system throughput increases with an increase in the batch size under both batching policies. But, the marginal benefit reduces as we increase the batch size.

AB Research on the development of plants grown for energy purposes is important for ensuring the global energy supply and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and simulation is an important method to study its potential. This paper evaluated the marginal land that could be used to grow sugarcane in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Based on the meteorological data from 2009 to 2017 in this region and field observations from sugarcane plantations, the sensitivity of the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) model parameters was analyzed by an extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, and the APSIM model was validated for sugarcane phenology and yields. During the process of model validation, the value of the determination coefficient R-2 of the observed and simulated values was between 0.76 and 0.91, and the consistency index D was between 0.91 and 0.97, indicating a good fit. On this basis, the APSIM sugarcane model was used to simulate the sugarcane production potential of the marginal land on a surface scale, and the distribution pattern of sugarcane production potential in the marginal land was obtained. The simulation results showed that if sugarcane was planted as an energy crop on the marginal land in Guangxi, it would likely yield approximately 42,522.05 x 10(4) t of cane stalks per year. It was estimated that the sugarcane grown on the marginal land plus 50% of the sugarcane grown on the cropland would be sufficient to produce approximately 3847.37 x 10(4) t of ethanol fuel. After meeting the demands for vehicle ethanol fuel in Guangxi, 3808.14 x 10(4) t of ethanol fuel would remain and could be exported to the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

AB A repeated bathymetric survey reveals seafloor displacement between before and after geodynamic events. We evaluated the less-known spatial resolution and estimation error of the seafloor displacement observation from a vessel-based multi-narrow beam bathymetric survey. In this evaluation, bathymetric data from vessel-based and near-seafloor high-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based surveys in the same area were used. Simulated vessel-based bathymetric "before and after" data of the seafloor displacement were made using AUV-based bathymetric data. The displacement was verified by comparing these simulated data using the analysis conditions that no locational errors of beam sounding points exist, a footprint effect is uniform, depth accuracy is constant in the analysis area, and there are no depth offset between two data. As a result, we found that the smallest vertical seafloor displacement that can be detected occurs when the horizontal extent of the deformation is larger than several times the size of the footprint (area of the narrow sounding beam projected onto the seafloor) of the used vessel's multi-narrow beam echo sounder, and in the situation that the amplitude of the depth difference is greater than the accuracy of the vessel-based depth measurement (standard deviation of measuring error). When local slopes of the bathymetry are gentler than those of the artificial variation appeared in the depth differences between two data, the horizontal seafloor displacement seems to be difficult to resolve accurately. The local slope of the artificial depth variation is derived from the wavelength and the amplitude which are equivalent to similar to 1-3 times of the footprint size and the accuracy of the depth measurement, respectively.

TI Performance evaluation of SVM-based hand gesture detection and
   recognition system using distance transform on different data sets for
   autonomous vehicle moving applications
SO CIRCUIT WORLD
LA English
DT Article
DE Image processing; Image segmentation
AB Purpose
   This paper aims to propose a novel methodology for classifying the gestures using support vector machine (SVM) classification method. Initially, the Red Green Blue color hand gesture image is converted into YCbCr image in preprocessing stage and then palm with finger region is segmented by threshold process. Then, distance transformation method is applied on the palm with finger segmented image. Further, the center point (centroid) of palm region is detected and the fingertips are detected using SVM classification algorithm based on the detected centroids of the detected palm region.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Gesture is a physical indication of the body to convey information. Though any bodily movement can be considered a gesture, generally it originates from the movement of hand or face or combination of both. Combined gestures are quiet complex and difficult for a machine to classify. This paper proposes a novel methodology for classifying the gestures using SVM classification method. Initially, the color hand gesture image is converted into YCbCr image in preprocessing stage and then palm with finger region is segmented by threshold process. Then, distance transformation method is applied on the palm with finger segmented image. Further, the center point of the palm region is detected and the fingertips are detected using SVM classification algorithm. The proposed hand gesture image classification system is applied and tested on "Jochen Triesch," "Sebastien Marcel" and "11Khands" data set hand gesture images to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed system. The performance of the proposed system is analyzed with respect to sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and recognition rate. The simulation results of the proposed method on these different data sets are compared with the conventional methods.
   Findings
   This paper proposes a novel methodology for classifying the gestures using SVM classification method. Distance transform method is used to detect the center point of the segmented palm region. The proposed hand gesture detection methodology achieves 96.5% of sensitivity, 97.1% of specificity, 96.9% of accuracy and 99.3% of recognition rate on "Jochen Triesch" data set. The proposed hand gesture detection methodology achieves 94.6% of sensitivity, 95.4% of specificity, 95.3% of accuracy and 97.8% of recognition rate on "Sebastien Marcel" data set. The proposed hand gesture detection methodology achieves 97% of sensitivity, 98% of specificity, 98.1% of accuracy and 98.8% of recognition rate on "11Khands" data set. The proposed hand gesture detection methodology consumes 0.52 s as recognition time on "Jochen Triesch" data set images, 0.71 s as recognition time on "Sebastien Marcel" data set images and 0.22 s as recognition time on "11Khands" data set images. It is very clear that the proposed hand gesture detection methodology consumes less recognition rate on "11Khands" data set when compared with other data set images. Hence, this data set is very suitable for real-time hand gesture applications with multi background environments.
   Originality/value
   The modern world requires more numbers of automated systems for improving our daily routine activities in an efficient manner. This present day technology emerges touch screen methodology for operating or functioning many devices or machines with or without wire connections.
   This also makes impact on automated vehicles where the vehicles can be operated without any interfacing with the driver. This is possible through hand gesture recognition system. This hand gesture recognition system captures the real-time hand gestures, a physical movement of human hand, as a digital image and recognizes them with the pre stored set of hand gestures.

AB This paper presents a climbing AUV, which is able to work in both swimming and climbing modes. The key issue in the design of a climbing robot is the choice of a reliable adhesion technique. Due to its great performance as regards payload, motion speed, simple system kinematics and gripping over a wide range of surfaces, a vortex based suction cup is adopted to provide adhesion effect for the climbing motion of the AUV. Since the vortex based suction cup is the core component of the vehicle, this paper mainly focuses on the structural and operational optimization of the suction cup by both Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental validation. The proposed CFD simulation method is firstly verified by uncertainty study. The uncertainty analysis results indicate that the proposed simulation model and settings are reliable as reasonable agreements are found when comparing the computed results from varied grid size, iteration number, and time step cases. The total numerical uncertainties of the CFD simulation method for adhesion force and torque prediction are 1.50% and 1.46% of the average simulated values, respectively. In the CFD simulations, we investigate the effects of some key structural and operational parameters on the adhesion performance of the suction cup, including the vane number of impeller, the shape of cup shell, the adhesion gap (distance between cup bottom and wall surface), and the rotation rate of impeller. It can be concluded that more rotation rate of impeller can generate more adhesion force and more torque; smaller adhesion gap can produce more adhesion force but less torque; cup wall with inclined angle can increase the adhesion force and decrease the torque; the adhesion performance of the suction cup is less sensitive to the vane number of the impeller. CFD simulation results provide the basic design guidelines for the development of suction cup prototype. In the experiments, a specially designed testing platform is built up to validate and compare the performance of a set of suction cup prototypes, varied by different impeller and cup shell combinations. We compare the CFD simulation and experiment results of a 10 vane suction cup at a range of rotation rate conditions. The reasons of the discrepancy between CFD simulation and experiment results are mainly due to the open-loop control of the drive motor and the underestimate of the rotation rate in the experiments. The experimental results indicate that the effects of the structural and operational parameters on the generated adhesion performance are very complicated, and the effect of the structural parameters on the adhesion performance is influenced by the operational parameters, while the rotation rate and the adhesion gap play the key roles.

AB The search for life in new environments, e.g., Mars/Titan, will be scientifically challenging and have great engineering difficulties. In this paper the authors discuss an approach to field-testing methods relevant to three scientific thrusts in the detection of life and pre-biotic organics on other worlds. We describe how this can be accomplished through a series of field trials using a mobile aerial vehicle that is a proxy for the exploration approaches and instrument techniques necessary for the next stage of life detection on other planets. We do this by deploying a mobile organic laboratory on Earth to demonstrate the requisite techniques. We show how terrestrial field trials provide new insights on the colonization by life of fresh volcanic flows, and the competition between biotic and abiotic processes on a newly cooling piece of the Earth's crust. This paper suggests that such work could be very effectively conducted on Hawaii, where the erupted lava is basaltic, an important crustal component for terrestrial planets. The presence of water is generally agreed to be a prerequisite for planetary habitability but the combination of basalt and water is chemically unstable at the temperatures to which basalt cools after eruption. The subsequent chemical reactions occur because the total energy of the products is lower than that of the precursor materials and on Earth biological processes result from organisms harvesting that difference in energy. For life processes to succeed they must out-compete the rate at which abiotic chemistry might accomplish the same tasks. Monitoring the rate at which chemical processes occur is therefore a life-detection approach. Biotic involvement in the rate of weathering of basalts is the test case for this new, generic life detection paradigm. This approach would be applicable to the peri-glacial zones of Mars, if liquid water were proven to be present there. We show that a 15 m autonomous BLIMP could carry various instrument packages including camera, visible spectrometer, tunable diode laser spectrometer (TDLS) for gas and gas isotope analysis, gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GCMS). These could be calibrated followed by ground-truthing using field experiments in the interior of Meteor Crater in Arizona. This well understood system could then study the extreme environment of the still active volcanic caldera of Kilauea and the adjacent older lava flows. For Mars the BLIMP is a proxy for a lighter balloon or even a Martian Rover, which could carry a similar suite of instruments and take a similar set of measurements. For Titan, with its dense and high-molecular weight atmosphere calm winds and low gravity, a BLIMP will be the vehicle of choice. The experiments would be directly relevant. We discuss how a Titan BLIMP could search for organic compounds in the post-Cassini exploration of Titan. (c) 2005 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB "Industry 5.0" is the latest industrial revolution. A variety of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and others, come together to form it. Billions of devices are connected for high-speed data transfer, especially in a 5G-enabled industrial environment for information collection and processing. Most of the issues, such as access control mechanism, time to fetch the data from different devices, and protocols used, may not be applicable in the future as these protocols are based upon a centralized mechanism. This centralized mechanism may have a single point of failure along with the computational overhead. Thus, there is a need for an efficient decentralized access control mechanism for device-to-device (D2D) communication in various industrial sectors, for example, sensors in different regions may collect and process the data for making intelligent decisions. In such an environment, reliability, security, and privacy are major concerns as most of the solutions are based upon a centralized control mechanism. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, this paper provides the opportunities for and highlights some of the most impressive initiatives that help to curve the future. This new era will bring about significant changes in the way businesses operate, allowing them to become more cost-effective, more efficient, and produce higher-quality goods and services. As sensors are getting more accurate, cheaper, and have lower time responses, 5G networks are being integrated, and more industrial equipment and machinery are becoming available; hence, various sectors, including the manufacturing sector, are going through a significant period of transition right now. Additionally, the emergence of the cloud enables modern production models that use the cloud (both internal and external services), networks, and systems to leverage the cloud's low cost, scalability, increased computational power, real-time communication, and data transfer capabilities to create much smarter and more autonomous systems. We discuss the ways in which decentralized networks that make use of protocols help to achieve decentralization and how network meshes can grow to make things more secure, reliable, and cohere with these technologies, which are not going away anytime soon. We emphasize the significance of new design in regard to cybersecurity, data integrity, and storage by using straightforward examples that have the potential to lead to the excellence of distributed systems. This groundbreaking paper delves deep into the world of industrial automation and explores the possibilities to adopt blockchain for developing solutions for smart cities, smart homes, healthcare, smart agriculture, autonomous vehicles, and supply chain management within Industry 5.0. With an in-depth examination of various consensus mechanisms, readers gain a comprehensive understanding of the latest developments in this field. The paper also explores the current issues and challenges associated with blockchain adaptation for industrial automation and provides a thorough comparison of the available consensus, enabling end customers to select the most suitable one based on its unique advantages.

AB In situ sensors capable of real-time measurements and analyses in the deep ocean are necessary to fulfill the potential created by the development of autonomous, deep-sea platforms such as autonomous and remotely operated vehicles, and cabled observatories. Laser Raman spectroscopy (a type of vibrational spectroscopy) is an optical technique that is capable of in situ molecular identification of minerals in the deep ocean. The goals of this work are to determine the characteristic spectral bands and relative Raman scattering strength of hydrothermally and cold seep-relevant minerals, and to determine how the quality of the spectra are affected by changes in excitation wavelength and sampling optics. The information learned from this work will lead to the development of new, smaller sea-going Raman instruments that are optimized to analyze minerals in the deep ocean. Many minerals of interest at seafloor hydrothermal and cold seep sites are Raman active, such as elemental sulfur, carbonates, sulfates and sulfides. Elemental S-8 sulfur is a strong Raman scatterer with dominant bands at similar to 219 and 472 Delta cm(-1). The Raman spectra of carbonates (such as the polymorphs calcite and aragonite) are dominated by vibrations within the carbonate ion with a primary band at similar to 1085 Delta cm(-1). The positions of minor Raman bands differentiate these polymorphs. Likewise, the Raman spectra of sulfates (such as anhydrite, gypsum and barite) are dominated by the vibration of the sulfate ion with a primary band around 1000 Delta cm(-1) (similar to 1017 for anhydrite, similar to 1008 for gypsum, and similar to 988 for barite). Sulfides (pyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, isocubanite, sphalerite, and wurtzite) are weaker Raman scatters than carbonate and sulfate minerals. They have distinctive Raman bands in the similar to 300-500 Delta cm(-1) region. Raman spectra from these mineral species are very consistent in band position and normalized band intensity. High quality Raman spectra are obtained from all of these minerals using both green and red excitation lasers, and using a variety of sampling optics. The highest quality spectra (highest signal-to-noise) were obtained using green excitation (532 nm Nd:YAG laser) and a sampling optic with a short depth of focus (and thus high power density). Significant fluorescence was not observed for the minerals analyzed using green excitation.
   Spectra were also collected from pieces of active and inactive hydrothermal chimneys, recovered from the Kilo Moana vent field in 2005 and 11 degrees N on the East Pacific Rise in 1988, respectively. Profiles of sample J2-137-1-r1-a show the transition from the chalcopyrite-rich "inner" wall to the sphalerite-dominated "outer" wall, and indicate the presence of minor amounts of anhydrite. Spectra collected from sample A2003-7-1a5 identify Cu-S tarnishes present on the surface of the sample. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports unique measurements of albedo, atmospheric solar absorption, and heating rates in the visible (0.4 to 0.7 mu m) and broadband (0.3 to 2.8 mu m) spectral regions using vertically stacked multiple lightweight autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The most significant finding of this study is that when absorbing aerosols and water vapour concentrations are measured accurately and accounted for in models, and when heating rates are measured directly with stacked aircraft, the simulated clear sky heating rates are consistent with the observed broadband heating rates within experimental errors (about 15%). We conclude that there is no need to invoke anomalous or excess absorption or unknown physics in clear skies.
   Aerosol-radiation-cloud measurements were made over the tropical Indian Ocean within the lowest 3 km of the atmosphere during the Maldives Autonomous UAV Campaign (MAC). The UAVs and ground-based remote sensing instruments determined most of the parameters required for calculating the albedo and vertical distribution of solar fluxes. The paper provides a refined analytical procedure to reduce errors and biases due to the offset errors arising from mounting of the radiometers on the aircraft and due to the aircraft attitude. Measured fluxes have been compared with those derived from a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer algorithm which can incorporate both gaseous and aerosol components. Under cloud-free conditions the calculated and measured incoming fluxes agree within 2-10 W m(-2) (<1%) depending upon the altitudes. Similarly, the measured and calculated reflected fluxes agreed within 2-5 W m(-2) (<5%).
   The analysis focuses on a cloud-free day when the air was polluted due to long-range transport from India, and the mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) was 0.31 and mean single scattering albedo was 0.92. The UAV-measured absorption AOD, was 0.019 which agreed within 20% of the value of 0.024 reported by a ground-based instrument. The observed and simulated solar absorption agreed within 5% above 1.0 km and aerosol absorption accounted for 30% to 50% of the absorption depending upon the altitude and solar zenith angle. Thus there was no need to invoke spurious or anomalous absorption, provided we accounted for aerosol black carbon. The diurnal mean absorption values for altitudes between 0.5 and 3.0 km above mean sea level were observed to be 41 +/- 3 W m(-2) (1.5 K/day) in the broadband region and 8 +/- 2 W m(-2) (0.3 K/day) in the visible region. The contribution of absorbing aerosols to the heating rate was an order of magnitude larger than the contribution of CO2 and one-third that of the water vapour. In the lowest 3 km of the tropical atmosphere, aerosols accounted for more than 80% of the atmospheric absorption in the visible region. Copyright (c) 2007 Royal Meteorological Society.

AB Submarine volcanic eruptions are difficult to detect because they are hidden from view at the bottom of the ocean and far from land-based sensors. However, most of Earth's volcanic activity is in the oceans along tectonic plate boundaries, and modern tools of oceanography now allow us to find and study recent eruptions in the deep sea. The first known historical eruption on the Mariana back-arc spreading center was discovered in December 2015 during exploration of the southern back-arc for new hydrothermal vent sites. A water-column survey along the axis of the back-arc showed hydrothermal plumes over the site characterized by low particle concentrations and relatively high reduced chemical anomalies. A dive with the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry collected high-resolution (1 m) multibeam sonar bathymetry over the site, followed by a near-bottom photographic survey of a smaller area. The photo survey revealed the presence of a pristine, dark, glassy lava flow on the seafloor with no sediment cover. Venting of milky hydrothermal fluid indicated that the lava flow was still warm and therefore very young. A comparison of multibeam sonar bathymetry collected by R/V Falkor in December 2015, to the most recent previous survey of the area by R/V Melville in February 2013, revealed large depth changes in the same area, effectively bracketing the timing of the eruption within a window of less than 3 years. The bathymetric comparison shows the eruption produced a string of lava flows with maximum thicknesses of 40-138 m along a distance of 7.3 km (from latitude 15 degrees 22.3' to 15 degrees 26.3'N) between depths of 4050-4450 m bsl (meters below sea level), making this the deepest known historical submarine volcanic eruption on Earth. The cross-axis width of the lava flows is 200-800 m. The Sentry bathymetry shows that the new lava flows are constructed of steep-sided hummocky pillow mounds and are surrounded by older flows with similar morphology. In April and December 2016, two dives were made on the new lava flows by remotely operated vehicles Deep Discoverer and SuBastian. The pillow lavas have many small glassy buds on the steep flanks of the mounds, locally thick accumulations of hydrothermal sediment near the tops of mounds, and small cones of radiating pillows at their summits. The 2015-2016 observations show a rapidly declining hydrothermal system on the lava flows, suggesting that the eruption had occurred only months before its discovery in December 2015. The morphology of the pillow lavas is similar to other historical eruption sites, so the greater depth and ambient pressure of this site had no apparent effect on the processes of lava extrusion and emplacement. This study reveals that some segments of the Mariana back-arc have active magmatic systems despite the relatively low spreading rate, and that other eruptions are possible in the near future.

AB Huabei, located between 32 degrees N and 42 degrees N, is part of eastern China and includes administratively the Beijing and Tianjin Municipalities, Hebei and Shanxi Provinces, and Inner-Mongolia Autonomous Region. Over the past decades, the region has experienced dramatic changes in air quality and climate, and has become a major focus of environmental research in China. Here we present a new inventory of air pollutant emissions in Huabei for the year 2003 developed as part of the project Influence of Pollution on Aerosols and Cloud Microphysics in North China (IPAC-NC).
   Our estimates are based on data from the statistical yearbooks of the state, provinces and local districts, including major sectors and activities of power generation, industrial energy consumption, industrial processing, civil energy consumption, crop straw burning, oil and solvent evaporation, manure, and motor vehicles. The emission factors are selected from a variety of literature and those from local measurements in China are used whenever available. The estimated total emissions in the Huabei administrative region in 2003 are 4.73 Tg SO2, 2.72 Tg NOx (in equivalent NO2), 1.77 Tg VOC, 24.14 Tg CO, 2.03 Tg NH3, 4.57 Tg PM10, 2.42 Tg PM2.5, 0.21 Tg EC, and 0.46 Tg OC.
   For model convenience, we consider a larger Huabei region with Shandong, Henan and Liaoning Provinces included in our inventory. The estimated total emissions in the larger Huabei region in 2003 are: 9.55 Tg SO2, 5.27 Tg NOx (in equivalent NO2), 3.82 Tg VOC, 46.59 Tg CO, 5.36 Tg NH3, 10.74 Tg PM10, 5.62 Tg PM2.5, 0.41 Tg EC, and 0.99 Tg OC. The estimated emission rates are projected into grid cells at a horizontal resolution of 0.1 degrees latitude by 0.1 degrees longitude. Our gridded emission inventory consists of area sources, which are classified into industrial, civil, traffic, and straw burning sectors, and large industrial point sources, which include 345 sets of power plants, iron and steel plants, cement plants, and chemical plants.
   The estimated regional NO2 emissions are about 2-3% (administrative Huabei region) or 5% (larger Huabei region) of the global anthropogenic NO2 emissions. We compare our inventory (IPAC-NC) with the global emission inventory EDGAR-CIRCE and the Asian emission inventory INTEX-B. Except for a factor of 3 lower EC emission rate in comparison with INTEX-B, the biases of the total emissions of most primary air pollutants in Huabei estimated in our inventory, with respect to EDGAR-CIRCE and INTEX-B, generally range from -30% to +40%. Large differences up to a factor of 2-3 for local emissions in some areas (e. g. Beijing and Tianjin) are found. It is recommended that the inventories based on the activity rates and emission factors for each specific year should be applied in future modeling work related to the changes in air quality and atmospheric chemistry over this region.

AB Fissures and faults provide insight into how plate separation is accommodated by magmatism and brittle deformation during crustal accretion. Although fissure and fault geometry can be used to quantify the spreading process at mid-ocean ridges, accurate measurements are rare due to insufficiently detailed mapping data. Here, fissures and faults at the fast-spreading 9 degrees 50'N segment of the East Pacific Rise were mapped using bathymetric data collected at 1-m horizontal resolution by autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry. Fault dip estimates from the bathymetric data were calibrated using co-registered near-bottom imagery and depth transects acquired by remotely operated vehicle Jason. Fissures are classified as either eruptive or non-eruptive (i.e., cracks). Tectonic strain estimated from corrected fault heaves suggests that faulting plays a negligible role in the plate separation on crust younger than 72 kyr (<4 km from the ridge axis). Pre-and post-eruption surveys show that most fissures were reactivated during the eruptions in 2005-2006. Variable eruptive fissure geometry could be explained by the frequency with which each fissure is reactivated and partially infilled. Fissure swarms and lava plateaus in low-relief areas >2 km from the ridge are spatially associated with off-axis lower-crustal magma lenses identified in multichannel seismic data. Deep, closely spaced fissures overlie a relatively shallow portion of the axial magma lens. The width of on-axis fissures and inferred subsurface dike geometry imply a similar to 9-year long diking recurrence interval to fully accommodate plate spreading, which is broadly consistent with cycle intervals obtained from estimates of melt extraction rates, eruption volumes, and spreading rate.
   Plain Language Summary New oceanic crust is created by seafloor spreading at mid-ocean ridges, where lava erupts as the tectonic plates spread apart. Plate separation is accommodated by a combination of slip along dipping faults and the opening of magma-filled cracks, called dikes. We present bathymetric and profile mapping data collected from near the seafloor on a volcanically active portion of the East Pacific Rise near 9 degrees 50'N. The data show faults and fissures (i.e., open cracks) in remarkable detail, with meter-scale resolution. A total of 707 fissures and 42 faults were identified and measured, suggesting that the amount of plate separation accommodated by faulting is minimal compared to that by dike intrusion causing open cracks. About one-third of the fissures mapped are located within the region covered by the most recent eruptions in 2005-2006, and most of these fissures seem to have been reactivated from previous eruptions. Based on measurements of fissure width, we estimate that the interval between diking events is similar to 9 years, which agrees with previous independent estimates. The analysis in this study reveals the relative importance of faults and fissures in seafloor spreading, and in the magmatic cycles that continuously re-pave the ocean floor.

AB With the development of communications, various applications of communication technologies, such as remote driving, delivery drones, and telesurgery, are emerging. In particular, in many cases, these applications need real-time video transmission services, and they should support low latency for operation reliability and quick response in emergencies. Sensor sharing is required to support advanced communication services, but the latency analysis of device-to-remote users or remote servers with high data traffic is insufficient. Most related works have device-to-device communication or low data traffic messages for basic device status sharing. However, the latency analysis of sensor sharing between a device and a remote server or remote user is essential to support advanced communication services such as autonomous driving utilizing data offloading and device operation by remote users via the base station and server. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the end-to-end latency and latency elements for video sharing, which is the most representative sensor in 4G long-term evolution (LTE) and 5G new radio (NR) Uu interfaces. In addition, we derive the supportable video resolution according to the raw video and encoded video transmission in each communication system. For each video resolution level, we analyze which latency elements have a significant effect on the end-to-end latency. Depending on each communication system, we investigate the number of users for the real-time sensor-sharing system that can be supported at the same time. Simulation results show that the LTE Uu interface supports up to full high definition (FHD) video resolution, and the 5G Uu interface supports up to ultrahigh definition (UHD). Additionally, the results show that only a single user can be supported with the FHD resolution level in the LTE Uu interface, whereas up to 19 users can be supported in the 5G Uu interface.

AB This research article presents a novel solution of controller design for the autonomous path-following maneuver of a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robotic (WMR) system subjected to static and dynamic obstacles. Currently, autonomously operated nonholonomic vehicles, capable of completing tasks avoiding collisions, are deployed for low-profile household applications to sophisticated space missions. The geometrically constrained path-following controller with embedded intelligence for collision avoidance is designed based on a twofold hybrid control law. The hybrid control law combines the feedback linearization controller (FBC) with the fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The feedback linearization controller helps the mobile robot to remain on its desired path, while the fuzzy logic controller helps the mobile robot to avoid critical obstacles around the reference path. It is analytically proven that the proposed hybrid control law converges the robot asymptotically to the desired path when it is safely away from obstacles. Further, when the robot detects an obstacle in its sensing range, obstacle avoidance control law acts locally and it deviates itself from the desired path to avoid collision assuring stability through a bounded tracking control law. Considering bounded sensor measurement uncertainties during obstacle detection, it is observed that the fuzzy logic-based collision-avoidance algorithm behaves in a robust manner. The hybrid controller is designed and tested in a simulated environment with the real-life parameters of a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robot. The robot is capable of traversing through the geometrically constrained desired paths avoiding obstacles in an improved manner compared to the existing method. Moreover, the robot is also capable of returning back to its original path when obstacles are safely away. The performance of the novel hybrid control strategy is illustrated for several geometrically constrained paths via simulation to show its effectiveness in terms of fulfilling dual objectives of path following and simultaneous collision avoidance in an improved manner.

AB The internal combustion engine faces increasing societal and governmental pressure to improve both efficiency and engine out emissions. Currently, research has moved from traditional combustion methods to new highly efficient combustion strategies such as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI). However, predicting the exact value of engine out emissions using conventional physics-based or data-driven models is still a challenge for engine researchers due to the complexity the of combustion and emission formation. Research has focused on using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for this problem but ANN's require large training datasets for acceptable accuracy. This work addresses this problem by presenting the development of a simple model for predicting the steady-state emissions of a single cylinder HCCI engine which is created using an metaheuristic optimization based Support Vector Machine (SVM). The selection of input variables to the SVM model is explored using five different feature sets, considering up to seven engine inputs. The best results are achieved with a model combining linear and squared inputs as well as cross correlations and their squares totaling 26 features. In this case the model fit represented by R-2 values were between 0.72 and 0.95. The best model fits were achieved for CO and CO2, while HC and NOx models have reduced model performance. Linear and non-linear SVM models were then compared to an ANN model. This comparison showed that SVM based models were more robust to changes in feature selection and better able to avoid local minimums compared to the ANN models leading to a more consistent model prediction when limited training data is available. The proposed machine learning based HCCI emission models and the feature selection approach provide insight into optimizing the model accuracy while minimizing the computational costs.

AB According to a shared functionalist view in philosophy of mind, a cognitive system, and cognitive function thereof, is based on the components of the organism it is realized by which, indeed, play a causal role in regulating our cognitive processes. This led philosophers to suggest also that, thus, cognition could be seen as an extended process, whose vehicle can extend not only outside the brain but also beyond bodily boundaries, on different kinds of devices. This is what we call the 'Externally Extended Cognition Thesis.' This notion has generated a lively debate. Here, we offer a novel notion of extended cognition, according to which cognition can be seen as being realized (and expanded) outside the brain, but still inside the body. This is what we call the 'Internally Extended Cognition Thesis'. Not only our thesis but also our approach while defending it is innovative. The argument we offer is supported by recent empirical findings in the life sciences and biomedicine, which suggest that the gut microbiota's activity has a functional role in regulating our cognitive processes and behaviors. In doing so, we embrace the holobiont-perspective, according to which it is possible to claim that what we call biological individuals are not autonomous entities with clear boundaries, but should rather be seen as networks of multiple interactions among species. Thus, by analyzing different sets of evidence in light of the holobiont-perspective, we argue that the gut microbiota could be seen as a component of our organism. On the basis of the philosophical interpretation of this evidence, however, we also suggest that there are no impediments standing the way of considering the gut microbiota also as a functional extension of our cognitive system. If so, this amounts to extending cognition out of 'our skull', though still confining it within 'our body': to 'our gut'. This is an instance of the 'Internally Extended Cognition Thesis,' whose benefits for an original (biologically informed) theory of extended cognition are discussed.

AB The use of a multi-functional autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a platform for making turbulence measurements in the ocean is developed. The layout optimization of the turbulence package and platform motion performance are limitation problems in turbulent AUV design. In this study, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method has been used to determine the optimized layout position and distance of the shear probe integrated into an AUV. When placed 0.8 D ahead of the AUV nose along the axis, the shear probe is not influenced by flow distortion and can contact the water body first. To analyze the motion of the turbulence AUV, the dynamic model of turbulence AUV for planar flight is obtained. Then, the mathematical equations of speed and angle of attack under steady-state motion have also been obtained. By calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients of the turbulence AUV and given system parameters, the simulation analysis has been conducted. The simulation results demonstrated that the speed of turbulent AUV is 0.5-1 m/s, and the maximum angle of attack is less than 6.5 degrees, which meets the observation requirements of the shear probe. In addition, turbulence AUV conducted a series of sea-trials in the northern South China Sea to illustrate the validity of the design and measurement. Two continuous profiles (1000 m) with a horizontal distance of 10 km were completed, and numerous high-quality spatiotemporal turbulence data were obtained. These profiles demonstrate the superior flight performance of turbulence AUV. Analysis shows that the measured data are of high quality, with the shear spectra being in very good agreement with the Nasmyth spectrum. Dissipation rates are consistent with background shear. When shear velocity is weak, the measurement of dissipation rate is 10(-10) W Kg(-1). All indications are that the turbulence AUV is suitable for long-term, contiguous ocean microstructure measurements, which will provide data needed to understand the temporal and spatial variability of the turbulent processes in the oceans.
