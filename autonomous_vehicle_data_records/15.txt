AB Automated self-driving vehicles not only allow of improved energy saving but also better traffic flow. In particular, with the rapid technological advance of autonomous self-driving, technical development of efficient energy consumption for fully electric vehicles (EVs) is becoming progressively important for due to the limited battery capacity and power of EVs. This article proposes a hybrid approach using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for improving the energy economy of the EVs. In this study, the MPC algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem for the speed control of the EVs for minimization of energy consumption in a receding horizon, where the cost value of the horizon is fed into the DRL networks as observed state. Thus, the terminal cost of a state is learned by nearest neighbors and the terminal condition is constrained in a state observed before. The proposed scheme was tested virtually with the high fidelity car simulator (CarSim) and the remaining power of the battery source was sensed during tracing the given track in real-time. Two algorithms for performance evaluation are quantitatively explored and compared in terms of battery energy-saving. The simulation results show that the eco-driving strategy for energy saving of the EVs can be established on road driving in real-time. The performance of energy-saving about average 1% and 17% under simple uphill climbing and multiple ascents and descents, respectively. The results, as an energy efficient planning strategy of the future autonomous and intelligent eco-driving for the EVs, might be possible for guiding and significant practice. (c) 2022 The Author.

AB We developed an environmentally adaptive under-ice navigation framework that was deployed in the Arctic Beaufort Sea during the United States Navy Ice Exercise in March 2020 (ICEX20). This navigation framework contained two subsystems developed from the ground up: (1) an on-board hydrodynamic model-aided navigation (HydroMAN) engine, and (2) an environmentally and acoustically adaptive integrated communication and navigation network (ICNN) that provided acoustic navigation aiding to the former. The HydroMAN synthesized measurements from an inertial navigation system (INS), ice-tracking Doppler velocity log (DVL), ICNN and pressure sensor into its self-calibrating vehicle flight dynamic model to compute the navigation solution. The ICNN system, which consisted of four ice buoys outfitted with acoustic modems, trilaterated the vehicle position using the one-way-travel-times (OWTT) of acoustic datagrams transmitted by the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and received by the ice buoy network. The ICNN digested salinity and temperature information to provide model-assisted real-time OWTT range conversion to deliver accurate acoustic navigation updates to the HydroMAN. To decouple the contributions from the HydroMAN and ICNN subsystems towards a stable navigation solution, this article evaluates them separately: (1) HydroMAN was compared against DVL bottom-track aided INS during pre-ICEX20 engineering trials where both systems provided similar accuracy; (2) ICNN was evaluated by conducting a static experiment in the Arctic where the ICNN navigation updates were compared against GPS with ICNN error within low tens of meters. The joint HydroMAN-ICNN framework was tested during ICEX20, which provided a nondiverging high-resolution navigation solution-with the majority of error below 15 m-that facilitated a successful AUV recovery through a small ice hole after an 11 km untethered run in the upper and mid-water column.

AB This paper studies the scheduling of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) at hospitals where the stochastic travel times and service times of AMRs are affected by the surrounding environment. The routes of AMRs are planned to minimize the daily cost of the hospital (including the AMR fixed cost, penalty cost of violating the time window, and transportation cost). To efficiently generate high-quality solutions, some properties are identified and incorporated into an improved tabu search (I-TS) algorithm for problem-solving. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the I-TS algorithm outperforms existing methods by producing high-quality solutions. Based on the characteristics of healthcare requests and the AMR working environment, scheduling AMRs reasonably can effectively provide medical services, improve the utilization of medical resources, and reduce hospital costs.

AB This article presents the kinematics model and control simulation of a hydraulic boom. This hydraulic boom is used on the logging harvester, which is a typical forestry vehicle. The kinematics equations of the hydraulic boom and the transformation between joint variables and hydraulic cylinder variables are obtained for the control purpose. An autonomous control method is suggested for the harvesting head to capture trunks. There are two separate closed loops in the control scheme: the inner closed loop realizes the control on the hydraulic cylinders, and the outer loop plans the desired trajectory of the harvesting head to capture trunks based on the laser measurement data. An interactive real-time dynamic simulation system is developed, and the proposed control method is verified.

AB The aim of this research was to identify potential external features on a fully autonomous vehicle (FAV) and investigate which features would help pedestrians to understand the intended behavior of a FAV at a crosswalk, improve their receptivity toward FAVs, and affect their crossing behavior. In the case of a FAV, technology may be primarily responsible for control of a vehicle, and therefore, interpersonal communication is not possible. The researchers wanted to identify potential interface/s on FAVs to make pedestrian-FAV interaction positive, in which pedestrians receive a clear message about the vehicle's intended action. In an experimental study, thirty participants walked across a virtual crosswalk in front of a FAV. Four visual and four audible features were tested. At the beginning of the study, the participants responded to a baseline receptivity survey, and at the end, they replied to a demographic questionnaire and a pedestrian behavior questionnaire, gave ratings for the features, and completed a personal innovativeness scale and an after-study receptivity survey. Crossing time and waiting time were collected from the simulator data. The results showed that pedestrians' receptivity toward FAVs significantly increased with the inclusion of external features. A walking silhouette or 'braking' in text were the most favored visual interfaces, while a verbal message was found to be the preferred audible feature. Females and people from 30+ age group reacted the most positively to the features. Those pedestrians who often commit errors or who show aggressive behaviors toward other road users rated the implementation of FAVs poorly, even with the external features. On the other hand, pedestrians who intentionally violate traffic rules and those who get distracted on the road were found to be more cautious in the presence of FAVs and appreciated the inclusion of the external features.

TI A Novel Network scheduling Approach Based on Genetic Algorithm for

SO IEEE ACCESS

DT Article
DE Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); network scheduling; genetic
   algorithm; heading motion control
ID IDENTIFICATION; AUV
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is one type of important equipments for conducting ocean exploration missions. The AUV control system typically employs a common communication network to connect various function nodes such as Doppler meter, compass/inertial navigation unit, sonar, water depth sensor, main propulsion, and rudder motor. Each of these function nodes has its own information transmission requirements that need to be served by the limited bandwidth of the common communication network. In order to obtain a good control performance, an elaborate information transmission schedule in the communication network should be planned in such a way that all information transmission requirements in the AUV control system can be satisfied with as less network-induced delay and data packet dropout as possible. This paper proposes a novel network scheduling approach based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the time-triggered architecture for meeting information transmission requirements in the Controller Area Network (CAN) of the AUV control system. The proposed network scheduling approach divides the whole transmission period into a serial of time slices with equal lengths, and defines a large cycle consisting of multiple time slices. For the periodical information transmission, the transmission schedule in one large cycle is determined by solving one nonlinear integer optimization problem with the Genetic Algorithm. This GA-based network scheduling approach maximizes the available bandwidth of each single time slice in all the periodic time slices of the whole schedule period, and aims to achieve a balanced information transmission in the CAN network. Meanwhile, the available bandwidth in each time slice of the whole schedule period is then allocated for the event-triggered information transmission. In this way, the proposed network scheduling approach satisfies the transmission requirements of both periodical and event-triggered information in the AUV. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed GA based network scheduling approach, and verify its performance improvement on an AUV heading motion control using TrueTime toolbox.

AB Light Detection And Ranging sensors (lidar) are key to autonomous driving, but their data is severely impacted by weather events (rain, fog, snow). To increase the safety and availability of self-driving vehicles, the analysis of the phenomena consequences at stake is necessary. This paper presents experiments performed in a climatic chamber with lidars of different technologies (spinning, Risley prisms, micro-motion and MEMS) that are compared in various artificial rain and fog conditions. A specific target with calibrated reflectance is used to make a first quantitative analysis. We observe different results depending on the sensors, valuable multi-echo information, and unexpected behaviors in the analysis with artificial rain are seen where higher rain rates do not necessarily mean higher degradations on lidar data.

AB In recent years, tech evangelists have made headlines predicting that in the future manual driving will be outlawed. This essay will investigate the question whether a ban of human driven cars can be defended on moral grounds in a future scenario in which autonomous cars are going to be significantly safer than manually driven cars. This article will argue that in such a future scenario manually driven cars, for moral reasons, indeed should be banned from participating in regular traffic. Since the moral argument for outlawing manually driven cars will likely be met by resistance by car-aficionados, in the final part of the paper, we are devising a proposal for reconciling the strong moral case for a ban of manually driven cars with the widespread fondness of manual driving.

AB For a maneuvering unmanned autonomous helicopter, it is necessary to design a proper controller for each flight mode. In this paper, the overall helicopter dynamics is derived and a hovering model is linearized and transformed into a state-space form. However, since it is difficult to obtain parameters for stability derivatives in the state-space directly, a linear control model is derived by a time-domain parametric system identification method with real flight data of a model helicopter. Then, two different controllers (a linear feedback controller with the proportional gain and a robust controller) are designed and their performances are compared. The simulation results show outstanding performance. The validated controllers can be utilized to enable autonomous flight of a RUAV (Rotorcraft-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB For various threats in the enemy defense area, in order to achieve covert penetration and implement effective combat against enemy, the unmanned aerial vehicles formation needs to be reconfigured in the process of penetration; the mutual collision avoidance problems and communication constraint problems among the formation also need to be considered. By establishing the virtual-leader formation model, this paper puts forward distributed model predictive control and finite state machine formation manager. Combined with distributed cooperative strategy establishing the formation reconfiguration cost function, this paper proposes that adopting the revised quantum-behaved particle swarm algorithm solves the cost function, and it is compared with the result which is solved by particle swarm algorithm. Simulation result shows that this algorithm can control multiple UAVs formation autonomous reconfiguration effectively and achieve covert penetration safely.

AB Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUVs), also known as Underwater Vehicle Manipulator Systems (UVMSs), are an alternative for reducing costs and increasing safety in underwater operations which require dexterous manipulation. Beyond the well-posed and currently studied manipulation scenarios, the cooperative underwater transportation is a promising and challenging task, still not extensively explored. This paper aims to contribute to this latter problem by addressing the modeling and control system design of a cooperative underwater transportation performed by two planar I-AUVs, each of them composed by an AUV linked to a 2-Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) serial manipulator. A hierarchical approach for deriving the equations of motion through the Modular Modeling Methodology (MMM) is presented. Also, a complete coordination scheme composed of the Inverse Kinematics (IK) and motion control modules is proposed. A new IK control is formulated on the jerk level with the Super-Twisting Algorithm (STA) to prevent numerical drift and uncertainties while considering secondary objectives. The low-level motion control is synthesized within a continuous Sliding Mode Control (SMC) algorithm to compensate for the modeling errors and external disturbances. The coordination scheme is verified through numerical simulation considering a scenario in which an object is transported by the two I-AUVs over a predefined path. The analysis is made more realistic by considering the thrusters and motors dynamics along with sensors measurements, sampling effects and an optimal state estimator. Modeling errors and external disturbances are also considered in the analysis. The results reveal the suitability of the proposed modeling and coordination approaches for numerical simulation and control of the I-AUVs during underwater transportation.

AB This study addresses the platoon formation control problem of multiple off-axle hitching tractor-trailers with limited communication ranges, under model uncertainties and external disturbances, without any collision and without velocity and acceleration measurements for the first time. Towards this end, a new second-order Euler-Lagrange formulation of tractor-trailers is introduced under the prescribed performance design procedure that preserves all structural properties of the tractor-trailer dynamics. Then, a prescribed performance non-linear transformation, a saturated filtered tracking error, radial basis function neural networks, an adaptive robust controller, and a high-gain observer are creatively employed to design a novel platoon output-feedback controller, which forces the vehicles to construct a desired convoy while guaranteeing the robust performance against unmodelled dynamics and external forces and ensuring inter-vehicular communication maintenance, collision avoidance between each successive pair in the convoy of vehicles, and some preassigned desired response specifications of platoon formation errors including overshoot/undershoot, convergence speed, and ultimate tracking accuracy. By utilising a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, a semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of formation errors is ensured with prescribed performance. Finally, simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control system.

ID VEHICLE TRACKING; LIDAR; BEHAVIOR
AB The roadside Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor can provide the high-resolution micro traffic data (HRMTD) of all road users by collecting real-time point clouds in three-dimensional (3D) space. The HRMTD collected by the roadside LiDAR provides a solution to fill the data gap under the mixed situation (both connected vehicles and unconnected vehicles exist on the roads) for connected vehicle technologies. Lane identification is important information in HRMTD. The current lane identification algorithms are mainly developed for autonomous vehicles, which could not be directly used to process roadside LiDAR data. This article provides an innovative algorithm to automatically identify traffic lanes for the roadside LiDAR data. The proposed lane identification algorithm includes five major steps: background filtering, point clustering, object classification, frame aggregation, and traversal search. The parameters used in the algorithm are selected by balancing the time cost and the accuracy. With the GPS information, the location of the lane can be transferred into the GoogleEarth and be compared with the location of the lane in real world. The testing results showed that the average distance error (ADE) compared to the real location in Google Earth was less than 0.1 m. This robust lane identification can release engineers from the manual lane identification task and avoid any error caused by manual work. The extracted lane locations can be used for researchers and practitioners to locate the vehicles precisely in different applications.

AB This study investigates the effect of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) platoon characteristics on the fundamental diagram under mixed traffic flow. First, a new platoon intensity of CAVs is developed to measure the clustering strength of CAVs. Second, a new traffic flow model is proposed based on the Markov chain, which determines the proportion of vehicles with different car-following modes. Third, a fundamental diagram model is deduced to consider the influence of platoon intensity and platoon size of CAVs. Then, numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the impact of relevant factors (i.e., platoon intensity, platoon size, platoon management strategy, and penetration rate of CAVs) on the fundamental diagram. Finally, the simulation experiments are designed to verify the theoretical model. The results show that (1) platoon intensity, platoon size, and the penetration rate of CAVs have a positive effect on improving traffic capacity; (2) a platoon size of 2-4 with a fixed platoon intensity of 0.5 significantly improves the capacity of mixed traffic flow.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID TRACKING; SYSTEM
AB Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an underactuated multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system which has nonlinear dynamic behavior such as high coupling degree and unknown nonlinearities. It is a great challenge to design a quadrotor control system due to these features. In this paper, the contribution is focused on the backstepping-based robust control design of the quadrotor UAV. Firstly, the dynamic model of the aerial vehicle is mathematically formulated. Then, a robust controller is designed for the stabilization and tracking control of the vehicle. The developed robust control system comprises a backstepping and a proportional-derivative (PD) controller. Backstepping is a recursive design methodology that uses Lyapunov theorem which can guarantee the stability of the nominal model system, while PD control is used to attenuate the effects caused by system uncertainties. For the problem of determining the backstepping control parameters, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been employed. In addition, the genetic algorithm (GA) technique is also adopted for the purpose of performance comparison with PSO scheme. Finally, the designed controller is experimentally evaluated on a quadrotor simulation environment to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the theoretical development.

AB The concept of smart cities is to enhance the life quality of residents and provide efficient services by integrating advanced information and communication technologies, autonomous robots, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, etc. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a class of autonomous flying mobile robots that bring a lot of benefits to smart cities due to their mobility, accessibility, autonomy, and many other advantages. Their integration allows for accomplishing hard and complex tasks that humans or other entities are not able to complete. In most applications, multiple connected UAVs are required to build a network under which missions are completed and tasks are shared. This network can be established by finding the optimal UAV placement that meets some requirements such as user coverage, UAV connectivity, energy, and load distribution. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm, called IMRFO-TS, based on the hybridization of Improved Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (IMRFO) with the Tabu Search (TS) algorithm for solving the UAV placement problem in a smart city. First, the tangential control strategy is incorporated into the original MRFO algorithm to enhance its convergence speed and explore the search space effectively. Second, The TS algorithm is hybridized with the IMRFO algorithm to increase the exploitation capability of IMRFO and improve the best solution (placement quality) obtained after each iteration. The performance of the proposed IMRFO-TS algorithm is validated using 52 benchmarks considering the fitness value, coverage, connectivity, energy consumption, and load distribution parameters. Compared to eight well-known optimization meta-heuristics such as the original MRFO, TS algorithm, Bat Algorithm (BA), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA), the results of the experiments revealed the significant superiority of the proposed IMRFO-TS algorithm by obtaining promising solutions (optimal positions of UAVs) in the majority of the cases.

AB Benthopelagic animals are an important component of the deep-sea ecosystem, yet are notoriously difficult to study. Multibeam echosounders (MBES) deployed on autonomous underwater vehicles represent a promising technology for monitoring this elusive fauna at relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. However, application of this remote-sensing technology to the study of small (relative to the sampling resolution), dispered and mobile animals at depth does not come without significant challenges with respect to data collection, data processing and vessel avoidance. As a proof of concept, we used data from a downward-looking RESON SeaBat 7125 MBES mounted on a Dorado-class AUV to detect and characterise the location and movement of backscattering targets (which were likely to have been individual fish or squid) within 50 m of the seafloor at -800 m similar to depth in Monterey Bay, California. The targets were detected and tracked, enabling their numerical density and movement to be characterised. The results revealed aconsistent movement of targets downwards away from the AUV that we interpreted as an avoidance response. The large volume and complexity of the data presented a computational challenge, while reverberation and noise, spatial confounding and a marginal sampling resolution relative to the size of the targets caused difficulties for reliable and comprehensive target detection and tracking. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate that an AUV-mounted MBES has the potential to proide unique and detailed information on the in situ abundance, distribution, size and behaviour of both individual and aggregated deep-sea benthopelagic animals. We provide detailed data-processing information for thse interested in working with MBES water-column data, and a critical appraisal of the data in the context of aquatic ecosystem research. We consider future directions for deep-sea water-column echosounding, and renforce the importance of measures to mitigate vessel avoidance in studies of aquatic ecosystems.

AB The ability to perform autonomous mission planning is considered one or the key enabling technologies for uninhabited aerial systems. Subsequently, a big effort is made in the development of algorithms capable of computing safe and efficient routes in terms of distance, time, and fuel. In this paper an innovative 3-D planning algorithm is presented. The algorithm is based on considering the uninhabited aerial systems representation of real world systems as objects moving in a virtual environment (terrain, obstacles, and no fly zones), which replicates the airspace. Original obstacle avoidance strategies have been conceived to generate mission plans that are consistent with flight rules and with the vehicle performance constraints. Simulation test results show that efficient routes are computed in a few seconds.

TI Improving EDCA for Efficient Channel Access in Vehicular Communications

DT Article
AB With the development of artificial intelligence, loT, and high-performance computing, modern vehicles are becoming more and more connected and autonomous, which is deeply dependent on wireless communications for information exchange and sharing between the vehicle and the surrounding environment. IEEE 802.11p is a standard protocol designed for low latency and high mobility of vehicular communications. However, the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) of 802.11p with static access category queue allocation and fixed backoff parameter setting cannot meet the requirement of efficient vehicular channel access. In light of this, we improve EDCA by prioritizing messages and adjusting backoff window values dynamically to guarantee the timely delivery of real-time messages. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism has higher throughput and lower transmission delay for efficient vehicular communications.

AB Covert communications can hide the existence of a transmission from the transmitter to receiver. This paper considers an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) covert communication system. It was inspired by the high-dimensional data processing and decision-making capabilities of the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. In order to improve the covert communication performance, an UAV 3D trajectory and IRS phase optimization algorithm based on double deep Q network (TAP-DDQN) is proposed. The simulations show that TAP-DDQN can significantly improve the covert performance of the IRS-assisted UAV covert communication system, compared with benchmark solutions.

AB This paper proposes a novel control mechanism for the reliable and stable operation of isolated microgrid (MG) systems, which face higher operational complexity due to the involvement of intermittent and uncertain renewable energy sources. The proposed control approach is based on a scaling factor-based fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative with filter-(one plus integral) controller designed using the Prairie dog optimization algorithm. The MG system comprises a biodiesel engine generator, solar photovoltaics, wind turbine generator as distributed generation unit, ultra-capacitor, and flywheel are included as energy storage systems. The performance of the proposed controller is examined with other state-of-the-art control approaches in various real-time scenarios. In addition, the effectiveness of the controller during the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the MG has been analyzed. Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed approach has been confirmed by testing various scenarios for robustness analysis. The results indicate that the proposed controller outperforms other approaches and achieves minimum settling time (10.25 s), undershoot (0.0037 Hz), and overshoot (0.0006 Hz) after the integration of EVs. Overall, the proposed control approach demonstrates its effectiveness to sustain the robust operation of autonomous microgrid system.

AB This paper presents a hybrid time-of-arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) cooperative localization algorithm, termed HTACL, for the multiple-autonomous-underwater-vehicle (multi-AUV) navigation in the absence of anchors (devices with known positions). Compared with traditional TOA-based methods, the joint use of TOA and AOA measurements improves the quality of position prediction and inter-AUV relative position information in localization. Specifically, by exploring the relationship between AOA measurements and AUV attitudes, the impact of the accumulated errors in inertial measurements on the position prediction is alleviated. Moreover, the directivity and resolution of relative position representation is improved through involving AOA information. As a result, the localization accuracy can be improved by HTACL. The design of HTACL also considers the influence of the long propagation delay during AUV cooperation to enhance its adaptability to harsh underwater environments. Moreover, HTACL is naturally distributed and with good scalability. The above features make it applicable and suitable for multi-AUV localization issues. Through various simulations, the advantages of HTACL are verified and it could stably provide better localization accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art alternative methods under different conditions.

AB Due to the receding sea-ice extent in the Arctic, and the potentially large undiscovered petroleum resources present north of the Arctic circle, offshore activities in ice-infested waters are increasing. Due to the presence of drifting sea-ice and icebergs, ice management (IM) becomes an important part of the offshore operation, and an important part of an TM system is the ability to reliably monitor the ice conditions. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has a unique capability of high underwater spatial and temporal coverage, making it suitable for monitoring applications. Since the first Arctic AUV deployment in 1972, AUV technology has matured and has been used in complex under-ice operations. This paper motivates the use of AUVs as an ice-monitoring sensor platform. It discusses relevant sensor capabilities and challenges related to communication and navigation. This paper also presents experiences from a field campaign that took place in Ny-Alesund at Svalbard in January 2014, where a REMUS 100 AUV was used for sea-floor mapping and collection of oceanographic parameters. Based on this, we discuss the experiences related to using AUVs for ice-monitoring. We conclude that AUVs are highly applicable for ice-monitoring, but further research is needed.

ID LOCATION PRIVACY
AB The pervasive capabilities and myriad of mission performance abilities of Unmanned (Combat) Aerial Vehicles (UAVs/UCAVs) have exponentially grown their deployment possibilities in the recent past. Advancements in artificial intelligence, sensing technologies and autonomous guidance, navigation and control capabilities have further fueled wide-scale deployments of UAVs, both for military and commercial applications, ranging from autonomous air taxis and cargo deliveries to intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat missions. Most of these applications consume Global Nav-igation Satellite System (GNSS) based location information for their services, which is also shared in real-time with ground control stations and centralized service operators, often using insecure communication channels. This limitation has significantly raised the location privacy concerns of aerial vehicles, deployed to conduct user-centric, safety-critical and localization-sensitive operations. A compromise of location privacy of a UAV can pose serious threats, including stalking, theft or damage of UAV/payload or even use of GNSS-guided munitions. These emerging threats call for robust and trust-worthy solutions for preserving the location privacy of aerial vehicles.
   This paper proposes a novel obfuscation-based mechanism to safeguard location information against privacy attacks. Our proposed solution conceals actual information by transmitting modified location parameters, either after diluting their accuracy or by fabricating deceptive trajectories for a known eavesdropper. Based on these two broad categories, defined as Attenuation and Deception based obfuscation techniques respectively, we also present a novel taxonomy of 3D obfuscation mechanisms, supported by formal descriptions of underlying operators. The operators can be used independently or in conjunction to satisfy diverse mission-specific obfuscation profiles. The proposed operators have been practically implemented and evaluated using a customizable obfuscator deployed over a Global Positioning System (GPS) guided UAV. The field experiments validate the efficacy, security and deployability of the proposed solution against location-privacy threats. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce a novel distributed control architecture for heterogeneous platoons of linear time-invariant autonomous vehicles. Our approach is based on a generalization of the concept of leader-follower controllers for which we provide a Youla-like parameterization, while the sparsity constraints are imposed on the controller's left coprime factors, outlining a new concept of structural constraints in distributed control. The proposed scheme is amenable to optimal controller design via norm based costs, it guarantees string stability and eliminates the accordion effect from the behavior of the platoon. We also introduce a synchronization mechanism for the exact compensation of the time delays induced by the wireless communications.

AB The Cranfield University torpedo-shaped underwater vehicle has been modified to accommodate a laser stripe illumination system. As well as providing enhanced viewing capabilities, this system derives real-time navigational data during the mission and gathers images to produce a post mission enhanced optical waterfall image of a surveyed area.
   This paper describes a preliminary set of constrained motion trials at the IFREMER wave basin in Brest, where the system was towed through the 50 m test tank at different altitudes and orientations whilst the true trajectory was measured. A comparison is made between ground truth trajectory generated from these external measurements and that derived from the video camera and rotation sensors internal to the vehicle.

AB Autonomous driving motion control based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) faces integration stability issues when driving at low speeds. However, this issue has not received sufficient attention or been adequately addressed. Ensuring integration stability requires the adoption of an implicit method, which incurs a high computational burden, making this phenomenon crucial to the performance of NMPC. In this paper, a split integration method is proposed to utilize the gradient-based augmented Lagrangian approach (GRAMPC) to solve the integration stability problem and significantly improve the efficiency of NMPC. The proposed split integration method integrates the explicit second-order Runge-Kutta (RK) method and the second-order L-stable Rosenbrock (ROS2) method. To enhance integration stability for the stiff part of the state equation, the ROS2 method is used. For the non-stiff part of the system, the RK method is used to improve its efficiency. This approach results in an efficient nonlinear NMPC system that can be adapted to full range speeds. Simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that the low-speed integration stability problem of NMPC is entirely resolved without compromising its efficiency.

AB With the development of electric vehicles, indoor driving robots, wearable devices, etc., research on technology for recognizing one's current location continues to progress. Self-localization is an essential need for autonomous driving and mainly requires global positioning system (GPS), thereby using technologies such as LiDAR, Wi-Fi, and visible light communication (VLC). However, GPS is greatly affected by its surrounding environment, and it can make errors, especially in spaces where signals are blocked, such as tunnels and buildings. In this paper, we propose a system for estimating one's location using LED lights and frequency components with different color temperatures in an indoor space such as a tunnel. We installed three types of LED lights with different color temperatures in a tunnel-like experimental environment and collected data using RGB sensors. We also estimated the user's current location according to the color temperature and frequency component analysis from the data. In most cases, it was measured within a margin of error of 0-2 cm. It is expected that this will be used for generating data on the location of indoor service robots and autonomous vehicles in spaces where it is difficult to use GPS.

AB This article proposes an adaptive flight framework that integrates a discrete-time incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion controller and a neural network (NN)-based observer for maneuvering flight. The framework is built on the feedback-inversion scheme in which the adaptive neural network augments a discrete-time disturbance observer in the loop. The effects of the modeling uncertainties and the exogenous perturbations are both taken into consideration and are alleviated by the observer. By utilizing the Lyapunov synthesis method, the updating rule of the NN's weights is introduced, which guarantees the system's stability with enhanced tracking performance. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is presented through numerical verification of a 6-DOF fixed-wing fighter performing several aggressive flight maneuvers. Extensive simulation results illustrate that this versatile controller is more practical for aerobatic flights compared with the discontinuous sliding mode (DSM) and the nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) methods. Given well-generated maneuver commands, the aircraft can accurately track the aggressive reference in the presence of modeling perturbations such as changes in aerodynamic coefficient, inertial parameters, and wind gusts.

AB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have been widely studied over the last years for autonomous vehicles. SLAM achieves its purpose by constructing a map of the unknown environment while keeping track of the location. A major challenge, which is paramount during the design of SLAM systems, lies in the efficient use of onboard sensors to perceive the environment. The most widely applied algorithms are camera-based SLAM and LiDAR-based SLAM. Recent research focuses on the fusion of camera-based and LiDAR-based frameworks that show promising results. In this paper, we present a study of commonly used sensors and the fundamental theories behind SLAM algorithms. The study then presents the hardware architectures used to process these algorithms and the performance obtained when possible. Secondly, we highlight state-of-the-art methodologies in each modality and in the multi-modal framework. A brief comparison followed by future challenges is then underlined. Additionally, we provide insights to possible fusion approaches that can increase the robustness and accuracy of modern SLAM algorithms; hence allowing the hardware-software co-design of embedded systems taking into account the algorithmic complexity and the embedded architectures and real-time constraints.

AB Accurate object detection on the road is the most important requirement of autonomous vehicles. Extensive work has been accomplished for car, pedestrian, and cyclist detection; however, comparatively, very few efforts have been put into 2D object detection. In this article, a dynamic approach is investigated to design a perfect unified neural network that could achieve the best results based on our available hardware. The proposed architecture is based on CSPNet for feature extraction in an end-to-end way. The net extracts visual features by using backbone subnet, visual object detection is based on a feature pyramid network (FPN). In order to increase the net flexibility, an auto-anchor generating method is applied to the detection layer that makes the net suitable for any datasets. For fine-tuning the net, activation, optimization, and loss functions are considered along with multiple check points. The proposed net is trained and tested based on the benchmark KITTI dataset. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed model for visual object detection is superior to others, where other nets output very low accuracy for pedestrian and cyclist detection, our proposed model achieves 99.3% recall rate based on our dataset.

TI Baseline design of a subsea shuttle tanker system for liquid carbon

SO OCEAN ENGINEERING

DE Subsea shuttle tanker; Autonomous underwater vehicle; Carbon capture and
   storage; CO2 transportation
AB This paper presents the baseline design of a 34,000-tonne subsea shuttle tanker (SST). The SST is proposed as an alternative to subsea pipelines and surface tankers for the transportation of liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) from existing offshore/land facilities to marginal subsea fields. In contrast to highly weather-dependent surface tanker operations, the SST can operate in any condition underwater. The SST is an electric-powered autonomous underwater vehicle with a length and beam of 164 m and 17 m, respectively. It has a cargo carrying capacity of 16,362 m3. This capacity is sufficient to allow the SST to fulfil the annual storage demands of ongoing carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in Norway. It travels with a slow speed of 6 knots at 70 m constant water depth for maximum energy efficiency and offloads CO2 via a connected coupling to the subsea well where CO2 is directly injected. To be economically attractive, the SST has a high payload of 50% displacement which makes a low structural weight design extremely crucial. This is achieved by employing a double hull design for the SST with active pressure compensating systems to cope with the large collapse pressure loads underwater.

AB This letter demonstrates the feasibility of near realtime, plenoptic-inertial navigation on a low-cost central processing unit (CPU). To enable real-time operation, a standard plenoptic camera was modeled as a system of stereo cameras and triangulation was used to estimate its pose from a minimal set of subaperture images. The relationship between distance and disparity for the simplified model was experimentally validated in an aquatic environment, using a first-generation Lytro camera, and a mean error of 2% of the target distance was obtained. This letter culminates with testing the proposed navigation system on an in-house developed, novel, biologically inspired, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), CephaloBot. The test consisted of the AUV rotating around a static object while maintaining a fixed separation distance. The mean position error from the test was 2.5% of the target distance. With the simplified plenoptic model, only 750 ms were required to process the raw plenoptic data and estimate position on an Intel i5 CPU. The processing delay was short enough that the delayed position measurements bounded the effects of sensor drift when fused with an inertial measurement unit using a delayed extended Kalman filter. This result demonstrates the feasibility of plenoptic-inertial navigation on a low-cost CPU.

AB The generation of digital maps with lane-level resolution is rapidly becoming a necessity, as semi- or fully-autonomous driving vehicles are now commercially available. In this paper, we present a practical real-time working prototype for road lane detection using LiDAR data, which can be further extended to automatic lane-level map generation. Conventional lane detection methods are limited to simple road conditions and are not suitable for complex urban roads with various road signs on the ground. Given a 3D point cloud scanned by a 3D LiDAR sensor, we categorized the points of the drivable region and distinguished the points of the road signs on the ground. Then, we developed an expectation-maximization method to detect parallel lines and update the 3D line parameters in real time, as the probe vehicle equipped with the LiDAR sensor moved forward. The detected and recorded line parameters were integrated to build a lane-level digital map with the help of a GPS/INS sensor. The proposed system was tested to generate accurate lane-level maps of two complex urban routes. The experimental results showed that the proposed system was fast and practical in terms of effectively detecting road lines and generating lane-level maps.

ID POWERED-DESCENT GUIDANCE; CONVEX-OPTIMIZATION; CONSTRAINTS
AB Space maneuverings of the space vehicle require the capability of onboard trajectory planning. Convex programming based optimization strategy gets much attention in the design of trajectory planning methods with deterministic convergence properties. Due to the nonlinear dynamics, space-trajectory planning problems are always non-convex and difficult to be solved by the convex programming approach directly. This paper presents a Newton-Kantorovich/convex programming (N-K/CP) approach, based on the combination of the convex programming and the Newton-Kantorovich (N-K) method, to solve the nonlinear and non-convex space-trajectory planning problem. This trajectory planning problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem. By linearization and relaxation techniques, the nonlinear optimal control problem is convexified as a convex programming problem, which can be solved efficiently with convex programming solvers. For the linearized convex optimization problem, N-K method is introduced to design an iterative solving algorithm, the solution of which approximates the original trajectory planning problem with high accuracy. The convergence of the proposed N-K/CP approach is proved, and the effectiveness is demonstrated by numerical experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.

AB This research is an extension of image detection technique for obstacle-avoidance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) by applying the BK triangle sub-product of fuzzy relations. According to the concept of stereo vision detection technique, the obstacles as well as offshore structures can be reconstructed by depth images. By obtaining the depth information in the space, the optimal route can be evaluated combining PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)-based dynamic routing algorithm. In this study, the graphical language, LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench), is used to simulate the AUV's inspection task in the offshore wind farm. The interface shows the pose, trajectories, perspectives and real-time series of 6-Degrees of Freedom (DOF) motion for the AUV. In the existence of obstacles, the AUV is found to conduct inspection tasks of the offshore wind farm with feasible routes by considering minimum time and energy consumption successfully. In summary, the stereo-vision detection technique with PSO-based dynamic routing algorithm is not only beneficial to optimize feasible routes but also identify features of objects for the purpose tracking and obstacle-avoidance more efficiently.

AB A dichotomy between depth penetration and resolution as a function of sonar frequency, draw resolution, and beam spread challenges fish target classification from sonar. Moving high-frequency sources to depth using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) mitigates this and also co-locates transducers with other AUV-mounted short-range sensors to allow a holistic approach to ecological surveys. This widely available tool with a pedigree for bottom mapping is not commonly applied to fish reconnaissance and requires the development of an interpretation of pelagic reflective features, revisitation of count methods, image-processing rather than wave-form recognition for automation, and an understanding of bias. In a series of AUV mission test cases, side-scan sonar (600 and 900 kHz) returns often resolved individual school members, spacing, size, behavior, and (infrequently) species from anatomical features and could be intuitively classified by ecologists - but also produced artifacts. Fish often followed the AUV and thus were videographed, but in doing so removed themselves from the sonar aperture. AUV-supported high-frequency side-scan holds particular promise for survey of scarce, large species or for synergistic investigation of predators and their prey because the spatial scale of observations may be similar to those of predators.

Recent advances in computational technology and real-time programming techniques afford the ability to process bathymetric data in situ to react to real-time environment data. The novel approach presented interrogates real-time bathymetric data to predict the transmission-reception timing of payload sensor acoustic pulses, thus permitting the ability to synchronize the trigger of the instruments such that neighboring return signals of other sonar are not saturated by sensor crosstalk.

AB Vision (both using one-dimensional and two-dimensional retina) is useful for the autonomous navigation of vehicles. In this paper the case of a vehicle equipped with multiple cameras with non-overlapping views is considered. The geometry and algebra of such a moving platform of cameras are considered. In particular we formulate and solve structure and motion problems for a few novel cases of such moving platforms. For the case of two-dimensional retina cameras (ordinary cameras) there are two minimal cases of three points in two platform positions and two points in three platform positions. For the case of one-dimensional retina cameras there are three minimal structure and motion problems. In this paper we consider one of these (6 points in 3 platform positions). The theory has been tested on synthetic data.

AB This paper proposes an autopilot system for a small and light unmanned air vehicle called Kiteplane. The Kiteplane has a large delta-shaped main wing that is easily disturbed by the wind, which was minimized by utilizing trim flight with drift. The proposed control system for autonomous trajectory following with a wind disturbance included fuzzy logic controllers, a speed controller, a wind disturbance attenuation block, and low-level feedback controllers. The system was implemented onboard the aircraft. Experiments were performed to test the performance of the proposed system and the Kiteplane nearly succeeded in following the desired trajectory, under the wind disturbance. Although the path was not followed perfectly the airplane was able to traverse the waypoints by utilizing a failsafe waypoint updating rule.

AB The first Arctic under-ice sidescan sonar imagery from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been obtained in the winter marginal ice zone of the East Greenland Current at 73degrees00'N, 11degrees47'W, using a Maridan Martin 150 vehicle operated from R/V Lance. First-year, multiyear, brash, and frazil ice can be discriminated, with the underside of multiyear ice appearing smooth as compared to the rough underside detected by submarine-borne sidescan in the Arctic Basin, implying downstream bottom melt. The ice draft profile was obtained from the vertical part of the sidescan beam, and the probability density function of ice thickness was derived and found to agree well with upward sonar results from this region obtained in 1987 from a British submarine.

ID REINFORCEMENT; DESIGN
AB This letter presents an efficient coverage map-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation framework in cellular communication systems. Unlike previous research that focused on viewing UAV navigation as a Markov decision process in unknown continuous state space and leveraged various model-free and deep neural network-based reinforcement learning algorithms, a more straightforward and efficient model-based value iteration algorithm is proposed. The algorithm leverages prior knowledge obtained through empirical channel models to develop a sampled coverage map that can be used in value iteration. A deep neural network is subsequently trained with supervised learning to approximate the optimal Q function in continuous state space. Finally, the trained neural network is applied to obtain a UAV trajectory that optimizes the objective function.

ID DRIVER STRESS; RECOGNITION
AB Despite advances in autonomous driving technology, traffic accidents remain a problem to be solved in the transportation system. More than half of traffic accidents are due to unsafe driving. In addition, aggressive driving behavior can lead to traffic jams. To reduce this, we propose a 4-layer CNN-2 stack LSTM-based driving behavior classification and V2X sharing system that uses time-series data as an input to reflect temporal changes. The proposed system classifies driving behavior into defensive, normal, and aggressive driving using only the 3-axis acceleration of the driving vehicle and shares it with the surroundings. We collect a training dataset by composing a road that reflects various environmental factors using a driving simulator that mimics a real vehicle and IPG CarMaker, an autonomous driving simulation. Additionally, driving behavior datasets are collected by driving real-world DGIST campus to augment training data. The proposed network has the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. Finally, our system shares the driving behavior classified by 4-layer CNN-2 stacked LSTM with surrounding vehicles through V2X communication. The proposed system has been validated in ACC simulations and real environments. For real world testing, we configure NVIDIA Jetson TX2, IMU, GPS, and V2X devices as one module. We performed the experiments of the driving behavior classification and V2X transmission and reception in a real world by using the prototype module. As a result of the experiment, the driving behavior classification performance was confirmed to be ~98% or more in the simulation test and 97% or more in the real-world test. In addition, the V2X communication delay through the prototype was confirmed to be an average of 4.8 ms. The proposed system can contribute to improving the safety of the transportation system by sharing the driving behaviors of each vehicle.</p>

AB Driving behavior analysis plays an important role in improving the human-like driving capability of the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. In this study, 906 data of drivers stopping normally at urban intersections were extracted from natural driving data to study reaction characteristics and braking characteristics of drivers in real road traffic. The effects of traffic state and traffic density on approach speed and reaction distance were studied using one-way ANOVA, and the relationships between maximum deceleration, average deceleration, braking duration, and influencing factors were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression. The main results indicate the following: (1) compare with free driving, the approach speed in the following state was lower, and following traffic also caused drivers with higher speeds to further increase reaction distance in high-density traffic. (2) Traffic density only affected the approach speed in the free-driving condition. High-density traffic caused drivers to reduce speed. (3) There was a clear correlation between approach speed and reaction distance: the greater the approach speed, the longer the reaction distance. (4) The braking characteristics were mainly affected by the self-vehicle motion state. Drivers braked to a stop with greater average deceleration and maximum deceleration in a shorter time when the approach speed was higher or the reaction distance was shorter. (5) Both traffic state and traffic density had an influence on the braking characteristics. Drivers reduced average deceleration and increased braking duration in the following state and high-density traffic. (6) When following a preceding vehicle to stop, the braking characteristics of drivers were no longer influenced by the traffic density but were related to the relative motion state with the preceding vehicle. In addition to the driving behavior analysis, the identification method of traffic participants and ranging method used in this study will also advance the development of autonomous driving technologies and driver assistance systems.

AB In recent years, video footage obtained from routine industry surveys using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) has been used to assess fish assemblages associated with offshore oil and gas infrastructure. However, as industry moves towards using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), it is important to understand how such a change may affect assessments of fish assemblages and whether these data collected from AUVs can be directly compared to those collected from historic and future ROV footage. In an extremely rare opportunity, we compare fish assemblages surveyed by an industrial ROV and an industrial hybrid-AUV (H-AUV) along the same 2,060-m section of subsea pipeline, at the same time of day, within 1 day of each other. A total of 206 transects, each 20 m in length, were analyzed, recording 406 fish from 10 species. The H-AUV recorded all 10 fish species, while the ROV recorded seven. Mean species richness was similar to 4% higher for H-AUV, and mean abundance was similar to 21% higher for ROV; these differences can be considered negligible. Multivariate analysis revealed nonsignificant differences in species composition between survey methods. This result suggests that future surveys of fish at this pipeline using a similar H-AUV can yield comparable results to ROV and, as such, facilitate comparison to historical ROV imagery. Future surveys of pipelines with AUV should consider adding extra lighting and high-definition cameras onto booms similar to those operating on ROVs, which will provide a useful field of view into pipeline spans and make it easier to identify fish. Our study provides insight into the utility and comparability of industry ROV and AUV pipeline inspection footage for the assessment of fish assemblages associated with subsea pipelines, which is used to inform policies and practices on the installation and decommissioning of subsea infrastructure.

AB In 2007, a possible wreck site was discovered in Trygghamna, Isfjorden, Svalbard by the Norwegian Hydrographic Service. Using (1) a REMUS 100 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a sidescan sonar (SSS) and (2) a Seabotix LBV 200 mini-remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with a high-definition (HD) camera, the wreck was in 2015 identified as the Figaro: a floating whalery that sank in 1908. The Figaro is to our knowledge currently the northernmost wreck in the world to be investigated by archaeologists. As the wreck is protected by law as an underwater cultural heritage (UCH) site, only non-intrusive methods could be used during surveys. In this study, we demonstrate how using multiple complementary remote sensing techniques can be advantageous with respect to acquiring a holistic overview of a recently discovered wreck site. In January 2016, the wreck was revisited, and a full photogrammetric survey of the site was conducted with a Sperre Subfighter 7500 medium class ROV. In addition to stereo camera images, HD-video and underwater hyperspectral imagery was also obtained from the wreck site. In terms of data analysis and interpretation, the emphasis was in the current study put on the photogrammetric 3D model and the underwater hyperspectral imagery. The former provided an excellent general overview of the Figaro wreck site, whereas the latter supplied detailed information from a 14.65-m(2) sub-area situated on the top of the wreck. By analyzing classified underwater hyperspectral imagery in context with supplementary information from the 3D model, the levels of biofouling associated with different marine archaeological substrate types were assessed. Our findings suggest that strongly protruding archaeological objects support significantly higher levels of biofouling than their surroundings, and consequently that high-density biological assemblages could serve as proxies for identifying human-made artifacts on the seafloor.

AB The synchronisation problem is investigated for multiple linear agents with external disturbances that are guided by a leader with different dynamics. A method is presented for designing a networked controller that synchronises the agents. First, a general dynamic controller with two inputs is proposed that introduces the model of the leader as an internal reference model into the control loop of all the following agents. Second, the two inputs to the local controllers of the followers are designed by H-infinity control theory such that the resulting closed-loop system achieves the output synchronisation with a desired disturbance attenuation performance. The proposed method is applied to the leader-follower synchronisation of vehicles in a platoon.

TI Video quality assessment for inter-vehicular streaming with IEEE
   802.11p, LTE, and LTE Direct networks over fading channels
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Availability of real time video streams capturing surrounding road conditions can not only aid automobile drivers and autonomous vehicles, they can also enhance road safety and improve traffic efficiency. However, provisioning of such services is challenging due to the harsh operational environments and stringent resource requirements of the applications. Nevertheless, radio access technologies like IEEE 802.11p, LTE, and LTE Direct have provisions for supporting real time streams for inter-vehicular communications.
   In this paper, we present an emulation-based study to demonstrate to what extent these networks are able to sustain real-time video streaming for vehicle-to-vehicle communication. We model highways and congested urban road scenarios using Ricean and Rayleigh fading channel models respectively, that closely mimic the real-life environment. We use H.264 codec for transcoding 360p and 480p videos at the sender vehicle, and then stream the transport segments over a real-time transport protocol. The quality of the video received at the target vehicle is assessed using two metrics: PSNR and SSIM. The emulation is done for varying encoding rates, relative speeds between vehicles, and inter-vehicular distances. We also find the link layer throughput that these networks can support. The results reveal that LTE Direct performs better than 802.11p, which in turn performs better than LTE. This study also provides insights into how to configure the radio and network parameters for delivering streaming services to vehicular networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research introduces an innovative strategy to impede and lessen lateral and rear-end vehicular collisions by consolidating braking systems with active emergency steering controls. This study puts forward a T-type active emergency steering method, designed to circumvent both lateral and rear-end collisions at vehicular intersections. To secure vehicular stability and condense the time required for steering during the T-type active emergency process, this research formulates a nonlinear dynamic model for the vehicle, in addition to a nonlinear tire model. This study also engages in a thorough analysis of the constraints linked to the initial and terminal states of the steering process. The issue at hand is articulated as an optimization control problem with boundary value restrictions, which is subsequently resolved using the Radau pseudospectral method. Simulation results corroborate that the prompt commencement of the anti-collision strategy can effectively deter potential collisions. This pioneering approach shows considerable promise in augmenting the active safety of intelligent vehicles and bears meaningful implications for high-precision automotive collision evasion systems.

SO ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION

DE Automated driving; Optimization; Car-following; Hand rule
ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; RISK
AB This paper proposes an approach to rationally set automated vehicles' car following behavior that explicitly balances between the competing considerations of safety (i.e. small probabilities of a high-consequence crash) and efficiency (guaranteed but small impacts on journey arrival time due to the choice of car following distance). The specification of safety and efficiency are both based on empirically supported concepts and data. In numerical analyses with empirical vehicle trajectories at two sites, we demonstrate intuitive response to systematic variation in numerical values selected as inputs, as well as whether the scope of the efficiency consideration is selfish or systemwide. The proposed balancing is aligned with the standard "Hand Rule" criterion to demonstrate that a duty of care has been met, in which a burden must be borne if it is less than the product of the probability of loss to a third party and the magnitude of loss. Thus the proposed approach is intended to be useful for designers of control algorithms for AVs to establish that they have met their duty of care, taking both safety and efficiency into account.

AB This work presents an intelligent transportation system (ITS) that was implemented on an autonomous vehicle designed to perform global navigation missions on a network of unmarked roads. This is the first step toward the complete implementation of ITS in urban environments, which is the long-term goal of this work. Using a global positioning system, global navigation is achieved by means of a global planner and a task manager that recurrently coordinate the execution of vision-based perception tasks for the road tracking of nonstructured roads and the navigation of intersections. In addition, a vision-based vehicle-detection task has been developed, which endows the global navigation system with a reactive capacity. The complete system has been tested on the BABIECA prototype vehicle, which was autonomously driven for hundreds of kilometers around a private circuit, designed to emulate an urban quarter, at speeds of up to 50 km/h, successfully carrying out different navigation missions. During the tests, the vehicle drove itself across crossroads and performed the appropriate turning maneuvers at intersections. It also demonstrated its robustness with regard to shadows, road texture, weather conditions, and changing illumination.

AB In this article, we present a method of nonmarked road following that is based on images coming from an onboard monochromatic camera. The principle is based first on a segmentation stage that makes it possible to locate the road area in the image, managing, if possible, the shadows on the roadway. The method is original since the algorithm must be running day as well as night (infrared camera) so it does not use color images. Furthermore, a single constant threshold is used whatever the analyzed sequence. Then, a localization stage estimates the vehicle's location on the roadway. The estimate of the parameters L (road width) and or (camera inclination angle) (assumed known and constant for certain existing approaches) ensures a greater robustness of the other estimated parameters. Finally, a filtering stage is applied onto the previous data and predicts the position of the vehicle in the next image. Results ave shown for each stage on both a normal nonmarked road and a forest lane sequence. The computational times are very low and will permit a real-time implementation on an experimental vehicle.

AB This paper is concerned with bipartite tracking control design for multiple autonomous surface vessels with unknown dynamics and external disturbances. Under a signed directed graph, novel distributed adaptive control inputs are constructed recursively by using backstepping method to make the bipartite tracking errors eventually converge to an arbitrarily small compact set by appropriately adjusting design parameters. To reduce the complexity of the controllers, we employ parameter separation technique to deal with the unknown dynamics. In particular, under the assumption that the reference trajectory is only available to a fraction of followers, the cooperative tracking is also achieved with the proposed distributed control design scheme. Finally, two simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB In this paper, an adaptive sliding controller is developed for controlling a vehicle active suspension system. The functional approximation technique is employed to substitute the unknown non-autonomous functions of the suspension system and release the model-based requirement of sliding mode control algorithm. In order to improve the control performance and reduce the implementation problem, a fuzzy strategy with online learning ability is added to compensate the functional approximation error. The update laws of the functional approximation coefficients and the fuzzy tuning parameters are derived from the Lyapunov theorem to guarantee the system stability. The proposed controller is implemented on a quarter-car hydraulic actuating active suspension system test-rig. The experimental results show that the proposed controller suppresses the oscillation amplitude of the suspension system effectively.

AB This paper presents the Environment Description Framework (EDF) for modeling complex networks of intersecting roads and pathways in virtual environments. EDF represents information about the layout of streets and sidewalks, the rules that govern behavior on roads and walkways, and the locations of agents with respect to navigable structures. The framework serves as the substrate on which behavior programs for autonomous vehicles and pedestrians are built. Pathways are modeled as ribbons in space. The ribbon structure provides a natural coordinate frame for defining the local geometry of navigable surfaces. EDF includes a powerful runtime interface supported by robust and efficient code for locating objects on the ribbon network, for mapping between Cartesian and ribbon coordinates, and for determining behavioral constraints imposed by the environment.

AB The increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), better known as drones, by civilians has grown exponentially and their autonomous flight control systems have improved significantly, which has resulted in a greater number of accidents and dangerous situations. To help resolve this problem, in this paper, we address the use of low-cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms for simulating a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), more specifically the global positioning system (GPS), in order to transmit false signals and induce a location error on the targeted GPS receiver. Using this approach, a defensive system can be implemented which can divert, or even take control of unauthorized UAVs whose flight path depends on the information obtained by the GPS system.

AB Consensus tracking problems with, respectively, bounded control effort and directed switching interaction topologies are considered when a time-varying consensus reference state is available to only a subgroup of a team and the team members have only local interaction. A consensus tracking algorithm explicitly accounting for bounded control effort is proposed and analyzed under a directed fixed interaction topology. Furthermore, convergence analysis for a consensus tracking algorithm is provided when the time-varying consensus reference state is available to a dynamically changing subgroup of the team under directed switching inter-vehicle interaction topologies. Experimental results of a formation control application are demonstrated on a multi-robot platform to validate one of the proposed consensus tracking algorithms.

AB In the past decade, reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved encouraging results in autonomous driving, especially in well-structured and regulated highway environments. However, few researches pay attention to RL-based multiple-vehicles cooperative driving, which is much more challenging because of dynamic real-time interactions and transient scenarios. This article proposes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based twin-vehicles cooperative driving decision making method which achieves the generalization adaptation of the RL method in highly dynamic highway environments and enhances the flexibility and effectiveness of collaborative decision making system. The proposed fair cooperative MARL method pays equal attention to the individual intelligence and the cooperative performance, and employs a stable estimation method to reduce the propagation of overestimated joint Q-values between agents. Thus, the twin-vehicles system strikes a balance between maintaining formation and free overtaking in dynamic highway environments, to intelligently adapt to different scenarios, such as heavy traffic, loose traffic, even some emergency. Targeted experiments show that our method has strong cooperative performance, also further increases the possibility of creating a harmonious driving environment.

AB This paper presents a new approach to estimate the probability of line-of-sight (LoS) for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. We provide lower and upper bounds on the probability of LoS in terms of what we call the first-building-LoS probability. We provide a statistical model for the ground distance to the first building along the line from the user to the UAV. Based on this we provide a general formula for the first-building-LoS probability for urban environments where the building heights follow a Rayleigh distribution. We show that the first-building-LoS probability is a good estimate for the probability of LoS. Our closed-form formulas estimate the probability of LoS significantly more accurately than the existing approaches. We also obtain closed-form estimates of Area Line-of-Sight Probabilities for a scenario in which the UAV provides coverage to a circular region on the ground.

AB In a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-restricted area, a mobile robot navigation system exploits surrounding environment information. For an aerial or underwater vehicle, undulating terrain of a land or seabed surface is a valuable information resource that leads to the development of terrain-referenced navigation (TRN) algorithms. However, due to the vast amount of a vehicle's activity area, surveying all the regions to obtain a high-resolution terrain map is impractical and requires simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) as a highly desirable capability. This paper presents a topographic SLAM algorithm using only a single terrain altimeter, which is low-cost, computationally efficient, and sufficiently stable for long-term operation. The proposed rectangular panel map structure and update method enable robust and efficient SLAM. As terrain elevation changes are inherently nonlinear, an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based SLAM filter is adopted. The feasibility and validity of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through simulations using terrain elevation data from a real-world undersea environment.

AB In this article, the formation control of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is addressed considering actuator saturation and unknown nonlinear items. The algorithm can be divided into two parts, steering the leader USV to trace along the desired path and steering the follower USV to follow the leader in the desired formation. In the proposed formation control framework, a virtual USV is first constructed so that the leader USV can be guided to the desired path. To solve the input constraint problem, an auxiliary is introduced, and the adaptive fuzzy method is used to estimate unknown nonlinear items in the USV. To maintain the desired formation, the desired velocities of follower USVs are deduced using geometry and Lyapunov stability theories; the stability of the closed-loop system is also proved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by the simulation and experimental results.

AB In this study, the visual servoing control problem is investigated, and a fixed time based visual servoing control scheme is proposed for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles. First, based on the perspective projection principle and target points, effective image features are defined on an image plane called the virtual image plane. Then, the image feature dynamics and QUAV dynamics are combined to derive a coupled non-linear system, and the non-linear system is decoupled into two subsystems under inner-outer loop control framework. Furthermore, the novel sliding mode surfaces based fixed-time controllers are designed, and the resulting closed-loop systems are proved to be stable. Finally, the numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Owing to the rapid and facile deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the third-generation partnership programme has recently shown considerable interest in UAVs for assisting current terrestrial base stations. Hence, the feasibility of using UAVs has been vigorously investigated for enhancing the performance of traditional ground-based communications, e.g. coverage and quality-of-service enhancement under natural disaster or overwhelming data requirement conditions. Here, however, the energy-efficient operation of the UAV is necessary to obtain the essential benefits. To strengthen the base of operation and management of UAVs in cellular systems, the authors consider in this Letter a single mission in which a small-size UAV transmits a given data volume to a cell boundary user. They design the transmit power and altitude of the UAV to complete the mission with high-energy efficiency. From the numerical results, it is verified that the UAV transmitting data with the designed transmit power at the designed altitude can complete the mission with near-optimal, i.e. maximum, energy efficiency.

AB Naismith obtained a set of empirical rules for the time required to move through a terrain. this paper we solve the problem of determining the path which minimizes the transit time between two points on a given terrain. We give an interpretation of Naismith's rule which leads to an elegant geometric construction of the optimal solution. This problem is a paradigm for the navigation of an autonomous vehicle in a heterogenous terrain.

AB In this letter, we study the energy efficiency (EE) optimization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) providing wireless coverage to static and mobile ground users. Recent multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches optimise the system's EE using a 2D trajectory design, neglecting interference from nearby UAV cells. We aim to maximize the system's EE by jointly optimizing each UAV's 3D trajectory, number of connected users, and the energy consumed, while accounting for interference. Thus, we propose a cooperative Multi-Agent Decentralized Double Deep Q-Network (MAD-DDQN) approach. Our approach outperforms existing baselines in terms of EE by as much as 55- 80%.

DE Aerial robotics; localization; autonomous vehicle navigation

AB This article presents an enhanced version of the Monte Carlo localization algorithm, commonly used for robot navigation in indoor environments, which is suitable for aerial robots moving in a three-dimentional environment and makes use of a combination of measurements from an Red,Green,Blue-Depth (RGB-D) sensor, distances to several radio-tags placed in the environment, and an inertial measurement unit. The approach is demonstrated with an unmanned aerial vehicle flying for 10 min indoors and validated with a very precise motion tracking system. The approach has been implemented using the robot operating system framework and works smoothly on a regular i7 computer, leaving plenty of computational capacity for other navigation tasks such as motion planning or control.

AB Graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is one of the methods to generate point cloud maps which are used for various applications in autonomous vehicles. Graph-based SLAM represents the pose of the vehicle as a node and the odometry between two different nodes as an edge. Among the edge generating methods, scan matching, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based method, can provide an accurate pose between two nodes based on the high distance accuracy of the LiDAR. However, the point cloud in real driving situations contains numerous moving objects, which degrade the scan-matching performance. Therefore, this article defines the static probability which means the likelihood that an acquired point is from a static object, and proposes the weighted normal distribution transformation (NDT), which is achieved by modifying NDT. Weighted NDT is a scan-matching algorithm which can reflect the static probability of each point as a weight. The odometry from the weighted NDT is utilized for graph construction to generate a robust point cloud map even in a dynamic environment. Finally, the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing object removal algorithms in two areas: dynamic object classification and scan-matching performance. Based on the scan-matching results, the accuracy of the point cloud map generated by the proposed algorithm was evaluated with a reference map using high-performance global navigation satellite system (GNSS). It was confirmed that the proposed algorithm has higher classification accuracy and lower scan-matching error compared with other dynamic object removal methods. The proposed algorithm was able to generate a point cloud map, despite the presence of many dynamic objects, that was similar to a map generated in the absence of dynamic objects in the same environment.

AB This paper investigates the nonlinear dynamics of a vehicle with two flexible flapping wings. The body dynamics and the wings' deformation are monolithically grouped into a single system of equations, with aerodynamics accounted for by a quasi-steady blade element method. A periodic shooting method is then used to locate closed orbits of this non-autonomous system, and Floquet multipliers assess the linearized stability about the nonlinear orbit. This framework is then exposed to a gradient based optimizer, in order to quantify the role of wing planform variables, wing structure variables, and kinematic actuation variables in obtaining vehicles with superior open-loop stability characteristics, and/or low-power requirements.

AB A conventional region control technique cannot meet the demands for an accurate tracking performance in view of its inability to accommodate highly nonlinear system dynamics, imprecise hydrodynamic coefficients, and external disturbances. In this paper, a robust technique is presented for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) with region tracking function. Within this control scheme, nonlinear H-infinity and region based control schemes are used. ALyapunov-like function is presented for stability analysis of the proposed control law. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed tracking control of the AUV. It is shown that the proposed control law is robust against parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, and nonlinearities and it leads to uniform ultimate boundedness of the region tracking error.

AB This paper designs a fixed-time formation control law for multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system (MAS) subjected to unmeasurable velocities, actuator saturation and time-varying disturbances. To address these challenges, the actuator saturation and time-varying disturbances are initially integrated into lumped disturbances, the initial step is to integrate actuator saturation and time-varying disturbances into lumped disturbances, followed by designing a fixed-time extended state observer (FTESO) to estimate the unavailable velocities and the lumped disturbances in fixed time. Moreover, a nonlinear filter is also utilized to eliminate the problem of computational explosion that arises due to derivatives in the controller design process. Additionally, a tan-type barrier Lyapunov function (TT-BLF) is presented to constrain the tracking errors within a predetermined time-varying constraint function. Then, a novel fixed-time formation control algorithm based on FTESO and TTBLF is further designed to ensure that the formation tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood near origin in fixed time, and the fast formation task can be completed within a fixed time. Finally, the simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB Aiming at poor effects and single consideration factors of traditional driving decision-making algorithm in high-speed and complex environment, a method based on improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed in this paper. We innovatively design and optimize the reward function of the Dueling Deep Q network (Dueling DQN), and the factors such as safety, comfort, traffic efficiency and altruism are taken into account. The weight of each influencing factor is determined by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which makes the influence of each factor on driving behavior decision-making more acceptable. Subsequently, a decision-making model of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is built by using improved Dueling DQN. Furthermore, the action space is enriched and combined with the trajectory planner, so that AVs can take appropriate behaviors in the longitudinal and lateral directions according to the environment. The output of the decision model can be combined with the underlying controller with a view to make the AVs maneuver reasonably. The driving decision-making method in two different traffic scenarios is simulated. Moreover, the improved method compares with other methods. The results illustrate that the improved Dueling DQN can make the AVs take safe, comfortable, efficient, and altruistic behavior.

ID DYNAMICS
AB A novel approach is presented for learning probabilistic transition matrices from temporal data series as switching models based on Generalized States (GS). An observed data sequence is analyzed by a reference filter whose errors are clustered. Each cluster is associated with a dynamic flow model, which described as a parametric linear attractor. The set of linear attractors define the Hierarchical Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (H-GDBN), which encodes a learned model of the obtained sequence. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) uses H-GDBN's probabilistic information to make inferences at a multilevel scale and facilitates the detection of abnormalities. This paper shows how transition matrices can be obtained as an integral part of the clustering step by employing the advantages of GSs, enabling a unique opti-mal criterion for learning flow models at discrete and continuous levels of H-GDBN. For evaluating the proposed method, odometry and proprioceptive control data from an autonomous vehicle are employed to learn H-GDBNs. Learned H-GDBN are used to detect abnormalities when vehicle encounter any abnor-mal situation. Performance evaluation based on ROC curves is provided to select the optimal transition matrix.

AB The recent developments in the additive manufacturing to manufacture complex cost effective profiles is gaining popularity to test the strength of developed products through finite element method (FEM). Finite element analysis (FEA) is a potent tool for mechanical analysis. The combination of 3D printing and FEA is opening new opportunities to go further in the complexity of the product geometry. The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) propeller blade has a complex profile with multi-directional gradient and twist, which requires a multi-stage operation to manufacture, including the hubs. The AUV propeller is required to withstand the applied load and generate the required thrust to move AUV at the desired speed. The current study explores the performance of AUV propeller prepared by additive synthesis using Nylon 6 material. The design of the propeller blade was developed using SOLID WORKS and integrated to the CUBPRO (DUO) to obtain the required 3D printing parameters. A comparative investigation is made for Nylon material within the dimensional conformance with the 3D printed propeller blade. The stress-strain analysis of the Nylon AUV propeller is carried with the FEM. The analysis of error and the stress show that the Nylon material meets the performance criteria for AUV propeller.

AB We present a non-linear navigation solution, referred to as the Reverse Bearing Only Target Motion Analysis (Reverse BO-TMA). Reverse BO-TMA is a passive method for the self-localization of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Our method relies solely on bearing measurements based on the radiated noise of a passing vessel sailing along a known route. Compared to traditional range-based underwater localization methods, Reverse BO-TMA allows the AUV to remain farther from the reference vessel, and does not require collaboration or message exchange. We formalize the Reverse BO-TMA as an optimization problem, and offer both a least squares solution and an unscented Kalman filter solution. Numerical results show that Reverse BO-TMA provides accurate performance, in terms of both positioning and speed, which are close to the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we have implemented a prototype for Reverse BO-TMA and successfully tested it in three sea experiments. We show that the Reverse BO-TMA is suitable for the long-term deployment of an AUV and in cases where energy is scarce and cooperating anchors are not available.

AB Transfer alignment is used to initialize SINS (Strapdown Inertial Navigation System) in motion. Lever-arm effect compensation is studied existing in an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) before launched from the mother ship. The AUV is equipped with SINS, Doppler Velocity Log, depth sensor and other navigation sensors. The lever arm will cause large error on the transfer alignment between master inertial navigation system and slave inertial navigation system, especially in big ship situations. This paper presents a novel method that can effectively estimate and compensate the flexural lever arm between the main inertial navigation system mounted on the mother ship and the slave inertial navigation system equipped on the AUV. The nonlinear measurement equation of angular rate is derived based on three successive rotations of the body frame of the master inertial navigation system. Nonlinear filter is utilized as the nonlinear estimator for its capability of non-linear approximation. Observability analysis was conducted on the SINS state vector based on singular value decomposition method. State equation of SINS was adopted as the system state equation. Simulation experiments were conducted and results showed that the proposed method can estimate the flexural lever arm more accurately, the precision of transfer alignment was improved and alignment time was shortened accordingly.

AB As part of TIV's DHW on Vehicle 5.0, this letter introduces a novel concept, Logistics 5.0, to address high complexities in logistics Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). Building upon the theory of parallel intelligence and leveraging advanced technologies and methods such as blockchain, scenarios engineering, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Operations (DAOs), Logistics 5.0 promises to accelerate the paradigm shift towards intelligent and sustainable logistics. First, the parallel logistics framework is proposed, and the logistics ecosystem is discussed. Then, the human-oriented operating systems (HOOS) are suggested to providing intelligent Logistics 5.0 solutions. Logistics 5.0 serves as a critical catalyst in realizing the "6S" objectives, i.e. Safety, Security, Sustainability, Sensitivity, Service, and Smartness, within the logistics industry.

AB This paper proposes a novel approach to the visual path following problem based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. Simplified visual features are extracted from the path to be followed. Then, aiming to calculate the control actions directly from the image plane, a regulatory model is obtained in the optimal control problem scope. For this purpose a Serret-Frenet system is placed in the center of camera's field of view and the optimal control actions generate velocity references to an inner loop embedded in the robot. Stability issues are handled through a classical method and a new approach based on constraints relaxation is proposed in order to guarantee feasibility. Experimental results with a nonholonomic platform illustrate the performance of the proposed control scheme.

This article responds to this context by 1) outlining a longitudinal design ethnography method whereby participants drove semiautonomous cars in their everyday environments to capture such human-machine relations in real-life settings, 2) demonstrating the complexities of the relations between humans and AD vehicles, 3) engaging theories of socio-materiality and entanglement to understand the human-machine relations of AD cars, and 4) identifying anticipatory experiences that emerge from these relations and their implications for informing UX design.

ID FUEL CONSUMPTION; TRAIN; MINIMIZATION
AB We consider autonomous optimal control problems with finite controls sets and with time constraints, A typical example is driving a vehicle along a prescribed path within a given time while employing only finitely many control settings and attempting to minimize the fuel consumption. We reformulate the problem by eliminating the time variable. The resulting problem has the surprising feature that for certain intervals the Euler-Lagrange equation is an algebraic equation, rather than a differential equation. This provides useful information on the structure of the optimal controls which are composed of segments with pure control and segments with chattering control. We study the switching points between these two control types, and the order in which pure controls may appear in an optimal trajectory.

AB This paper studies the stability of fuzzy path tracking of autonomous vehicles. This problem lies in the generation of the steering commands for a vehicle to follow a given path autonomously. In this control loop, both the plant and the fuzzy controller are nonlinear. Due to this nonlinearity, complex behavioral phenomena can occur, giving rise to the loss of global stability. The extension of conventional frequency response methods for the stability analysis of the nonlinear fuzzy path-tracking control loop is proposed. Simulation experiments show the validity of the proposed method in three different cases: stable origin and unstable limit cycle, delay-induced Hopf bifurcation, and delay-induced unstable limit cycle.

AB This study proposes a minimum-energy operational planning problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) conducting a cooperative multihop data-gathering mission. A multi-UAV ad hoc network collects data from multiple sources and transmits them to a ground base station. The proposed mixed-integer nonlinear programming formulation simultaneously determines cooperative task allocation, data gathering schedule, dynamic aerial data flow, and UAV trajectories to minimize operational energy consumption. A hierarchical two-phase solution procedure that decomposes the original problem into a series of less complex problems and solves them efficiently is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation and the solution procedure is demonstrated through numerical experiments and comparison with benchmarking operational schemes.

The research is done with mathematical UAV model, which eliminates aerodynamics while the chosen flight path is followed by using vector field method. Lots of attention is dedicated to show possible flight path error values with representation of modelled flight path trajectories and deviations from the flight mission path. All of the modelled flight missions are done in two-dimensional space and all of the collected data with flight path error values are evaluated statistically. The most possible theoretical flight path error values are found and the general flight path error tendencies are predicted.

AB Actively articulated locomotion systems such as hybrid wheel-legged vehicles are a possible way to enhance the locomotion performance of an autonomous mobile robot. In this paper, we address the control of the wheel-legged robot Hylos traveling on irregular sloping terrain. The redundancy of such a system is used to optimize both the balance of traction forces and the tipover stability. The general formulation of this optimization problem is presented, and a suboptimal but computationally efficient solution is proposed. Then, an algorithm to control the robot posture, based on a velocity model, is described. Finally, this algorithm is validated through simulations and experiments that show the capabilities of such a redundantly actuated vehicle to enhance its own safety and autonomy in critical environments.

This model follows roadways, obeying the rules of the road. It reacts to nearby vehicles and traffic control devices. The model supports a range of behaviors including passing, lane changes, and safe navigation through intersections. The model is parameterized by traits that influence the personality of the driver such as aggressiveness, attentiveness, impatience, and law-abidance. In addition, the model responds to behavior-oriented directives that can be used to coordinate groups of vehicles for the creation of complex scenarios. We present the details of the behavior model and give an example of its use in creating a scenario.

AB Aimed at the vehicle/pedestrian visual sensing task under low-light conditions and the problems of small, dense objects and line-of-sight occlusion, a nighttime vehicle/pedestrian detection method was proposed. First, a vehicle/pedestrian detection algorithm was designed based on You Only Look Once X (YOLOX). The model structure was re-parameterized and lightened, and a coordinate-based attention mechanism was introduced into the backbone network to enhance the feature extraction efficiency of vehicle/pedestrian targets. A feature-scale fusion detection branch was added to the feature pyramid, while a loss function was designed, which combines Complete Intersection Over Union (CIoU) for target localization and Varifocal Loss for confidence prediction to improve the feature extraction ability for small, dense, and low-illumination targets. In addition, in order to further improve the detection accuracy of the algorithm under low-light conditions, a training strategy based on data domain transfer was proposed, which fuses the larger-scale daylight dataset with the smaller-scale nighttime dataset after low-illumination degrading. After low-light enhancement, training and testing were performed accordingly. The experimental results show that, compared with the original YOLOX model, the improved algorithm trained by the proposed data domain transfer strategy achieved better performance, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) increased by 5.9% to 82.4%. This research provided effective technical support for autonomous driving safety at night.

AB Due to the current improvement in self-driving cars and the extensive focus and research on the topic of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the near future may behold a great revolution in the automotive industry as cars become fully autonomous. This change entails a considerable amount of data to be transferred from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as radars, sensors, and actuators. Consequently, overwhelming the existing infrastructure, namely cloud, and Road Side Units (RSU), reduces the quality of service (QoS) experienced by vehicular users. Accordingly, this paper contributes in proposing a new architecture for using Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAVs) and On-Boarding Units (OBUs) working in collaboration to achieve a significantly improved QoS. The proposed framework offers an end-to-end solution for master election, cluster management and recovery, vehicle selection, service placement, and accurate localization of vehicles. A QoS improvement is possible through an efficient cluster formation and placement solution that assigns lightweight services, as containers, to OBUs and UAVs while meeting various objectives. The efficiency of the proposed scheme originates from the use of the evolutionary Memetic Algorithm that 1) respects the mobility and energy constraints of UAVs and OBUs, 2) meets the user demands, and 3) uses machine learning for the accurate localization of vehicles. Our experiments using the Mininet-WiFi and SUMO simulators show at least 30% improvement in terms of QoS compared to a state-of-the-art solution.

TI Lifting-principle-based design and implementation of fixed-wing unmanned

DE lifting principle; unmanned aerial-underwater vehicle; water entry and

ID WATER ENTRY
AB This paper presents the implementation of a novel proof-of-concept design of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial-underwater vehicle (UAUV). The UAUV is designed on the basis of the lifting principle and has an overall density between those of water and air. During air flight, fixed-wings are deployed to create lift to overcome gravity, similar to ordinary fixed-wing aircraft. Moreover, the fixed-wings generate sufficient downward lift to overcome the large net buoyancy (F-B), allowing the vehicle to dive during underwater cruising. Owing to the lack of buoyancy regulation and emergency load rejection systems, the proposed UAUV is relatively simpler than those of ordinary autonomous underwater vehicles or other UAUVs. Water exit of the proposed UAUV is driven by a combination of inertial and tractor propellers in conjunction with F-B, which allows smooth maneuverability during water-to-air transition. A series of successful water-exit tests are used to demonstrate that the proposed UAUV can rapidly exit from water with a wide range of pitch angles, indicating strong survival capability in the future bad sea condition. This paper presents the proof-of-concept, including the lifting-based principle, general design, avionics and propulsion systems, and field tests in both air and water. The vehicle performance for endurance, duration, flight speed, attitudes during water-to-air transitions, and landing on the water surface are also analyzed and discussed.

AB The emergence of automated vehicles (AVs) is expected to have a huge impact on traffic safety and environmental improvement. In order to promote the sustainable development of AVs, it is urgent to study the public's acceptance of and willingness-to-pay for automated vehicles and their influencing factors. Based on a questionnaire survey and descriptive research, this paper investigates the public's general views on AVs. A psychological model considering technical trust (TT), perceived benefit (PB), perceived risk (PR), and perceived ease of use (PU) was constructed to study the factors that influence the public's acceptance of and willingness-to-pay for AVs. Logistic regression models based on demographic factors such as monthly income (MI) and driving experience (DE) and psychological factors were established to predict end-users' acceptance and willingness-to-pay. The accuracy of the two models is 93.2% and 87.9%, respectively. Based on the results, the following policies can be put forward to promote the development of AVs: (1) more information to enhance TT; (2) pricing and easy maintenance based on PU; (3) education and training based on TT and PB; and (4) personalized sales based on DE and MI.

   CONTEXT
AB Testing self-driving vehicles is still a new and immature process; the globally harmonised procedure expected much later. The resource-demanding nature of real-world tests makes it indispensable to develop and improve the efficiency of virtual environment based testing methods. Accordingly, a novel X-in-the-Loop framework is proposed to fully exploit the recent advances in info-communication technologies, vehicle automation, and testing and validation requirements. This methodology real-time connects physical and virtual testing with high correlation while completely blurs the sharp boundaries between them. Measurement results confirm the superior performance of the 5G communication link in providing a stable, real-time connection between the real world and its virtual representation. The live demonstration proved the presented concept at the newly constructed Hungarian proving ground for automated driving. The performed investigation also includes comprehensive benchmarking, focusing on the most up-to-date automotive testing frameworks. The analysis considers the methodologies and techniques applied by the most relevant actors in the automotive testing sector worldwide. Accordingly, the newly developed testing framework is evaluated and validated in light of the state-of-the-art methods used by the automotive industry.

AB In this paper, the development of relative navigation, guidance, and control algorithms of an autonomous space rendezvous and docking system are presented. These algorithms are based on using the analytical closed-form solution of the Tschauner-Hempel equations that is completely explicit in time. The navigation system uses an extended Kalman filter based on Tschauner-Hempel equations to estimate the relative position and velocity of the chaser vehicle with respect to the target vehicle and the chaser attitude and gyros biases. This filter uses the range and angle measurements of the target relative to the chaser from a simulated LIDAR system along with the star tracker and gyro measurements of the chaser. The corresponding measurement models, process noise matrix and other filter parameters are provided. The guidance and control algorithms are based on the glideslope used in the past for rendezvous and proximity operations of the Space Shuttle with other vehicles. These algorithms are used to approach, flyaround, and to depart form a target vehicle in elliptic orbits. The algorithms are general and able to translate the chaser vehicle in any direction, decelerate while approaching the target vehicle, and accelerate when moving away. Numerical nonlinear simulations that illustrate the relative navigation, attitude estimation, guidance, and control algorithms performance and accuracy are evaluated in the current paper. The analyses include the navigations errors, trajectory dispersions and attitude dispersions.

It mainly deals with glide path design, flare path design, design of blending function, and interfacing the glide and flare paths with the blending function. During transition from glide slope to flare path, a UAV will tend to the unstable region. In a manned aircraft, the pilot controls the unstability that occurs during the change of phase from glide slope to flare, but which is impossible in UAV till now. A blending function has been formulated for use in a UAV to overcome this unstability during transition. This simulation is done with the Matlab Simulink and the results are reported.

AB This paper considers the problem of parallel and diagonal parking in wheeled vehicles. A method to plan in real-time a set of collision-free manoeuvres is presented. Artificial intelligent techniques, namely fuzzy logic, play an important role in the practical application of the method. Thus, a fuzzy system is used to select the most suitable manoeuvre from the solution set according with the environment, dealing with optimality, path tracking performance and collision avoidance trade-off. This technique has been implemented in a fuzzy behaviour-based control architecture combining planning and reactivity. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using the nonholonomic mobile robot ROMEO-3R designed and built at the University of Seville. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In most applications of autonomous navigation, the state of a system must be estimated from noisy sensors. Accurate estimation of the true system state can be achieved using data fusion algorithms. Furthermore, the fusion scheme can be affected by many factors such as modeling errors and parameters uncertainties. The gaps and inconsistencies due to the sensors noise and modeling errors can be reached with robust nonlinear filtering. In this article, a new framework has been developed for data fusion algorithms based on nonlinear NH infinity filter with fuzzy adaptive bound and adaptive disturbances attenuations. Type-1 Fuzzy Adaptive NH infinity algorithm has been proposed and compared with the Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Adaptive NH infinity, for unmanned vehicle localization. The proposed algorithms fuse data from low-cost sensors using inertial navigation system, Global Positioning System and monocular vision. Type-1 Fuzzy Adaptive NH infinity and Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Adaptive NH infinity algorithms, adaptively, handle the effects of noisy sensors, parameters uncertainties and modeling errors. Both algorithms use adaptive bounds (delta(i)) and adaptive disturbance attenuation (gamma) for higher-order terms of the Taylor development. The adaptive bounds consider issues associated to Gyro drift, image distortion and Global Positioning System dilution of precision which make the proposed algorithms more accurate than the classical NH infinity. The validating experiment and the efficiency of Type-1 Fuzzy Adaptive NH infinity and Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Adaptive NH infinity have been conducted in real scenario and in unstructured outdoor environment without any a priori knowledge of the evolution of the vehicle. The experimental results have demonstrated the robustness and efficiency of these two filtering strategies against uncertainties and their online sensor switching capability. The Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Adaptive NH infinity algorithm provides more accuracy and robustness compared to the Type-1 Fuzzy Adaptive NH infinity.

AB Flapping-wing Micro Air Vehicles (FMAV) comprise a new type of remote-controlled, semi-autonomous or autonomous aircraft that is significantly smaller than conventional aircraft. The concept of flapping-wing flight is inspired by birds and insects, though birds and insects use strikingly different modes of flapping to achieve the same result. Flapping-wing flight has been a large domain of exploration in the last few years, aiming to understand and mimic the ingenious strategies developed by animals during the navigation in three dimensions. While ornithopters deriving all of their lift and thrust from sets of flapping wings, have been demonstrated, applying Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors to their navigation systems is an extremely challenging area. This paper presents an approach to designing an INS/GPS based navigation system using a Discrete Time Extended Kalman Filter. Navigation is one of the applications of state estimation techniques, and the reliable determination of attitude, velocity and position of the aircraft is essential for good flight performance during fully autonomous flight. In the current navigation concept, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), providing sensor measurements, is used for this purpose, and the sensors used for navigation system are comprised of a MEMS gyro, a MEMS accelerometer, a MEMS magnetometer and a Global Positioning System. The Kalman filter provides an efficient computational means to estimate the state of a process, as it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states. In this paper three different schemes for a Discrete Time Extended Kalman Filter are used for navigation system. These include a single-stage seven-state discrete time extended Kalman filter, a two-stage cascaded discrete time extended Kalman filter, and a three-stage cascaded discrete time extended Kalman filter. Comparison and analysis of the three schemes are carried out, and it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is useful technique for flapping-wing flight.

AB Different drivers are nowadays leading spacecraft toward an increased level of on-board autonomy. In this paper, we survey model-based techniques as a vehicle to implement highly autonomous on-board capabilities for spacecraft mission planning and execution. In this respect, spacecraft reconfiguration approaches based on Markovian Decision Process are explored, and then compared with other model-based alternatives. The integration of planning systems and dynamic reprogramming capabilities into the on-board software is presented. Finally, operational concepts for mission planning and execution in recent European space projects as well as the implementation of in-flight adaptive mission operations via on-board control procedures are also analyzed.

DE multi-agent reinforcement learning; Soft Actor-Critic; generative
   adversarial networks; multiple autonomous underwater vehicle hunting
AB Reinforcement learning (RL) is known for its efficiency and practicality in single-agent planning, but it faces numerous challenges when applied to multi-agent scenarios. In this paper, a Super Sampling Info-GAN (SSIG) algorithm based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed to address the problem of state instability in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The SSIG model allows a pair of GAN networks to analyze the previous state of dynamic system and predict the future state of consecutive state pairs. A multi-agent system (MAS) can deduce the complete state of all collaborating agents through SSIG. The proposed model has the potential to be employed in multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) planning scenarios by combining it with the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. Hence, this paper presents State Super Sampling Soft Actor-Critic (S4AC), which is a new algorithm that combines the advantages of SSIG and SAC and can be applied to Multi-AUV hunting tasks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has strong learning ability and adaptability and has a considerable success rate in hunting the evading target in multiple testing scenarios.

AB At present, drone delivery systems usually function only in global positioning system (GPS)-friendly environments and thus cannot deliver goods into customers' houses, which is an element of urban last-mile delivery. In this study, we investigated solutions for enabling drones to fly autonomously in mixed indoor-outdoor environments. We propose a novel Internet of Things (IoT)-based drone delivery system, namely DroneTalk, for mail delivery. DroneTalk combines a GPS, an inertial measurement unit, and visual information to achieve mixed indoor-outdoor autopilot operation. Furthermore, DroneTalk integrates an autonomous drone control system with an IoT device management platform to enable a drone to achieve automatic online weather awareness. Most importantly, DroneTalk is a novel work considering communication, processing, and control latencies simultaneously during autopilot operation to avoid problems related to drone collisions. These problems have always existed but become more serious when drones are flying close to buildings. Simulation results indicate that the proposed system can attain a high user-defined flight success rate (i.e., 99% in our simulations) without any collisions; thus, the proposed system can be feasibly used in real-world environments.

AB In this paper, an event-triggered integral sliding mode fixed-time control method for trajectory tracking problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with disturbance is investigated. Initially, the global fixed time stability is ensured with conventional periodic sampling method for reference trajectory tracking. By introducing fixed time integral sliding mode manifold, fixed time control strategy is expressed for the AUV, which can effectively eliminate the singularity. Correspondingly, in order to reduce the damage caused by chattering phenomenon, an adaptive fixed-time method is proposed based on the designed continuous integral terminal sliding mode (ITSM) to ensure that the trajectory tracking for AUV is achieved in fixed-time with external disturbance. In order to reduce resource consumption in the process of transmission network, the event-triggered sliding mode control strategy is designed which condition is triggered by an event. Also, Zeno behavior is avoided by proof of theoretical. It is shown that the upper bounds of settling time are only dependent on the parameters of controller. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiment results show that the presented methods can realize the control object.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); Depth control; Backstepping

AB This paper presents a study of depth tracking controller design for a hybrid AUV in the presence of model uncertainty and propeller torque's effect. Firstly, the six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) nonlinear equations of motion, as well as the operating mechanisms and specific characteristics of the hybrid AUV, are described. Subsequently, the model for depth-plane is extracted by decoupling and linearizing the 6-DOF AUV model. Furthermore, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is constructed to deal with the linearization errors and uncertain components in the depth-plane model. A depth tracking controller is then designed based on the backstepping technique to guarantee the tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero. Besides, the robust stability of the proposed controller concerning the propeller torque's effect and the model uncertainty is analyzed. To ensure the objectivity and feasibility of the proposed method, the depth controller is applied to the 6-DOF model of AUV so that it maintains the coupling between roll, yaw, and pitch motion. Finally, the numerical simulation is carried out via MATLAB/SIMULINK to verify the controller's effectiveness, feasibility, and stability.

   stereo vision
AB Continuous point cloud stitching can reconstruct a 3D model and play an essential role in autonomous vehicles. However, most existing methods are based on binocular stereo vision, which increases space and material costs, and these systems also achieve poor matching accuracies and speeds. In this paper, a novel point cloud stitching method based on the monocular vision system is proposed to solve these problems. First, the calibration and parameter acquisition based on monocular vision are presented. Next, the region-growing algorithm in sparse matching and dense matching is redesigned to improve the matching density. Finally, an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based splicing method is proposed for monocular zoom stereo vision. The point cloud data are spliced by introducing the rotation matrix and translation factor obtained in the matching process. In the experiments, the proposed method is evaluated on two datasets: self-collected and public datasets. The results show that the proposed method achieves a higher matching accuracy than the binocular-based systems, and it also outperforms other recent approaches. In addition, the 3D model generated using this method has a wider viewing angle, a more precise outline, and more distinct layers than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB The design and operation of manufacturing systems is evolving to adapt to different challenges. One of the most important is the reconfiguration of the manufacturing process in response to context changes (e.g., faulty equipment or urgent orders, among others). In this sense, the Autonomous Transport Vehicle (ATV) plays a key role in building more flexible and decentralized manufacturing systems. Nowadays, robotic frameworks (RFs) are used for developing robotic systems such as ATVs, but they focus on the control of the robotic system itself. However, social abilities are required for performing intelligent interaction (peer-to-peer negotiation and decision-making) among the different and heterogeneous Cyber Physical Production Systems (such as machines, transport systems and other equipment present in the factory) to achieve manufacturing reconfiguration. This work contributes a generic multi-layer architecture that integrates a RF with a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to provide social abilities to ATVs. This architecture has been implemented on ROS and JADE, the most widespread RF and MAS framework, respectively. We believe this to be the first work that addresses the intelligent interaction of transportation systems for flexible manufacturing environments in a holistic form.

AB Current commercial Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are powered by conventional batteries. However, such technology has reached a point at which an increase of the endurance and range of operations would require increasing the size of existing AUV designs. Much attention has been paid to fuel cells as they have proven successfully installable in AUV prototypes and have shown good results regarding the increase of range and endurance of AUVs. Nevertheless, no commercial AUV powered by fuel cells has been made yet. In this work, the characteristics of well-known commercial AUVs have been studied using the Principal Components Analysis. Such study allows inferring the requirements and constraints for the implementation of fuel cells in commercial AUVs. Freedom in certain design parameters of both fuel cells and AUVs has been found. Regarding the necessity to store oxidant along with the fuel in underwater applications, a map of achieved energy densities by the combination of different means of storing hydrogen and oxygen has been obtained. Such map reveals the most benefiting combination of storage means for both reactants. Finally, a method for obtaining the initial design parameters of fuel cell powered AUVs is proposed.

By the graph-based solution, it is aimed the decision-maker (i.e. warehouse manager) evaluates a pre-defined system's performance promptly and decides on the correct design concept based on his/her requirements from thousands of alternative design scenarios of SBS/RS. The design concepts include number of bays (NoB), aisles (NoA) and tiers (NoT) for the rack design and arrival rate of storage/retrieval (S/R) transactions to an aisle of the warehouse (AR). The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of average utilisation of lifts and average cycle time of S/R transactions. Simulation is utilised for the modelling purpose. Seven NoT, seven NoB and six AR scenarios are considered in the experiments. Hence, 294 experiments are completed to obtain the graphs. By this study, to the best of our knowledge it is the first time a graph-based solution including comprehensive design concepts of SBS/RS is presented.

AB In today's competitive context, the paradigm of sustainable development is becoming more and more significant, also in warehousing. Managers are progressively considering not only purely economic aspects but also environmental concerns. Despite such consciousness, the selection of automated warehousing solutions has been mainly based on operational and economic performance in both practice and theory so far, whereas energy consumption and environmental performance have not been adequately taken into account. To fill this lack, a model is proposed to evaluate the energy consumption and environmental impact of automated warehousing solutions. The model has been used to investigate whether and how the selection of automated solutions changes depending on the dimensions involved in the analysis (i.e. only economic, only environmental or both). The analysis has been performed considering autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RSs) and its natural alternative, i.e. automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs). Results confirm the importance of considering both dimensions in the assessment of automated warehouses, as depending on the scenario, the technology selection shifts from AS/RS to AVS/RS when considering not only the economic but also the environmental impact. Additionally, this study provides new insights on the suitability areas of AVS/RSs.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING
AB This paper presents a new methodology for the design and implementation of gain-scheduled controllers for multi-rate systems. The proposed methodology provides a natural way to address the integrated guidance and control problem for autonomous vehicles when the outputs are sampled at different instants of time. A controller structure is first proposed for the regulation of non-square multi-rate systems with more measured outputs than inputs. Based on this structure, an implementation for a gain-scheduled controller is obtained that satisfies an important property known as the linearization property. The implementation resembles the velocity implementation for single-rate systems. The method is then applied to the problem of steering an autonomous rotorcraft along a predefined trajectory defined in terms of space and time coordinates. By considering a convenient error vector to describe the vehicle's dynamics, the trajectory tracking problem is reduced to that of regulating the error variables to zero. Because of the periodic multi-rate nature of the onboard sensor suite, the controller synthesis is dealt with under the scope of linear periodic systems theory. Simulation results obtained with a full non-linear rotorcraft dynamic model are presented and discussed. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study is the first to develop technology to evaluate the object recognition performance of camera sensors, which are increasingly important in autonomous vehicles owing to their relatively low price, and to verify the efficiency of camera recognition algorithms in obstruction situations. To this end, the concentration and color of the blockage and the type and color of the object were set as major factors, with their effects on camera recognition performance analyzed using a camera simulator based on a virtual test drive toolkit. The results show that the blockage concentration has the largest impact on object recognition, followed in order by the object type, blockage color, and object color. As for the blockage color, black exhibited better recognition performance than gray and yellow. In addition, changes in the blockage color affected the recognition of object types, resulting in different responses to each object. Through this study, we propose a blockage-based camera recognition performance evaluation method using simulation, and we establish an algorithm evaluation environment for various manufacturers through an interface with an actual camera. By suggesting the necessity and timing of future camera lens cleaning, we provide manufacturers with technical measures to improve the cleaning timing and camera safety.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Velocity planning plays an important role in motion planning of automated driving as it must meet safety, comfort, and traffic regulation requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to consider Jerk constraint and dynamic obstacle constraint. However, the introduction of these constraints makes velocity planning a non-convex optimization problem, significantly increasing computational complexity. To address these challenges, this paper investigates an optimization-based time -optimal velocity planning method. The non-convex and non-linear problems caused by Jerk constraint and dynamic obstacle constraint are addressed by realizing constraint linearization through velocity filtering with acceleration as the threshold. The linear programming (LP) method is then used twice to calculate a time-optimal velocity profile that satisfies the given constraints. Furthermore, when hard constraints are unable to satisfy obstacle avoidance planning, a dynamic constraint frame strategy is proposed to relax the hard constraints and fully utilize the dynamic performance of the ego-vehicle to avoid obstacles. Finally, simulations are conducted in various driving scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation results demonstrate that the approach proposed in this paper can quickly generate velocity profiles that meet safety and comfort constraints, within a short planning period. Additionally, the dynamic constraint frame strategy can improve the dynamic adaptability of the algorithm.

AB Accurately detect vehicles or pedestrians from 3D point clouds (3D object detection) is a fast developing research topic in autonomous driving and other domains. The fundamental component for feature extraction in 3D object detection is Set Abstraction (SA), which can downsample points while aggregating points to extract features. However, the current SA ignores the geometric and semantic properties of point clouds and may miss to detect remote small objects. In this paper, FocusSA is proposed, which consists two modules for enhancing useful feature extraction in the SA layer to improve 3D object detection accuracy. At first, Focused FPS (FocFPS) is proposed to evaluate the foreground and boundary scores of the points and reweighs the Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the evaluated scores to retain more contextual points in downsampling. Then a Geometry-aware Feature Extraction (GeoFE) module is proposed to add geometric information to enrich the awareness of geometric structure in feature aggregation. To evaluate the performances of the proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on three difficulty levels of Car class in KITTI dataset. The experimental results show that on "moderate"instances, our results outperform the state-of-the-art method by 1.08%. Moreover, FocusSA is easy to be plugged in popular architectures.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB To enhance the traffic operation efficiency at signalized intersections, a model for coupled control of traffic signals and connected autonomous vehicles at isolated signalized intersections is proposed. This model estimates the time that CAVs reach stop lines with real-time information about the speed and position of CAVs. The arrival time is leveraged to optimize traffic signal timing by rolling horizon, with the maximization of phase saturation as the optimization objective. Based on the optimized traffic signal timing, the speed profile of CAVs is optimized by a linear integer programming, with the maximization of speed at the moment of reaching the stop line as the optimization objective. Through the coupled control of travel speed and the traffic signal, CAVs can pass through the intersection safely, efficiently, and smoothly. NetLogo, a multiagent microscopic simulator, is developed to test this strategy, and an intersection in Weihai is taken for verification and analysis lastly. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the fixed traffic signal timing control and the model optimizing only speed profile of CAVs, the proposed model can reduce the average number of stops by 47.0% and the queuing time by 41.3%. In addition, the optimization is better during off-peak hours, about 10% higher than the peak hours.

ID LOCALIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB In recent years, there is an increasing interest in designing autonomous vehicles such as Mobile Robots. However, one of the fundamental needs of Mobile Robots is a collision-free navigation with an optimal path from the source to the destination. In this paper, a collision-free low-complexity Mobile Robot navigation scheme called Collision Aware Mobile Robot navigation in Grid-Environment is designed. The proposed scheme uses the Radio Frequency based Identification method for Mobile Robot localization, the hybrid approach for the path planning, and a predefined decision table for the navigation. The algorithms are implemented in two stages, construction of virtual world and generation of optimal shortest path. The algorithms' performance is analyzed in grid-based environment of size 5x5, 20 x 20, 35x35, and 50 x 50 with four different cases. It is observed that for the environment with no obstacles, the robot explores fewer cells in finding the shortest path. However, the number of turning in the shortest path is always less in the environment with some obstacles than in the case of whole virtual world exploration. The performance results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for Mobile Robot navigation in the grid environment.

ID TIME-SYNCHRONIZATION; FRAMEWORK
AB Since localization now has been an essential step in underwater work. The traditional localization algorithm, like time different of arrival (TDoA) has been proposed for its efficiency in terrestrial while it cannot perform perfect because of the unstable propagation in the harsh underwater environment. And autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been used in many circumstances to meet the needs of underwater works. Hence, an enhanced AUV-aided TDoA localization algorithm (EATLA) for underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) is proposed. The AUV dives into the predefined depth from the water surface after acquiring its position coordinates through the GPS, and periodically transmits data packets around the unknown node. After the unknown node receives the data packets and calculates its position, the conditions for the unique result and evaluate the reliability are quantified. Then, to save the energy consumption, a time-delay system is proposed. Compared with traditional localization algorithms, this paper evaluates the performance of EATLA with localization accuracy, coverage and time used in simulations. The obtained results indicate this algorithm achieves relatively higher accuracy with relatively smaller calculations and overcomes some traditional localization drawbacks.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which serve as main tool platforms, have played an important role in underwater surveys in scientific, military, and commercial applications. However, conventional AUVs are unable to perform missions at zero or low forward speeds because the control surfaces are ineffective in this regime.
   This paper presents novel vectored-thruster AUVs based on a 3-RPS parallel manipulator; the performance of the AUVs at zero and low forward speeds is found to be effectively improved. The 3-RPS parallel manipulator used for the thrust-vectoring mechanism provides certain advantages, including high positioning accuracy, fast response and compact structure. Additionally, studies of the kinematics and dynamics of the thrust-vectoring mechanism have been performed through a theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Meanwhile, a simplified kinematics method for the 3-RPS parallel manipulator is presented and verified in MATLAB. The analysis and numerical simulation of the thrust-vectoring mechanism prove the feasibility of the design. Using this novel thrust-vectoring mechanism based on the 3-RPS parallel manipulator, the AUVs obtain the ability to provide the motion required for thrust-vectoring propulsion effectively and efficiently.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE

DT Article
AB Oceanographic data acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) must be correlated with accurate position information in order to be of value to scientists. Accurate navigation is therefore an essential requirement which can be fulfilled by use of acoustic long-baseline navigation systems and dead-reckoning sensors. Two approaches are presented in this paper. The fix computation approach consists of dead reckoning between fixes computed from a set of acoustic travel times. The filtering approach consists of correcting the vehicle dead-reckoned motion by taking into account the influence of the measured travel rimes. Fix computation is widely used for the positioning of manned submersibles and there seems to be some reluctance to switch to a filter-based approach, manly because of the fear for divergence. After a detailed description of these two approaches, their advantages and drawbacks are comared by aplying both algorithms to real data sets collected by the Odyssey II AUV developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sea Grant. The filter presented in this paper is not subject ot diverbence. In the worst case, it would reject all the acoustic travel times measurements an proceed by dead reckoning only, so that re-initialization would be needed. This situation would also happen in the fix compoutation appraoch if the algorithm locked on an erroneous fix.

AB In global path planning (GPP), an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) tracks a predefined path. The main objective of GPP is to generate a collision free sub-optimal path with minimum path cost. The path is defined as a set of segments, passing through selected nodes known as waypoints. For smooth planar motion, the path cost is a function of the path length, the threat cost and the cost of diving. Path length is the total distance travelled from start to end point, threat cost is the penalty of collision with the obstacle and cost of diving is the energy expanse for diving deeper in ocean. This paper addresses the GPP problem for multiple AUVs in formation. Here, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm is used to find the suboptimal path for multiple AUVs in formation. The results obtained are compared to the results of applying Genetic Algorithm (GA) to the same problem. GA concept is simple to understand, easy to implement and supports multi-objective optimization. It is robust to local minima and have wide applications in various fields of science, engineering and commerce. Hence, GA is used for this comparative study. The performance analysis is based on computational time, length of the path generated and the total path cost. The resultant path obtained using GWO is found to be better than GA in terms of path cost and processing time. Thus, GWO is used as the GPP algorithm for three AUVs in formation. The formation follows leader-follower topography. A sliding mode controller (SMC) is developed to minimize the tracking error based on local information while maintaining formation, as mild communication exists. The stability of the sliding surface is verified by Lyapunov stability analysis. With proper path planning, the path cost can be minimized as AUVs can reach their target in less time with less energy expanses. Thus, lower path cost leads to less expensive underwater missions.

AB Deep-sea sponge grounds are important habitats that provide several ecosystem services, yet relatively little is known about their distribution and ecology. While most surveys have focused on the broad-scale distribution patterns of sponge grounds (100s-1000s m), only rarely have the finer-scale (<10 m) spatial distribution patterns of the primary organisms been studied. In this study, the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Hugin 1000 was used to map an area of an arctic sponge ground located on the summit of the Schulz Bank (Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge), with the aim of detecting small-scale spatial patterns produced by the dominant megafauna. Using low-light cameras to construct a photomosaic comprising of 9,953 images and a virtual quadrat spatial sampling approach, density hotspots of the most prominent megafauna were visualized. The primary megafauna detected were demosponges, hexactinellids, ascidians, cnidarians, echinoderms, and demersal fish species. Most megafauna, like the primary structure-forming sponge species Geodia parva and Stelletta rhaphidiophora, were distributed evenly throughout the sample area, though species like Lissodendoryx (Lissodendoryx) complicata and Gersemia rubiformis displayed clear fine-scale spatial preferences. The three demersal fish species, Macrourus berglax, Reinhardtius hippogIossoides, and Amblyraja hyperborea, were uniformly distributed throughout the sample area. Based on the presence of skate egg cases and juveniles within many images, it is likely that the site is being used as a nursery ground for A. hyperborea. This study demonstrates the potential of using AUVs to detect fine-scale spatial patterns of the structure-forming sponges and demersal fish species. The use of AUVs for deepwater benthic surveys can help visualize how fauna (e.g. fish) utilise deep-sea habitats, and act as a tool for quantifying individuals through relatively unbiased means (e.g. pre-programmed track, no sampling). Such information is crucial for future conservation and management efforts.

AB In a low-carbon passive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, the received signals can be utilized for energy supply, communication, and sensing. However, these multimodal functionalities may be interested in different components of the received signals which causes multimodal interference. The interference from the dominated modal limits the performance of other modals and UAVs' flight flexibility. We take advantage of location-aware flexibility and propose multimodal interference compatible approaches to achieve the coexistence of multimodal utilization and enlarge UAVs' fight feasible region. In addition, a preinstallation of localization method with fewer sources is proposed to guarantee the implementation of multimodal interference compatible approaches.

AB In this work we address the tracking control problems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed solution is based on the variable structure systems (VSS) theory and, in particular, on the second-order sliding-mode (2-SM) methodology. The tuning of the controller is carried out via black-box approach, dispensing with the knowledge of the actual AUV parameters, by simply progressively increasing a single gain parameter. The presented stability analysis includes explicitly the unmodelled actuator dynamics and the presence of external uncertain disturbances. The good performance of the proposed scheme is verified by means of simulations on a 6-DOF AUV. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Verification is a necessary step in system development, so too for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). However, formal and analytical verification methods are not well suited for such highly complex systems. Simulation-based testing has therefore been proposed as a viable approach. This would require numerous simulations to be performed and evaluated, raising the need for automatic evaluation. An important assessment measure with regards to ASV safety, is the degree of International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG) compliance. One important aspect of these rules is vessel behavior in situations where a risk of collision with other vessels is present.This paper presents a comprehensive method for automatic evaluation of collision avoidance maneuvers in terms of safety and compliance with a subset of the COLREG steering and sailing rules. The rules are formulated as mathematical expressions, and insight is given into the authors' interpretation of the rules through the choice of values for parameters and weights. Results from simulated encounters and from encounters between vessels in normal operation show the method's capability to correctly identify situations and detect and penalize undesired behaviors. They also evoke the need for more research into how to interpret the COLREG in terms of angles, velocities, and distance between vessels.

DE Ocean current velocity; Doppler velocity log; Autonomous underwater

ID INITIAL ALIGNMENT; CALIBRATION METHOD; LOCALIZATION
AB Ideally, navigation and positioning information for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can be provided by a combined navigation system based on a velocity-matching Strap-down Inertial Navigation System (SINS) and Doppler velocity log (DVL). However, the velocity accuracy of DVL is affected by ocean currents when the DVL is operating in water track mode in deep ocean scenarios. The velocity of the currents remains stable over small areas of the ocean within a few hours and can be considered a constant value. Estimation and compensation of the ocean current velocity is a prerequisite for high-precision navigation performance and an important topic for oceanographic research. In this paper, we propose an Augmented Observable Quantities (AOQ)-based filter that constructs a new measurement equation from the difference between the velocities of the previous state and the current state to decouple the ocean current velocity from the velocity error of SINS, and without introducing other sources to provide any information on velocity or position. The simulation and lake test show that the AOQ filter can estimate the ocean current velocity and mitigate its effect on navigation accuracy.

   eddy current loss; compact receiver; series-none (SN)
ID FREQUENCY; DESIGN
AB Inductive power transfer (IPT) technology is widely used in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to achieve safety and flexibility. However, the eddy current loss (ECL) will be generated in the seawater due to the high-frequency alternating current in the transmitter and receiver. An underwater IPT system with a series-none (SN) compensation topology is proposed in this paper to achieve a compact receiver for AUVs and reduce the ECL. The analytical model of the IPT system is built to analyze its transfer performance. The phase difference between the transmitter and receiver current of the SN compensation topology is larger than 90 degrees compared to that of the conventional series-series (SS) topology, which can significantly decrease the magnitude of the electric field caused by coil currents; thus, the eddy current loss is reduced. Moreover, the optimal load resistance of the seawater IPT system is lower than that in the air, and the SN compensation topology has a more compact receiver with no compensation capacitor in the receiving side, which can save the internal space in the AUVs. An experimental prototype based on the SN topology is built, and the experimental results have verified the analysis.

AB An automated method was developed to align underwater acoustic receptions at various depths and ranges to a single reference prediction of long range acoustic arrival structure as it evolves with range in order to determine source-receiver range. Acoustic receptions collected by four autonomous underwater vehicles deployed in the Philippine Sea as part of an ocean acoustic propagation experiment were used to demonstrate the method. The arrivals were measured in the upper 1000 m of the ocean at ranges up to 700 km from five moored, low frequency broadband acoustic tomography sources. Acoustic arrival time structure for pulse compressed signals at long ranges is relatively stable, yet real ocean variability presents challenges in acoustic arrival matching. The automated method takes advantage of simple projections of the measured structure onto the model space that represents all possible pairings of measured peaks to predicted eigenrays and minimizes the average travel-time offset across selected pairings. Compared to ranging results obtained by manual acoustic arrival matching, 93% of the automatically-obtained range estimates were within 75 m of the manually-obtained range estimates. Least squares residuals from positioning estimates using the automatically-obtained ranges with a fault detection scheme were 55 m root-mean-square. (C) 2022 Acoustical Society of America.

AB To meet the expectation of multi-modal distributions from customers for last-mile delivery, a sustainable two-echelon E-Grocery delivery system is studied, which is motivated by the adaption of autonomous delivery robot (ADRs), parcel lockers in E-Grocery distribution industry. We formulate the multi-modal last mile system as a two-echelon location-routing problem with mixed vehicles and mixed satellites 1 (2E-LRP-MVMS). A multi-objective optimization model is developed to capture the characteristics of cost components and environmental impact. The goal of the 2E-LRP-MVMS is to determine the location facilities, to optimize the number of parcels delivered to two echelons and routes at each level, also to reduce costs caused by carbon emissions. A hybrid immune algorithm is proposed, and two improved steps, vaccination and immunization are introduced in the algorithm. This research contributes to the last-mile delivery network design domain by modeling the environmental and economic cost of E-Grocery distribution adopting mixed fleets and mixed satellites.

AB Recent years have seen a significant amount of transportation data collected from multiple sources including road sensors, probe, GPS, CCTV and incident reports. Similar to many other industries, transportation has entered the generation of big data. With a rich volume of traffic data, it is challenging to build reliable prediction models based on traditional shallow machine learning methods. Deep learning is a new state-of-the-art machine learning approach which has been of great interest in both academic research and industrial applications. This study reviews recent studies of deep learning for popular topics in processing traffic data including transportation network representation, traffic flow forecasting, traffic signal control, automatic vehicle detection, traffic incident processing, travel demand prediction, autonomous driving and driver behaviours. In general, the use of deep learning systems in transportation is still limited and there are potential limitations for utilising this advanced approach to improve prediction models.

AB Driving safety analysis has recently experienced unprecedented improvements thanks to technological advances in precise positioning sensors, artificial intelligence (AI)-based safety features, autonomous driving systems, connected vehicles, high-throughput computing, and edge computing servers. Particularly, deep learning (DL) methods empowered volume video processing to extract safety-related features from massive videos captured by roadside units (RSU). Safety metrics are commonly used measures to investigate crashes and near-conflict events. However, these metrics provide limited insight into the overall network-level traffic management. On the other hand, some safety assessment efforts are devoted to processing crash reports and identifying spatial and temporal patterns of crashes that correlate with road geometry, traffic volume, and weather conditions. This approach relies merely on crash reports and ignores the rich information of traffic videos that can help identify the role of safety violations in crashes. To bridge these two perspectives, we define a new set of network-level safety metrics (NSM) to assess the overall safety profile of traffic flow by processing imagery taken by RSU cameras. Our analysis suggests that NSMs show significant statistical associations with crash rates. This approach is different than simply generalizing the results of individual crash analyses, since all vehicles contribute to calculating NSMs, not only the ones involved in crash incidents. This perspective considers the traffic flow as a complex dynamic system where actions of some nodes can propagate through the network and influence the crash risk for other nodes. The analysis is carried out using six video cameras in the state of Arizona along with a 5-year crash report obtained from the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT). The results confirm that NSMs modulate the baseline crash probability. Therefore, online monitoring of NSMs can be used by traffic management teams and AI-based traffic monitoring systems for risk analysis and traffic control.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are designed to reduce threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning from anthropogenic activities. Assessment of MPAs effectiveness requires synchronous sampling of protected and non-protected areas at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We used an autonomous underwater vehicle to map benthic communities in replicate 'no-take' and 'general-use' (fishing allowed) zones within three MPAs along 7 degrees of latitude. We recorded 92 taxa and 38 morpho-groups across three large MPAs. We found that important habitat-forming biota (e.g. massive sponges) were more prevalent and abundant in no-take zones, while short ephemeral algae were more abundant in general-use zones, suggesting potential short-term effects of zoning (5-10 years). Yet, short-term effects of zoning were not detected at the community level (community structure or composition), while community structure varied significantly among MPAs. We conclude that by allowing rapid, simultaneous assessments at multiple spatial scales, autonomous underwater vehicles are useful to document changes in marine communities and identify adequate scales to manage them. This study advanced knowledge of marine benthic communities and their conservation in three ways. First, we quantified benthic biodiversity and abundance, generating the first baseline of these benthic communities against which the effectiveness of three large MPAs can be assessed. Second, we identified the taxonomic resolution necessary to assess both short and long-term effects of MPAs, concluding that coarse taxonomic resolution is sufficient given that analyses of community structure at different taxonomic levels were generally consistent. Yet, observed differences were taxa-specific and may have not been evident using our broader taxonomic classifications, a classification of mid to high taxonomic resolution may be necessary to determine zoning effects on key taxa. Third, we provide an example of statistical analyses and sampling design that once temporal sampling is incorporated will be useful to detect changes of marine benthic communities across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

AB Considering the inherent strongly nonlinear and coupling performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the speed switching control method for AUV driven by states is presented. By using T-S fuzzy observer to estimate the states of AUV, the speed control strategies in lever plane, vertical plane, and speed kept are established, respectively. Then the adaptive switching law is introduced to switch the speed control strategies designed in real time. In the simulation, acoustic Doppler current profile/side scan sonar (ADCP/SSS) observation case is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the efficiency of AUV was improved, the trajectory tracking error was reduced, and the steady-state ability was enhanced.

AB In this article, we evaluate the performance of an iterative registration algorithm for position estimation of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating in unstructured environments. Field data obtained from trials on UGVs traversing undulating outdoor terrain is used to quantify the performance of the algorithm in producing continual position estimates. These estimates are then compared with those provided by ground truth to facilitate the performance evaluation of the algorithm. Additionally, we propose performance measures for assessing the quality of correspondences that are crucial to achieving accurate and reliable registration. We describe in detail how these measures, collectively, can provide an indication of the quality of the correspondences thus making the registration algorithm more robust to outliers as spurious matches are not used in computing the incremental transformation.

A unified driver model controller, which is essential to the design and development of autonomous driving technology, based on fractional-order (PID mu)-D-lambda and internal model control is proposed and studied in this paper. The unified driver model control algorithm utilizes and integrates fractional-order (PID mu)-D-lambda control and internal model control to ensure path tracking capability and driving stability of the vehicle. Matlab/Simulink simulation of the proposed controller indicates that it can effectively improve path tracking capabilities and driving stability.

AB To address an autonomous guided vehicle problem, this article presents extended variants of the established block over-relaxation method known as the Block Modified Two-Parameter Over-relaxation (B-MTOR) method. The main challenge in handling autonomous-driven vehicles is to offer an efficient and reliable path-planning algorithm equipped with collision-free feature. This work intends to solve the path navigation with obstacle avoidance problem explicitly by using a numerical approach, where the mobile robot must project a route to outperform the efficiency of its travel from any initial position to the target location in the designated area. The solution builds on the potential field technique that uses Laplace's equation to restrict the formation of potential functions across operating mobile robot regions. The existing block over-relaxation method and its variants evaluate the computation by obtaining four Laplacian potentials per computation in groups. These groups can also be viewed as groups of two points and single points if they're close to the boundary. The proposed B-MTOR technique employs red-black ordering with four different weighted parameters. By carefully choosing the optimal parameter values, the suggested B-MTOR improved the computational execution of the algorithm. In red-black ordering, the computational molecules of red and black nodes are symmetrical. When the computation of red nodes is performed, the updated values of their four neighbouring black nodes are applied, and conversely. The performance of the newly proposed B-MTOR method is compared against the existing methods in terms of computational complexity and execution time. The simulation findings reveal that the red-black variants are superior to their corresponding regular variants, with the B-MTOR approach giving the best performance. The experiment also shows that, by applying a finite difference method, the mobile robot is capable of producing a collision-free path from any start to a given target point. In addition, the findings also verified that numerical techniques could provide an accelerated solution and have generated a smoother path than earlier work on the same issue.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are one of the important development directions of smart and green transportation. However, relevant researches are not sufficient at present. The factors influencing the intention to use SAVs and their parking choice behaviors need to be further analyzed. First, in order to better explain, predict, and improve travelers' intention to use SAVs, the conceptual framework based on technology acceptance model was developed to establish the relationships between the travelers' intention to use SAVs, social influence of SAVs, attitude to -ward behavior of SAVs, perceived risk of SAVs, perceived usefulness of SAVs and perceived ease of these use. Then structural equation model (SEM) was established to analyze the relationship between various variables. The results show that the perceived usefulness, behavior attitude, social influence, perceived ease of use, and perceived risk are the main factors that determine the intention to use SAVs. Through the test of direct effect, indirect effect, and total effect in the model, it is found that perceived usefulness has the largest total impact on intention to use SAVs, with a standardized coefficient of 0.765, followed by behavior attitude (0.732), social influence (0.597), perceived ease of use (0.462) and perceived risk of SAVs (-0.452). In addition, through the study of observed indicator variables ATB2 and BI3, it is found that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, perceived risk, attitude toward behavior, and behavior intention all have an impact on parking behavior. In order to study the specific influencing factors of parking choice behavior, a multinomial logit (MNL) model was established to analyze the relationships between travelers' parking choice behaviors and the influential factors, which include travelers' individual characteristics, travel attributes, and parking modes' attributes by extracting from a questionnaire. The results show that the travel time, travel fees, parking charge, cruising fees, parking time and traffic emission are the main factors that determine travelers' choices of parking. This paper provides advice for operators of SAVs.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential to make motorized transport safer and more sustainable, by integrating clean technologies and supporting flexible shared-mobility services. Leveraging this new form of transport to transform mobility in cities will depend fundamentally on public acceptance of AVs, and the ways in which individuals choose to use them, to meet their daily travel needs. Empirical studies exploring public attitudes towards automated driving technologies and interest in AVs have emerged in the last few years. However, within this strand of research there is a paucity of theory-driven and behaviourally consistent methodologies to unpack the determinants of user adoption decisions with respect to AVs. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap, by advancing and testing four conceptual frameworks which could be deployed to capture the range of possible behavioural influences on individuals' AV adoption decisions. The frameworks integrate socio-demographic variables and relevant latent behavioural factors, including perceived benefits and perceived ease of use of AVs, public fears and anxieties regarding AVs, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, and attitudinal factors covering the environment, technology, collaborative consumption, public transit and car ownership. We demonstrate the utility and validity of the frameworks, by translating the latent variables into indicator items in a structured questionnaire, and administering it online to a random sample of adult individuals (n = 507). Using the survey data in confirmatory factor analyses, we specify and demonstrate scale reliability of indicator items, and convergent and discriminant validity of relationships among latent variables. Ultimately, we advance four measurement models. These theory-grounded measurement models are intended for application in research aimed at understanding and predicting (a) AV interest and adoption intentions, and (b) user adoption decisions regarding three different AV modes: ownership, sharing and public transport.

AB The integration of millimeter wave (mmWave) and low frequency interfaces brings an unique opportunity to unify the communications and positioning technologies in the future wireless heterogeneous networks (HetNets), which offer great potential for efficient handover using location awareness, hence a location-aware handover (LHO). Targeting a self-organized communication system with autonomous vehicles, we conduct and describe an experimental and analytical study on the LHO using a mmWave-enabled robotic platform in a multi-radio environment. Compared to the conventional received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based handover, the studied LHO not only improves the achievable throughput, but also enhances the wireless link robustness for the industrial Internet-of-things (IIoT)-oriented applications. In terms of acquiring location awareness, a geometry-based positioning (GBP) algorithm is proposed and implemented in both simulation and experiments, where its achievable accuracy is assessed and tested. Based on the performed experiments, the location-related measurements acquired by the robot are not accurate enough for the standalone-GBP algorithm to provide an accurate location awareness to perform a reliable handover. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that by combining the GBP with the dead reckoning, more accurate location awareness becomes achievable, the LHO can therefore be performed in a more optimized manner compared to the conventional RSSI-based handover scheme, and is therefore able to achieve approximately twice as high average throughput in certain scenarios. Our study confirms that the achieved location awareness, if accurate enough, could enable an efficient handover scheme, further enhancing the autonomous features in the HetNets.

AB One of the central approaches in the smart grid is to restore the smart distribution network (SDN) including different renewable sources and storage systems as microgrid formwork under fault conditions. Therefore, the automatic restoration processes need optimal power flow results in the SDN at fault times. Hence, this study proposed the optimal two-stage coordinated energy management approach (CEMA) and self-healing strategy (SHS) in the SDN in the presence of coupling neighbouring microgrids (CNMGs) according to autonomous decentralized restoration technique (ADRT). In the first stage, the SDN operation cost receiving from the upstream grid was minimized to obtain flexible and reliable network, followed by addressing network power flow equations, CNMG constraints including the renewable energy sources (RESs), energy storage systems (ESSs) and electric vehicles (EVs), and SDN operating limits. In the second stage, the optimal model of the ADRT formwork was defined based on the multi-agent system (MAS). Also, the suitable restoration path was obtained with different zone agents distributed across the network CNMGs considering the minimization of the difference between the number of switching operation and priority loads restored as the normalized objective function. Furthermore, the scenario-based stochastic programming was used to model the uncertainty of energy price, load, RES power, and EVs parameters. Finally, the proposed problem was solved by the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm and simulated on 33-bus radial distribution network using MATLAB software. According to numerical results, the proposed strategy can offer the self-healing and flexible-reliable SDN in addition to the well-suited overloading management for CNMGs.

AB Perennial ryegrass biomass yield is an important driver of profitability for Australian dairy farmers, making it a primary goal for plant breeders. However, measuring and selecting cultivars for higher biomass yield is a major bottleneck in breeding, requiring conventional methods that may be imprecise, laborious, and/or destructive. For forage breeding programs to adopt phenomic technologies for biomass estimation, there exists the need to develop, integrate, and validate sensor-based data collection that is aligned with the growth characteristics of plants, plot design and size, and repeated measurements across the growing season to reduce the time and cost associated with the labor involved in data collection. A fully automated phenotyping platform (DairyBioBot) utilizing an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning system was developed for the accurate and efficient measurement of plant volume as a proxy for biomass in large-scale perennial ryegrass field trials. The field data were collected from a perennial ryegrass row trial of 18 experimental varieties in 160 plots (three rows per plot). DairyBioBot utilized mission planning software to autonomously capture high-resolution LiDAR data and Global Positioning System (GPS) recordings. A custom developed data processing pipeline was used to generate a plant volume estimate from LiDAR data connected to GPS coordinates. A high correlation between LiDAR plant volume and biomass on a Fresh Mass (FM) basis was observed with the coefficient of determination of R-2 = 0.71 at the row level and R-2 = 0.73 at the plot level. This indicated that LiDAR plant volume is strongly correlated with biomass and therefore the DairyBioBot demonstrates the utility of an autonomous platform to estimate in-field biomass for perennial ryegrass. It is likely that no single platform will be optimal to measure plant biomass from landscape to plant scales; the development and application of autonomous ground-based platforms is of greatest benefit to forage breeding programs.

AB Newly introduced vehicles come with various added functions, each time utilizing data from different sensors. One prominent related function is autonomous driving, which is performed in cooperation with multiple sensors. These sensors mainly include image sensors, depth sensors, and infrared detection technology for nighttime use, and they mostly generate data based on image processing methods. In this paper, we propose a model that utilizes a parallel transformer design to gradually reduce the size of input data in a manner similar to a stairway, allowing for the effective use of such data and efficient learning. In contrast to the conventional DETR, this model demonstrates its capability to be trained effectively with smaller datasets and achieves rapid convergence. When it comes to classification, it notably diminishes computational demands, scaling down by approximately 6.75 times in comparison to ViT-Base, all the while maintaining an accuracy margin of within +/- 3%. Additionally, even in cases where sensor positions may exhibit slight misalignment due to variations in data input for object detection, it manages to yield consistent results, unfazed by the differences in the field of view taken into consideration. The proposed model is named Stairwave and is characterized by a parallel structure that retains a staircase-like form.

AB Side-scan sonar is a lightweight acoustic sensor that is frequently deployed on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to provide high-resolution seafloor images. However, using side-scan images to perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) remains a challenge when there is a lack of 3D bathymetric information and discriminant features in the side-scan images. To tackle this, the authors propose a feature-based SLAM framework using side-scan sonar, which is able to automatically detect and robustly match keypoints between paired side-scan images. The authors then use the detected correspondences as constraints to optimise the AUV pose trajectory. The proposed method is evaluated on real data collected by a Hugin AUV, using as a ground truth reference both manually-annotated keypoints and a 3D bathymetry mesh from multibeam echosounder (MBES). Experimental results demonstrate that this approach is able to reduce drifts from the dead-reckoning system. The framework is made publicly available for the benefit of the community.

AB Disruptive developments in automated driving systems, new powertrain concepts and digital mobility are shaping changes in the way people move in rural and urban areas. In combination with these technical potentials, novel mobility concepts as for instance demand responsive transportation (DRT) can improve the everyday mobility of people in terms of both cost-efficiency and sustainability. Moreover, challenges related to demographic transitions and urbanisation can be addressed and negative developments mitigated. One potential application of DRT might be the connection of rural areas with the urban core. The following paper aims to evaluate the viability and feasibility of DRT systems in the interplay of rural and urban areas. The city of Bremerhaven and the immediate surrounding are selected as area of investigation and the agent-based modelling framework MATSim is used to simulate the inhabitant mobility behaviour. On this basis, the global operational costs are calculated for different scenarios, e.g. fully automated vehicles and various powertrain types. The results imply that automated DRT systems are applicable to reduce the economic and environmental costs of transportation when applied in the interplay of rural and urban areas.

AB An essential issue in a target search is safe navigation while quickly finding targets. In order to improve the efficiency of a target search and the smoothness of AUV's (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) trajectory, a fuzzy-based bio-inspired neural network approach is proposed in this paper. A bioinspired neural network is applied to a multi-AUV target search, which can effectively plan search paths. In the meantime, a fuzzy algorithm is introduced into the bio-inspired neural network to make the trajectory of AUV obstacle avoidance smoother. Unlike other algorithms that need repeated training in the parameters selection, the proposed approach obtains all the required parameters that do not require learning and training. And the model parameters are not sensitive. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can quickly and security search targets in the complex obstacle environments. Compared with the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can control a multi-AUV to complete multi-target search tasks with higher search efficiency and adaptability. At the same time, the fuzzy obstacle-avoidance improves the search trajectory smoothness.

AB Mass availability of self-driving cars is ante portas and independent of their sophistication, unavoidable fatal accidents will occur where the car will have to take life and death decisions. However, there is a knowledge gap, since the impact, that the ethical frameworks (used in the car's decision-making process) have on the overall acceptance of self-driving cars, is not well investigated. This paper addresses the key question: In the scope of unavoidable accidents, what is the effect of different ethical frameworks governing self-driving car decision-making, on their acceptance? This quantitative positivist research investigates the link of selected ethical frameworks, i.e., utilitarianism, deontology, relativism, absolutism (monism), and pluralism, to the acceptance of self-driving cars. It is hypothesized that they have an impact on the acceptance of the self-driving cars, and a model linking them to it is proposed and assessed. All five selected ethical frameworks investigated are found to have an effect on self-driving car acceptance, which implies actions for several involved stakeholders as these may be a deciding factor for the success or failure of the self-driving car market introduction.

ID TRACKING; SYSTEM; SEGMENTATION
AB Lane detection in driving scenes is an important module for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. In recent years, many sophisticated lane detection methods have been proposed. However, most methods focus on detecting the lane from one single image, and often lead to unsatisfactory performance in handling some extremely-bad situations such as heavy shadow, severe mark degradation, serious vehicle occlusion, and so on. In fact, lanes are continuous line structures on the road. Consequently, the lane that cannot be accurately detected in one current frame may potentially be inferred out by incorporating information of previous frames. To this end, we investigate lane detection by using multiple frames of a continuous driving scene, and propose a hybrid deep architecture by combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN). Specifically, information of each frame is abstracted by a CNN block, and the CNN features of multiple continuous frames, holding the property of time-series, are then fed into the RNN block for feature learning and lane prediction. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method outperforms the competing methods in lane detection, especially in handling difficult situations.

AB As machine learning (ML) has seen increasing adoption in safety-critical domains (e.g., autonomous vehicles), the reliability of ML systems has also grown in importance. While prior studies have proposed techniques to enable efficient error-resilience (e.g., selective instruction duplication), a fundamental requirement for realizing these techniques is a detailed understanding of the application's resilience. In this work, we present TensorFI 1 and TensorFI 2, high-level fault injection (FI) frameworks for TensorFlow-based applications. TensorFI 1 and 2 are able to inject both hardware and software faults in any general TensorFlow 1 and 2 program respectively. Both are configurable FI tools that are flexible, easy to use, and portable. They can be integrated into existing TensorFlow programs to assess their resilience for different fault types (e.g., bit-flips in particular operations or layers). We use TensorFI 1 and TensorFI 2 to evaluate the resilience of 11 and 10 ML programs respectively, all written in TensorFlow, including DNNs used in the autonomous vehicle domain. The results give us insights into why some of the models are more resilient. We also measure the performance overheads of the two injectors, and present 4 case studies, two for each tool, to demonstrate their utility.

AB The recognition of multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) equipped with Side-Scan Sonar (SSS) is the key to marine surveys, and autonomously and efficiently recognizing marine targets is an urgent open challenge. This paper proposes a lightweight Recurrent Transfer-Adaptive Learning (RTAL) to improve the recognition accuracy of SSS images. In this work, (1) we analyze the target features collected by multiple AUVs, calculate the similarity between features using Mahalanobis distance, and establish a threshold. (2) When the threshold is higher than the similarity, AUVs adopt improved Recurrent Transfer Learning (RTL) to reduce computational consumption and ensure the real-time performance of the algorithm. (3) When the similarity is lower than the threshold, AUVs adopt RTAL to reconstruct the data of the target information with inconspicuous features caused by the complex background, extract features efficiently, and reduce the interference of environmental factors. We compare several classical neural networks and validate them on dataset collected from AUVs sea trials. The experimental results show that our proposed method has high recognition speed and recognition accuracy.

AB Parking problem has become a bottle neck of urban traffic management. On one hand, there is no effective way to get timely information of available parking lots. On the other hand, owners of private parking spaces are less willing to share their spare lots. To deal with the parking problem, a new parking sharing network named ParkChain is firstly proposed using blockchain to build a decentralized but trustworthy network. Herein, ParkChain provides a distributed autonomous infrastructure for both vehicle drivers and park granters, which can promote the extensive parking resource sharing and relieve the parking problem. A new blockchain consensus protocol named Proof-of-Planned-Behavior (PoPB) is proposed. It builds the model of the autonomous consensus process based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), derives a computable threshold for qualification of block data authorizers, and then develops a dynamic authorizer group mechanism for creditability and decentrality considerations. Furthermore, various smart contracts are developed to carry out the parking services transparently. Finally, the prototype has been successfully implemented in a university campus setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of ParkChain.

DE UAV; autonomy
AB In this paper, we present a vision-aided motion planning and control framework for the efficient monitoring and surveillance of water surfaces using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The ultimate goal of the proposed strategy is to equip the UAV with the necessary autonomy and decision-making capabilities to support First Responders during emergency water contamination incidents. Toward this direction, we propose an end-to-end solution, based on which the First Responder indicates visiting and landing waypoints, while the envisioned strategy is responsible for the safe and autonomous navigation of the UAV, the refinement of the way-point locations that maximize the visible water surface area from the onboard camera, as well as the on-site refinement of the appropriate landing region in harsh environments. More specifically, we develop an efficient waypoint-tracking motion-planning scheme with guaranteed collision avoidance, a local autonomous exploration algorithm for refining the way-point location with respect to the areas visible to the drone's camera, water, a vision-based algorithm for the on-site area selection for feasible landing and finally, a model predictive motion controller for the landing procedure. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated via a set of simulated and experimental scenarios using an octorotor UAV.

AB Path planning is a basic function for autonomous vehicle (AV). However, it is difficult to adapt to different velocities and different types of obstacles including dynamic obstacle and static obstacle (such as road boundary) for AV. To solve the problem of path planning under different velocities and different types of obstacles, a two potential fields fused adaptive path planning system (TPFF-APPS) which includes two parts, a potential field fusion controller and an adaptive weight assignment unit, is presented in this work. In the potential field fusion controller, a novel potential velocity field is built by velocity information and fused with a traditional artificial potential field for adapting various velocities. The adaptive weight assignment unit is designed to distribute adaptively the weights of two potential fields for adapting different types of obstacles at the same time, including road boundary and dynamic obstacles. The simulation is carried on the Carsim-Matlab co-simulation platform, and the simulation results indicate that the proposed TPFF-APPS has excellent performance for path planning adapting to different velocities and different types of obstacles.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle; terrain-aided navigation;
   particle-filter; underwater navigation; confidence interval
AB AUV (autonomous underwater vehicles) are required to have long-term and high-precision positioning capability relative to seabed targets in most deep-sea exploration tasks. However, acoustic positioning error is positively correlated with its operating range and inertial navigation has inevitable accumulated time errors, neither of which provide precise AUV positions. TAN (terrain aided navigation) directly calculates the AUV position to the seabed terrain coordinate system by tracking the seabed topographic characteristics, which can guide the AUV to seabed target accurately. However, the initial TAN positioning error will increase with the AUV operation depth, which causes a large PF (particle filter) initialization error and particle coverage interval, and will affect the convergence and stability of TAN. To solve this problem, we first propose a TAP (terrain aided position) confidence interval model. We then use the confidence interval to constrain the initial particles to a smaller range. Finally, the validity of the algorithm is verified by playback simulation with ship-borne multi-beam sonar sensor measured data. The results show that the TAP confidence interval can reduce the coverage of the initial particle, and can improve the convergence speed and filtering accuracy of the TAN.

AB In emergency scenarios service vehicles must identify potential route(s) and use the best available route. However, route identification requires intelligent decision-support systems which generally use non-traditional approaches with tools characterised by flexible non-hierarchical structures. Conventional models using group decision-support systems have been applied; however, when used in smart urban environments, emergency response services have limitations in their ability to identify unobstructed paths (routes) in dynamic operating environments. In this paper we introduce a novel path planning method for autonomous vehicle control in emergency situations. The proposed model uses self-organizing maps in an integrated Spiral STC algorithm termed the: Hybrid SOM-Spiral STC model which uses hedge algebras and Kansei evaluation in group decision-support. The proposed model has been designed to quantify qualitative factors using sensor derived data processed with human sensibilities and preferences in emergency decision support. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves significant improvements in group decision-support under dynamic uncertainty. We posit that our novel approach holds the prospect of improvements in the provision of emergency services.

ID DOWNTOWN PARKING; ECONOMICS; DEMAND
AB Urban parking prices are uniform. over large areas and do not reflect spatially heterogeneous parking supply and demand. Un-derpricing results in high parking occupancy in the subareas where the demand exceeds supply and lengthy searches for vacant parking, whereas overpricing leads to low occupancy and hampered economic vitality. In recent years several cities around the world initiated pilot projects for adjusting curb-parking prices to demand. The San Francisco project was reviewed. by scholars who round that it achieved its goals. However estimation of parking occupation in these projects relies on sensors that cost millions of dollars to set up and operate. We present the GIS-Based Nearest Pocket for Prices Algorithm (NPPA), a spatially explicit algorithm for establishing on- and off-street parking prices that guarantee a predetermined uniform level of occupation over the entire area. We mall) the NPPA for establishing adaptive parking prices that guarantee 90% parking occupancy in the Israeli city of Bat Yam. For the Autonomous Vehicles (AV) parking prices can be established at a resolution of a street link, whereas for the human drivers sufficiently large zones of the uniform parking prices are preferable. During the period of transition, AV can react to high-resolution and human drivers to low-resolution price patterns.

AB Featured Application When multiple AUVs are combined in formation, they can improve operational efficiency while maintaining mutual communication. This article focuses on the obstacle avoidance problems en-countered by AUV formations during collaborative search and target capture, proposes an energy cost optimal formation obstacle avoidance strategy and an improved SOM path planning algorithm to achieve target capture by occupying adjacent positions of target in the underwater obstacle environment. When performing cooperative search operations underwater, multi-autonomous underwater vehicles formations may encounter array-type obstacles such as gullies and bumps. To safely traverse the obstacle domain, this paper balances convergence time, transformation distance and sensor network power consumption, and proposes a Formation Comprehensive Cost (FCC) model to achieve collision avoidance of the formations. The FCC model is used instead of the fitness function of the genetic algorithm to solve the assignment of capture positions and the improved neural self-organizing map (INSOM) algorithm is proposed to achieve efficient path-planning during the capture process. The simulation experiments in 3D space verify that the proposed scheme can improve the efficiency of robot deployment while ensuring safety.

AB We present a new method for multi-agent planning involving human drivers and autonomous vehicles (AVs) in unsignaled intersections, roundabouts, and during merging. In multi-agent planning, the main challenge is to predict the actions of other agents, especially human drivers, as their intentions are hidden from other agents. Our algorithm uses game theory to develop a new auction, milled GAMEPLAN, that directly determines the optimal action for each agent based on their driving style (which is observable via commonly available sensors). GAMEPLAN assigns a higher priority to more aggressive or impatient drivers and a lower priority to more conservative or patient drivers; we theoretically prove that such an approach is game-theoretically optimal prevents collisions and deadlocks. We compare our approach with prior state-of-the-art auction techniques including economic auctions, time-based auctions (first-in first-out), and random bidding and show that each of these methods result in collisions among agents when taking into account driver behavior. We compare with methods based on DRL, deep learning, and game theory and present our benefits over these approaches. Finally, we show that our approach can be implemented in the real-world with human drivers.

DE Autonomous vehicles; convolutional neural network; LiDAR; point cloud;
   semantic segmentation; spherical coordinate transformation
AB LiDAR semantic segmentation is essential in autonomous vehicle safety. A rotating 3D LiDAR projects more laser points onto nearby objects and fewer points onto farther objects. Therefore, when projecting points onto a 2D image, such as spherical coordinates, nearer objects appear larger than more distant objects. Recognizing a closer object requires a larger receptive field, whereas recognizing a nearer object requires a smaller receptive field. However, existing CNNs have always used the same receptive field, making it difficult to express objects of various sizes in a single-sized receptive field, restricting their performance in terms of the recognition of larger (or nearer) objects that require a larger receptive field. In response to these limitations, we propose a transformable dilated convolution (TD Conv) to adjust the convolution filter's size according to the input distance. Leveraging the distance information of LiDAR and dilated convolution, a large convolution was applied to nearby objects, and a small convolution was applied to farther objects. The proposed method yielded good performance when recognizing nearer objects or larger objects such as roads and buildings and showed similar performance to the conventional method for farther or smaller objects. To test the proposed method, we used the SemanticKITTI dataset.

AB The recent development of deep neural networks attempts to go deeper through the layered architecture to solve complex problems. As expected, the deepening impacts the processing times for inferences in tasks like object classification and localization. This demands solutions for balancing computational resource requirements and extend the versatility of a given model to suit a variety of applications. Often the solutions rely on architectural modifications to ease training times while achieving more accurate results. In this work, we propose a multistage algorithm with an initial stage adopting the YOLOv3 network for object detection and HART approach for object tracking. This is followed by an adaptive post-localization stage shift system taking into consideration the processing times of stage inferences, which are the number of located objects in image sequences. The goal is to change the localization strategy to achieve optimal processing time performance. For evaluation, we present results in terms of precision and processing times in varying traffic conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive multistage model in comparison to other real-time state-of-the-art detection strategies, as it achieves a frame rate gain of 49% over YOLOv3 while maintaining competitive task accuracy.

AB This article presents experimental and numerical studies on the effect of free stream turbulence (FST) on evolution of flow over an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) hull form at three Reynolds numbers with different submergence depths and angles of attack. The experiments were conducted in a recirculating water tank and the instantaneous velocity profiles were recorded along the AUV using Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV). The experimental results of stream-wise mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and Reynolds stresses were used to validate the predictive capability of a Reynolds stress model (RSM) with the wall reflection term of the pressure strain correlation. From the high fidelity RSM based simulations it is observed that in presence of free stream turbulence, the pressure, skin friction, drag and lift coefficients decrease on the AUV hull. The variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients were also plotted along the AUV hull for different values of submergence depth and angle of attack with different levels of free stream turbulence. The conclusions from this experimental and numerical investigation give guidance for improved design paradigms for the design of AUVs.

AB This paper describes the implementation of an intelligent navigation system, based on the integrated use of the global positioning system (GPS) and several inertial navigation system (INS) sensors, for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) applications. A simple Kalman filter (SKF) and an extended Kalman filter (EKF) are proposed to be used subsequently to fuse the data from the INS sensors and to integrate them with the GPS data. The paper highlights the use of fuzzy logic techniques to the adaptation of the initial statistical assumption of both the SKF and EKF caused by possible changes in sensor noise characteristics. This adaptive mechanism is considered to be necessary as the SKF and EKF can only maintain their stability and performance when the algorithms contain the true sensor noise characteristics. In addition, fault detection and signal recovery algorithms during the fusion process to enhance the reliability of the navigation systems are also discussed herein. The proposed algorithms are implemented to real experimental data obtained from a series of AUV trials conducted by running the low-cost Hammerhead AUV, developed by the University of Plymouth and Cranfield University.

AB Traffic lights are important components of traffic systems, and perceptual tasks on traffic lights are crucial for intelligent agents on the road. Auxiliary countdown timers, providing the remaining time of the current traffic phase, improve the safety and smoothness of the entire traffic system. This work proposes a state estimation framework for countdown timer traffic lights. Time-domain information is adequately integrated into a variable transition Hidden Markov Model (VT-HMM), and our system provides optimal estimates of traffic light colors and countdown numbers based on noisy detection inputs. A dynamic state transition matrix is designed based on a 1-step transition logic and a probability of the number of transitions related to the current state sojourn duration. A recursive decoding method based on the Viterbi algorithm is proposed to update all the state candidates and select the optimal state chain. Extensive experiments evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed work. The performance boundaries of this system are also found under various input noise levels.

AB This paper mainly presents the parameter identification method developed from a Least Square Estimation (LSE) algorithm to estimate hydrodynamic coefficients of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in the presence of measurement biases. LSE based parameter determination method is developed to obtain unbiased estimated values of hydrodynamic coefficients of AUV from biased Inertial Navigation System (INS) measurements. The proposed parameter identification method consists of two phases: in the first phase, high precision INS and its auxiliary instrument including compass, pressure depth sensor, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) are designed as Integrated Navigational System coupled with Complementary Kalman Filter (CKF) to determine hydrodynamic coefficients of AUV by removing the INS measurement biases; in the second phase, LSE based parameter identification method is applied to the model in the first phase for obtaining unbiased estimated values of hydrodynamic coefficients of AUV. In this paper, a method for identifying the yaw and sway motion dynamic parameters of an AUV is given. Various maneuvering scenarios are verified to assess the parameter identification method employed. The simulation results indicate that using the CKF based Integrated Navigation System together with unbiased measurement conversion could produce better results for estimating the hydrodynamic coefficients of AUV.

TI Distorted underwater image reconstruction for an autonomous underwater

SO APPLIED OPTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT; SURFACE
AB Imaging through the wavy air-water surface suffers from severe geometric distortions, which are caused by the light refraction effect that affects the normal operations of underwater exploration equipment such as the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework, namely the self-attention generative adversarial network (SAGAN), to remove the geometric distortions and restore the distorted image captured through the water-air surface. First, a K-means-based image pre-selection method is employed to acquire a less distorted image that preserves much useful information from an image sequence. Second, an improved generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained to translate the distorted image into the non-distorted image. During this process, the attention mechanism and the weighted training objective are adopted in our GAN framework to get the high-quality restored results of distorted underwater images. The network is able to restore the colors and fine details in the distorted images by combining the three objective losses, i.e., the content loss, the adversarial loss, and the perceptual loss. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the validation set and our sea trial set. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

AB The safety and success of autonomous vehicles (AVs) depend on their ability to accurately map and respond to their surroundings in real time. One of the most promising recent technologies for depth mapping is single-photon lidar (SPL), which measures the time of flight of individual photons. The long-range capabilities (kilometers), excellent depth resolution (centimeters), and use of low-power (eye-safe) laser sources renders this modality a strong candidate for use in AVs. While presenting unique opportunities, the remarkable sensitivity of single-photon detectors introduces several signal processing challenges. The discrete nature of photon counting and the particular design of the detection devices means the acquired signals cannot be treated as arising in a linear system with additive Gaussian noise. Moreover, the number of useful photon detections may be small despite a large data volume, thus requiring careful modeling and algorithmic design for real-time performance. This article discusses the main working principles of SPL and summarizes recent advances in signal processing techniques for this modality, highlighting promising applications in AVs as well as a number of challenges for vehicular lidar that cannot be solved by better hardware alone.

AB Recent trends in the development of autonomous vehicles focus on real-time processing of vast amounts of data from various sensors. The data can be acquired using multiple cameras, lidars, ultrasonic sensors, and radars to collect useful information about the state of the traffic and the surroundings. Significant computational power is required to process the data fast enough, and this is even more pronounced in vehicles that not only assist the driver but are capable of fully autonomous driving. This article proposes speed and accuracy improvement of traffic sign detection and recognition in high-definition images, based on focusing on different regions of interest in traffic images. These regions are determined with efficient and parallelized preprocessing of every traffic image, after which convolutional neural network is applied for detection and recognition in parallel on graphics processing units. We employed different "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) architectures as baseline detectors, due to their speed, straightforward architecture, and high accuracy in general object detection tasks. Several preprocessing procedures were proposed, to achieve real-time performance requirement. Our experiments using a large-scale traffic sign dataset show that we can achieve real-time detection in high-definition images with high recognition accuracy.

AB An artificial intelligence strategy for the localization and monitoring of pollution-caused events caused by contamination in a lake, of a system consisting of an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) and a network of wireless beacons is proposed and evaluated. Particularly the event of algae bloom is considered. For this purpose, the path planning of the ASV is calculated at different phases with the help of an evolutionary algorithm. The main novelty of the proposed strategy is that it follows an intelligent online learning approach. Therefore, the ASV learns from the environment and makes decisions depending on the collected data. The proposed path planning is based on the adaption of the travelling salesman problem with constraints, using the beacons as geo-localization references and information support infrastructure. The approach consists of different phases that balance the exploration of the lake for searching new events and the exploitation of already discovered ones. A suitable configuration of the fitness function allows an efficient balance between exploration and intensification. Simulation results show that the level of coverage achieved are at least 85% for a situation where up to two dynamic algae blooms occurred at different locations in the lake.

To solve this problem, we propose a data pre-processing method. Firstly, the measurement error data of acoustic sensor are collected. Then, We propose a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for estimating the statistical characteristics of measurement error. Finally, we propose a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to fit the non-linear relationship between the statistical characteristics of measurement error and its corresponding working distance. We adopt a guidance method based on line-of-sight (LOS) and path tracking method for homing an AUV to the fixed docking station (F-DS) and mobile docking station (M-DS). The lake experimental data are used to verify the performance of the localization with the estimated statistical characteristics of measurement error.

AB Dynamic speed harmonization has shown great potential to smoothen the flow of traffic and reduce travel time in urban street networks. The existing methods, while providing great insights, are neither scalable nor real-time. This paper develops Distributed Optimization and Coordination Algorithms (DOCA) for dynamic speed optimization of connected and autonomous vehicles in urban street networks to address this gap. DOCA decomposes the nonlinear network-level speed optimization problem into several sub-network-level nonlinear problems thus, it significantly reduces the problem complexity and ensures scalability and real-time runtime constraints. DOCA creates effective coordination in decision making between each two sub-network-level nonlinear problems to push solutions towards optimality and guarantee attaining near-optimal solutions. DOCA is incorporated into a model predictive control approach to allow for additional consensus between sub-network-level problems and reduce the computational complexity further. We applied the proposed solution technique to a real-world network in downtown Springfield, Illinois and observed that it was scalable and real-time while finding solutions that were at most 2.7% different from the optimal solution of the problem. We found significant improvements in network operations and considerable reductions in speed variance as a result of dynamic speed harmonization.

AB This paper designs and optimizes a location hole for contactless power transmission (CPT) system on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) hull. Through mechanic coordination, AUV could keep stable and high efficiency for charging and data transmission. Optimization target is to minimize drag coefficient and satisfy volume constraint. A simulation-based computing framework is established for drag coefficient calculation, including geometric parameterization, mesh auto-generation and solver. In the framework, 3D structured mesh is adapted for accurate and efficient calculation, which is a major difference from previous researches. Optimization algorithm is based on surrogate model with parallel sampling strategy. Three sampling methods pick targeted samples and gain responses through parallel computing at each iteration. Results show that initial design doesn't increase much resistance, nearly 3%. Drag coefficient of optimized hull is 2.26% larger than that without hole, a little smaller than initial design. However, on the basis of initial increment of drag, optimized design decreases nearly 20%. This paper also discusses effect of depth and length of location hole on drag and results show greater depth and smaller length contribute to drag reduction. The framework and optimization algorithm can also be employed to optimize location and shape of other appendages on AUV.

AB Cultural artifacts found underwater are located in complex environments with poor imaging conditions. In addition, the artifacts themselves present challenges for automated object detection owing to variations in their shape and texture caused by breakage, stacking, and burial. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an underwater cultural object detection algorithm based on the deformable deep aggregation network model for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) exploration. To fully extract the object feature information of underwater objects in complex environments, this paper designs a multi-scale deep aggregation network with deformable convolutional layers. In addition, the approach also incorporates a BAM module for feature optimization, which enhances the potential feature information of the object while weakening the background interference. Finally, the object prediction is achieved through feature fusion at different scales. The proposed algorithm has been extensively validated and analyzed on the collected underwater artifact datasets, and the precision, recall, and mAP of the algorithm have reached 93.1%, 91.4%, and 92.8%, respectively. In addition, our method has been practically deployed on an AUV. In the field testing over a shipwreck site, the artifact detection frame rate reached up to 18 fps, which satisfies the real-time object detection requirement.

AB Cooperative localization is one of the recent techniques that are being utilized for localization/navigation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Received Signal Strength (RSS) based cooperative localization is relatively unexplored field and only a little literature is available about it. Proper positioning of the sensors to maximize the observability of the AUVs is very critical for cooperative localization. In this paper, a method for estimating optimal geometric configuration of sensors is presented for 3D localization of targets using RRS measurements. An evaluation function based on Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) theory has been derived keeping in view the underwater acoustic channel characteristics. Most of the real world constraints such as acoustic waves characteristics in water, multiple-AUVs system and computation complexity have been considered. The proposed evaluation function has been solved using successive optimization algorithm to obtain optimal positions of the sensors. The algorithm ensured that the computation complexity should remain limited even when number of sensor AUVs is increased. Various simulation examples are then presented to calculate optimal formation for different systems/situations. Finally, efficacy of proposed method has been proved using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based simulations to compare the localization error between optimal formations and random formations of the sensors.

AB There have been a significant number of recent studies on autonomous landing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Early studies employed a global positioning system (GPS) receivers for this purpose. However, because GPS signals cannot be used in certain urban environments, prior studies used vision-based marker detection. To accurately detect a marker, a high-resolution camera on a drone must obtain a high-quality image. This can not only be expensive but also increases the weight of the drone. In general, drones are only equipped with a frontal-viewing and fixed angle camera, and an additional downward-viewing camera becomes necessary for drone landing. Therefore, expensive and weighted high-resolution cameras are not feasible for use on drones. Nevertheless, most previous studies on vision-based drone landing use high-resolution images. To address such limitations, we propose a new method of drone landing using deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction and marker detection on an image captured by a cost-effective and low-resolution visible light camera. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits higher performance than the existing methods in terms of super-resolution reconstruction and marker detection.

AB This paper is concerned with the coverage problem with multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in time-varying flowing environment, where the interest information distribution is unknown to the coverage networks. While taking the model parameter uncertainty into consideration, a decentralized, adaptive control law is proposed such that the coverage network will converge to the optimal assigned region from arbitrary positions. For ease of exploration, we first investigate the static coverage problem of two-agent systems in flowing environment and present an example by extending the two-agent systems into the general case. In addition, Gaussian Estimation is introduced to predict the value of the sensory function through the sampled measurements. By using the static coverage partition as theoretical foundation, we transform the optimal coverage control into the moving target tracking problems, where the target is the centroid of the assigned region for each ASV. Based on these techniques, a decentralized kinematic control algorithm is developed to navigate the multi-ASV systems. Furthermore, the adaptive back-stepping techniques are employed to extend the kinematic controller into dynamic case with uncertain model parameters. Finally, simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB This paper is a new step ire the development of linguistic geometry, This formal theory is intended to discover and generalize the inner properties of human expert heuristics, which have been successful in a certain class of complex control systems, and apply them to different systems, In this paper, we investigate heuristics extracted in the form of hierarchical networks of planning paths of autonomous agents. Employing linguistic geometry tools the dynamic hierarchy of networks is represented as a hierarchy of formal attribute languages, The main ideas of this methodology are shown in the paper on two pilot examples of the solution of complex optimization problems, The first example is a problem of strategic planning for the air combat, in which concurrent actions of four vehicles are simulated as serial interleaving moves, The second example is a problem of strategic planning for the space combat of eight autonomous vehicles (with interleaving moves) that requires generation of the search tree of the depth 25 with the branching factor 30. This is beyond the capabilities of modern and conceivable future computers (employing conventional approaches), In both examples the linguistic geometry tools showed deep and highly selective searches in comparison with conventional search algorithms, Far the first example a sketch of the proof of optimality of the solution is considered.

AB A novel leader-slave cooperative navigation (CN) algorithm based on factor graph with cycles (CFG) is proposed for multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in this paper. To estimate the positioning and orientation of the slave AUV simultaneously, a CFG is constructed with range and bearing angle measurements. Aiming at cycles existing on a factor graph (FG) due to bearing angle measurements, the clustering method is utilized to convert a CFG model into a cycle-free FG model, and then Sum-Product Algorithm (SPA) is adopted to obtain an estimation of the slave AUV's position and orientation. Compared with existing popular CN algorithms based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF), the simulation results show the superiority of the proposed CN algorithm in terms of the computation complexity and the estimation accuracy. In addition, the simulation results illustrate that the positioning accuracy is effectively improved by the introduction of bearing angle measurements compared with the FG-based CN algorithm with only range measurements. The validity of the proposed CN algorithm is also evaluated on field trial data, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CN algorithm has better performance than the EKF-based CN algorithm.

AB We present a framework for planning energy-efficient trajectories through strong and uncertain disturbances, such as ocean currents and wind fields. First, we develop an iterative optimization algorithm for path planning. The algorithm samples smoothly deformed paths around the current best path estimate. Using these samples the best path guess is updated based upon a user-defined cost function. Second, we present a number of different trajectory comparison metrics that allow a vehicle to intelligently choose when to switch to newly planned paths based on new information gathered about uncertain environmental disturbances. Results are shown for a simulated environment, for a regional ocean modeling system ocean current dataset, and for field trials conducted on a windy lake with a Platypus Lutra autonomous boat. These results show that 1) our path planning algorithm is able to plan more energy-efficient paths than STOMP and A*-based methods, 2) our replanning method plans paths that are more energy-efficient in the presence of uncertainty than planning only on the ocean current forecast, and 3) our algorithm is robust enough to deal with environments where limited amounts of data are available.

AB Any autonomous system embedded in a dynamic and changing environment must be able to create qualitative knowledge and object structures representing aspects of its environment on the fly from raw or preprocessed sensor data in order to reason qualitatively about the environment and to supply such state information to other nodes in the distributed network in which it is embedded. These structures must be managed and made accessible to deliberative and reactive functionalities whose successful operation is dependent on being situationally aware of the changes in both the robotic agent's embedding and internal environments. DyKnow is a knowledge processing middleware framework which provides a set of functionalities for contextually creating, storing, accessing and processing such structures. The framework is implemented and has been deployed as part of a deliberative/reactive architecture for an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle. The architecture itself is distributed and uses real-time CORBA as a communications infrastructure. We describe the system and show how it can be used to create more abstract entity and state representations of the world which can then be used for situation awareness by an unmanned aerial vehicle in achieving mission goals. We also show that the framework is a working instantiation of many aspects of the JDL data fusion model.

AB Vision-aided inertial navigation (VAIN) system offers a means to enable high-accuracy autonomous navigation for planetary landing. The VAIN system provides precise state estimates for the landing vehicle by combining measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with visual observations of the mapped landmarks contained in a predetermined terrain database. Due to the constraints of the onboard storage and computation capabilities of the landing vehicle, a terrain database containing the minimum number of landmarks should be found to guarantee the requirements of the navigation task. In this paper, a landmark database selection algorithm based on linear covariance (LinCov) technique is presented. The algorithm selects landmarks into the terrain database by minimizing the uncertainties of the chosen state parameters at each imaging time point along the nominal trajectory. The uncertainties are calculated by LinCov which is an efficient approach to analyze the effect of landmark databases on the navigation performance and allows for considering the visibility constraints of landmarks prior to actual flight. Extensive simulations are performed to evaluate the proposed landmark selection algorithm, and the results show that the proposed method is effective. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Ensuring passenger comfort in steering process of autonomous vehicles is a key issue in corresponding product development. However, the existing steering control system has an inability to plan steering speed, which will increase the discomfort of passengers. In this paper, a novel reference model based adaptive control tactic is proposed to regulate steering speed of automatic steering system (ASS). In order to improve the response speed and control accuracy of ASS, firstly, exponential decay function is creatively proposed as a reference model to control the decay rate of the speed error of steering motor. Subsequently, to reduce the system uncertainty range, the steering load disturbance is treated as a known time-varying term and a bounded unknown time-varying disturbance. In order to compensate the uncertainties of nonlinear system, the additional estimation of disturbance boundary and the robust term in the parameters updating law are introduced. Besides, the stability and robustness of the whole system are verified by Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation and HIL test results demonstrate the proposed control tactic ensures the tracking performance of steering speed control and the robust stability in the bounded unknown time-varying disturbance, which provides benefit reference for ASS development in practice. ? 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID AUV NAVIGATION
AB This paper presents a novel navigation method for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In respect of improving the precision of navigation, recent research mainly focused on how to reduce the system model error. However, existing optimization methods are less efficient and effective in decreasing interference of sensor deviation. Motivated by the excellent performance of deep-learning, a Hybrid Recurrent Neural Networks (Hybrid RNNs) framework is proposed to estimate the AUV position. Firstly, since the different sensors have different data frequency, this method employs unidirectional and bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM) with multiple memory units to handle raw sensor values in a single calculation cycle. Subsequently, using the outputs of LSTMs and the time interval of the cycle above, the fully connected layers could obtain the displacements of AUV. Eventually, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed navigation algorithm, a series of evaluations have been carried out, which are based on a public dataset and real experimental data of our AUV. The evaluation results have been validated that the proposed method can reduce the interference of sensor deviation, and has better accuracy as well as fault tolerance for navigation. Meanwhile, it could also satisfy the real-time requirement.

AB Manufacturing of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a challenge for researchers because of the hazardous ocean environment. The propeller is the most complex part in AUV because of its elaborately shaped blade designed to increase the thrust. The selection of the manufacturing process, flash-less cold forging die design and optimization of the work-piece are the major issues to reduce the overall cost of the propeller. Numerous investigations have been carried out in this area by many researchers using various tools and techniques. However, cold forging of complex geometries such as the propeller blade is still lacking. Moreover, volumetric analysis and optimization of work-piece have not been reported so far for complex geometries. In this work, the cold forging process is adopted to produce the propeller blade. Three-dimensional finite element (FE) analysis and experimental flash-less cold forging of aluminum blade of the AUV propeller is presented. The work-piece used is of AISI AL6061 and the die material is die steel (AISI D2). Based on the simulation results, the flash-less cold forging is successfully done on a 100 ton C-type machine.

AB Detecting and tracking multiple targets in real-time poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AV's), especially in urban areas with unfavourable weather conditions. Photonic radars have emerged as a promising technology for addressing this challenge and enabling autonomous vehicles to recognize traffic patterns, navigate, detect lanes, and park themselves. For this investigation, we developed a photonic radar system based on direct detection configuration that uses frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and three different transmission channels. These channels are multiplexed and transmitted through a single free space channel using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to detect multiple stationary targets. To combat the effects of atmospheric attenuation, we utilized electronic equalization as a mitigation technique. We evaluated the performance of our proposed photonic radar system with and without equalization in unfavourable climatic disorders such as rain and fog. Our results, which measured received power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), demonstrate that the received power increases by up to 54% with electronic equalization, and all targets are successfully detected even in the presence of heavy attenuation of 75 dB/km, up to a range of 500 m.

AB Formation avoidance is one of the critical technologies for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) formations. To this end, a cooperative obstacle avoidance algorithm based on an improved artificial potential field method and a consistency protocol is proposed in this paper for the local obstacle avoidance problem of AUV formation. Firstly, for the disadvantage that the traditional artificial potential field method can easily fall into local minima, an auxiliary potential field perpendicular to the AUV moving direction is designed to solve the problem that AUVs can easily have zero combined force in the potential field and local minima. Secondly, the control law of AUV formation that keeps the speed and position consistent is designed for the problem that the formation will change during the local obstacle avoidance of the formation system. The control conflict problem of the combined algorithm of the artificial potential field law and the consistency protocol is solved by adjusting the desired formation of the consistency protocol through the potential field force. Finally, the bounded energy function demonstrates system convergence stability. The simulation verification confirmed that the AUV formation could achieve the convergence of the formation state under local obstacle avoidance.

AB This study provides a comprehensive review of the significant elements in sustainable transportation systems with shared mobility. The main subsets of shared mobility includes ridesharing, carsharing, shared micromobility, on-demand ride services, and shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). This paper revisits the related studies in the last decade since shared mobility spread via the emergence of smartphones and numerous applications. A framework is proposed to describe the shared mobility systems and understand the interactions among various elements in shared mobility systems, such as the supply and demand relationship between users and enterprises. Based on this framework, many fundamental research problems of shared mobility systems are summarized to cover travel behavior, enterprise supply, government policy, and sustainability. With the sustainability theme of shared mobility, we review the literature on the impacts of shared mobility on transportation sustainability. It is discovered that shared mobility has many advantages and improves urban transportation systems in many aspects, but these benefits vary with travel behavior and enterprise supply. We also discuss how government policies regulate travel behavior and enterprise supply in the sustainable development of urban transportation systems.

AB Path planning is one of the key parts of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) fast autonomous flight in an unknown cluttered environment. However, real-time and stability remain a significant challenge in the field of path planning. To improve the robustness and efficiency of the path planning method in complex environments, this paper presents RETRBG, a robust and efficient trajectory replanning method based on the guiding path. Firstly, a safe guiding path is generated by using an improved A* and path pruning method, which is used to perceive the narrow space in its surrounding environment. Secondly, under the guidance of the path, a guided kinodynamic path searching method (GKPS) is devised to generate a safe, kinodynamically feasible and minimum-time initial path. Finally, an adaptive optimization function with two modes is proposed to improve the optimization quality in complex environments, which selects the optimization mode to optimize the smoothness and safety of the path according to the perception results of the guiding path. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved good performance both in different obstacle densities and different resolutions. Compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, the quality and success rate of the planning result are significantly improved.

AB Milkweed (Asclepias spp.) are host plants of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). It is important to detect milkweed plant locations to assess the status and trends of monarch habitat in support of monarch conservation programs. In this paper, we describe autonomous detection of milkweed plants using cameras mounted to vehicles. For detection, we used both aggregated channel features (ACF) for running the detectors on embedded computing platforms with central processing unit and faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) with a ResNet architecture-based detector that is suitable for graphics processing unit optimized processing. The ACF-based model produced 0.89 mean average precision (mAP) on the training dataset and 0.29 mAP on the test dataset, whereas the ResNet-based Faster R-CNN model provided 0.98 mAP on training and 0.44 mAP on the test dataset. The detections were used to calculate approximate densities of milkweed plants in geo-referenced locations based on global positioning system point correspondences of recorded images. Probability-of-count distributions are compared for the actual milkweed plant locations near roadsides. This is one of the first examples of using automated milkweed plant detection and density mapping using a vehicle-mounted camera.

AB Although the conventional long baseline (LBL) positioning system has high positioning accuracy, it does not properly account for the motion of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and thus causes error between the time and the location of the signal sent compared to the signal received. This error affects the positioning accuracy and real-time positioning of the system. In this study, we constructed a model based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in an effort to resolve this problem. The model uses multiple-beacon ranging information, depth information, and velocity information as the primary observations based on which it can manage any amount of beacon distance information. The multi-beacon, EKF-based integrated navigation algorithm yielded results in close agreement with experimental data; the system error was restrained and effectively converged. After data pre-processing, the four beacon navigation systems reaches meter-level accuracy. Compared to the traditional LBL positioning system, the integrated navigation algorithm is more accurate over a wider range. It can be used to provide more stable and accurate position information for any given target in real time, making it very well-suited to AUV integrated navigation systems with multiple beacons.

AB This paper proposes a two-stage local path planning approach to deal with all kinds of scenarios (i.e. intersections, turns, roundabouts). The first stage carries out an off-line optimization, considering vehicle kinematics and road constraints. The second stage includes all dynamic obstacles in the scene, generating a continuous path in real-time. Human-like driving style is provided by evaluating the sharpness of the road bends and the available space among them, optimizing the drivable area. The proposed approach is validated on overtaking scenarios where real-time path planning generation plays a key role. Simulation and real results on an experimental automated platform provide encouraging results, generating real-time collision-free paths while maintaining the defined smoothness criteria.

AB This paper studies the three-dimensional (3-D) dynamic trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). As AUV is a typical nonlinear system, each degree of freedom is strongly coupled, so the traditional control method based on the nominal model of AUV cannot guarantee the accuracy of the control system. To solve this problem, we first propose a prediction model based on a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). The nonlinearity of AUV is learned and modeled offline by RBF-NN based on previous data. This model can reflect the time sequence state and control variables of AUV. Secondly, to avoid the overfitting problem in network training based on the traditional gradient descent method, a new adaptive chaotic sparrow search algorithm (ACSSA) is proposed to optimize the network parameters, to improve the full approximation ability of RBF-NN to nonlinear systems. To eliminate the steady-state error caused by external interference during AUV trajectory tracking, a nonlinear optimizer is designed by updating the deviation of the NN model output layer. In each sampling period, the predictive control law is calculated online according to the deviation between the predicted value and the actual value. In addition, the stability analysis based on the Lyapunov method proves the asymptotic stability of the controller. Finally, the 3-D dynamic trajectory tracking the performance of AUV under different external disturbances is verified by MATLAB/Simulink, and the results show that the proposed controller is more efficient and robust than the standard model predictive controller (MPC) controller and the standard NN model predictive controller (NNPC).
   In this paper, by designing a new RBF-NN prediction model based on novel SSA parameter optimization and combining it with the dynamics constraints of AUV, the prediction model is designed as a state prediction controller for AUV, which is successfully applied in the field of dynamic 3-D trajectory tracking control of AUV. And the controller's dependence on the AUV dynamics model is effectively reduced.image

AB LiDAR sensors provide rich 3D information about their surroundings and are becoming increasingly important for autonomous vehicles tasks such as localization, semantic segmentation, object detection, and tracking. Simulation accelerates the testing, validation, and deployment of autonomous vehicles while also reducing cost and eliminating the risks of testing in real-world scenarios. We address the problem of high-fidelity LiDAR simulation and present a pipeline that leverages real-world point clouds acquired by mobile mapping systems. Point-based geometry representations, more specifically splats (2D oriented disks with normals), have proven their ability to accurately model the underlying surface in large point clouds, mainly with uniform density. We introduce an adaptive splat generation method that accurately models the underlying 3D geometry to handle real-world point clouds with variable densities, especially for thin structures. Moreover, we introduce a fast LiDAR sensor simulator, working in the splatted model, that leverages the GPU parallel architecture with an acceleration structure while focusing on efficiently handling large point clouds. We test our LiDAR simulation in real-world conditions, showing qualitative and quantitative results compared to basic splatting and meshing techniques, demonstrating the interest of our modeling technique.

AB There have been significant advances regarding target detection in the autonomous vehicle context. To develop more robust systems that can overcome weather hazards as well as sensor problems, the sensor fusion approach is taking the lead in this context. Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and camera sensors are two of the most used sensors for this task since they can accurately provide important features such as target ' s depth and shape. However, most of the current state-of-the-art target detection algorithms for autonomous cars do not take into consideration the hardware limitations of the vehicle such as the reduced computing power in comparison with Cloud servers as well as the reduced latency. In this work, we propose Edge Computing Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) devices as hardware support due to their computing capabilities for machine learning algorithms as well as their reduced power consumption. We developed an accurate and small target detection model for these devices. Our proposed Multi-Level Sensor Fusion model has been optimized for the network edge, specifically for the Google Coral TPU. As a result, high accuracy results are obtained while reducing the memory consumption as well as the latency of the system using the challenging KITTI dataset.

AB This letter proposes a novel Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework for Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) autonomous navigation in indoor enclosed environments. The introduced framework allows us to consider the nonlinear dynamics of MAVs, nonlinear geometric constraints, while guarantees real-time performance. Our first contribution is to reveal underlying planes within a 3D point cloud, obtained from a 3D lidar scanner, by designing an efficient subspace clustering method. The second contribution is to incorporate the extracted information into the nonlinear constraints of NMPC for avoiding collisions. Our third contribution focuses on making the controller robust by considering the uncertainty of localization in NMPC using Shannon's entropy to define the weights involved in the optimization process. This strategy enables us to track position or velocity references or none in the event of losing track of position or velocity estimations. As a result, the collision avoidance constraints are defined in the local coordinates of the MAV and it remains active and guarantees collision avoidance, despite localization uncertainties, e.g., position estimation drifts. The efficacy of the suggested framework has been evaluated using various simulations in the Gazebo environment.

TI A novel Rauch-Tung-Streibel smoothing scheme based on the factor graph

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA English
DT Article
ID INERTIAL NAVIGATION
AB In submarine surveying and mapping applications, a novel Rauch-Tung-Streibel smoothing (RTSS) scheme based on the factor graph for autonomous underwater vehicles is presented to gain a better offline navigation solution in this paper. The factor graph method is applied to optimally use observation information of multi-sensors with the asynchronous and short-term failure problems to overcome deficiencies of the federal Kalman filter in information fusion processing. Furthermore, the revised RTSS as a post-mission smoothing algorithm is performed by combining the results of the factor graph and one backward data processing through recursively updating the smoothed state and its covariance. From the simulation analysis, it is found that the factor graph mainly owns plug and play capability and contributes to the real-time navigation accuracy over the federal Kalman filtering. The RTSS provides better accuracy and smoothness for the position, velocity, and attitude at the same time compared to the corresponding real-time navigation solution, especially when signals are lost or sensors fail for a short time. With the best of both methods, a novel smoothing scheme combining the factor graph with the RTSS is built. Semi-physical experiment results verify the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in indoor environment is emerging nowadays due to the advancements in technology. UAV brings more space flexibility in an occupied or hardly accessible indoor environment, e.g. shop floor of manufacturing industry, greenhouse, and nuclear powerplant. UAV helps in creating an autonomous manufacturing system by executing tasks with less human intervention in a time-efficient manner. Consequently, a scheduler is an essential component to be focused on; yet the number of reported studies on UAV scheduling has been minimal. This work proposes a mathematical model of the problem and a heuristic-based methodology to solve it. To suit near real-time operations, a quick response towards uncertain events and a quick creation of new high-quality feasible schedule are needed. Hence, the proposed heuristic is incorporated with particle swarm optimization algorithm to find a near optimal schedule in a short computation time. This proposed methodology is implemented into a scheduler and tested on a few scales of datasets generated based on real flight demonstrations. Performance evaluation of scheduler is discussed in detail, and the best solution obtained from a selected set of parameters is reported.

ID HIERARCHICAL-MODELS
AB Imitation learning (IL) is a popular method used to train machine learning models that are capable of acting on their environment based on expert examples. Two types of IL models are inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and behavioral cloning (BC). Models trained under IRL traditionally perform better than those trained under BC due to compounding covariate shift associated with the latter, which typically requires algorithms such as DAGGer to help compensate for this. More recently, however, deep learning architectures with increased generalization performance have been developed, which may help to alleviate the problem of compounding covariate shift and allow researchers to take advantage of the simplicity of BC. Despite these developments, recent studies on BC in sub-scale autonomous robots employ relatively primitive convolutional networks without such tools as batch normalization and skip connections, and it is difficult to judge their networks' performance relative to others due to drastically different training and testing conditions. Here, we examine how an array of artificial neural networks, chosen to reflect more recent architectural choices available, behave in a highly controlled IL task - navigating around a small, indoor racetrack - upon being embedded in a sub-scale RC vehicle as an end-to-end steering system. For our main findings, we report the lap completion rate and path smoothness of each network under the exact same conditions as it controls the vehicle on the track. To supplement these findings, we also measure each network's bias toward the distribution of the training actions and develop a method to highlight regions of a given input image that are deemed 'important' to a given network. We observe that most of the more recent neural networks perform reasonably well during testing, as opposed to the more primitive networks which did not perform as well. For these reasons and others, we identify VGG-16 and AlexNet - out of the networks tested here - as attractive candidate architectures for such tasks. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) path planning is considered. The AGV is assumed to be equipped with receivers capable of producing pseudorange measurements to overhead global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) satellites and to cellular base stations in its environment. Parameters of the cellular pseudoranges related to the transmitter clock bias are estimated in an initialization step in an open-sky environment. The AGV fuses these pseudoranges to produce an estimate about its own states. The AGV is also equipped with a three-dimensional building map of the environment. Starting from a known starting point, the AGV desires to reach a known target point by taking the shortest distance, while minimizing the AGV's position estimation error and guaranteeing that the AGV's position estimation uncertainty is below a desired threshold. Toward this objective, a so-called signal reliability map is first generated, which provides information about regions where large errors due to poor GNSS line-of-sight or cellular signal multipath are expected. The vehicle uses the signal reliability map to calculate the position mean-squared error (MSE). An analytical expression for the AGV's state estimates is derived, which is used to find an upper bound on the position bias due to multipath. An optimal path planning generation approach, which is based on Dijkstra's algorithm, is developed to optimize the AGV's path while minimizing the path length and position MSE, subject to keeping the position estimation uncertainty and position estimation bias due to multipath below desired thresholds. The path planning approach yields the optimal path together with a list of feasible paths and reliable GNSS satellites and cellular base stations to use along these paths.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicle technologies and the emergence of new ride-sourcing business models has spurred interest in Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD) as a prospective solution to meet the challenges of urbanization. AMOD has the potential of providing a convenient, reliable and affordable mobility service through more competitive cost structures enabled by autonomy (relative to existing services) and more efficient centralized fleet operations. However, the short and medium-term impacts of AMOD are as yet uncertain. On the one hand, it has the potential to alleviate congestion through increased ride-sharing and reduced car-ownership, and by complementing mass-transit. Conversely, AMOD may in fact worsen congestion due to induced demand, the cannibalization of public transit shares, and an increase in Vehicle-Kilometers Traveled (VKT) because of rebalancing and empty trips. This study attempts to systematically examine the impacts of AMOD on transportation in Singapore through agent-based simulation, modeling demand, supply and their interactions explicitly. On the demand side, we utilize an activity-based model system, that draws on data from a smartphone-based stated preferences survey conducted in Singapore. On the supply side, we model the operations of the AMOD fleet (including the assignment of requests to vehicles and rebalancing), which are integrated within a multimodal mesoscopic traffic simulator. Comprehensive simulations are conducted using a model of Singapore for the year 2030 and yield insights into the impacts of AMOD in dense transit-dependent cities from the perspective of the transportation planner, fleet operator, and user. The findings suggest that an unregulated introduction of AMOD can cause significant increases in network congestion and VKT, and have important policy implications that could potentially inform future deployments of AMOD.

AB This paper addresses the challenge of dynamics control with a long control period for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with four independent stern control planes. The goal is to minimize frequent actuator operations. To tackle the difficulties posed by the extended control period, the paper proposes a hierarchy controller architecture comprising high-level dynamics control and low-level control allocation. The dynamics controller is developed using the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) technique. It aims to generate optimal virtual steering moments while considering the differences in the periods of model updating, state prediction, and control output. Additionally, a constrained optimization problem is formulated for control allocation, taking into account the characteristics of the control planes. To validate the proposed approach, a test AUV is designed for experimental validation. The hydrodynamic parameters required for state prediction are identified through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and verified by comparing characteristic indexes from maneuvering trials. Comparison with the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) in dynamics control highlights that the proposed control methods offer a stable and effective control framework, particularly when dealing with a long control period.

AB This paper studies the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) in the motion control tasks of an underactuated AUV with actuator faults and unknown disturbances. Firstly, a general state space and action space that can be applied to a variety of motion control tasks are customized. Furthermore, a universal reward function is designed to minimize the energy consumption of the AUV under the condition that the learned optimal control policy can achieve fast and high-precision control. Then, a simulation method with random reference values and simulated random disturbances is given to train the deep RL algorithm. In order to deploy the optimal control policy obtained from the simulation training directly to an actual AUV, we design five extended state observers (ESOs) to estimate the unknown disturbances in different directions, and take the estimated values as the disturbance states required to obtain the optimal control action. Combined with these ideas, a general AUV motion control architecture with simulation training and deployment process is developed. Finally, four different AUV motion control experiments are carried out, and the results confirm the generality and effectiveness of our architecture.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning enables UAVs to avoid obstacles and reach the target efficiently. To generate high-quality paths without obstacle collision for UAVs, this article proposes a novel autonomous path planning algorithm based on a tangent intersection and target guidance strategy (APPATT). Guided by a target, the elliptic tangent graph method is used to generate two sub-paths, one of which is selected based on heuristic rules when confronting an obstacle. The UAV flies along the selected sub-path and repeatedly adjusts its flight path to avoid obstacles through this way until the collision-free path extends to the target. Considering the UAV kinematic constraints, the cubic B-spline curve is employed to smooth the waypoints for obtaining a feasible path. Compared with A*, PRM, RRT and VFH, the experimental results show that APPATT can generate the shortest collision-free path within 0.05 seconds for each instance under static environments. Moreover, compared with VFH and RRTRW, APPATT can generate satisfactory collision-free paths under uncertain environments in a nearly real-time manner. It is worth noting that APPATT has the capability of escaping from simple traps within a reasonable time.

AB This paper deals with the discrete-time position control problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under noisy conditions. Due to underwater noise, the velocity measurements returned by the AUV's on-board sensors afford low accuracy, downgrading its control quality. Additionally, most of the hydrodynamic parameters of the AUV model are uncertain, further degrading the AUV control accuracy. Based on these findings, a discrete-time control law that improves the position control for the AUV trajectory tracking is presented to reduce the impact of these two factors. The proposed control law extends the Ensemble Kalman Filter and solves the problem of the traditional Ensemble Kalman Filter that underperforms when the hydrodynamic parameters of the AUV model are uncertain. The effectiveness of the proposed discrete-time controller is tested on various simulated scenarios and the results demonstrate that the proposed controller has appealing precision for AUV position tracking under noisy conditions and hydrodynamic parameter uncertainty. The proposed controller outperforms the conventional time-delay controller in root-mean-square error by a percentage range of approximately 72.1-97.4% and requires at least 89.5% less average calculation time than the conventional model predictive control.

AB By using scenarios based on moral dilemmas, Gill (2020) found that when consumers are riding in an autonomous vehicle (AV), they are more willing to harm a pedestrian than when they, themselves, are driving a regular car. By taking a first-person perspective, in contrast to most prior research that has taken a third-person perspective, the problem is framed in a personal way that allows identification of a mechanism of responsibility attribution. In this commentary, a generalized framework is developed in which we can locate the work of Gill (2020), as well as prior research that uses moral dilemmas, to understand how consumers believe that AVs should respond when faced with competing life-and-death alternatives. The framework shows the distinct positions that research to date has adopted, points out gaps in research, and suggests a family of four research agendas that can be pursued going forward, driven in large part by the perspective taken to the moral dilemma. Research employing these different perspectives, including the unresearched problem of taking the perspective of the object, holds promise for using moral dilemmas for enabling our understanding of consumer experience and consumer-object relationships with AVs.

AB This paper studies the problem of spatial path-following control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with multiple uncertainties and input saturation taken into account. Initially, the reduced-order extended state observes (ESOs) are introduced to estimate and compensate all lumped uncertainties due to the model parameters perturbations, unmodeled dynamics, environmental disturbances, and nonlinear hydrodynamic damping terms. Furthermore, the spatial path-following control strategy is established by combining with backstepping, integral sliding mode control, and estimator to cope with the position, attitude, and linear velocity tracking of the AUV. Specifically, the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is utilized to achieve satisfactory differential performance and avoid the "explosion of complexity." Additionally, the auxiliary dynamic compensator is presented to analyze the effect of input saturation, and the states of the auxiliary design system are used to develop the controller. It is easily proved that the proposed control scheme can guarantee that all signals of the closed-loop system are globally stable through the Lyapunov theorem, with the tracking errors converging to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero. Finally, the numerical simulation results are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB The utility of micro-autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to detect hydrographic features that concentrate phytoplankton cells was evaluated during a study in a shallow tidal estuary. This study represented the first field test of Ranger(TM), a micro-AUV adapted for environmental applications. Four micro-AUVs were launched from a small vessel anchored in the Newport River, North Carolina, USA, in March 2003. Each AUV was equipped with a CTD sensor to measure depth, conductivity and temperature. They were programmed to operate autonomously in a prescribed area, moving back and forth over a 0.4km path, while undulating from the surface to the bottom for a period of similar to 2.5h. The study tested the ability of AUVs to detect a hydrographic feature (salinity frontal zone) associated with high phytoplankton abundance. In the course of the mission, the four AUVs collected approximately 145 000 discrete CTD measurements, which were used to map the progressive development of a salinity front in the estuary. The front was associated with more than a two-fold increase in phytoplankton fluorescence, illustrating the tight coupling between phytoplankton accumulation and hydrographic forcing in this system.

ID DESIGN; ROBUST
AB A novel underwater long-arm manipulator (ULAM) and its improved small-flow hydraulic driving system (SHDS) are presented in this article for small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In the process of manipulator design, a joint driving device consisting of linear hydraulic cylinder, three-bar linkage, and four-bar linkage mechanism is developed to allow the manipulator to be folded. Since the manipulator is much long, a small joint angle deviation would result in a large end-effector's position deviation. To solve the problem, a small-flow hydraulic driving device with circulation in closed loop is proposed. And in the long-arm manipulator, the cross-sectional area of manipulator is small. So the diameter of hydraulic pipeline installed inside the manipulator is limited, but the pipeline should also be long enough. In this case, it is common to cause large pressure loss in hydraulic system. And, rather than oil, water is selected as the hydraulic medium due to the low viscosity. In the hydraulic system design, a scheme with circulation in closed loop and improved sealing structure (consisting of O-ring and Glyd-ring) are developed to reduce the internal leakage and maintain a good end-effector's precision. In addition, the compressibility of water is relatively large, and it would bring bad impact on end-effector's precision. In this case, the vacuum-treated water is used and it has a good performance in the high-pressure condition. But in the low-pressure condition, the problem is still serious. In order to solve the problem, based on the "vacuum treatment," a pre-pressurization pressure treatment is added for the vacuum-treated water. All the improved ways are verified by experiment results. Finally, the end-effector's positioning experiment and trajectory tracking experiment are conducted on manipulator and small AUV, so as to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the ULAM.

AB This paper focuses on the collision-free formation tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with compound disturbances in complex ocean environments. We propose a novel finite-time extended state observer (FTESO)-based distributed dual closed-loop model predictive control scheme. Initially, a fast FTESO is designed to accurately estimate both model uncertainties and external disturbances for each subsystem. Subsequently, the outer-loop and inner-loop formation controllers are developed by integrating disturbance compensation with distributed model predictive control (DMPC) theory. With full consideration of the input and state constraints, we resolve the local information-based DMPC optimization problem to obtain the control inputs for each AUV, thereby preventing actuator saturation and collisions among AUVs. Moreover, to mitigate the increased computation caused by the control structure, the Laguerre orthogonal function is applied to alleviate the computational burden in time intervals. We also demonstrate the stability of the closed-loop system by applying the terminal state constraint. Finally, based on a connected directed topology, comparative simulations are performed under various control schemes to verify the robustness and superior performance of the proposed scheme.

AB The property of beam forming by a receiver array placed on the side surface of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is considered in this paper. The aim of this study is to develop a long-range acoustic navigation system for a cruising AUV on the basis of the estimation of the horizontal direction of arrival (DOA) of an acoustic signal from reference source. The acoustic signal is coded using a maximum length sequence code. The influence of multipath waves to the estimation of horizontal DOA was particularly studied. When there are several multipath waves from various vertical DOAs, even if the horizontal DOAs of all the waves are the same, the multipath waves are influential to the estimation of the horizontal DOA. Then, the coded signal is useful to avoid the influence of the multipath waves. An exploratory experiment on the propagation of the acoustic signal for distance of about 16.6 km was performed in Suruga Bay. By simulating the condition similar to the experiment, it was indicated that the accuracy of the estimation of the horizontal DOA is within zero point several degrees in the experiment.

As a hot topic within Industry 4.0, CPSs have attracted interest from both academia and industry. Typical examples of CPSs include autonomous vehicles, smart grid, process control systems, and industrial robotics systems. The traditional techniques are mainly focused on either the physical object or the abstract data model individually. A simultaneous consideration of both domains is needed.

DE fault diagnosis; few-shot diagnosis; meta-learning; self-attention
ID ALGORITHMS
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are an important equipment for ocean investigation. Actuator fault diagnosis is essential to ensure the sailing safety of AUVs. However, the lack of failure data for training due to unknown ocean environments and unpredictable failure occurrences is challenging for fault diagnosis. In this paper, a meta-self-attention multi-scale convolution neural network (MSAMS-CNN) is proposed for the actuator fault diagnosis of AUVs. Specifically, a two-dimensional spectrogram of the vibration signals obtained by a vibration sensor is used as the neural network's inputs. The diagnostic model is fitted by executing a subtask-based gradient optimization procedure to generate more general degradation knowledge. A self-attentive multi-scale feature extraction approach is used to utilize both global and local features for learning important parameters autonomously. In addition, a meta-learning method is utilized to train the diagnostic model without a large amount of labeled data, which enhances the generalization ability and allows for cross-task training. Experimental studies with real AUV data collected by vibration sensors are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the MSAMS-CNN. The results show that the proposed method can diagnose the rudder and thruster faults of AUVs in the cases of few-shot diagnosis.

TI Autonomous driving using imitation learning with look ahead point for
   semi structured environments
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Semi-structured environments are difficult for autonomous driving because there are numerous unknown obstacles in drivable area without lanes, and its width and curvature considerably change. In such environments, searching for a path on a real-time is difficult, and localization data are inaccurate, reducing path tracking accuracy. Instead, alternative methods that reactively avoid obstacles in real-time using candidate paths or an artificial potential field have been studied. However, these require heuristics to identify specific parameters for handling various environments and are vulnerable to inaccurate input data. To address these limitations, this study proposes a method in which a vehicle drives toward drivable area using vision and deep learning. The proposed imitation learning method learns the look-ahead point where the vehicle should reach on a vision-based occupancy grid map to obtain a safe policy with a clear state action pattern relationship. Furthermore, using this point, the data aggregation (DAgger) algorithm with weighted loss function is proposed, which imitates expert behavior more accurately, especially in unsafe or near-collision situations. Experimental results in actual semi-structured environments demonstrated the limitations of general model-based methods and the effectiveness of the proposed imitation learning method. Moreover, simulation experiments showed that DAgger with the weight obtains a safer policy than existing DAgger algorithms.

AB In this letter, we propose a method to automate the exploration of unknown underwater structures for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed algorithm iteratively incorporates exteroceptive sensor data and replans the next-best-view in order to fully map an underwater structure. This approach does not require prior environment information. However, a safe exploration depth and the exploration area (defined by a bounding box, parameterized by its size, location, and resolution) must be provided by the user. The algorithm operates online by iteratively conducting the following three tasks: 1) Profiling sonar data are first incorporated into a 2-D grid map, where voxels are labeled according to their state (a voxel can be labeled as empty, unseen, occluded, occplane, occupied, or viewed). 2) Useful viewpoints to continue exploration are generated according to the map. 3) A safe path is generated to guide the robot toward the next viewpoint location. Two sensors are used in this approach: a scanning profiling sonar, which is used to build an occupancy map of the surroundings, and an optical camera, which acquires optical data of the scene. Finally, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we provide real-world results using the Sparus II AUV.

AB This paper describes and analyzes the processes carried out to obtain the model identification and the controller design, as well as its posterior implementation, for the quadrotor Parrot AR-Drone. The results are intended to control the autonomous tracking of that quadrotor on a path in the XY plane, flexible defined by the user. The identification phase is characterized by the division of the model into a linear and a non-linear part, resulting in a Hammerstein's model. The control is characterized by the use of a cascade control with an inner speed control loop and an outer position control loop. As characteristic features, it is highlighted that: the speed controller includes a static linearization of the model, and the position loop includes a nonlinear block to reduce the tracking error of the trajectory but using a simple position controller logic. The context of this study is the Control Engineering Competition 2012, "Autonomous trajectory tracking control of a quadrotor vehicle "organized by the Spanish Committee for Automation, which took place at the Automation Symposium in Vigo, last September 2012. The work presented was awarded in the first and second phase of the competition with the first and third prize, respectively.

AB Developed at National Chiao Tung University, TAIWAN iTS-1 is the first smart car with active safety systems and comfortable autonomous driving in Taiwan. An adaptive vision-based lane detection algorithm was proposed to help the lateral control unit to keep the car in its lane safely. It also carries a DSP system to generate warning, signals for unintentional roadway departures. A laser radar measures the distance between the preceding car and TAIWAN iTS-1. With this information, the longitudinal control unit performs intelligent cruise control and stop-and-go functions. The remote control function is realized on TAIWAN iTS-1 for safety testing and military applications. Unlike most smart car studies, this paper considers not only driving safety demands but also non-driving security. An active mobile surveillance system will inform the car owner when the car is illegally broken into, anytime and anywhere. For drivers and passengers, the perception of comfort is achieved by intelligent vehicle dynamic control. All functions integrated into TAIWAN iTS-1 have been tested repeatedly on National Highway 3 and Expressway 68 in the Hsinchu area and the system's robustness has been successfully demonstrated in these real-road experiments.

AB Low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) technology is classically used in the field of radio frequencies to make items such as miniature transceivers for handheld devices. Here we harness the LTCC technology to autonomous micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs), a field in which small size and low mass are at a premium. Designing autonomous MAVs will be a highly challenging issue during the next few decades. Bio-inspired optic flow sensors, also known as elementary motion detector (EMD) circuits, have proved to be efficient means of providing animals and robots with visual guidance ability. The LTCC technology gives a good trade-off between the need for reliable optic flow sensors and the need for small-sized multiple electronic components. Comparisons with other technologies (PCB, analogue VLSI) show that LTCC technology is one of the most reliable solutions to the problem of obtaining reliable electronic EMDs that are small enough (area 7 mm x 7 mm) and light enough (mass 0.2 g) to be accommodated on-board a MAV. The output from our LTCC based optic flow sensors is largely invariant with respect to both contrast and spatial frequency. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New technological possibilities associated with autonomous driving (AD) cars are generating new questions and imaginaries about automated futures. In this article we advance a theoretical-methodological approach towards researching this context based in design anthropological theory and sensory ethnographic practice. In doing so we explain and discuss the findings of an in-car video ethnography study designed to investigate the usually unspoken and not necessarily visible elements of car-based mobility. Such an approach is needed, we argue, both in order to inform a research agenda that is capable of addressing the emergence of automated vehicles specifically, as well as in preparation for understanding the implications of automation more generally as human mobility is increasingly entangled with automated technologies and the future imaginaries associated with them.

AB When employing autonomous helicopters, it is desirable to use navigation approaches, which firmly ensure safety. In this paper, we propose and compare two approaches to navigation through environments containing obstacles. The first uses sliding mode boundary following to maintain a prespecified distance to obstacles, and the second uses a model predictive control approach to plan short horizon trajectories around detected objects, while ensuring that the helicopter is brought to a halt within the sensor visibility radius. The navigation approaches are subjected to analysis for robustness, and simulations are carried out with a realistic helicopter model for verification. Additional real-world experiments were performed with a wheeled robot to demonstrate potential for real-time application.

AB The challenge of solving the collision avoidance path planning problem lies in adaptively selecting the optimal agent velocity in complex scenarios full of reciprocal obstacles. To achieve autonomous collision avoidance for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), a distributed multi-USVs navigation method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed, which combines the concept of reciprocal velocity obstacle (RVO) with a DRL scheme to solve the collision avoidance path planning problem with limited information. The collision avoidance behavior in USV navigation is based on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, and to obtain an improved proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, the RVO algorithm is used to improve the action space and reward function of the PPO algorithm. Gate Recurrent Unit-based neural network is used to map the states of different number of surrounding obstacles directly into actions. The effectiveness of the method in various situations was verified through simulation experiments. It is also shown that the algorithm can accurately determine collision situations, give reasonable collision avoidance behaviors, and achieve effective collision avoidance in complex environments with dynamic and static obstacles. The research can provide a theoretical basis and methodological reference for USV autonomous navigation.

AB To deal with the influence of abnormal underwater acoustic ranging errors in cooperative localization of autonomous underwater vehicles, a novel measurement information anomaly detection method based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The method can accurately identify and isolate acoustic distance information with errors exceeding the threshold range even when multiple distance information is alternately used as the measurement data for the filtering algorithm. The adaptive cubature Kalman filter is used to extract the characteristic information, which can better reflect the change of measurement information. According to the preset state threshold, the flag bit obeying Bernoulli distribution is obtained, and the hybrid database is established. This method combines the online data training mechanism with the ANFIS-based detection system to update the ANFIS rules online, which can effectively improve the reliability and accuracy of anomaly detection method, especially when the sample data are insufficient. Experimental results based on data obtained from the actual lake-water trial show that the method can accurately identify the abnormal acoustic distance information and retain the accurate distance information to ensure the stable operation of cooperative localization system.

AB Currently, accelerated research on automation is involved in most fields associated with vehicle manufacturing. In the area of autonomous operation of marine vehicles, automatic berthing remains a problem due to the nonlinearity of the low-speed maneuvering model, poor control of the vessel at low speed, and collision with berth danger. A previous study on off-line automatic berthing reveals frequent switching of the propeller revolution direction, which is impractical and must be prevented in case of a diesel engine. In this study, to overcome this problem, a new variable for the time to switch the propeller revolution direction is introduced and optimized. Also, we establish a more robust off-line control method for optimizing the required time and the final ship attitude by enhancing the objective function. Since the method provided here is still an off-line control method, its applicability to on-line control must consider the external force uncertainty and modeling error. The set of the optimal control input and trajectory obtained in this study, however, are applicable as an initial candidate for on-line predictive control modeling. Furthermore, the trajectory can serve as the desired path in a path-tracking problem.

AB For an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), navigation is a key functionality. Dead-reckoning (DR) navigation is an important class among all the AUV navigation methods. In DR, the measurement errors of inertial sensors (such as gyroscopes and accelerometers) lead to accumulated errors with time, which affect navigation accuracy significantly. Especially, accumulated errors in fast-changing environments, such as waves near or on the surface, are tough to handle. In this article, we propose a neural-network-based AUV navigation method for fast-changing environments, called NN-DR. NN-DR employs the neural network to predict pitch angles accurately, which is our core contribution. In NN-DR, we smoothly integrate the Kalman filter, neural network, and velocity compensation to reduce accumulated errors. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to test the correctness and stability of NN-DR, and the results show that NN-DR is very effective in lowering accumulated errors. For instance, at time 300 s, NN-DR achieves superior performance on accuracy for navigation, about 160 times than the state-of-the-art DR methods, demonstrating great advantage on AUV navigation for fast-changing environments.

AB A full-scale adaptive ocean sampling network was deployed throughout the month-long 2006 Adaptive Sampling and Prediction (ASAP) field experiment in Monterey Bay, California. One of the central goals of the field experiment was to test and demonstrate newly developed techniques for coordinated motion control of autonomous vehicles carrying environmental sensors to efficiently sample the ocean. We describe the field results for the heterogeneous fleet of autonomous underwater gliders that collected data continuously throughout the month-long experiment. Six of these gliders were coordinated autonomously for 24 days straight using feedback laws that scale with the number of vehicles. These feedback laws were systematically computed using recently developed methodology to produce desired collective motion patterns, tuned to the spatial and temporal scales in the sampled fields for the purpose of reducing statistical uncertainty in field estimates. The implementation was designed to allow for adaptation of coordinated sampling patterns using human-in-the-loop decision making, guided by optimization and prediction tools. The results demonstrate an innovative tool for ocean sampling and provide a proof of concept for an important field robotics endeavor that integrates coordinated motion control with adaptive sampling.

AB The preferences of travelers determines the utility of daily activity plans. Decision-makers can affect the preference of travelers when they force private car users to use park-and-ride (P&R) facilities as a way of decreasing traffic in city centers. The P&R system has been shown to be effective in reducing uninterrupted increases in traffic congestion, especially in city centers. Therefore, the impacts of P&R on travel behavior and the daily activity plans of both worker and shopper travelers were studied in this paper. Moreover, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are a promising technology for the coming decade. A simulation of the AV as part of a multimodal system, when the P&R system was integrated in the daily activity plans, was carried out to determine the required AV fleet size needed to fulfill a certain demand and to study the impacts of AVs on the behavior of travelers (trip time and distance). Specifically, a group of travelers, who use private cars as their transport mode, was studied, and certain modifications to their daily activity plans, including P&R facilities and changing their transport mode, were introduced. Using the MATSim open-source tool, four scenarios were simulated based on the mentioned modifications. The four scenarios included (1) a simulation of the existing transport modes of the travelers, (2) a simulation of their daily activity plans when their transport modes were changed to AVs, (3) a simulation of the travelers, when P&R facilities were included in their activity chain plans, and (4) a simulation of their daily activity plans, when both P&R and AVs were included in their activity chain plans. The result showed that using the P&R system increased overall travel time, compared with using a private car. The results also demonstrated that using AVs as a replacement for conventional cars reduced travel time. In conclusion, the impact of P&R and AVs on the travel behavior of certain travelers was evaluated in this paper.

ID TRAVEL; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN
AB The advent of the autonomous vehicle (AV) will affect not only the transportation system, but also future patterns of land development. Integrated land use and transportation models will be critical tools in assessing the path forward with this technology. Key questions with respect to land use impacts of AVs arise from potential changes in sensitivity to travel and reduced demand for parking. It is an open question whether AVs will induce urban sprawl, or whether spatial economies of agglomeration will mitigate any reductions in travel time sensitivity. The deployment of shared fleets of AVs would likely reduce parking demand, producing yet to be explored impacts on property development within existing urban footprints. We perform a critical assessment of currently operational models and their ability to represent the adoption of AVs. We identify the representation of time in such models as a vital component requiring additional development to model this new technology. Existing model applications have focused on the discrete addition of new infrastructure or policy at a fixed point in time, whereas AV adoption will occur incrementally through time. Stated adaptation surveys are recommended as tools to quantify preferences and develop relevant model inputs. It is argued that existing models that assume comparatively static equilibrium have been convenient in the past, but are insufficient to model technology adoption. In contrast, dynamic model frameworks lack sufficient structure to maintain reasonability under large perturbations from base conditions. The ongoing advancement of computing has allowed models to move away from being mechanistic aggregate tools, towards behaviourally rich depictions of individual persons and firms. However, much work remains to move from projections of existing conditions into the future, to the evolution of the spatial economy as it evolves through time in response to new technologies and exogenous stresses. Principles from complex and evolutionary systems theory will be important in the development of models with the capacity to consider such dynamics.

For maximizing the computation efficiency, the resource allocation problem is formulated as the mixed-integer programming problems. Then, we develop a cooperative deep deterministic policy gradient (CODDPG) algorithm to solve the problem via an observable Markov game. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms centralized reinforcement learning in terms of the computation efficiency.

AB Inspired by the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism in natural language processing, this letter proposes an iterative single-head attention (ISHA) mechanism for multi-UAV path planning. The ISHA mechanism is run by a communication helper collecting the state embeddings of UAVs and distributing an attention score vector to each UAV. The attention scores computed by ISHA identify how many interactions with other UAVs should be considered in each UAV's control decision-making. Simulation results corroborate that the ISHA-based communication and control framework achieves faster travel with lower inter-UAV collision risks than an MHA-aided baseline, particularly under limited communication resources.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB The work is proposed to design a controller of the form known as the roundabout scenario trajectory tracking problem. The road condition is a four-leg, single-lane roundabout; the reference path is given. Due to the decision choice of exits, the MPC tracking controller is used to test the effect of weight parameter and target speed on the performance of the tracking controller. Two sets of test cases are proposed to make the experimental comparison, see the relationship between the control parameters and road conditions (different curvature path), and also see how the weight parameters Q and R and sample time affect the tracking performance. Our work, MPC controller utilization in a roundabout, plays an essential role with the increasing autonomy of vehicles.

AB Today, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have deeply modified the concepts of surveillance, Search&Rescue, aerial photogrammetry, mapping, etc. The kinds of missions grow continuously; missions are in most cases performed by a fleet of cooperating autonomous and heterogeneous vehicles. These systems are really complex and it becomes fundamental to simulate any mission stage to exploit benefits of simulations like repeatability, modularity and low cost. In this paper a framework for simulation and testing of UAVs in cooperative scenarios is presented. The framework, based on modularity and stratification in different specialized layers, allows an easy switching from simulated to real environments, thus reducing testing and debugging times, especially in a training context. Results obtained using the proposed framework on some test cases are also reported.

AB Intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) are believed to change people's life in the near future by making the transportation safer, cleaner and more comfortable. Although many prototypes of ICVs have been developed to prove the concept of autonomous driving and the feasibility of improving traffic efficiency, there still exists a significant gap before achieving mass production of high-level ICVs. The objective of this study is to present an overview of both the state of the art and future perspectives of key technologies that are needed for future ICVs. It is a challenging task to review all related works and predict their future perspectives, especially for such a complex and interdisciplinary area of research. This article is organized to overview the ICV key technologies by answering three questions: what are the milestones in the history of ICVs; what are the electronic components needed for building an ICV platform; and what are the essential algorithms to enable intelligent driving? To answer the first question, the article has reviewed the history and the development milestones of ICVs. For the second question, the recent technology advances in electrical/electronic architecture, sensors, and actuators are presented. For the third question, the article focuses on the algorithms in decision making, as the perception and control algorithm are covered in the development of sensors and actuators. To achieve correct decision-making, there exist two different approaches: the principle-based approach and data-driven approach. The advantages and limitations of both approaches are explained and analyzed. Currently automotive engineers are concerned more with the vehicle platform technology, whereas the academic researchers prefer to focus on theoretical algorithms. However, only by incorporating elements from both worlds can we accelerate the production of high-level ICVs.

AB To characterize the transitional region from the near-field to far-field of a river plume entering coastal waters, we conducted four surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to target the outflow of the New River Inlet, North Carolina, during maximum ebb tide. The utilization of a mobile sensor to synoptically observe current velocity data in tandem with natural river plume tracers (e.g., colored dissolved organic matter, salinity) was essential in understanding the mechanisms driving the observed circulation and mixing patterns within these waters. We find that this region is regularly impacted by two primary processes: (1) the interaction of an old dredged channel plume with the main discharge and (2) the recirculation of the discharge plume by an eddy that persistently forms between the old channel and main discharge location. Wind-driven processes in the nearshore can enhance the interaction of these two plumes resulting in unstable regions where mixing of the merged plume with the receiving waters is accelerated. We also conduct comparisons between AUV velocity observations from two surveys and their corresponding velocity outputs from a parallelized quasi-3-D model. We conclude that the ability to observe the estuarine outflow transitional region at near-synoptic temporal scales and resolutions discussed in this paper is key in providing the mechanisms driving local circulation which is essential for proper parameterization of high-resolution numerical coastal models.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have broad applications owing to their ability to undertake long voyages, strong concealment, high level of intelligence and ability to replace humans in dangerous operations. AUV motion control systems can ensure stable operation in the complex ocean environment and have attracted significant research attention. In this paper, we propose a single-input fractional-order fuzzy logic controller (SIFOFLC) as an AUV motion control system. First, a single-input fuzzy logic controller (SIFLC) was proposed based on the signed distance method, whose control input is the linear combination of the error signal and its derivative. The SIFLC offers a significant reduction in the controller design and calculation process. Then, a SIFOFLC was obtained with the derivative of the error signal extending to a fractional order and offering greater flexibility and adaptability. Finally, to verify the superiority of the proposed control algorithm, comparative numerical simulations in terms of spiral dive motion control were conducted. Meanwhile, the parameters of different controllers were optimized according to the hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm. The simulation results illustrate the superior stability and transient performance of the proposed control algorithm.

AB Object detection is a critical problem for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved large successes on object detection, with performance improvement over traditional approaches, which use hand-engineered features. However, due to the challenging driving environment (e.g., large object scale variation, object occlusion, and bad light conditions), popular CNN detectors do not achieve very good object detection accuracy over the KITTI autonomous driving benchmark dataset. In this paper, we propose three enhancements for CNN-based visual object detection for ADAS. To address the large object scale variation challenge, deconvolution and fusion of CNN feature maps are proposed to add context and deeper features for better object detection at low feature map scales. In addition, soft non-maximal suppression (NMS) is applied across object proposals at different feature scales to address the object occlusion challenge. As the cars and pedestrians have distinct aspect ratio features, we measure their aspect ratio statistics and exploit them to set anchor boxes properly for better object matching and localization.

AB Performance evaluation is a necessary stage in development of tracking control strategy of autonomous vehicle system, which determines the scope of application and promotes further improvement. At present, most of the tracking control strategies include performance evaluation. However, performance evaluation criteria differ from work to work, lacking comprehensive evaluation system. This article proposes a multidimensional integrated tracking control evaluation system based on subjective and objective weighting, taking into account the tracking accuracy, driving stability, and ride comfort. Through the co-simulation of CarSim and Simulink, qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis based on multidimensional evaluation system of five coupled longitudinal and lateral control strategies (lateral: pure pursuit feedforward control, dynamic-model-based optimal curvature control (dynamic feedforward control), Stanley feedback control, kinematics feedback control, and dynamic feedback control; longitudinal: the incremental proportion-integration-differentiation control) under typical operating conditions are carried out to analyze the operating range and robustness of each tracking control strategy. The results show that the Stanley tracking control strategy and the dynamic feedback tracking control strategy have a wide range of applications and robustness. The consistency of qualitative analysis results and the quantitative analysis results verify the validity and feasibility of the evaluation system.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION; SAFETY
AB Cyber physical systems (CPSs) are characterized by behaviors emergent from the interactions of software systems with physical systems. Many complex CPSs utilize "independent monitoring" of the system behavior for any undesirable effects so that appropriate mitigation actions can potentially be taken. Typical independent monitoring systems for CPSs focus only on the violation of specified constraints that are detected "after-the-fact," and any preemptive attempts to prevent the violation are handled by the core software systems. In this paper, we propose an independent health monitoring mechanism as a human-recognizable measure of trustworthiness of the system. Specifically, this mechanism not only detects actual violations of constraints but also calculates the possibility to violate the constraints. The proposed health monitor has two components: 1) health measurement functions that are specific and tailored to each component of a CPS and 2) a probabilistic health-state determination that is generic and directly derived from Bayesian estimation methods. The implementation and performance of the proposed monitoring mechanism were demonstrated with an autonomous vehicle self-navigating to a free parking space in MATLAB/Simulink simulations, which showed that the mechanism was able to promptly and accurately estimate the health state of the monitored system and help prevent accidents/catastrophes.

   terrain matching; autonomous underwater vehicle; multipath parallel ICCP
ID AIDED NAVIGATION; LOCALIZATION; ACCURACY
AB Using the underwater terrain for assisted navigation is a popular research direction for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation technology. The iterated closest contour point (ICCP) algorithm is one of the classic matching algorithms in underwater terrain assisted navigation. However, the traditional ICCP algorithm is not suitable for the case of large initial error of inertial navigation system (INS) because it easily leads to a total match failure. This failure brings a great challenge to an underwater terrain matching system. In this paper, the improved ICCP underwater terrain matching algorithm, a multipath parallel ICCP algorithm, is proposed. The improved algorithm is based on multibeam bathymetric data acquired by the multibeam echosounder that is one of the main instruments of water depth measurement. The data points at the center and both sides of the edge of the swath sounding data are chosen to comprise three paths that are fully utilized by the improved algorithm. Computer simulation is used to evaluate the proposed algorithm in two terrain differences areas. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of multipath parallel ICCP algorithm. The proposed algorithm can effectively solve the problem of matching divergence caused by large initial errors of INS and obtain higher location accuracy.

AB We obtain, solve, and verify fundamental differential equations for energy-time path planning in dynamic flows. The equations govern the energy-time reachable sets, optimal paths, and optimal controls for autonomous vehicles navigating to any destination in known dynamic environments, minimizing both energy usage and travel time. Based on Hamilton-Jacobi theory for reachability and the level set method, the resulting methodology computes the Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective path planning problem, numerically solving the exact equations governing the evolution of reachability fronts and optimal paths in the augmented energy and physical-space domain. Our approach is applicable to path planning in various dynamic flow environments and energy types. We first validate the methodology through a benchmark case of crossing a steady jet for which we compare our results to semi-analytical optimal energy-time solutions. We then consider unsteady flow environments and solve for energy-time optimal missions in a quasi-geostrophic double-gyre flow field. Results show that our theory and schemes can provide all the energy-time optimal solutions and that these solutions can be strongly influenced by unsteady flow conditions. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rogue Base Stations (RBS), also known as 5G Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) catchers, were initially developed to maliciously intercept subscribers' identities. Since then, further advances have been made, not only in RBSs, but also in communication network security. The identification and prevention of RBSs in Fifth Generation (5G) networks are among the main security challenges for users and network infrastructure. The security architecture group in 3GPP clarified that the radio configuration information received from user equipment could contain fingerprints of the RBS. This information is periodically included in the measurement report generated by the user equipment to report location information and Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements for the strongest base stations. The motivation in this work, then is to generate 5G measurement reports to provide a large and realistic dataset of radio information and RSS measurements for an autonomous vehicle driving along various sections of a road. These simulated measurement reports can then be used to develop and test new methods for identifying an RBS and taking mitigating actions. The proposed approach can generate 20 min of synthetic drive test data in 15 s, which is 80 times faster than real time.

ID HYDRODYNAMIC COEFFICIENTS; PREDICTION
AB This paper presents a numerical procedure to calculate the stability derivatives of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In addition, the effects of Strouhal number on the stability derivatives are investigated. The stability derivatives are obtained by finding the body hydrodynamic responses to some specified time variant motions. Here, three distinct oscillating maneuvers: surge, pure-heave, and pure-pitch are proposed based on the linearized equations of motion. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with dynamic mesh technique is used to simulate the specified maneuvers. To verify the numerical scheme, computational results for simulation of the flow field are then validated by comparison with experimental data. In addition, a comparison between quasi-steady (Theodorsen's theory) and RANS approaches is taken into account, which shows that the quasisteady methods do not guarantee the solution accuracy for the purpose of stability derivative calculation. Finally, the effects of Strouhal number variations on these coefficients are investigated which shows that the dimensionless damping coefficients (except longitudinal damping coefficient) are evidently dependent on the Strouhal number, specially at high frequencies. However, the Strouhal number variation effects on the added-mass coefficients are small.

AB Autonomous navigation technology is a core technology for intelligent operation, allowing the vehicles to perform tasks without relying on external information, which effectively improves the concealability and reliability. In this paper, based on the previous research on the bionic compound eye, a multi-channel camera array with different polarization degrees was used to construct the atmospheric polarization state measurement platform. A polarization trough threshold segmentation algorithm was applied to study the distribution characteristics and characterization methods of polarization states in atmospheric remote sensing images. In the extracted polarization feature map, the tilting suggestion box was obtained based on the multi-direction window extraction network (similarity-based region proposal networks, SRPN) and the rotation of the suggestion box (Rotation Region of interests, RRoIs). Fast Region Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) was used to screen the suggestion boxes, and the Non-maximum suppression (NMS) method was used to select the angle, corresponding to the label of the suggestion box with the highest score, as the solar meridian azimuth in the vehicle coordinate system. The azimuth angle of the solar meridian in the atmospheric coordinate system can be calculated by the astronomical formula. Finally, the final heading angle can be obtained according to the conversion relationship between the coordinate systems. By fitting the measured data based on the least Square method, the slope K value is -1.062, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is 6.984, and the determination coefficient R-Square is 0.9968. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and this study can construct an autonomous navigation algorithm with high concealment and precision, providing a new research idea for the research of autonomous navigation technology.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
AB GPS-denied closed-loop autonomous control of unstable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) such as rotorcraft using information from a monocular camera has been an open problem. Most proposed Vision aided Inertial Navigation Systems (V-INSs) have been too computationally intensive or do not have sufficient integrity for closed-loop flight. We provide an affirmative answer to the question of whether V-INSs can be used to sustain prolonged real-world GPS-denied flight by presenting a V-INS that is validated through autonomous flight-tests over prolonged closed-loop dynamic operation in both indoor and outdoor GPS-denied environments with two rotorcraft unmanned aircraft systems (UASs). The architecture efficiently combines visual feature information from a monocular camera with measurements from inertial sensors. Inertial measurements are used to predict frame-to-frame transition of online selected feature locations, and the difference between predicted and observed feature locations is used to bind in real-time the inertial measurement unit drift, estimate its bias, and account for initial misalignment errors. A novel algorithm to manage a library of features online is presented that can add or remove features based on a measure of relative confidence in each feature location. The resulting V-INS is sufficiently efficient and reliable to enable real-time implementation on resource-constrained aerial vehicles. The presented algorithms are validated on multiple platforms in real-world conditions: through a 16-min flight test, including an autonomous landing, of a 66 kg rotorcraft UAV operating in an unconctrolled outdoor environment without using GPS and through a Micro-UAV operating in a cluttered, unmapped, and gusty indoor environment.

AB In this work, a new tracking control scheme is developed for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle(UAUV) with unknown disturbance. First, an error tracking system is constructed using backstepping method, which transforms the tracking control problem into the two-player zero-sum game problem. One player is the optimal controller which is designed to make the UAUV track the desired trajectory. The other player is the unknown disturbance that represent the overall damping effect of the UAUV. Then, the single critic network based online policy iteration algorithm is designed to get the optimal control law and the worst-case disturbance, which can achieve the near-optimal control performance and relax the requirements for initial admissible control conditions. In order to improve the converge velocity of tracking error, the weight update law are designed. Furthermore, a discount coefficient is introduced into the performance index due to the nonlinearity and the complexity of UAUV. In addition, the stability of the UAUV is analyzed based on the Lyapunov stability theory the system is guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the real-time simulations on the UAUV model.

TI 3-D path planning system for autonomous vehicle considering the rollover

SO JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

DT Article
ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; CONTROLLER
AB In the 3-D path planning, the undulation of terrain have a significant impact on the roll angle of autonomous vehicle (AV). However, the existing 3-D path planning methods rarely consider the roll angle, which may lead to the rollover of AV. To solve this problem, a 3-D path planning system considering the rollover and path length (3DPPS-CRPL) is presented in this work. The 3DPPS-CRPL can plan a shorter path on the basis of inhibiting the roll angle of AV. In order to inhibit the roll angle, a novel roll angle evaluation model based on the undulation of terrain is developed, and the amount of computation is also greatly reduced because complex dynamics is avoided. In order to optimize the path length, both 2-D and 3-D path length are evaluated synthetically by a path length evaluation model. In order to optimize the parameters of 3DPPS-CRPL, a fuzzy-based optimizer is proposed to determine the weight of roll angle and path length. The simulation results prove that 3DPPS-CRPL has excellent performance for inhibiting roll angle and optimizing the path length in 3-D environment. (c) 2022 The Franklin Institute.

AB There are numerous global navigation satellite system-denied regions in urban areas, where the localization of autonomous driving remains a challenge. To address this problem, a high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor was recently developed. Various methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy of localization using precise distance measurements derived from LiDAR sensors. This study proposes an algorithm to accelerate the computational speed of LiDAR localization while maintaining the original accuracy of lightweight map-matching algorithms. To this end, first, a point cloud map was transformed into a normal distribution (ND) map. During this process, vector-based normal distribution transform, suitable for graphics processing unit (GPU) parallel processing, was used. In this study, we introduce an algorithm that enabled GPU parallel processing of an existing ND map-matching process. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified using an open dataset and simulations. To verify the practical performance of the proposed algorithm, the real-time serial and parallel processing performances of the localization were compared using high-performance and embedded computers, respectively. The distance root-mean-square error and computational time of the proposed algorithm were compared. The algorithm increased the computational speed of the embedded computer almost 100-fold while maintaining high localization precision.

AB This paper proposes a new robust Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Control (DT-SMC) scheme for linear discrete-time delay system. The delays, affecting the state and the input, are assumed to be known, time-varying and bounded. The considered system is also subject to time-varying Unknown But norm-Bounded (UBB) unmatched uncertainties, that act on the state and the delayed state vectors. The designed controller is based on a novel sliding surface. Using a new Lyapunov functional candidate and by introducing slack variables, a less conservative delay-dependent sufficient condition ensuring the asymptotic stability of the closed loop system is derived in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). With respect to that condition a new DT-SMC law is synthesized. The proposed control algorithm is applied to an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. (C) 2021 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In order to measure and reconstruct accurate three-dimension (3D) data for visual aided navigation of autonomous land vehicles (ALVs), a multimedia stereo calibration algorithm which is suitable for normal scene and especially for low illumination scene is proposed. Firstly, an expression of object-point re-projection errors is derived by the collinear equation model, and the non-linear least square algorithm (NLS) is introduced to iteratively optimize external parameters for individual camera. A rectangular pyramidal method enforcing the rectangular geometric constraint is presented, to produce more stable initial parameter values. Then, according to imaging-point correspondences between the left and right camera, a re-projection error model is constructed for this stereo calibration system, of which all parameters are further optimized and calculated through the calibrated results of two separate cameras. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve re-projection errors of no more than 0.5 pixels and converge fast usually with less than 10 interation times, whether under normal illumination or low illumination, so it can get better performance and realize a rapid re-calibration.

AB Recent years have witnessed growing attention to the mobile data gathering schemes using autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). In this paper, a novel cluster-based mobile data gathering (CMDG) scheme for large-scale UWSNs is presented to make a tradeoff between the data gathering latency and energy saving. To cluster the acoustic sensors and cover their heads with the shortest possible tour, we first formulate it into an optimization problem and then propose two efficient algorithms to obtain the near-optimal solutions in the less computational time. We also discuss the impact of topology change on the CMDG performance. To the best of our knowledge, CMDG is the first AUV tour planning scheme which is able to deal with the sensors mobility in UWSNs. CMDG is scalable and also applicable in both connected and disconnected networks. In terms of energy-latency tradeoff, CMDG can effectively keep the tour length short while prolonging the network lifetime compared to those of the existing mobile data gathering schemes. The effectiveness of CMDG is validated through an extensive simulation study which reveals the performance improvement in the energy saving, data gathering latency, and packet delivery ratio.

Overcoming the energy constraints is necessary to ensure the long-term functionality and sustainability of UWSN, enabling continuous data collection and communication for various applications such as environmental monitoring and surveillance. To solve the problems of limited energy and the difficulty of battery replacement in UWSN, a path planning and energy-saving scheme for charging underwater sensor nodes using AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) is proposed. Applying multiple AUVs to charge the sensing network nodes will maximize the size of the underwater sensing network as well as meet the transmission reliability, and the optimal path of AUVs is solved by using a genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the AUV path planning scheme convergence is faster than that of conventional algorithms, and the lifetime of UWSN is prolonged while energy balancing according to the network size and node density. In high-density networks, the average energy consumption generated by AUVs for exploration is reduced by 15 percent for each additional AUV with our path planning.

AB Autonomous vehicles are required to operate in an uncertain environment. Recent advances in computational intelligence techniques make it possible to understand driving scenes in various environments by using a semantic segmentation neural network, which assigns a class label to each pixel. It requires massive pixel-level labelled data to optimise the network. However, it is challenging to collect sufficient data and labels in the real world. An alternative solution is to obtain synthetic dense pixel-level labelled data from a driving simulator. Although the use of synthetic data is a promising way to alleviate the labelling problem, models trained with virtual data cannot generalise well to realistic data due to the domain shift. To fill this gap, the authors propose a novel uncertainty-aware generative ensemble method. In particular, ensembles are obtained from different optimisation objectives, training iterations, and network initialisation so that they are complementary to each other to produce reliable predictions. Moreover, an uncertainty-aware ensemble scheme is developed to derive fused prediction by considering the uncertainty from ensembles. Such a design can make better use of the strengths of ensembles to enhance adapted segmentation performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three large-scale datasets.

AB Localization of autonomous underwater vehicles is essential for underwater exploration, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure inspections, as only a few examples. As wirelessly transmitted data cannot be used in underwater navigation, and equivalent sensors are costly and not readily deployable, the use of cameras as a localization aid offers an attractive alternative. Nonetheless, the utilization of cameras for underwater navigation is hindered by medium-induced visual deterioration and refraction of the incident ray. While most research has been focusing on addressing the radiometric deterioration effects, we demonstrate that the introduction of a physically aware model of the refraction effect can significantly improve the platform localization. Specifically, we develop a refraction-aware continuous formulation of the egomotion model, which computes the translational and rotational velocities using optical flow measurements. We also demonstrate that a linear model can be reached despite the nonlinear ray's path. Results show an improved navigation solution echoed by a significant reduction in the drift with more than tenfold improvement in the estimated position and angular quantities compared to state-of-the-art methods. They demonstrate the benefit of exact modeling in underwater navigation.

DE autonomous underwater vehicle; S-plane control; high speed; situational

AB The classic S-plane control method combines PD structure with fuzzy control theory, with the advantages of a simple control structure and fewer parameters to be adjusted. It has been proved as a practical method in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) motion control at low and medium speeds, but it takes no account of the situational static load and varying hydrodynamic forces which influence the control quality and even result in a "dolphin effect" at the time of high-speed movement. For this reason, an improved S-plane controller is designed based on the sliding mode variable structure, sliding mode surface, and control items in order to respond to the situational static load and high-speed movement. The improved S-plane controller is verified by Lyapunov stability analysis. The thrust allocation strategies are also discussed with constraints introduced in accordance with task requirements. In order to verify the practicability and effectiveness of the improved S-plane controller, both simulation experiments and field trials of AUV motion control, long-range cruise, and path point following were carried out. The results have demonstrated the superiority of the improved S-plane controller over the classic S-plane controller.

AB Motion state monitoring and recognition are the important issues to be dealt to improve the reliability of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In this work, we transform the motion state classification into Multi-variate Time Series Classification (MTSC). By combining two kinds of MTSC methods, including the methods based on feature representation transformation and Deep Neural Network (DNN), we propose a new classifi-cation method for Multivariate Time Series (MTS). Multivariate monitoring data of AUV are fused to construct complex networks as graphs to represent the motion states. Then, Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) is used to extract the features of the graphs and classify the graphs. The effectiveness of our method is validated through sea experiments, whose data are from three classes of navigational motions: near the surface, at fixed depth, and influenced by unknown ocean currents at fixed depth. The experimental results show that the graphical representation based on complex networks can effectively describe the motion states. Compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM), the graphical features are extracted automatically by GCNN to get a higher accuracy of classification of the motion states. The experiments also show that the classification accuracy of our method is higher than that of other two DNNs.

AB Course estimation is a key component for the development of autonomous navigation systems for robots. While state-of-the-art methods widely use visual-based algorithms, it is worth noting that most fail to deal with the complexity of the real world. They often require obstacles to be highly textured to improve the overall performance, particularly when the obstacle is located within the focus of expansion (FOE) where the optic flow (OF) is almost null. This study proposes the FAst ITerative Half-plane (FAITH) method to determine the course of a micro air vehicle (MAV). This is achieved by means of an event-based camera, along with a fast RANSAC-based algorithm that uses event-based OF to determine the FOE. The performance is validated by means of a benchmark on a simulated environment and then tested on a dataset collected for indoor obstacle avoidance. Our results show that the computational efficiency outperforms state-of-the-art methods while keeping a high level of accuracy. This has been further demonstrated onboard an MAV equipped with an event-based camera, thus showing that the FAITH algorithm can be achieved online and is suitable for autonomous obstacle avoidance and navigation onboard MAVs.

AB In the scenario where autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) carry out tasks, it is necessary to reliably estimate underwater-moving-target positioning. While cameras often give low-precision visibility in a limited field of view, the forward-looking sonar is still an attractive method for underwater sensing, which is especially effective for long-range tracking. This paper describes an online processing framework based on forward-looking-sonar (FLS) images, and presents a novel tracking approach based on a Gaussian particle filter (GPF) to resolve persistent multiple-target tracking in cluttered environments. First, the character of acoustic-vision images is considered, and methods of median filtering and region-growing segmentation were modified to improve image-processing results. Second, a generalized regression neural network was adopted to evaluate multiple features of target regions, and a representation of feature subsets was created to improve tracking performance. Thus, an adaptive fusion strategy is introduced to integrate feature cues into the observation model, and the complete procedure of underwater target tracking based on GPF is displayed. Results obtained on a real acoustic-vision AUV platform during sea trials are shown and discussed. These showed that the proposed method is feasible and effective in tracking targets in complex underwater environments.

AB The goal of this study is investigated an implementation model, which is based on the real-time Unified Modeling Language (UML)/MARTE combined with the specification of hybrid automata and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm in order to intensively capture the development lifecycle of control and reuse it for controllers of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). To achieve this goal, the study is stepwise carried out as follows: the physical and dynamic model together with control architecture of AUVs are firstly adapted for developing entirely an AUV controller. The use-case model combined with the realization hypotheses of hybrid automata and the EKF algorithm are then specialized to closely gather the requirement analysis of control. The specializations of real-time UML/MARTE's features such as the 'capsules, ports and protocols' notation combined with the timing concurrency of evolution are next realized to precisely design structures and behaviors for the controller. The detailed design model is then converted into the implementation model by using object-oriented and opensource platforms in order to quickly simulate and realize this controller. Finally, a planar trajectory-tracking controller, which permits a miniature unmanned submarine to autonomously reaches and follows a planar reference trajectory, was deployed and tested with good reliability.

TI Autonomous plug and play electric vehicle charging scenarios including
   reactive power provision: a probabilistic load flow analysis
SO IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Electric vehicle (EV) charging can have various impacts on low-voltage distribution systems, along with increasing the uncertainty of network load levels. One method for capturing the statistical uncertainty is probabilistic load flow (PLF). A primary concern of such an approach is determining the correlation between the input variables. Since data are limited, a 1 min resolution bottom-up time-variant load model, capturing the changing voltage dependencies of the load, is used for modelling household electrical demand to provide pseudo-meter data for the three-phase PLF analysis of a residential distribution network. The correlation between the household and EV charging loads are implicitly taken into account by modelling the EV plug-in and departure times with the corresponding occupancy model. Two autonomous plug-and-play charging scenarios are compared with a standard charging arrangement at both unity and 0.95 capacitive power factors. Four different PLF input correlation scenarios, varying from fully correlated to fully independent, are considered. The proposed charging scenarios and reactive power provision reduce the likelihood of system voltage violations introduced by EVs. The PLF results are verified against those from the initial time-series analysis providing valuable insight into the uncertainty introduced by EVs and the correlation between household and EV loads.

AB Satellites have documented trends in Antarctic sea-ice extent and its variability for decades, but estimating sea-ice thickness in the Antarctic from remote sensing data remains challenging. In situ observations needed for validation of remote sensing data and sea-ice models are limited; most have been restricted to a few point measurements on selected ice floes, or to visual shipboard estimates. Here we present three-dimensional (3D) floe-scale maps of sea-ice draft for ten floes, compiled from two springtime expeditions by an autonomous underwater vehicle to the near-coastal regions of the Weddell, Bellingshausen, and Wilkes Land sectors of Antarctica. Mean drafts range from 1.4 to 5.5 m, with maxima up to 16 m. We also find that, on average, 76% of the ice volume is deformed ice. Our surveys indicate that the floes are much thicker and more deformed than reported by most drilling and ship-based measurements of Antarctic sea ice. We suggest that thick ice in the near-coastal and interior pack may be under-represented in existing in situ assessments of Antarctic sea ice and hence, on average, Antarctic sea ice may be thicker than previously thought.

AB In this article, we investigate the worker (i.e., vehicle) selection problem in vehicle-based crowdsourcing (VBC), where vehicles in a specific area are recruited by the crowdsourcing platform to collect geographical information in real driving scenarios for autonomous driving. Given a limited recruitment budget, we formulate a cumulative platform utility maximization problem (CMP) to obtain the optimal worker set. The CMP is unsolvable directly as the platform has no prior information of workers at the initial stage (also known as "cold start") and the cost of collecting all workers' information is prohibitive. To solve the problem, we first conduct a comprehensive data analytics on two real-world vehicle traces and obtain two crucial observations: 1) trajectory of individual vehicle is highly uncertain that it is difficult to make accurate prediction and 2) the overall distribution of vehicular trajectory penetration (measured by collection quantity and coverage) has a diurnal pattern and varies with weekly periodicity. Inspired by the insights, we propose the performance transfer-based online worker selection (POSE) scheme, which works independently from trajectory prediction with two components, i.e., transfer learning-based performance estimation and online worker selection (OWS). Based on the diurnal pattern, the former component collects a short-period trajectory penetration data of vehicles for model fitting, which can output a specific numerical distribution. With the fitting model, we can identify and select vehicles with high trajectory penetration at the initial stage to cope with the "cold start" problem. Then, we map the worker selection problem into a multiarmed bandit problem and develop upper confidence bound-based approach to solve it. Extensive trace-driven simulations are carried out and the results demonstrate the efficiency of POSE in terms of cumulative platform utility.

AB This paper presents the development of the "intelligent Robotic Wheelchair" (iRW), emphasizing its mobility assistance design. The vehicle uses four Mecanum wheels to facilitate movement in all directions, including sideways, and zero radius of rotation. The iRW requires much less space than ordinary electric wheelchairs in turning and sideways manoeuvres. Based on this moving vehicle, mobility assistance functions are designed for three different operators: the wheelchair user, caregivers, and the iRW itself in autonomous behaviours. Five operation modes, all mutually exclusive, are developed: obstacle avoidance, joystick mode, handlebar mode, teleoperation, and indoor navigation. Man-machine collaborative control is reflected in the assignment of priorities to the three operators. The functional test performed in this research compared the operational efficiency of the five operation modes.

   Mixed-flow traffic; Deep reinforcement learning
ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; STRING STABILITY
AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can be leveraged to enable cooperative platooning control to alleviate traffic oscillations. However, prior to a pure CAV environment, CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) will coexist on roads, creating a mixed-flow traffic environment. Mixed-flow traffic introduces key challenges for CAV operations due to potential lane changes by HDVs in adjacent lanes, which can cause stop-and-go waves and traffic oscillations. An understanding of the interactions between CAVs and HDVs in the lane-change process can be leveraged to use CAVs to proactively preclude disruptive lane changes by HDVs. This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based proactive longitudinal control strategy (PLCS) for CAVs to counteract disruptive HDV lane-change behaviors that can induce disturbances, and to preserve the smoothness of traffic flow in the CAV platooning control process. In it, a Transformer-based lane-change traffic condition predictor is constructed to predict whether an HDV will likely perform a disruptive lane change under the ambient traffic conditions. If no disruptive lane change is predicted, an extended intelligent driver model is activated for the CAV to perform smooth car-following behavior under cooperative CAV platooning control. If a disruptive lane change is predicted, a rainbow deep Q-network (RDQN)-based lane-change preclusion model is proposed through which the CAV can alter the lane-change traffic condition to preclude the HDV's lane change. Results from numerical experiments suggest that a CAV controlled by the PLCS is effective in reducing disruptive lane-change maneuvers by an HDV in its vicinity, and can improve string stability performance in mixed-flow traffic. Further, the effectiveness of the PLCS is illustrated under different lane-change scenarios, CAV control setups, and HDV driver types.

AB With the growth of autonomous vehicles and collision-avoidance systems, several approaches using deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continually address accuracy improvement in obstacle detection. The authors introduce a three-stage architecture that adds side channels as low-level features to serve as input to existing CNNs. In a case study, the architecture is used to extract depth from stereo cameras, and then compose RGBD inputs to state-of-the-art CNNs to improve their vehicle and pedestrian detection accuracy. This can be achieved by simple modifications on the first layers of any existing CNN with RGB inputs. To validate the architecture, the state-of-the-art matching cost-CNN, and cascade residual learning, both specialist algorithms to extract depth information combined to the state-of-the-art Faster-region-based CNN, MSCNCN, and Subcategory-aware Convolutional Neural Network (SubCNN) to yield the models to be tested using the KITTI dataset benchmark. In many cases, the accuracy (in terms of average precision) using their proposal outperforms the original scores in various scenarios of detection difficulty, reaching improvements up to +3.96% in the training and +1.50% in the testing KITTI datasets. This proposal also introduces efficient methods to initialise the weights of the depth convolutional filters during transfer learning using net surgery.

AB Near-coastal retention of larvae affects the ecology of many marine species. In coastal upwelling ecosystems having strong offshore transport, larval ecology is greatly influenced by nearshore retention in bays and in the lee of headlands. Further, frontal dynamics along the periphery of retention zones can drive larval accumulation and transport. The purpose of this study is to examine larval distributions and associated processes across a retention zone and its peripheral front in the coastal upwelling environment of Monterey Bay, California, USA. During fall 2009 an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was used to observe environmental variability at high resolution and acquire targeted water samples. Invertebrate larvae in samples were subsequently identified and quantified using molecular methods. To infer ecological processes we examine larval distributions in relation to environmental processes revealed by the AUV data and the greater regional observing system. As a window into biological-physical interactions that may concentrate motile larvae in convergence zones, we examine more extensive in situ and remote sensing observations that describe distribution patterns of motile phytoplankton. During the 10-day study intensification of upwelling caused flow of cold water into the bay and formation of an upwelling front. Drifter and satellite observations showed retention of near-surface water within the bay inshore of the front, where a bloom of motile phytoplankton intensified. Larval distributions were related to processes inferred at a range of scales. At the scale of the retention zone, dense phytoplankton accumulations indicated concentration of motile plankton in a convergence zone created by flow toward the coast, as well as nutritional support for larvae. At the scale of the front, velocity and water property measurements indicated convergence between cold deep-shelf water transported shoreward along shoaling bathymetry and the overlying warm surface water, influencing plankton accumulation and vertical transport. At the finest scales resolved, aerial photography revealed banded accumulations of dense phytoplankton bloom patches and narrow foam lines, common indicators of small-scale convergence zones and consistent with internal wave processes. Exceptionally high larval concentrations were detected in samples from locations affected by frontal and internal wave dynamics. This study illustrates how autonomous feature recognition and targeted sampling with an AUV, applied within the greater context of multidisciplinary observation across regional to small scales, can advance plankton ecology research.

AB Blooms of toxic algae are increasing in magnitude and frequency around the globe, causing extensive economic and environmental impacts. On the west coast of Florida, blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis (Davis) have been documented annually for the last 30 years causing respiratory irritation in humans, fish kills, and toxin bioaccumulation in shellfish beds. As a result, methods need to be established to monitor and predict bloom formation and transport to mitigate their harmful effects on the surrounding ecosystems and local communities. In the past, monitoring and mitigation efforts have relied on visual confirmation of water discoloration, fish kills, and laborious cell counts, but recently satellite remote sensing has been used to track harmful algal blooms (HABs) along the Florida coast. Unfortunately satellite ocean color is limited by cloud cover, lack of detection below one optical depth, and revisit frequency, all of which can lead to extended periods without data. To address these shortcomings, an optical phytoplankton discriminator (OPD) was developed to detect K. brevis cells in mixed phytoplankton assemblages. The OPD was integrated into autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) platforms to gather spatially and temporally relevant data that can be used in collaboration with satellite imagery to provide a 3D picture of bloom dynamics over time. In January 2005, a Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS (REMUS) AUV with an OPD payload was deployed on the west coast of Florida to retrieve a similarity index (SI), which indicates when K. brevis dominates the phytoplankton community. SI was used to monitor a K. brevis bloom in relation to temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and ocean currents. Current speed, SI, temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a from the AUV were used to quantify a 1 km displacement of the K. brevis bloom front that was observed over the deployment period. The ability to monitor short term bloom movement will improve monitoring and predictive efforts that are used to provide warnings for local tourism and fishing industries. In addition, understanding the fine scale environmental conditions associated with bloom formation will increase our ability to predict the location and timing of K. brevis bloom formation. This study demonstrates the use of one autonomous platform and provides evidence that a nested array of AUVs and moorings equipped with new sensors, combined with remote sensing, can provide an early warning and monitoring system to reduce the impact of HABs.

AB To investigate the manoeuvring performance of a body-caudal fin robot fish, a numerical framework combining computational fluid dynamics and multi-body dynamics with a closed-loop control algorithm was established in this study. Within this framework, we modelled a body-caudal fin swimmer as a multi-body system with the shape of a NACA0012 hydrofoil. The manoeuvring performance was investigated by using different curvature magnitudes and distributions along the centre line (the curvature is defined by means of a curvature envelop function as part of the general body undulation equation). To characterize the turning performance, a new parameter named cost of manoeuvring (CoM) is proposed. This parameter provides a combined assessment of the turning radius, linear and angular velocity components, and power. It is found that when the body curvature is introduced, the swimmer switches from straight-line swimming to quasi-steady turning at a constant speed. Further investigations were conducted to study contributions of head and tail deformations on the turning performance by comparing predominantly head and tail curved envelopes. Results reveal that a tail-dominated envelope improves performance, whereas a head-dominated envelope has a negative effect.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have attracted extensive attention worldwide for their huge potential to revolutionize urban cities. The diffusion of AVs in cities will largely depend on public acceptance of AVs. But many studies revealed that people hold a high level of concern about AVs. This study aims to enrich our understanding of public acceptance of AVs in China, both at the explicit level and at the implicit level. We also attempt to enhance people's positive attitudes toward AVs by Evaluative Conditioning (EC). Study 1 found that participants recognized the benefits of AVs, but were also concerned about them. Moreover, participants showed only moderate trust in AVs. In Study 2, it was observed that participants mainly showed positive implicit attitudes toward AVs and there was no significant correlation between implicit and explicit attitudes toward AVs. In Study 3, EC offered an alternative way to change implicit attitudes. Specifically, implicit attitudes toward AVs were positively increased through EC, whereas explicit attitudes did not change significantly. This research provides several theoretical and practical implications. The findings support the notion that explicit and implicit attitudes involve independent psychological processes, and that implicit attitude can be changed through EC.

AB This paper aims to present a systematic approach to evaluate the parameters affecting the vessel's performances in the target tracking motion control scenario and, for this reason, three guidance laws have been formalised. Such scenario consists of reaching and following a target of which it is only possible to know the instantaneous position and velocity, hence when the future motion is unknown. The standard Line-Of-Sight, Pure Pursuit, and Constant Bearing have been modified and deeply tested. The target tracking scenario has been divided into two parts: the target approach and following strategies. The increase in system complexity needs advanced tools to predict the vehicle response in both standard and non-standard conditions. Simulation can support the designer's effort for the transition from a traditional to an autonomous ship in the whole ship design; hence, all the guidance laws have been virtually tested and a sensitivity analysis is carried out to understand each parameter effect. Several manoeuvres have been performed and the results are shown to highlight benefits and drawbacks for each law. Eventually, key performance indicators are outlined and some suggestions are given to the proper settings of the guidance law parameters in the function of the specific mission.

AB Vision navigation technique, especially the vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM), plays a critical role in robotic navigation. As a relative positioning technique, V-SLAM often suffers from drift and scale uncertainty problems which incur bias increasing over time. To overcome these drawbacks and to improve the robustness and accuracy of localization, an effective way is to fuse global navigation satellite system (GNSS) with V-SLAM. In this paper, we propose a novel GNSS and SLAM fusion algorithm, which provides ego-motion estimation through tightly coupling GNSS pseudo-range measurements and camera feature points. It first decomposes the pose state into basic motion vectors, based on which an asynchronous tracking is performed. Then, a 10-DoF joint-optimization formulation on manifold is proposed to achieve tight fusion of the raw measurement from camera and GNSS. Finally, this formulation is solved to calculate the ego-motion state. The proposed algorithm is verified on an autonomous ground vehicle in two typical environments. The results demonstrated that, the new algorithm can amend the bias in vision SLAM and constrain the GNSS solution, which achieves a better localization result than the traditional methods.

AB Urban planning and management need accurate three-dimensional (3D) data such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The mobile laser scanning (MLS) data, with up to millimeter-level accuracy and point density of a few thousand points/m(2), have gained increasing attention in urban applications. Substantial research has been conducted in the past decade. This paper conducted a comprehensive survey of urban applications and key techniques based on MLS point clouds. We first introduce the key characteristics of MLS systems and the corresponding point clouds, and present the challenges and opportunities of using the data. Next, we summarize the current applications of using MLS over urban areas, including transportation infrastructure mapping, building information modeling, utility surveying and mapping, vegetation inventory, and autonomous vehicle driving. Then, we review common key issues for processing and analyzing MLS point clouds, including classification methods, object recognition, data registration, data fusion, and 3D city modeling. Finally, we discuss the future prospects for MLS technology and urban applications.

AB As an extremely significant tool, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) obtain corresponding development which is widely used in the oceanographic survey, military applications and ocean investigation. However, it is rather hard to fulfill missions about ocean exploration in suspended status or at slow speeds for traditional AUVs, due to the effect of the control surfaces trends to decline or even invalid completely in this condition. To overcome the limitation mentioned above, a torpedo-shaped AUV with vectored thrust ducted propeller is presented in this paper, in which the vector thruster is designed based on a 3SPS-S parallel manipulator. The 3SPS-S parallel manipulator, which has merits of compact structure, high reliability, high precision and fast response, is employed for thrust vectoring control mechanism. Additionally, the kinematics and dynamics model of the thrust-vectoring mechanism is constructed, and the MATLAB simulation results show the designed vectored thruster have great application superiority and potential for AUV. Finally, a control scheme of the vectored thruster is designed after considering the case study.

AB To solve the problem of unknown noise covariance matrices inherent in the cooperative localization of autonomous underwater vehicles, a new adaptive extended Kalman filter is proposed. The predicted error covariance matrix and measurement noise covariance matrix are adaptively estimated based on an online expectation-maximization approach. Experimental results illustrate that, under the circumstances that are detailed in the paper, the proposed algorithm has better localization accuracy than existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

ID KALMAN FILTER DESIGN; AUV NAVIGATION; ALGORITHM
AB In the underwater domain, guaranteeing accurate navigation for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a complex but fundamental task to be achieved. As a matter of fact, only by ensuring a correct AUV localization, it is possible to accomplish surveillance, monitoring, and inspection missions. Most of the navigation filters for AUVs are based on Bayesian estimators, such as the Kalman filter, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), or the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and employ different instruments, including the Doppler velocity log to perform the localization task. Recently, the use of payload sensors, such as cameras or forward-looking SONARs, in navigation-aiding has arisen as an interesting research field in the attempt to reduce the localization error drift. Such sensors, if used simultaneously, can provide multiple observations, which can be combined in a Kalman filtering framework to increase navigation robustness against noise sources. Navigation techniques that employ multiple devices can provide a high improvement of the estimation quality, but they can also cause an increase in terms of computational load. Consequently, strategies that can represent a tradeoff between these two conflicting goals have to be investigated. In this contribution, two different frameworks have been implemented and compared: on the one hand, a centralized iterative UKF-based navigation approach and, on the other hand, a sensor fusion framework with parallel local UKFs. The sequential (or iterated) UKF, where the correction step is iteratively performed for each available measurement, belongs to the first class of filters. The federated and the consensus-based decentralized UKFs can be categorized as the second class and they differ in the employed fusion strategy. Experimental navigation data obtained during sea trials performed at Vulcano Island, Messina, Italy has been used for offline validation. The results analysis focuses on both the navigation quality and the filter robustness against the reduction of the available measurements.

AB Introduction: While improved safety is a highly cited potential benefit of autonomous vehicles (AVs), at the same time a frequently cited concern is the new safety challenges that AVs introduce. The literature lacks a rigorous exploration of the safety perceptions of road users who will interact with AVs, including vulnerable road users. Addressing this gap is essential because the successful integration of AVs into transportation systems hinges on an understanding of how all road users will react to their presence. Methods: A stated preference survey of the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan statistical area (Phoenix MSA) was conducted in July 2018. A series of ordered probit models was estimated to analyze the survey responses and identify differences between various population groups with respect to the perceived safety of driving, cycling, and walking near AVs. Results: Greater exposure to and awareness of AVs are not uniformly associated with increases in perceived safety. Various attitudinal factors, level of AV automation, and other intrinsic and extrinsic factors are related to safety perceptions of driving, walking, and cycling near AVs. Socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, income, employment, and automobile usage and ownership, have various relationships with perceived safety. Conclusions: Cycling near an AV was perceived as the least safe activity, followed by walking and then driving near an AV. Both similarities and differences were observed among the factors associated with the perceived safety of different travel alternatives. Practical Applications: Public perception will guide the development and adoption of AVs directly and indirectly. To help maintain control of public perception, transportation planners, decision makers, and other stakeholders should consider more deliberate and targeted messaging to address the concerns of different road users. In addition, more careful pilot testing and more direct attention to vulnerable road users may help avoid a backlash that could delay the rollout of this technology.

AB Despite an increasingly large body of research that focuses on the potential demand for autonomous vehicles (AVs), risk preference is an understudied factor. Given that AV technology and how it will interact with the evolving mobility system are highly risky, this lack of research on risk preference is a critical gap in current understanding. By using a stated preference survey of 1142 individuals from Singapore, this study achieves three objectives. First, it develops one measure of psychometric risk preference and operationalizes prospect theory to create two economic risk preference parameters. Second, it examines how these psychometric and economic risk preferences are associated with socioeconomic variables. Third, it analyzes how risk preference influences the mode choice of AVs. The study finds that risk preference parameters are significantly associated with socioeconomic variables: the elderly, poor, females, and unemployed Singaporeans appear more risk-averse and tend to overestimate small probabilities of losses. Furthermore, all three risk preference parameters contribute to the prediction of AV adoption. These modeling results have policy implications at both the aggregate and disaggregate levels. At the aggregate level, people misperceive probabilities, are overall risk-averse, and hence under-consume AVs relative to the social optimum. At the disaggregate level, the elderly, poor, female, and unemployed are more risk-averse and thus are less likely to adopt AVs. These results suggest that it might be valuable for governments to implement policies to encourage technology adoption, particularly for disadvantaged social groups, although caution remains due to uncertainty in the long-term effects of AVs. Individualized risk preference parameters could also inform how to design regulations, safety standards, and liability allocations of AVs since many regulations are essentially mechanisms for risk allocation. One limitation of the paper is that risk preference is measured and modeled only as individual-specific but not alternative-specific variables. Future studies should examine the relationship between the multiple components of risk preference and the multiple risky aspects of AVs.

AB The low diffusion of EVs, which account for only 4.2% of the global registrations, has pushed scholars' interest in uncovering the factors involved when purchasing these vehicles. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study performs an exploratory analysis of the factors influencing EV purchase intention of a representative sample of the Italian population (N = 1100). Data are collected through an online questionnaire composed as of the following: 33 items are derived from TPB, 20 concern mobility habits, 8 EV knowledge, and the remaining are socio-demographic variables. The last item measures the EV purchase intention. Data concerning TPB and mobility habits are reduced through two factor analyses. The first analysis reveals four components: pleasant-ness, traditional driving habits, environmental concern, and perceived purchase control. The second reveals three components: autonomous transport, non-autonomous transport, and walking versus driving the car. For EV knowledge, the mean score is calculated. Then a hierarchical multiple regression analysis shows that EV purchase intention is widely predicted by pleasantness, followed by environmental concern, perceived purchase control, and, to a less extent, autonomous transport, while it is negatively affected by traditional driving habits and EV knowledge. These findings reveal that EV purchase intention in the Italian e-mobility market is essentially driven by beliefs and attitudes, but is hindered by a reluctance to leave traditional driving habits and an increasing knowledge of EVs, entailing presumably that of their unresolved problems, such as the high purchase cost, the limited range, and the poor infrastructure. Demographic variables do not affect the EV purchase intention. Suggestions are provided to policy makers and car manufacturers to sustain the EV uptake.

ID SONAR IMAGE SEGMENTATION; MARKOV RANDOM-FIELD
AB Autonomous recognition of marine targets is considered a promising technology for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) marine survey, and AUV equipped with side-scan sonar (SSS) for recognition is the key to surveys. As a fundamental function, SSS recognition remains unsolved due to the challenging image conditions of SSS and insufficient algorithm robustness. This paper proposes an accurate and real-time dual-branch recognition framework containing segmentation and refinement branches. Firstly, the segmentation branch uses a lightweight learning network to analyze the data comprehensively. In this branch, we propose a densely connected local attention recurrent residual (LAR2) block as the backbone, and at the same time, an atrous convolution is introduced. This branch can focus on the features of interest in the image, ensuring better feature representation with low-resolution SSS information while guiding the next branch. Secondly, the refinement branch is to adjust the previous branch's results and combines the low-level and high-level features. We propose holistic attention (HA) block in this branch, which can further improve the target recognition performance. Finally, we adopt the feature fusion method of bilinear pooling to integrate the results of the two branches to output a high-precision recognition image. In offline experiments and sea trials, our proposed method outperforms other competing algorithms in the four indicators of semantic segmentation, and achieves a computation speed of 92.66 ms (+/- 0.86 ms) per image on AUV dedicated hardware. The method has strong robustness, meets real-time performance, and can be widely used in AUV marine survey.

ID RADIATED NOISE; UNDERWATER
AB Noise interference of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a critical factor affecting the performance of AUV-mounted sonar payloads, especially for passive acoustic systems. Adaptive noise cancellers (ANCs) are used to eliminate noise in many scenarios for signal enhancement. However, a conventional ANC uses a primary sensor to get the data and a secondary sensor to get correlated reference noise input, which adds complexity to the AUV-mounted sonar systems. In this paper, a modified ANC is proposed to improve the performance of an AUV-mounted passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system receiver. Unlike the conventional ANC, the reference input of this ANC is not the noise obtained using a secondary sensor; instead, the transmitted source signal is used as the reference signal, independent of the noise characteristics. The performance of the ANC is thoroughly evaluated using the field navigation data collected from an AUV sea trial. Postprocessing results indicate that the ANC can effectively improve the beamforming performance of the piUSBL array, suppressing the beamformed power of the AUV noise by up to 13.8 dB. To our knowledge, this work is the first ANC study for piUSBL, which is of great significance for the further development of piUSBL.

ID POLICY; ALGORITHM
AB Motion planning based on the reinforcement learning algorithms of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has shown great potential. Motion planning algorithms are primarily utilized for path planning and trajectory-tracking. However, prior studies have been confronted with some limitations. The time-varying ocean current affects algorithmic sampling and AUV motion and then leads to an overestimation error during path planning. In addition, the ocean current makes it easy to fall into local optima during trajectory planning. To address these problems, this paper presents a reinforcement learning-based motion planning algorithm with comprehensive ocean information (RLBMPA-COI). First, we introduce real ocean data to construct a time-varying ocean current motion model. Then, comprehensive ocean information and AUV motion position are introduced, and the objective function is optimized in the state-action value network to reduce overestimation errors. Finally, state transfer and reward functions are designed based on real ocean current data to achieve multi-objective path planning and adaptive event triggering in trajectorytracking to improve robustness and adaptability. The numerical simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a better path planning ability and a more robust trajectory-tracking effect than those of traditional reinforcement learning algorithms.

AB In this paper, 3D point cloud and depth map fusion system for 3D environment detection is proposed. This algorithm uses the depth map generated by virtual perspective mapping technology to assist LiDAR point cloud map information matching, and distinguishes objects according to distance and color to facilitate observation. At the same time, the depth map is used to assist in the generation of two-dimensional point cloud information to repair the missing problems to achieve the effect of restoring the point cloud information. The method solves the problems of sparse point cloud information of distant objects, reflections caused by the material of cars, and light penetration caused by glass, so that the point cloud map information can be more accurate. After a series of experiments, the accuracy rate of the proposed method can reach 91.27%, the precision of matching completeness is 91.61%, the F1-measure is 92.37%, and the recall rate can reach 93.14%. Compared with most methods, our proposed method has better performance. The proposed method successfully solves the problems that LiDAR point cloud map data will be missing and sparse due to environmental factors to achieve high-precision point cloud map.

AB To reduce the human exposure risk during the offshore structure inspection, the Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle (ROV) is a widely used solution. This paper couples an inspection class ROV with an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) via a launch and recovery system (LARS) in a nonlinear numerical model. Operational inspection missions with both static and moving targets are modelled for this ASV/ROV system. The paper reports the following distinctive mission profiles: i) pipeline inspection, ii) floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) mooring line inspection and iii) circumferential weld surface scan at the FOWT spar. The results provide important pa-rameters to design and implement autonomous inspection missions. During the scan/check stage, the distance between the ROV and the target will be varying, due to the relative motion between the ASV and ROV. Important model results are that missions with following ASV will allow to reduce the ROV umbilical tension for a given mission profile. Results also determined that the net buoyancy of the ROV will lead to a position offset. In the surface scan cases, it is found that the drag force caused by the tidal current can contribute to ROV rotation and should be considered in detail ahead of any mission.

TI Cloud Update of Geodetic Normal Distribution Map Based on Crowd-Sourcing

ID LOCALIZATION
AB LiDAR-based localization has been widely used for the pose estimation of autonomous vehicles. Since the localization requires a sustainable map reflecting environment changes, a map update framework based on crowd-sourcing measurements has been researched. Unfortunately, a point cloud map occupies too large data size to transmit data in the uploading and downloading of the map update framework. To realize the LiDAR map update framework by reducing the data size, we proposed a novel map update framework using a Geodetic Normal Distribution (GND) map that compresses the point cloud to the normal distributions. The proposed GND map update framework comprises two parts: map change detection based on crowd-sourcing vehicles and map updating based on a map cloud server. GND map changes are detected based on an evidence theory considering geometric relationships between the GND map and crowd-sourcing measurements and uploaded to the map cloud server. Uploaded map changes reproduce representative map changes based on a similarity-based clustering, which are updated into the GND map. The proposed framework was evaluated in simulations and real environments on construction sites. As a result, although partial map changes occurred, the GND map was kept up-to-date through the proposed framework and the localization for autonomous driving was performed successfully.

TI Chebyshev Transform-Based Robust Trajectory Prediction Using Recurrent

AB Trajectory prediction is gaining attention as a form of situational awareness because it is an essential component of the support system of autonomous driving, particularly in urban areas. A promising application is cooperative driving automation, where the traffic scene is monitored by roadside sensors with undisrupted views. A critical problem is that these sensors are adversely affected by inclement weather, including drenching rain or large amounts of snow, in which case the reliability of the prediction results can be significantly compromised. To address these problems, this study proposes a framework for robust vehicle-trajectory predictions based on the Chebyshev transform. In the proposed framework, the original trajectory snippets (partial trajectories) are Chebyshev-transformed, and the resulting coefficients form new snippets. The LSTM (long-short term memory) encoder-decoder structure was trained and tested using these new coefficient snippets, which were extracted from a public vehicle trajectory dataset. The performance and robustness of the proposed framework were verified by emulating sensor data that were incomplete as a result of environmental factors. The proposed framework provides stable and accurate long-term trajectory prediction because the Chebyshev transform is robust to incomplete sensor data by virtue of its uniform nature.

AB The Fifth Generation (5G) communication technology has paved the way for intelligent and diversified Internet of Connected Vehicles (IoCV) services that meet stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain are playing and will continue to play an imperative role in providing secure and decentralized resource sharing to solve complex and time-sensitive problems at the edge. The integration of both those techniques will enhance the performance of smart vehicular services, especially in beyond 5G (B5G) networks. Ensuring secure transactions in complex autonomous network architectures is an immense challenge. This article addresses computational, storage, connectivity and intelligence concerns using a collaborative approach to engage multiple Internet of Things (IoT) nodes such as connected- vehicles, drones and mobile devices for the provisioning of QoS-optimal complex service compositions in autonomous mobile networks. Continuous and fast compositions emerge using decentralized decisions and interactions with diversified neighboring nodes with the aid of reinforcement learning. Blockchain is used to ensure that nodes interact with each other verifiably and record transactions without the need for trusted intermediaries. We assess whether having an AI-enabled blockchain collaborative composition solution improves service availability and delivery of smart city vehicular services.

AB The ability to make measurements of phosphate (PO43-) concentrations at temporal and spatial scales beyond those offered by shipboard observations offers new opportunities for investigations of the marine phosphorus cycle. We here report the first in situ PO43- dataset from an underwater glider (Kongsberg Seaglider) equipped with a PO43- Lab-on-Chip (LoC) analyser. Over 44 days, a 120 km transect was conducted in the northern North Sea during late summer (August and September). Surface depletion of PO43- (<0.2 mu M) was observed above a seasonal thermocline, with elevated, but variable concentrations within the bottom layer (0.30-0.65 mu M). Part of the variability in the bottom layer is attributed to the regional circulation and across shelf exchange, with the highest PO(4)(3- )concentrations being associated with elevated salinities in northernmost regions, consistent with nutrient rich North Atlantic water intruding onto the shelf. Our study represents a significant step forward in autonomous underwater vehicle sensor capabilities and presents new capability to extend research into the marine phosphorous cycle and, when combined with other recent LoC developments, nutrient stoichiometry.

AB The field of robotics has received significant attention in our society due to the extensive use of robotic manipulators; however, recent advances in the research on autonomous vehicles have demonstrated a broader range of applications, such as exploration, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. In this sense, the problem of efficiently building a model of the environment using cooperative mobile robots is critical. Finding routes that are either length or time-optimized is essential for real-world applications of small autonomous robots. This paper addresses the problem of multi-robot area coverage path planning for geophysical surveys. Such surveys have many applications in mineral exploration, geology, archeology, and oceanography, among other fields. We propose a methodology that segments the environment into hexagonal cells and allocates groups of robots to different clusters of non-obstructed cells to acquire data. Cells can be covered by lawnmower, square or centroid patterns with specific configurations to address the constraints of magneto-metric surveys. Several trials were executed in a simulated environment, and a statistical investigation of the results is provided. We also report the results of experiments that were performed with real Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in an outdoor setting.

AB Detecting moving objects is of great importance for autonomous unmanned vehicle systems, and a challenging task especially in complex dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach for the detection of moving objects and the estimation of their motion states using consecutive stereo image pairs on mobile platforms. First, we use a variant of the semiglobal matching algorithm to compute initial disparity maps. Second, assisted by the initial disparities, boundaries in the image segmentation produced by simple linear iterative clustering are classified into coplanar, hinge, and occlusion. Moving points are obtained during ego-motion estimation by a modified random sample consensus) algorithm without resorting to time-consuming dense optical flow. Finally, the moving objects are extracted by merging superpixels according to the boundary types and their movements. The proposed method is accelerated on the GPU at 20 frames per second. The data which we use for testing and benchmarking is released, thus completing similar data sets. It includes 812 image pairs and 924 moving objects with ground truth for better algorithms evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results in terms of moving-object detection and their motion state estimation in challenging urban scenarios.

TI An apparatus to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of autonomous

SO REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Hydrodynamic coefficients or hydrodynamic derivatives of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play an important role in their development and maneuverability. The most popular way of estimating their coefficients is to implement captive model tests such as straight line tests and planar motion mechanism (PMM) tests in the towing tanks. This paper aims to develop an apparatus based on planar experiments of water tunnel in order to estimate hydrodynamic derivatives due to AUVs' acceleration and velocity. The capability of implementing straight line tests and PMM ones using mechanical oscillators located in the downstream flow of the model is considered in the design procedure of the system. The hydrodynamic derivatives that resulted from the acceleration and velocity of the AUV model were estimated using the apparatus that we developed. Static and dynamics test results were compared for the similar derivatives. The findings showed that the system provided the basis for conducting static tests, i.e., straight-line and dynamic tests that included pure pitch and pure heave. By conducting such tests in a water tunnel, we were able to eliminate errors related to the time limitation of the tests and the effects of surface waves in the towing tank on AUVs with applications in the deep sea.

AB Although autonomous vehicles are increasingly becoming a reality, eliminating human intervention from driving may imply significant safety and trust-related concerns. To address this issue from a psychological perspective, this study applies layers of anthropomorphic cues to an artificial driving agent and explicates the process in which these cues promote positive evaluations and perceptions of an unmanned driving system. In a between-subjects factorial experiment (N = 89) consisting of three unmanned driving scenarios, participants interacted with an artificial driving agent with different levels of anthropomorphic cues induced by the variations in appearance (human-like vs. gadget-like) and autonomy (high vs. low) of the agent. The results indicated that human-like appearance and high autonomy were more effective in eliciting positive perceptions of the agent. In addition, a mediation analysis revealed that the greater level of anthropomorphism induced by human-like appearance and high autonomy in the agent evoked the feelings of social presence, which in turn positively affected the perceived intelligence and safety of and trust in the agent, suggesting that the extent to which users perceive the driving agent as intelligent, safe, and trustworthy is largely determined by the feelings of social presence experienced during their interaction.

A short introduction describes the need for and expectations of autonomous robots and vehicles. A classification of swarm structures is based on animals such as bees or ants. Two main types of swarms are recognized: structural (master-slaves) and non-structural. The operator controls both of them remotely. The swarm structure has a great influence on the structure of single robots. A computer model with an object programming definition was worked out, and a simulation of the presented swarm structure is provided. The results are described in the paper.

AB The operation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) relies on three major motions: yaw, theta, and depth, each requiring its own set of proportional integral derivative (PID) controller gain criteria. Thus, different issues arise, including the availability of multiple criteria for optimization algorithm evaluation, the importance of these criteria, the trade-off between criterion performance, and criterion critical values. These issues make the evaluation of optimization algorithms for AUV motion control a complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This research proposes a novel selectionintegrated approach for AUV optimization algorithms in different motions using two MCDM methods: fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) for criteria weighting and fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM) for optimization algorithm selection. The approach comprises three main phases: development of PID, FWZIC-based criteria weighting, and FDOSM-based optimization algorithm selection. In all three motion types - "depth", "yaw", and "theta"- Kp_& theta; had the highest weight value, with respective weights of 0.143, 0.149, and 0.142. In contrast, Ki_depth consistently received the lowest weight value across all three motion types, with respective weights of 0.057, 0.0598, and 0.057. Regarding the "depth"motion, the Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA) was the highestperforming alternative with a score of 0.077, while the eagle strategy-particle swarm optimization algorithm was the worst alternative with a score of 0.022. The Cuckoo optimization algorithm was identified as the best alternative for the "yaw"motion with a score of 0.072, whereas black hole optimization had the lowest score of 0.036. The best alternative for the "theta"motion was AOA with a score of 0.067, and the worst algorithm was sunflower optimization with a score of 0.028. This developed approach was evaluated based on systematic ranking and sensitivity analysis, which confirmed the validity of the proposed work. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a promising technique to enhance the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. While FL has been extensively studied, the communication and networking challenges related to the operations of FL in dynamic yet dense vehicular networks remain under-explored. Limited storage and communication capacities of individual vehicles throttle the timely training of an FL model in distributed vehicular networks. In this paper, we present a communication framework for FL (CF4FL) in transportation systems. CF4FL aims to accelerate the convergence of FL training process through the innovation of two complementary networking components: (i) a deadline-driven vehicle scheduler (DDVS), and (ii) a concurrent vehicle polling scheme (CVPS). DDVS identifies a subset of vehicles for local model training in each iteration of FL, with the aim of minimizing data loss while respecting the deadline constraints derived from vehicles' storage, computation, and energy budgets. CVPS takes advantage of multiple antennas on an edge server to enable concurrent local model transmissions in dynamic vehicular networks, thereby reducing the airtime overhead of each FL iteration. We have evaluated CF4FL through a blend of experimentation and simulation. Trace-driven simulation shows that, compared to existing scheduling and transmission schemes, CF4FL reduces the convergence time of FL training by 39%.

AB The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and their inherent flexibility in charging timings make them an asset to improve grid performance. In contrast to direct control by a utility or autonomous price-based charging, the transactive control framework not only provides benefits to both grid and customers but also ensures customer autonomy. In this work, we design a transactive electric vehicle (TEV) agent that incorporates the EV owner's willingness to trade-off between savings and amenity in form of a slider, where the EV owner's amenity is characterized as vehicle readiness. Further, a privacy-preserving bidding formulation is proposed that also represents the customer's transactive preference. A transactive market mechanism is discussed that integrates the TEV Agents into the local retail market and reconciles with the current day-ahead and real-time market structure. It is demonstrated that the proposed slider is able to provide a preferred trade-off between savings and amenity to individual customers. At the same time, the market mechanism is shown to successfully reduce both peak prices and peak demand. A comparative investigation of V1G and V2G technologies with respect to the battery prices is also discussed. It reveals that the V2G does not offer significant additional benefits with current battery prices, but could be promising if battery costs decline in the future.

AB Driving safety is quite significant for human drivers, especially in the emergencies and extreme conditions. To advance the active safety of vehicles, a cooperative control framework is proposed for human driver and the active rear steering system (ARS). Human driver model is established considering different driving characteristics to simulate different drivers. Moreover, vehicle-road model is built for ARS controller design. Then, the performance indexes of active safety, i.e., lateral stability, handling performance, rollover prevention and path tracking performance, are defined. Meanwhile, constraints for ARS controller design are proposed. Furthermore, linear-time-varying (LTV) model predictive control (MPC) is applied to ARS controller design with the consideration of multi-constraints. To evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the cooperative control framework, three maneuvers on the low adhesion road are conducted based on the co-simulation platform of CarSim and Simulink. Testing results indicate that the cooperative control framework can assist human driver to enhance vehicle's active safety. With the application of ARS control, the performance indexes of active safety are reduced more than 50%. In addition, it also shows that the ARS system has good adaptability and effectiveness to deal with different driving characteristics.

AB Autonomous vehicles are equipped with complimentary sensors to perceive the environment accurately. Deep learning models have proven to be the most effective approach for computer vision problems. Therefore, in autonomous driving, it is essential to design reliable networks to fuse data from different sensors. In this work, we develop a novel data fusion architecture using camera and LiDAR data for object detection in autonomous driving. Given the sparsity of LiDAR data, developing multimodal fusion models is a challenging task. Our proposal integrates an efficient LiDAR sparse-to-dense completion network into the pipeline of object detection models, achieving a more robust performance at different times of the day. The Waymo Open Dataset has been used for the experimental study, which is the most diverse detection benchmark in terms of weather and lighting conditions. The depth completion network is trained with the KITTI depth dataset, and transfer learning is used to obtain dense maps on Waymo. With the enhanced LiDAR data and the camera images, we explore early and middle fusion approaches using popular object detection models. The proposed data fusion network provides a significant improvement compared to single-modal detection at all times of the day, and outperforms previous approaches that upsample depth maps with classical image processing algorithms. Our multi-modal and multi-source approach achieves a 1.5, 7.5, and 2.1 mean AP increase at day, night, and dawn/dusk, respectively, using four different object detection meta-architectures.

AB Computer vision is a subdomain of artificial intelligence widely utilized in autonomous vehicles, digital health, and image processing at large. Despite significant breakthroughs, concerns persist regarding the technical challenges computer vision may encounter in the real, open world. Drawing on qualitative interviews and content analysis, this article examines the diverse sociotechnical challenges that affect the technical accuracy of computer vision systems in real-world settings. From a new materialism perspective, this article defines the technological accuracy of a computer vision system as its ability to successfully enact an objective reality of things through the maintenance of a stable sociotechnical assemblage comprising various components, including things, sensors, data, algorithms, experts, institutions, and more. Computer vision-based artificial intelligence systems evolve as dynamic, emergent entities responsive to contextual changes across phases, domains, and environments. However, when these changes are inadequately considered, computer vision may produce unintended performances or encounter technical dilemmas. Ultimately, the success of computer vision hinges on its capacity to adapt to an open world characterized by diverse contexts or, alternatively, to flatten those contexts into a uniform, closed world. The conclusion proposes future research and policy recommendations for achieving technological accuracy in computer vision.

AB The undersea sensor networks have an important function in marine resource exploration. To prolong the lifetime of the sensor networks, a bidirectional inductive underwater wireless power transfer (BI-UWPT) system with variable structure is proposed. With the proposed system, the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) could receive energy from the undersea docking station and transmit energy to the undersea sensor networks. The two full bridge topologies and the SS compensation networks are adopted in the system to achieve the bidirectional power transfer. To achieve bidirectional energy transmission of different power levels, two different operating frequencies and variable compensation capacitors are employed by the AUV. The system mathematical model is also presented. To verify the theoretical analysis, a 432 W simulation model when the AUV receiving electric energy and a 96 W simulation model when the AUV transmitting electric energy are constructed, respectively. The theoretical analysis is verified by the simulation results. Simulation results show that the variable compensation networks can obtain high transfer efficiency of the BI-UWPT system.

AB In this article, a practical fixed-time adaptive neural network (NN) trajectory tracking control scheme for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to uncertain dynamics, unknown time-varying disturbances, an unknown dead zone, actuator faults and input quantization is developed for the first time. Here, a hysteresis quantizer is introduced to decrease the oscillation in the signal quantization process. Then, the radial basis function NN is employed to compensate the uncertainty term in the AUVs trajectory tracking control system. By incorporating the bounded estimate, smoothing functions and parameter adaptive technique, the problem of unknown dead zone, actuator fault and input quantization are addressed. The restrictive conditions of boundedness for the disturbance-like item in conventional sector bounded quantizer is resolved. Subsequently, a practical fixed-time adaptive NN trajectory tracking control law is designed does not require any parameter information of the quantizer under the backstepping design framework. The theoretical analysis further confirms that all signals in the AUV trajectory tracking closed-loop control system remain bounded, and the developed control scheme is shown to be effective through simulation results.

AB The bionic robotic fish is one of the special autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), whose path planning is crucial for many applications including underwater environment detection, archaeology, pipeline leak detection, and so on. However, the uncertain ocean currents increase the difficulty of path planning for bionic robotic fish in practice. In this paper, the path energy consumption is selected as the objective function for path planning, path safety factor, and smoothness are considered as the constraint conditions. The kinematic model is established for bionic robotic fish and, considering the uncertainty of ocean currents, a "min-max" robust optimization problem is proposed in the light of the normal optimization model of path planning for bionic robotic fish. The co-evolutionary genetic algorithm is presented to solve the robust optimization problem with two populations; one population represents the solutions and the other represents the uncertain ocean currents. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to find a robust solution that has the best worst-case performance over a set of possible ocean currents. Multiple experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is very effective for path planning for bionic robotic fish with ocean currents.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the most highly anticipated technological advancements of our time, with potentially wide-ranging social implications in terms of driver/passenger safety, equity and environmental aspects. However, most consumers feel reluctant towards the adoption of AIpowered AVs. To analyse user acceptance of AI-powered AVs, we need to understand the related psychological, social and cognitive factors. To do so, we established a conceptual model based on the technology acceptance literature and considered how performance and effort expectancy, social recognition, hedonism technology security and privacy concerns influence both technology trust and user well-being as mediators that subsequently influence the behavioural intention of the use of AI-powered AVs. We used user innovativeness as a moderator, and we performed a survey in France. Our results from the structural equation modelling largely support the positive relationship between the behavioural intention to use AI-powered AVs and performance-/effort expectancy, social recognition, well-being, hedonism and technology trust, as well as security. On the other hand, privacy concerns negatively influence technology trust.

AB Environment perception is a key enabling technology in autonomous vehicles, and multiple object tracking is an important part of this. The use of high resolution sensors, such as automotive radar and lidar, leads to the extended object tracking problem, with multiple detections per tracked object. For computationally feasible multiple extended object tracking, the data association problem must be handled. Previous work has relied on a two-step approach, using clustering algorithms, together with assignment algorithms, to achieve this. In this paper, we show that it is possible to handle the data association in a single step that works directly on the desired likelihood function. Single step data association is beneficial, because it enables better use of the measurement model and the predicted multiobject density. For single step data association, we use algorithms based on stochastic sampling, and integrate them into a Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture filter. In a simulation study, and in an experiment with Velodyne data acquired in an urban environment, four sampling algorithms are compared to clustering and assignment. The results from the simulations and the experiment show that single-step likelihood-based data association achieves better performance than two-step clustering and assignment data association does.

AB In this paper, we consider attitude control for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with input nonlinearities and unknown disturbances taken into account. The dynamics model in the 3D space of an AUV is simplified to a second-order dynamics with unknown model parameters and disturbances for the yaw and pitch control. Based on this simplification, a sliding-mode-based adaptive control is proposed for the case without any input nonlinearities. For the dead-zone nonlinearity and unknown disturbances, a sliding-mode-based adaptive control combined with a nonlinear disturbance observer is employed, in which the non-symmetric dead-zone with unknown parameters is modeled as a time-varying disturbance-like term rather than constructing a smooth dead-zone inverse. For rudder saturation, the control is further designed by introducing an auxiliary dynamic compensator. The mathematical proof of the proposed algorithms is presented. Extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control. In addition, experimental results on an AUV whose attitude is controlled by cross-type rudders are also provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper proposes a cooperative online target detection methodology by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (Multi-AUV) equipped with the side-scan sonar (SSS) sensor for real-time, accurate, and efficient underwater target detection and positioning in unknown environments. Due to the existence of unfavorable factors such as severe noises and geometric deformation of SSS images, this study incorporates the prior-based threshold segmentation with multi-scale cascaded networks (MSCNet) to reduce the high false alarm rate significantly. Specifically, to the real-time requirements of the AUVs computational platform, this study proposes the sequentially dual-branch lightweight block (LWBlock) as a baseline to obtain dense feature maps, which provide a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Meanwhile, this study establishes the comprehensive correction model, which obtains the accurate target positioning information fusing with the predicted results. Furthermore, according to the target information provided by the automatic target recognition (ATR) system, the data-driven behavior-based (DDBB) path re-planning algorithm is performed that endows each AUV to scan above the interest target autonomously and in detail by designed maneuver behavior. Simulation and actual sea trial experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, and achieves the recognition accuracy of 92.16%, inference speed of 2.45 s, and obtained the best FPR indicator in three SSS targets of 2.54% (metal ball),1.96% (seabed rock) and 1.03% (metal rod), respectively. At the same time, the proposed algorithm can improve detection efficiency by at least 40% compared with a single AUV, which can be widely used in marine mission exploration and resource deployment.

AB The scientific areas of plant genomics and phenomics are capable of improving plant productivity, yet they are limited by the manual labor that is currently required to perform in-field measurement, and a lack of technology for measuring the physical performance of crops growing in the field. A variety of sensor technology has the potential to efficiently measure plant characteristics that are related to production. Recent advances have also shown that autonomous airborne and manually driven ground-based sensor platforms provide practical mechanisms for deploying the sensors in the field. This paper advances the state-of-the-art by developing and rigorously testing an efficient system for high throughput in-field agricultural row-crop phenotyping. The system comprises an autonomous unmanned ground-vehicle robot for data acquisition and an efficient data post-processing framework to provide phenotype information over large-scale real-world plant-science trials. Experiments were performed at three trial locations at two different times of year, resulting in a total traversal of 43.8 km to scan 7.24 hectares and 2423 plots (including repeated scans). The height and canopy closure datawere found to be highly repeatable (r(2) = 1.00 N= 280, r(2) = 0.99 N= 280, respectively) and accurate with respect tomanually gathered field data (r(2) = 0.95 N = 470, r(2) = 0.91 N = 361, respectively), yetmore objective and less-reliant on human skill and experience. The system was found to be a more labor-efficient mechanism for gathering data, which compares favorably to current standardmanual practices.

AB This paper is devoted to the important problem of subsea infrastructure inspection using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The accomplishment of the inspection mission requires high accuracy of AUV coordination with respect to objects, which is not always provided by standard hydroacoustic equipment. That is why we propose an approach based on stereo image processing that can provide submeter accuracy of AUV coordination required under subsea conditions. In the framework of a unified approach based on the use of an a priori formed point model of an object and the application of a structural coherence criterion, we propose and analyze several methods for recognition of underwater objects and coordinate referencing of the AUV to these objects. As a geometric model of an object, we consider its representation based on characteristic points, which determines the spatial structure of the object. In addition to the standard method for object model construction from preliminary measurements, a new method is proposed, which is based on automated technique of model generation from images offline. The proposed object recognition methods use the structural coherence criterion to match 3D point clouds with object models. The 3D point clouds are formed from stereo images captured by a camera using visual navigation. Feature points are generated and matched using the SURF detector and Harris corner detector. To improve the reliability of object identification, we propose joint processing of source images with their vectorized forms. The use of line segments obtained by vectorization significantly increases the number of identified characteristic points when matching a 3D point cloud with a model. Based on the identified points of an object, the matrix of AUV coordinate referencing to this object is computed. The efficiency of the considered methods is estimated and compared. In the computational experiments with model scenes, a virtual geometric model of a distributed subsea production system is used. The experiments on real-world data are carried out under laboratory conditions with the use of a Karmin2 stereo camera (Nerian's 3D stereo camera, baseline 25 cm).

ID MODEL
AB Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have emerged as a promising solution for reconnaissance missions, overcoming labor cost, frequency, and subjectivity issues associated with manual procedures. However, for dynamic environments such as construction sites, the constantly changing conditions hinder a manager from planning the UGV's paths. For an autonomous monitoring mission, the path planning should be dealt with by having a map with the site's most recent scene. In this study, we develop a mobile app capable of local map updates by overlaying an image on a mapping API (e.g., Google Maps) hence working as a digital twin capable of creating a dynamic representation of the updated terrain over the mapping API. UGV operators can draw a path on such an updated construction scene using a tablet PC or smartphone. Discrete GPS information (e.g., latitudinal, and longitudinal) is executed for the UGV's controller. In the overlaying procedure, the homographic relation between the image and map is automatically computed and then projected. We successfully demonstrated the capabilities of the technique with two construction sites and a soccer field using images from the ground and satellite, respectively. The error generation is quantitatively measured and analyzed.

AB Automation continues to be a disruptive force in the workforce. In particular, new automated technologies are projected to replace many mid-skill jobs, potentially displacing millions of workers. Career planning agencies and other organizations can help support workers if they are able to effectively identify optimal transition occupations for displaced workers. We drew upon the 24.2 Occupational Information Network (O*NET) Database to conduct two related studies that identify alternate occupations for truck drivers, who are at risk of job loss due to the adoption of autonomous vehicles. In Study 1, we statistically compared the jobs that we identified based on different search methods using O*NET classifications based on their similarity to the knowledge, skills, values, and interests held by truck drivers. In Study 2, we conducted a survey of truck drivers to evaluate their perceptions of the occupations identified as objectively similar to their occupation. Results indicate that optimal transition occupations may be identified by searching for occupations that share skills as well as the same work activities/industry as a given occupation. These findings hold further implications for career planning organizations and policymakers to ease workforce disruption due to automation.

AB This paper proposes a bidirectional undersea capacitive wireless power transfer system (BD-UCWPT) for the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The two H-Bridge circuits are adapted in the proposed BD-UCWPT system to achieve the bidirectional power flow. The H-Bridge circuit is built based on the GaN devices. As a result, the high switching frequency, and low power loss could be reached. The two LCLC compensation networks are respectively used in the transmitter side and receiver side. The simulation work is conducted with the Ansys Maxwell, PSIM and MATLAB. In the experiments, two seawater bags are added in the middle of two metal plates of C-S1 and C-S2 to model the seawater condition, respectively. In order to verify the theory analysis, a 100W experimental BD-UCWPT system is constructed. The experiments have been conducted in air and in seawater, respectively. The simulated and experimental results are compared with each other. It shows that, with this BD-UCWPT system, the power of AUVs could flow bidirectionally. The stable operation and high efficiency of BD-UCWPT system is verified. The research work in this paper could facilitate the application of wireless power transfer (WPT) system for AUVs and other undersea devices.

ID KALMAN FILTER
AB This paper presents the development of a low cost miniature navigation system for autonomous flying rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system incorporates measurements from a low cost single point GPS and a triaxial solid state inertial/magnetic sensor unit. The navigation algorithm is composed of three modules running on a microcontroller: the sensor calibration module, the attitude estimator, and the velocity and position estimator. The sensor calibration module relies on a recursive least square based ellipsoid hypothesis calibration algorithm to estimate biases and scale factors of accelerometers and magnetometers without any additional calibration equipment. The attitude estimator is a low computational linear attitude fusion algorithm that effectively incorporates high frequency components of gyros and low frequency components of accelerometers and magnetometers to guarantee both accuracy and bandwidth of attitude estimation. The velocity and position estimator uses two cascaded complementary filters which fuse translational acceleration, GPS velocity, and position to improve the bandwidth of velocity and position. The designed navigation system is feasible for miniature UAVs due to its low cost, simplicity, miniaturization, and guaranteed estimation errors. Both ground tests and autonomous flight tests of miniature unmanned helicopter and quadrotor have shown the effectiveness of the proposed system, demonstrating its promise in UAV systems.

   in a rigid formation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE autonomous vehicles; decentralized control; formations; multivehicle
   systems; scalability
AB In this note, we consider the effect of information flow on the propagation of errors in spacing in a collection of vehicles trying to maintain a rigid formation during translational maneuvers. The,motion of each vehicle is described using a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We consider undirected and connected information flow graphs, and assume that each vehicle can communicate with a maximum of q vehicles, where q may vary with the size n of the collection. We consider translational maneuver of a reference vehicle, where its steady state velocity is different from its initial velocity. In the absence of any disturbing forces acting on the vehicles during the maneuver, it is desired that the collection be controlled in such a way that its motion asymptotically resembles that of a rigid body. In the presence of bounded disturbing forces acting on the vehicles, it is desired that the maximum deviation of the motion of the collection from that of a rigid body be bounded and be independent of the size of the collection. We consider a decentralized feedback control scheme, where the controller of each vehicle takes into account the aggregate errors in position and velocity from the vehicles with which it is in direct communication. We assume that all vehicles start at their respective desired positions and velocities. Since the displacement of every vehicle at the end of the maneuver of the reference vehicle must be the same, we show that the loop transfer function must have at least two poles at the origin. We then show that if the loop transfer function has three or more poles at the origin, then the motion of the collection is unstable, that is, its deviation from the rigid body motion is arbitrarily large, if the size of the formation is sufficiently large. If 1 is the number of poles of the transfer function relating the position of a vehicle with its control input, we show that if (q(n)/n) -> 0 as n -> infinity, then there is a low frequency simisoidal disturbance of at most unit amplitude acting on each vehicle such that the maximum errors in spacing response increase at least as Omega(((root n/q(n))(l+1))).(1) A consequence of the results presented in this note is that the maximum errors in spacing and velocity of any vehicle can be made insensitive to the size of the collection only if there is at least one vehicle in the collection that communicates with at least Q(n) other vehicles in the collection.

   Visual Place Recognition Toward Autonomous Vehicles
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Visual place recognition; loop detection; SLAM; semantic understanding
AB Long-term visual place recognition (VPR) has recently become a popular research topic in the field of autonomous driving. In urban scenarios, variations in scene appearance due to the change in seasons and illumination bring great challenges for scene description. Several learning-based VPR techniques can learn latent invariant descriptors for appearance variations and show excellent performance in long-term VPR tasks. However, these methods require huge datasets and computational resources (e.g., GPUs) for training and inference. Mobile platforms such as autonomous vehicles often cannot provide sufficient computing power. To address this issue, in this paper, a training-free lightweight global image descriptor named SSR-VLAD is proposed for VPR. This descriptor is able to work accurately in real-time without GPUs, even on embedded platforms. The contribution of this work has two aspects. (1) A novel semantic skeleton representation (SSR) is proposed to describe the semantic spatial distribution of scenes by using the semantic spatial context; (2) Inspired by the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD), a spatial-temporal aggregation framework for SSR features is constructed to aggregate all SSR features into one SSR-VLAD descriptor, which encodes the spatial and temporal information into a fixed-size global descriptor. SSR-VLAD shows robust performance towards the appearance variations of scenes. Specifically, on three public datasets with challenging urban scenes, experimental results show that SSR-VLAD has competitive VPR performance compared to several state-of-the-art (SoTA) VPR methods. Additionally, SSR-VLAD achieves SoTA real-time computational performance with lower RAM consumption in computationally constrained scenarios.

DE autonomous rail rapid transit; semi-flexible pavement; test section; FE
   model; dynamic responses
AB The application of a semi-flexible pavement (SFP) is an effective solution to solve the rutting problems of the autonomous rail rapid transit (ART) system. The service environment of an ART pavement is significantly different from that of the conventional pavement due to the large axle load and high tire pressure of ART vehicles. A test section was constructed in the Zhuzhou ART system and a tire-pavement coupling FE model was built to explore the distribution features of the dynamic responses as well as to optimize the material and structural design. The tire-pavement coupling model was firstly verified by the field test data and then, utilizing the validated model, the parameter study was performed to analyze the influence of the vehicle operating state and pavement conditions. The simulation results show that the transverse tensile strain at the bottom of the SFP layer is dominant for the fatigue cracking of the pavement. Properly reducing the tire pressure can effectively improve the tensile environment at the bottom of the SFP layer. The action of the braking force may cause significant longitudinal tensile strains at the surface of the SFP layer and lead to transverse cracking of the semi-flexible ART pavement. The interlayer bonding between the SFP layer and the asphalt layer has significant influence on the amplitude and distribution of tensile stress at the bottom of the SFP layer. Moreover, to optimize the tensile environment of the semi-flexible ART pavement, the thickness of the SFP layer and the asphalt concrete layer cannot differ too much under the premise of meeting the requirements of rutting resistance performance.

   Filter for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation
SO DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Decentralised Kalman filter; inertial navigation; redundant navigation;
   autonomous underwater vehicle navigation
AB Most submarines carry more than one set of inertial navigation system (INS) for redundancy and reliability. Apart from INS systems, the submarine carries other sensors that provide different navigation information. A major challenge is to combine these sensors and INS estimates in an optimal and robust manner for navigation. This issue has been addressed by Farrell(1). The same approach is used in this paper to combine different sensor measurements along with INS system. However, since more than one INS system is available onboard, it would be better to use multiple INS systems at the same time to obtain a better estimate of states and to provide autonomy in the event of failure of one INS system. This would require us to combine the estimates obtained from local filters (one set of INS system integrated with external sensors), in some optimal way to provide a global estimate. Individual sensor and IMU measurements cannot be accessed in this scenario. Also, autonomous operation requires no sharing of information among local filters. Hence a decentralised Kalman filter approach is considered for combining the estimates of local filters to give a global estimate. This estimate would not be optimal, however. A better optimal estimate can be obtained by accessing individual measurements and augmenting the state vector in Kalman filter, but in that case, corruption of one INS system will lead to failure of the whole filter. Hence to ensure satisfactory performance of the filter even in the event of failure of some INS system, a decentralised Kalman filtering approach is considered.

AB Worldwide, transportation accounts for 18% of global carbon dioxide emissions (as of 2019). In order to battle the impending threat of climate change, consumers and industry must adopt sustainable transport that complies with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of increased energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. To fulfil these objectives, a new class of vehicles has recently emerged, smart electric vehicles, which is forecasted to reduce carbon dioxide emissions up to 43% as compared to diesel engine vehicles. However, to bring these vehicles to the mainstream, supporting architecture is needed to optimize them in a sustainable manner. One such novel architecture is Digital Twin Technology, which is a virtual mapping technology, extending from it, capable of investigating the lifecycle of multisystem bodies in a digital environment. In recent years, digital twin technology is becoming an underpinning area of research globally. As a result, novel individual research covering digital twin implementation on various aspects of smart vehicles has transpired in research and industrial studies, consequently allowing digital twin technology to evolve over the years. This work aims to bridge the gap between individual research to provide a comprehensive review from a technically informed and academically neutral standpoint. Conceptual groundwork of digital twin technology is built systematically for the reader, to allow insight into its inception and evolution. The study sifts the digital twin domain for contributions in smart vehicle systems, exploring its potential and contemporaneous challenges to realization. The study then proceeds to review recent research and commercial projects for innovation within this domain. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first extensive review of the application of digital twin technology in smart electric vehicles. The review has been systematically classified into specific domains within the smart vehicle system such as autonomous navigation control, advanced driver assistance systems, vehicle health monitoring, battery management systems, vehicle power electronics, and electrical power drive systems. An in-depth discussion of each vehicle subsystem is undertaken to present this review as an eclectic panorama of the smart vehicle system. This review further facilitates appreciation of the role of digital twin technology within each classification from a holistic technical perspective. Finally, the work ends with an inspection of the technosocio-economic impact of digital twin technology that will revolutionize mainstream vehicle technology and the obstacles for further development.

AB Autonomous landing is a vital option for Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAV), as it can be a fail-safe in many critical cases. This paper demonstrates a complete solution for the soft landing application of a fully autonomous quadrotor on a moving pad considering external disturbance, model uncertainties, and actuators noise. The challenge starts with detecting the specially designed landing pad by an onboard vision system, a robust Algorithm estimates its coordinates precisely using a camera pose estimation. An enhanced Kalman filter by Madgwick data fusion of asynchronous sensors was developed for the best relative pose and heading reference. Different sizes and designs of the ArUco markers were attentively chosen to ensure the best detection at different altitudes and angles of approach. The landing trajectory is dynamically generated based on Jerk optimization, integrating a bio-inspired velocity profile by Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to smoothen the landing. Model Predictive Control (MPC) was opted for quadrotor control to track the generated trajectory in time reference with the rejection of disturbance. The solution presents a soft mechanism for flat surface landing similar to human decision concept and control. The proposed method ensures absorption of the shock of impact, and the optimal tracking of the moving landing pad at less than 4 cm of error in Cartesian coordinates. Experimental results from pad relative pose estimation developed in Python, Data fusion experimentation of Attitude and Heading Reference system (AHRS), and Matlab simulations with a performance comparison between MPC and Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed landing task solution.

AB While ride-hailing has become ubiquitous in most metropolitan areas, it is still unclear how it prevails in the regional areas, especially after the emergence of new services of pooling or self driving rides. This paper contributes to this knowledge gap by examining the regional/metropolitan dimension in the factors influencing the frequency of ride-hailing use and the demand for pooled and autonomous vehicle (AV) rides in Australia. Through individual-level survey data, we found that there is indeed a divide between factors affecting not only the frequency of using ride hailing in the status quo but also in the future adoption of new services of pooled and AV-based services. Using the hybrid discrete choice model, we identify several latent psychological constructs that influence the use of ride-hailing services, namely being pro-technology, pro-pooling, pro-AV, anti-driving and security-cautious traits. Moreover, the results of multivariate models point to different observed and latent characteristics influencing the adoption of pooled and AV ride-hailing services for various trip purposes. In line with the literature, it was found that the socio-demographic characteristics that affect the frequency of use or adopting pooled and AV services in future include gender, age, income, education attainment, employment status, car ownership, and the current travel behaviour. We also found that ride-hailing in Australia has played more as a substitution role for public transport, private car and taxi than as a complementary role or feeder of the public transport system, both in the metropolitan and regional areas.

AB Maneuver decision-making and trajectory planning play important roles in autonomous driving since a safe and flexible decision module is indispensable for navigation. Typical algorithms apply sampling methods to generate feasible trajectories. However, the fixed sampling distance and maneuver execution time in a sampling approach sacrifice the flexibility of algorithm. Moreover, since motion planning can be represented as a high-dimensional problem, it usually results in unnecessary samples that require additional resources to search the solution. Therefore, a semantic-level maneuver sampling and trajectory planning algorithm is proposed to solve the above problems. In the upper-level maneuver decision, the decision-making problem is formulated as a selection of the forward leading object. A semantic-level decision tree is built to sample long-term maneuver sequences, and the safety corridor of each maneuver sequence is calculated according to the surrounding environment. In the lower-level trajectory planning, the process is decoupled into longitudinal and lateral directions. First, a heuristic search method is proposed to generate longitudinal trajectory candidates for each maneuver sequence. Then, an exhaustive search algorithm is employed to synchronously generate the lateral trajectory within safety corridor. Among the generated trajectory candidates, the one with minimum cost will be chosen as the searching result. Furthermore, in order to improve the driving comfort, numerical optimization is adopted to refine the result by accounting for the constraints of kinematics and safety. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated through simulations of typical on-road dynamic scenarios, which help verify its performance with desirable computation efficiency of less than 32 ms.

AB Wireless multihop infrastructures (WMIs) are promising network platforms that facilitate applications, such as smart cities, emergency responses, and outdoor events. WMIs can allow coverage over large areas with low setup and maintenance overheads. However, WMIs may be susceptible to loss of network connectivity caused by node damage or energy depletion. The end-to-end reachability is essential for the WMI to provide network service to users. This paper studies the problem of network self-recovery to sustain reachability in a WMI network by utilizing autonomous mobile base stations (MBSs). It is assumed that MBS is able to move to and pause or stop at positions in the network area. An MBS could be a self-driving robotic vehicle, or vehicle driven directly or remotely by a human. The proposed MBS approach, MBS-Fit, is a distributed and packet-interaction-based mechanism that allows MBS to automatically construct new routes, assess, and adaptively respond to the fitness of pause positions, such that MBS can provide links to recover the disconnected WMIs. We adopt packet-level evaluation to study the automatic interactions of MBS with the static WMI objects. In particular, the network reachability is measured by the amount of packets successfully delivered from users to the gateway through the WMI. Simulation results reveal that the proposed MBS-Fit approach achieves up to 30% improvement of network reachability in terms of successfully packet delivery compared with the conventional MBS. MBS-Fit mechanism also enables up to 80% improvement in terms of number of packets forwarded at MBS.

AB With the growth of sensing, control and robotic technologies, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have become useful assistants to human divers for performing various underwater operations. In the current practice, the divers are required to carry expensive, bulky, and waterproof keyboards or joystick-based controllers for the supervision and control of AUVs. Therefore, diver action-based supervision is becoming increasingly popular because it is convenient, easier to use, faster, and cost effective. However, various environmental, diver, and sensing uncertainties make the underwater diver action recognition problem challenging. In this regard, this paper presents DARE, a diver action recognition encoder, which is robust to underwater uncertainties and classifies various diver actions including sixteen gestures and three poses with high accuracy. DARE is based on the fusion of stereo-pairs of underwater camera images using bi-channel convolutional layers for feature extraction followed by a systematically designed decision tree of neural network classifiers. DARE is trained using the Cognitive Autonomous Diving Buddy (CADDY) dataset, which consists of a rich set of images of different diver actions in real underwater environments. DARE requires only a few milliseconds to classify one stereo-pair, thus making it suitable for real-time implementation. The results show that DARE achieves up to 95.87% overall accuracy and 92% minimum class accuracy, thus verifying its robustnesss and reliability. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation against existing deep transfer learning architectures reveals that DARE improves the performance of baseline classifiers by up to 3.44% in the overall accuracy and 30% in the minimum class accuracy.

AB With a view to road safety education and accident prevention, the study of the interaction between autonomous cars and pedestrians cannot be postponed until actual introduction in the public space. In this study, we proactively investigate road-crossing decisions in virtual reality. The objective is to determine the influence of message content displayed by autonomous cars on road crossing decisions and feeling of safety. Focus groups resulted in two different message contents: information about the speed of the car and advice about desired behaviour (pedestrian traffic light). In a virtual reality study, the two message contents were compared to a gear-only control condition and to a human-operated car. The procedure involved 24 crossing decisions in road configurations varying in the likelihood of crossing according to traffic rules. The results showed that road crossing behaviour in virtual reality complied with the likelihood of crossing according to traffic rules (pedestrian rule compliance). Furthermore, as expected, we found an interaction between the type of car and message content in underdetermined road crossing situations. Positive crossings decisions were the least frequent in front of autonomous cars in the pedestrian traffic light (advice) condition. Thus, advice as message content generates cautious pedestrian road crossing behaviour. Finally, the results show a high feeling of safety except when pedestrian traffic lights were absent (present neither as object in the road configuration nor as message content). The results and implications for road safety education are discussed.

ID IMPLEMENTATION
AB Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) interactions with powerlines, such as close-up inspections for fault detection or grasping and landing for recharging, require advanced onboard perception capabilities. To solve such tasks, the UAV must be equipped with perception abilities that allow it to navigate between powerlines and safely approach specific cables of interest. A perception system with such capabilities requires state-of-the-art sensor technologies and data processing while still being subject to the limited hardware and energy resources of the UAV. In this paper, we present an advanced embedded system based on the cutting-edge Multiprocessing System-on-Chip (MPSoC) for onboard UAV powerline perception. Our platform consists of a mmWave radar and an RGB camera with data processing carried out on the MPSoC, covering both CPU and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) computations. Following hardware-software co-design methodology, the heavy image processing tasks are accelerated in the FPGA and fused with computationally light mmWave data on the CPU, facilitating pose-estimation of the power lines. Utilizing the open-source autonomy frameworks PX4 and ROS2, we demonstrate integration of the system with onboard path planning based on the estimated cable positions. The robustness of the detection and pose-estimation methods have been demonstrated in several tests performed both in simulated and real-world powerline environments. The results show that our proposed perception system allows the UAV to safely navigate in close proximity to powerlines, by perceiving more individual cables at longer distances compared to previous work, while remaining lightweight, power-efficient, and low-cost.

AB The origins and effects of wave drag at and near the surface and in shallow water are discussed in terms of the dispersive waves generated by streamlined technical bodies of revolution and by semi-aquatic and aquatic animals with a view to bearing on issues regarding the design and function of autonomous surface and underwater vehicles. A simple two-dimensional model based on energy flux, allowing assessment of drag and its associated wave amplitude, is applied to surface swimming in Lesser Scaup ducks and is in good agreement with measured values. It is argued that hydrodynamic limitations to swimming at speeds associated with the critical Froude number (approximate to 0.5) and hull speed do not necessarily set biological limitations as most behaviours occur well below the hull speed. From a comparative standpoint, the need for studies on the hull displacement of different forms is emphasized. For forms in surface proximity, drag is a function of both Froude and Reynolds numbers. Whilst the depth dependence of wave drag is not particularly sensitive to Reynolds number, its magnitude is, with smaller and slower forms subject to relatively less drag augmentation than larger, faster forms that generate additional resistance due to ventilation and spray. A quasi-steady approach to the hydrodynamics of swimming in shallow water identifies substantial drag increases relative to the deeply submerged case at Froude numbers of about 0.9 that could limit the performance of semi-aquatic and aquatic animals and autonomous vehicles. A comparative assessment of fast-starting trout and upside down catfish shows that the energy losses of fast-starting fish are likely to be less for fish in surface proximity in deep water than for those in shallow water. Further work on unsteady swimming in both circumstances is encouraged. Finally, perspectives are offered as to how autonomous surface and underwater vehicles in surface proximity and shallow water could function to avoid prohibitive hydrodynamic resistance, thereby increasing their operational life.

AB Autonomous vehicles represent a significant development in our society, and their acceptance will largely depend on trust. This study investigates strategies to increase trust and acceptance by making the cars' decisions. For this purpose, we created a virtual reality (VR) experiment with a self-explaining autonomous car, providing participants with verbal cues about crucial traffic decisions. First, we investigated attitudes toward self-driving cars among 7850 participants using a simplified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. Results revealed that female participants are less accepting than male participants, and that there is a general decline among all genders. Otherwise in general, a self-explaining car has a positive impact on trust and perceived usefulness. Surprisingly, it adversely affected the intention to use and perceived ease of use. This entails dissociation of trust from the other items of the questionnaire. Second, we analyzed behavioral of 26 750 participants to investigate the effect of self-explaining systems on head movements during the VR drive. We observed significant differences in head movements during the critical events and the baseline periods of the drive between the three driving conditions. Additionally, we demonstrated positive correlations between head movement parameters and the TAM scores, where trust showed the lowest correlation. This provides further evidence of the dissociation of trust from other TAM items. These findings illustrate the benefits of combining subjective questionnaire data with objective behavioral data. Overall, the outcomes indicate a partial dissociation of self-reported trust from intention to use and objective behavioral data.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles are improving and expanding in situ observations of sea ice for the validation of satellite remote sensing and climate models. Missions under sea ice, particularly over large distances (up to 100 km) away from the immediate vicinity of a ship or base, require accurate acoustic communication for monitoring, emergency response and some navigation systems. We investigate the propagation of acoustic signals in the Antarctic seasonal ice zone using the BELLHOP model, examining the influence of ocean and sea ice properties. We processed available observations from around Antarctica to generate input variables such as sound speed, surface reflection coefficient (R) and roughness parameters. The results show that changes in the sound speed profile make the most significant difference to the propagation of the direct path signal. The inclusion of the surface reflected signals from a flat ice surface was found to greatly decrease the transmission loss with range. When ice roughness was added, the transmission loss increased with roughness, in a manner similar to the direct path transmission loss results. The conclusions of this work are that: (1) the accuracy of acoustic modelling in this environment is greatly increased by using realistic sound speed data; (2) a risk averse ranging model would use only the direct path signal transmission; and (3) in a flat ice scenario, much greater ranges can be achieved if the surface reflected transmission paths are included. As autonomous missions under sea ice increase in scale and complexity, it will be increasingly important for operational procedures to include effective modelling of acoustic propagation with representative environmental data.

AB BackgroundBiologging studies have revealed a wealth of information about the spatio-temporal movements of a wide range of vertebrates large enough to carry electronic tracking tags. Advances in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs or UAVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (commonly known as drones), which can carry far larger payloads of sensor technologies, have revealed insights into the environment through which animals travel. Some AUVs have been used to film target animals, but are generally limited to periods as long as a drone operator can actively follow an animal. In the present study, we use an AUV, the REMUS-100 SharkCam, paired with a custom transponder tag attached to the shark, to autonomously follow three basking sharks for a cumulative total of 10.9 h to collect video and environmental data on their sub-surface behaviour. The basking shark is the second largest fish in the world and is endangered globally, but despite being subject to various biologging studies, little is known of this species breeding ecology and their mating grounds remain unknown.ResultsWe detail the first successful autonomous tracking of basking sharks, comprising three missions that filmed basking sharks in mid-water and close to benthic habitats. Sharks spent very little time feeding, and travelled relatively close to sandy, rocky and algae-covered benthos. One basking shark was observed defecating. Conspecifics were not observed in the three missions, nor were courtship or breeding behaviours. AUV offset distances for videography were determined iteratively through tracking. These offsets varied depending on the trade-off of between water clarity and proximity of the AUV for obtaining useful video data and directly influencing shark behaviour.ConclusionsThe present study is the first successful use of an AUV to gain insight into the sub-surface behaviour of basking sharks.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) is expected to be the ultimate solution for traffic safety, while autonomous emergency braking (AEB), as a crucial and fundamental active safety function of AV, has excellent potential for reducing fatalities and improving road safety. Although AV has the ability to cope with harsh conditions, it is supposed to be tested fully, systematically, and rigorously before it is officially commercialized. This study developed a novel indoor AV-in-the-loop (AVIL) simulation platform based on Client-Server (C/S) architecture for real full-scale AV testing. The proposed AVIL simulation platform consists of three parts: physical hardware components, software components, and various electrical interfaces that ensure the bidirectional virtual reality (VR) interaction. To validate the functionality and performance of the platform, this paper then adopted the Udwadia-Kalaba (U-K) approach to build the AEB system based on a typical driving situation due to the explicitness and simplicity of the U-K approach. Further, a group of real road-based experiments and AVIL-based experiments were conducted. The experimental results showed that the testing data obtained from the proposed AVIL platform have a high similarity to those of the real road tests, which means that the proposed AVIL platform is capable of simulating the AV running condition when it performs linear emergency braking on the road, thus confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the AVIL platform for AV AEB testing. Simultaneously, the testing time and repeatability of the latter performed better. The findings of this study provide a new safe, effective, and fast solution to AV testing, and the practicability of this method has been verified.

DE Multi-agent system; formation control; pattern formation; Lagrangian
   swarm; Lyapunov stability
AB A biological swarm is an ideal multi-agent system that collectively self-organizes into bounded, if not stable, formations. A mathematical model, developed appropriately from some principle of swarming, should enable one, therefore, to study formation strategies for multiple autonomous robots. In this article, based on the hypothesis that swarming is an interplay between long-range attraction and short-range repulsion between the individuals in the swarm, a planar individual-based or Lagrangian swarm model is constructed using the Direct Method of Lyapunov. While attraction ensures the swarm is cohesive, meaning that the individuals in the swarm remain close to each other at all times, repulsion ensures that the swarm is well-spaced, meaning that no two individuals in the swarm occupy the same space at the same time. Via a novel Lyapunov-like function with attractive and repulsive components, the article establishes the global existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of solutions about the centroid. This paves the way to prove that the swarm model, governed by a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), is cohesive and well-spaced. The article goes on to show that the artificial swarm can collectively self-organize into two stable formations: (i) a constant arrangement about the centroid when the system has equilibrium points, and (ii) a highly parallel formation when the system does not have equilibrium points. Computer simulations not only illustrate these but also reveal other emergent patterns such as swirling structures and random-like walks. As an application, we tailor the model accordingly and propose new autonomous steering laws giving rise to pattern-forming for multiple nonholonomic car-like vehicles.

AB path planning in the space of multinominals integrated into a model predictive control mechanism for driving formations of autonomous mobile robots is presented in this paper. The proposed approach is designed to stabilize the formations in desired shapes, and to navigate the group into a final position in a partly known environment with dynamic obstacles. In addition, the system provides inter-vehicle coordination and collision avoidance in the event of failure of a team member. The method is aimed at reaching the final position of the formation in the desired shape, but it enables to change temporarily this shape if it is enforced by the environment (in narrow corridors, on response to an impending collision with obstacles and faulty team members, etc.). This autonomous emergent behaviour increases the robustness of the system and its usability. It enables a proper compromise to be found between the formation driving requirement and the effort to fulfil the mission objective, i.e., to move the group from the current state into the required position. In this paper, the convergence of the method and the requirements for stability are shown on the basis of the results of the Lyapunov theorems of stability. These theoretical achievements imply constraints on the applicability of the system, which are verified in numerical simulations and in various tests with real autonomous robots. The performances of the entire system and of independent sub-systems in various formation driving scenarios are also shown in these tests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents a robust optimal output-tracking control strategy for underactuated mechanical systems whose motion is restricted by mixed holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. Autonomous rovers/cars and unmanned underwater/aerial vehicles are a few examples of such systems that must often operate in harsh environments and under uncertain conditions. We present a comprehensive control analysis of this large class of nonlinear systems, including the existing studies on local reachability and static state feedback linearization. We also propose a local observability analysis of the feedback transformed input-output linearized systems. Based on the input-output linearization of the holonomically restricted nominal system, we develop a sliding mode control strategy that is robust against the projected effects of uncertainties and disturbances on the system's output. Asymptotic stability of the output toward a bounded desired trajectory is proven using Lyapunov's direct method, while the system's internal stability (in the sense of boundedness) is investigated based on the notion of tracking-error zero dynamics. Time-dependent bounded matched uncertainties in the inertia parameters and disturbance forces arising in the unrestricted system are considered in this study. We propose an optimal sliding manifold according to the finite-horizon linear-quadratic regulator design problem with split boundary value conditions. The developed control strategy is implemented on a six-wheel autonomous Lunar rover in a simulation environment and its performance is compared with that of an optimal proportional-integral-derivative feedback, feedforward controller. The optimal sliding mode controller shows superior performance in trajectory tracking with acceptable control actions.

AB We consider the social dilemma related to the trolley problem in ethics regarding the driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle (AV) when there are passengers in the AV and pedestrians on the street. To investigate the optimal driving behaviors in different concepts of values, we introduce a general social welfare function (SWF) into our model that encompasses the three types of Bentham- (rho = 0), Nash- (rho -> 1), and Rawls-type (rho -> infinity) SWFs as a special case. Parameter rho is key and represents the inequality aversion. We first demonstrate that the optimal solution continuously and monotonically moves from rho = 0 to rho -> infinity. This result implies that the optimal solutions involving the Bentham- and Rawls-type SWFs are extreme (maximum or minimum value) solutions, whereas solutions involving the Nash-type SWF can be intermediate. Although some empirical studies have stated that it is better for a policymaker or AV manufacturer to employ Benthamism, our results suggest that care should be applied when choosing a driving behavior. Second, if the total utility of the passengers (or pedestrians) at the optimum is relatively large, our results indicate that the AV will likely go straight and hit the pedestrians (or swerve and crash into a wall) as rho increases (or decreases). Finally, we discuss the applicability of our results in controlling AVs worldwide. We confirm that setting rho = 0 is preferred in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and some Western European countries, whereas setting rho > 0 is preferred in some African and Asian countries, such as China, India, and Japan.

TI Autonomous Sampling of Ocean Submesoscale Fronts with Ocean Gliders and
   Numerical Model Forecasting

AB Submesoscale fronts arising from mesoscale stirring are ubiquitous in the ocean and have a strong impact on upper-ocean dynamics. This work presents a method for optimizing the sampling of ocean fronts with autonomous vehicles at meso-and submesoscales, based on a combination of numerical forecast and autonomous planning. This method uses a 48-h forecast from a real-time high-resolution data-assimilative primitive equation ocean model, feature detection techniques, and a planner that controls the observing platform. The method is tested in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California, during a 9-day experiment focused on sampling subsurface thermohaline-compensated structures using a Seaglider as the ocean observing platform. Based on model estimations, the sampling "gain,'' defined as the magnitude of isopycnal tracer variability sampled, is 50% larger in the feature-chasing case with respect to a non-feature-tracking scenario. The ability of the model to reproduce, in space and time, thermohaline submesoscale features is evaluated by quantitatively comparing the model and glider results. The model reproduces the vertical (similar to 50-200 m thick) and lateral (similar to 5-20 km) scales of subsurface subducting fronts and near-bottom features observed in the glider data. The differences between model and glider data are, in part, attributed to the selected glider optimal interpolation parameters and to uncertainties in the forecasting of the location of the structures. This method can be exported to any place in the ocean where high-resolution data-assimilative model output is available, and it allows for the incorporation of multiple observing platforms.

AB Vehicular communication and sensing technologies are key to enabling 6G Intelligent Autonomous Transportation Systems (IATS). With the introduction of massive sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) fusion applications, IATS is needed to support data transmission rates up to 10 Gb/s. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology has attracted extensive attention owing to abundant spectrum resources, which can support the timely transmission of massive data. However, performance degradation of mmWave due to signal blockage has become one of the critical technical challenges. Road bridges as one of the common obstacles in urban scenarios, which has severe blockage effects on communication links. Therefore, this paper comprehensively studies the impact of road bridge blockage effects on mmWave vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links and proposes an empirical model that can accurately characterize the bridge blockage effect. First, we use a self-developed mmWave channel sounder to carry out channel measurements on typical urban roads. Measurement results indicate that a maximum extra propagation loss of up to 23 dB is caused by road bridges. In addition, to address the deficiencies of existing propagation prediction models, the Single Road Bridge (SRB) model is proposed in this work. This model reveals for the first time the extra propagation loss caused by the road bridge to the channel. Compared with existing models, the SRB model can make the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) within 5 dB. The proposed SRB model is of great value for accurately simulating real-world road bridge blockage events when designing future IATS.

AB Aerial manipulators have the unique ability to cover wide-spread areas within a single mission, making them ideal for the transport and placement of sensors required to build an instrumented environment. Recent work in the field has focused on controllers for aerial interaction that account for compliance during contact-based tasks, omitting integration concerns that are critical to an automated solution. Furthermore, state-of-the-art flying base manipulators are often mechanically and computationally complex, reducing their endurance. Within this work, we present an interactive framework for autonomous sensor placement that incorporates both mechanical and software based compliance, optimised for use on a simple coplanar quadrotor. Under appropriate actuation and perception constraints, we detail the development of a control, perception, and motion planning strategy to enable sensor placement that relies solely on onboard computation and sensing, thus presenting a fully contained and accessible sensor placement approach capable of robust interaction with the environment. An extended finite-state machine is developed to facilitate automated mission planning. Extensive flight experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of each sub-system, as well as the integrated solution. Experiments result in trajectory tracking errors under 10 mm as well as onboard mass estimation errors under 0.7 % for sensors of various weights. A statistical analysis of 162 flight experiments shows the proposed framework's ability to autonomously place sensors within 10 cm of the target with a success rate of 93.8 % and 95 % confidence interval of (89%, 97%), thus confirming the robustness of our approach.

AB Thanks to their high carrying capacity and strong maneuverability, carlike robots which move with non-holonomic constraints, are frequently utilized in numerous coverage operation fields. In such fields, the robots need to complete the coverage task via autonomous path planning and tracking, which is referred to as a "Coverage Navigation for Carlike Robots" (CNCR) problem. When it comes to CNCR, two folds of challenges are put forward as follows. On one hand, the local path planner should not only consider the non-holonomic constraints of carlike robots but also should meet the high coverage rate required by the coverage task. On the other hand, during CNCR, there must be many U-turns in narrow areas. As a result, Reeds-Shepp-type paths will be planned inevitably. Tracking this sort of multi-segment paths stably is also an urgent problem to be solved in CNCR. To this end, this letter introduces a reference line constraint and a heuristic initialization strategy along with a cubic parametric path smoother to the time elastic band planner and designs a multi-segment-supported path tracker. Experimental results show that the proposed path planner largely reduces the average deviation off the reference line and obtains a high success rate even in complex environments. Besides, the designed path tracker achieves stable and high-precision tracking for multi-segment paths. Real-world experiments reveal that the proposed path planner and tracker are fully competent for CNCR, rendering our sweeping robot to attain an actual average coverage rate of 92.21%. To make our results fully reproducible, relevant codes and data are made available online at https://github.com/csLinZhang/cncr.git.

AB Cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) have recently gained attention from researchers due to their combination of cyber, physical, and social spaces. Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems (MARTE) is a Unified Modeling Language (UML) extension profile that supports the specification, design, and verification of Real-Time Embedded Systems (RTES). While MARTE Statecharts can assist in describing CPS, it does not model the uncertainty within a CPSS environment. To enhance the accuracy of CPSS analysis, we propose the stohMCharts (stochastic hybrid MARTE statecharts) modelling framework as an extension of MARTE statecharts for modelling and analyzing stochastic hybrid systems. stohMCharts can model CPSS in a unified manner. Additionally, based on the mapping rules and algorithms, we have developed a tool to convert models built in stohMChart language into Networks Stochastic Hybrid Automata (NSHA) which can be verified by statistical model checker UPPAAL-SMC. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the framework by applying it to one autonomous driving scenarios.

ID ROBOTIC MANIPULATORS
AB Uncertain characteristics along with unknown exterior disturbances are fundamental issues in the path-following control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). Here, a novel robust non-singular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) control method based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) structure is proposed to enhance the path-following performance of AGVs. First, based on the dynamic model and path-following model of AGVs, the robust NTSM steering controller is proposed to ensure that the lateral offset converges to zero within a limited time, and concurrently suppresses the chattering phenomenon that occurs in the regular sliding mode control (SMC) strategy. Then, the RNN is applied to approximate the unknown dynamics section of the system online. With an implied feedback loop, its study ability precedes the regular neural network to catch up with the dynamic response. In addition, the adaptive learning algorithms of the parameters in the RNN are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem and Taylor linearisation technique to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control approach against parametric uncertainties and unknown external disturbances are verified in the Simulink-CarSim simulation platform by comparison with selected reported control methods.

TI A Real-Time Object Detector for Autonomous Vehicles Based on YOLOv4
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Object detection is an important part of autonomous driving technology. To ensure the safe running of vehicles at high speed, real-time and accurate detection of all the objects on the road is required. How to balance the speed and accuracy of detection is a hot research topic in recent years. This paper puts forward a one-stage object detection algorithm based on YOLOv4, which improves the detection accuracy and supports real-time operation. The backbone of the algorithm doubles the stacking times of the last residual block of CSPDarkNet53. The neck of the algorithm replaces the SPP with the RFB structure, improves the PAN structure of the feature fusion module, adds the attention mechanism CBAM and CA structure to the backbone and neck structure, and finally reduces the overall width of the network to the original 3/4, so as to reduce the model parameters and improve the inference speed. Compared with YOLOv4, the algorithm in this paper improves the average accuracy on KITTI dataset by 2.06% and BDD dataset by 2.95%. When the detection accuracy is almost unchanged, the inference speed of this algorithm is increased by 9.14%, and it can detect in real time at a speed of more than 58.47 FPS.

AB Wave-propelled boats utilize submerged flapping foils to convert wave energy directly into propulsion. For platforms that are solely propelled using submerged flapping foils, predicting the forward speed is challenging as it is time varying and dependent on the coupled responses of the wave-induced hull motions (surge, heave, and pitch) and the foil flapping motion (driven by the wave-induced hull motions and incident wavy flow). To ascertain the free-running response of wave-propelled boats, this article presents a hybrid discrete time-domain numerical model and experimental results from a prototype wave-propelled autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with forward and aft (tandem) flapping foils. Results from a series of free-running experiments in regular head waves, over a range of wave frequencies for three different foil locations, are presented and used to validate the numerical model. The model was found to show good agreement with the experimental results, capturing the coupled dynamics of the vessel and foils and oscillating forward speed, over a range of wave frequencies and foil locations. The model and results provide a valuable insight for the design of wave-propelled boats.

AB Agent behavior is arguably the greatest source of uncertainty in trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles. This problem has motivated significant amounts of work in the behavior prediction community on learning rich distributions of the future states and actions of agents. However, most current works on chance-constrained trajectory planning under agent or obstacle uncertainty either assume Gaussian uncertainty or linear constraints, which is limiting, or requires sampling, which can be computationally intractable to encode in an optimization problem. In this letter, we extend the state-of-the-art by presenting a methodology to upper-bound chance-constraints defined by polynomials and mixture models with potentially non-Gaussian components. Our method achieves its generality by using statistical moments of the distributions in concentration inequalities to upper-bound the probability of constraint violation. With this method, optimization-based trajectory planners can plan trajectories that are chance-constrained with respect to a wide range of distributions representing predictions of agent future positions. In experiments, we show that the resulting optimization problem can be solved with state-of-the-art nonlinear program solvers to plan trajectories fast enough for use online.

AB Cloud computing offers a simple way to provide access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet. Its popularity is growing spectacularly. Consequently, there is a need for strong authentication schemes, offering besides data privacy also identity privacy during these actions. Therefore, this paper presents 2 user-friendly protocols, called the autonomous, anonymous, and authenticationAAA1 and AAA2schemes, able to derive the required security material at user's side without the need of a secure channel between user and registration center. The protocol AAA2 has the added functionality to guarantee unforgeability and non-repudiation of the request. Only simple elliptic curve operations, together with hashes and symmetric key encryptions are used. The proposed protocols are 2-factor based, requiring the knowledge of the password and the possession of a correctly installed smartphone, and are very efficient to be executed on the smartphone because of a small amount of computations. As an application, we show how AAA1 can be utilized in a communication protocol for monitoring and AAA2 for charging and discharging of electrical vehicles with the smart grid. Moreover, these proposed solutions allow a much better performance, compared with the state of the art protocols in this field.

AB The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Autosub-2 was deployed on eight missions ahead of RRS James Clark Ross in the northern Weddell Sea and in the Bransfield Strait, Southern Ocean, to assess avoidance of the research vessel by Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. The AUV was equipped with the same type of scientific echosounder as the research vessel (Simrad EK500 operating at 38 and 120 kHz) and measured the density of krill along transect acoustically (g m(-2) wet mass) prior to the ship's arrival. We hypothesised that if krill avoided the ship, perhaps in response to radiated noise, then the ship should detect less krill than the AUV which is known to have much lower noise levels than the ship. We were unable to detect any significant difference between the density of krill detected by the ship or the AUV, either at the transect level or at finer scales within transects. We conclude, therefore, that avoidance by krill of RRS James Clark Ross will not significantly bias acoustic estimates of krill abundance by this vessel. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Objectives: Automatic emergency braking (AEB) is a proven effective countermeasure for preventing front-to-rear crashes, but it has not yet fully lived up to its estimated potential. This study identified the types of rear-end crashes in which striking vehicles with AEB are overrepresented to determine whether the system is more effective in some situations than in others, so that additional opportunities for increasing AEB effectiveness might be explored. Methods: Rear-end crash involvements were extracted from 23 U.S. states during 2009-2016 for striking passenger vehicles with and without AEB among models where the system was optional. Logistic regression was used to examine the odds that rear-end crashes with various characteristics involved a striking vehicle with AEB, controlling for driver and vehicle features. Results: Striking vehicles were significantly more likely to have AEB in crashes where the striking vehicle was turning relative to when it was moving straight (odds ratio [OR] = 2.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76, 3.13); when the struck vehicle was turning (OR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.25, 2.21) or changing lanes (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.13, 3.72) relative to when it was slowing or stopped; when the struck vehicle was not a passenger vehicle or was a special use vehicle relative to a car (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.01, 2.55); on snowy or icy roads relative to dry roads (OR = 1.83; 95% CI, 1.16, 2.86); or on roads with speed limits of 70+ mph relative to those with 40 to 45 mph speed limits (OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.10, 2.03). Overall, 25.3% of crashes where the striking vehicle had AEB had at least one of these overrepresented characteristics, compared with 15.9% of strikes by vehicles without AEB. Conclusions: The typical rear-end crash occurs when 2 passenger vehicles are proceeding in line, on a dry road, and at lower speeds. Because atypical crash circumstances are overrepresented among rear-end crashes by striking vehicles with AEB, it appears that the system is doing a better job of preventing the more typical crash scenario. Consumer information testing programs of AEB use a test configuration that models the typical rear-end crash type. Testing programs promoting good AEB performance in crash circumstances where vehicles with AEB are overrepresented could guide future development of AEB systems that perform well in these additional rear-end collision scenarios.

It employs the state-of-the-art Microcontroller based embedded system to govern the comprehensive requirements in accordance with the changes that the vehicle either experiences or becomes necessary for it to negotiate. The design involves the bounding of the parameters that include the vehicle speed, engine speed, battery SoC (State of Charge), battery SoH (State of Health), a real time GPS navigator along with Edge/ Boundary Detection Algorithm which enters the system using ZigBee enabled wireless sensors and IoT based maps to incorporate the lane control system. It primarily ensures a close monitoring methodology to develop a sequence of steps that allow the system to remain in operation over scheduled durations. The procedure involves a simulation process carried out using embedded-c firmware code to epitomize the virtues of the proposed scheme and elicit the performance of the chosen vehicle in terms of its ability to operate at the predefined constraints.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is an effective method for motion planning of automated vehicles, but the high computational load of numerical optimization limits its practical application. This paper designs an NMPC based motion planner and presents two techniques, named adaptive Lagrange discretization and hybrid obstacle avoidance constraints, to accelerate the numerical optimization by reducing the optimization variables and simplifying the non-convex constraints. Given the high nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics, the Lagrange interpolation is adopted to convert the state equation of vehicle dynamics and the objective function to ensure a preset accuracy but with less discretization points. An adaptive strategy is then designed to adjust the order of Lagrange polynomials based on the distribution of discretization error. Moreover, a hybrid strategy is presented to construct the constraints for obstacle avoidance by combing the elliptic and linear time-varying methods together. It can ensure driving safety and also make a good balance between computing load and accuracy. The performance of these techniques on accelerating the NMPC based motion planner is validated and analyzed by comparative numerical simulations and experimental tests under various scenarios. Compared with traditional methods, the results show that these techniques improve accuracy and efficiency by 74% and 60%, respectively.

AB Nowadays, vehicles are involved deeply in human life, especially for passengers and goods transportation, and along with technological advancements, the autonomous car becomes one of the most concerning issues. With the aim of management and control, many kinds of sensors are situated in different parts of the vehicle to ensure safe and reliable driving, but they also drain out more power from the electric circuit. In this work, a rotational switched-mode water-based triboelectric nanogenerator (RSW-TENG) as battery-free device is demonstrated, in which its capability of converting rotational kinetic energy into electricity and detecting the road slope as well as the wheel speed is carefully investigated. The spatial relation between water and electrodes during operation has a great effect on the electrical outputs of RSW-TENG where they represent a negative proportional relationship with the slope angle ranging from 0 degrees to 80 degrees; meanwhile, a positive proportional relationship with rotational speed is observed instead. The practical evaluation with a prototype of vehicle wheel attached RSW-TENG is implemented, and it exhibits a reliable and accurate performance under different inclinations and driving speeds. These results point out that the RSW-TENG could be an appropriate selection for monitoring and enhancing driving safety. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MODEL
AB Merging at highway on-ramps while interacting with other human-driven vehicles is challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs). An efficient route to this challenge requires exploring and exploiting knowledge of the interaction process from demonstrations by humans. However, it is unclear what information (or environmental states) is utilized by the human driver to guide their behavior throughout the whole merging process. This paper provides quantitative analysis and evaluation of the merging behavior at highway on-ramps with congested traffic in a volume of time and space. Two types of social interaction scenarios are considered based on the social preferences of surrounding vehicles: courteous and rude. The significant levels of environmental states for characterizing the interactive merging process are empirically analyzed based on the real-world INTERACTION dataset. Experimental results reveal two fundamental mechanisms in the merging process: 1) Human drivers select different states to make sequential decisions at different moments of task execution; and 2) the social preference of surrounding vehicles can impact variable selection for making decisions. It implies that efficient decision-making design should filter out irrelevant information while considering social preference to achieve comparable human-level performance. These essential findings shed light on developing new decision-making approaches for AVs.

AB The high demand and acute timeliness that characterizes instant delivery entail the challenges of high labor costs and an increase in courier traffic accidents. Autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) may serve as a key solution, with their attendant reduced labor input and higher efficiency. Customers play a key role in the successful implementation of ADVs on a large scale. However, understanding the factors that affect customers' intentions to use ADVs is still limited. Compared to autonomous driving, ADV customers are ultimately not the real users, who only are served by ADVs during the last leg of a trip. On account of this, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) may not be well-fitted for explaining the dynamics involved in ADV adoption. Within the context of ADVs, our study identified influencing factors that have not been captured by prior studies. This study incorporates infection risk, use experience, and social awkwardness into the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory to explore customers' intentions to use ADVs. Data from 691 survey respondents were collected to validate the research design. The results demonstrate that compatibility, social influence, infection risk, green image, social awkwardness, and use experience all have a significantly positive impact on customers' intentions to adopt ADV services, while complexity and perceived risk both exhibited a negative impact. But no effect could be found for relative advantage, which may be because of the fact that customers only need ADVs to meet their delivery demand. This study contributes to understanding customers' adoption intentions toward ADVs, informing policymakers in formulating ADV regulations and standards, and promoting the large-scale application of ADVs in instant delivery services.

AB Focusing on the task of point-to-point navigation for an autonomous driving vehicle, we propose a novel deep learning model trained with end-to-end and multi-task learning manners to perform both perception and control tasks simultaneously. The model is used to drive the ego vehicle safely by following a sequence of routes defined by the global planner. The perception part of the model is used to encode high-dimensional observation data provided by an RGBD camera while performing semantic segmentation, semantic depth cloud (SDC) mapping, and traffic light state and stop sign prediction. Then, the control part decodes the encoded features along with additional information provided by GPS and speedometer to predict waypoints that come with a latent feature space. Furthermore, two agents are employed to process these outputs and make a control policy that determines the level of steering, throttle, and brake as the final action. The model is evaluated on CARLA simulator with various scenarios made of normal-adversarial situations and different weathers to mimic real-world conditions. In addition, we do a comparative study with some recent models to justify the performance in multiple aspects of driving. Moreover, we also conduct an ablation study on SDC mapping and multi-agent to understand their roles and behavior. As a result, our model achieves the highest driving score even with fewer parameters and computation load. To support future studies, we share our codes at https://github.com/oskarnatan/end-to-end-driving.

AB This paper proposed a data-driven bi-pattern (DDBP) path planning algorithm for ocean geomorphological surveys based on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). When an AUV conducts surveys in unknown areas, it uses the observation data of real-time side-scan sonar to conduct environment modeling to drive independent online path re-planning (PRP) according to the feature density of the interesting targets. Based on the DDBP algorithm, the AUV can autonomously focus on regions with rich target distribution and deviate from regions with sparse target distribution without prior knowledge of the task region. The quality and efficiency of the AUV-based surveys can be improved by focusing on the underwater detection area with high feature density. The DDBP algorithm includes two patterns: rough and fine scan, and the corresponding planning pattern is selected according to the distribution of the detected targets. AUV performs online PRP in the corresponding pattern according to the pre-identified strategy set. We conducted simulation experiments and selected sand waves and fish reefs as natural and artificial structures to conduct typical marine survey tests. Compared with the traditional marine survey method, the survey efficiency was increased by 33.6% and 29.6%, respectively, in the two DDBP survey experiments for sand waves; the efficiency increased by 32.9% and 36.7%, respectively, in the two groups of DDBP survey experiments on artificial reefs. The proposed general technical framework for online path planning driven by real-time observation data has good application prospects in underwater archaeology, rapid understanding of specific targets on the seafloor, and search of specific targets.

AB We introduce a prototype flying platform for planetary exploration: autonomous robot design for extraterrestrial applications (ARDEA). Communication with unmanned missions beyond Earth orbit suffers from time delay, thus a key criterion for robotic exploration is a robot's ability to perform tasks without human intervention. For autonomous operation, all computations should be done on-board and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) should not be relied on for navigation purposes. Given these objectives ARDEA is equipped with two pairs of wide-angle stereo cameras and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for robust visual-inertial navigation and time-efficient, omni-directional 3D mapping. The four cameras cover a 240 circle vertical field of view, enabling the system to operate in confined environments such as caves formed by lava tubes. The captured images are split into several pinhole cameras, which are used for simultaneously running visual odometries. The stereo output is used for simultaneous localization and mapping, 3D map generation and collision-free motion planning. To operate the vehicle efficiently for a variety of missions, ARDEA's capabilities have been modularized into skills which can be assembled to fulfill a mission's objectives. These skills are defined generically so that they are independent of the robot configuration, making the approach suitable for different heterogeneous robotic teams. The diverse skill set also makes the micro aerial vehicle (MAV) useful for any task where autonomous exploration is needed. For example terrestrial search and rescue missions where visual navigation in GNSS-denied indoor environments is crucial, such as partially collapsed man-made structures like buildings or tunnels.

AB Autonomous underwater gliders are robotic underwater vehicles that do not require operator input. They are frequently deployed in large-scale, long-term ocean-sampling missions that take advantage of their buoyancy-driven engines and very low power consumption. A limitation of the buoyancy-driven engine design is that the glider must travel at slow speeds and is unable to confront strong upstream currents. Optimal path-planning to minimize the upstream-current effect and distance traversed is helpful to guide the glider navigating in the ocean. In a glider path-planning problem, reachability signifies that a minimal upstream-current effect along a path is achieved, while efficiency refers to optimizing path distance, to make it as short as possible. Reachability and efficiency are sometimes inconsistent goals in glider path-planning, and obtaining an optimal solution between both aspects of path-planning constitutes a multi-objective optimization problem. In order to discover an optimal path for glider safety, a parallel genetic approach to the glider path-planning is developed here. We present a novel scheme of upstream-current avoidance to solve the critical path-planning problem in deployment of multiple gliders. The benefits of the proposed approach are used to produce characteristic curves that express how improved cruising capability benefits path diversity. The reachability of an important scheme of upstream-current avoidance is validated by a maximum likelihood function. Moreover, a new crossover operator is proposed to encourage individuals of offspring in solution diversity. Numeric results demonstrate that the proposed path-planning approach determines an optimal path that reduces the upstream-current effect, and also shortens the cruising distance in multi-glider path-planning solutions.

AB In this study, the shape of the autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH) was optimized. AUH is a new type of disc autonomous underwater vehicle with good maneuverability and flexibility. In this paper, an optimization mathematical model is established, which takes the resistance coefficient as the optimization objective and the internal volume and the actual engineering demand as the constraints. The optimization mathematical model of AUH is solved by using two combinatorial optimization strategies. Two combinatorial optimization strategies use experimental design algorithm and multi Island genetic algorithm (MIGA) as global search algorithm, and sequential quadratic programming algorithm as local search algorithm. And based on the back propagation (BP) neural network, the sample points are trained and fitted, and the cloud map of the resistance coefficient dis-tribution in the design space is obtained. The optimization results show that compared with the initial resistance coefficient, the first optimal solution reduces by 9.14%, and the second optimal solution reduces by 9.53%. So the resistance performance of AUH is significantly improved, which proves the feasibility of the method proposed in this paper. This provides theoretical support for the shape optimization design of AUH, which will improve the motion performance of AUH in practical engineering applications.

AB Low-altitude flight in mountainous terrains is a difficult flight task applied in both military and civilian fields. The helicopter has to maintain low altitude to realize search and rescue, reconnaissance, penetration, and strike operations. It contains complex environment perception, multilevel decision making, and multi-objective flight control; thus, flight is currently mainly conducted by human pilots. In this work, a control framework is implemented to realize autonomous flight for unmanned helicopter operations in an unknown mountainous environment. The identification of targets and threats is introduced using a deep neural network. A 3D vector field histogram method is adopted for local terrain avoidance based on airborne Lidar sensors. In particular, we propose an intuitive direct-viewing method to judge and change the visibilities of the helicopter. On this basis, a finite state machine is built for decision making of the autonomous flight. A highly realistic simulation environment is established to verify the proposed control framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the helicopter can autonomously complete flight missions including a fast approach, threat avoidance, cover concealment, and circuitous flight operations similar to human pilots. The proposed control framework provides an effective solution for complex flight tasks and expands the flight control technologies for high-level unmanned helicopter operations.

DE reinforcement learning; autonomous navigation; dynamic environments;

AB Autonomous navigation in dynamic environments where people move unpredictably is an essential task for service robots in real-world populated scenarios. Recent works in reinforcement learning (RL) have been applied to autonomous vehicle driving and to navigation around pedestrians. In this paper, we present a novel planner (reinforcement learning dynamic object velocity space, RL-DOVS) based on an RL technique for dynamic environments. The method explicitly considers the robot kinodynamic constraints for selecting the actions in every control period. The main contribution of our work is to use an environment model where the dynamism is represented in the robocentric velocity space as input to the learning system. The use of this dynamic information speeds the training process with respect to other techniques that learn directly either from raw sensors (vision, lidar) or from basic information about obstacle location and kinematics. We propose two approaches using RL and dynamic obstacle velocity (DOVS), RL-DOVS-A, which automatically learns the actions having the maximum utility, and RL-DOVS-D, in which the actions are selected by a human driver. Simulation results and evaluation are presented using different numbers of active agents and static and moving passive agents with random motion directions and velocities in many different scenarios. The performance of the technique is compared with other state-of-the-art techniques for solving navigation problems in environments such as ours.

   systems; Trajectory; Marine vehicles; Optimization
AB Unmanned surface vessel (USV) autonomous navigation on the open sea involving real-time path planning and collision avoidance is still one of the essential problems to ensure the USV's safe and efficient navigation. Especially in a congested and uncertain marine traffic environment, not only will static obstacles be taken into account but other target vessels in motion should also be considered. Also, the general requirement of the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) should be satisfied. Hence, an improved A-star algorithm for USV path planning and improved dynamic window approach (IDWA) for collision avoidance were proposed. First, considering the requirement of COLREGs, the velocity search space was filtered again, and the quantity of USV trajectories was reduced. Then, the improved A-star algorithm was introduced to let the USV avoid static obstacles and reach its destination without trapping in local optimization. Moreover the Deep Q-network method was utilized to train weight coefficients of the IDWA objective function. Thereby, the improved algorithm-generated path during the process of collision avoidance was more reasonable and safer. To verify feasibility of the proposed path-planning algorithm, a comparison experiment with the traditional DWA method was carried out. The results showed that whether it was for a single USV to a single target or for multiple USVs to multiple targets, path planning, the proposed method, could work effectively to avoid obstacles safely and reach the destination quickly. The improved algorithm will be expected to provide a reference for USV path planning and collision avoidance as well as contribute to the implementation of autonomous ship navigation.

AB Path-tracking control algorithms in agriculture typically focus on how to improve the trajectory-tracking performance of autonomous agricultural machinery, and the agricultural productivity is optimized in a two-layer way. The upper operational layer optimizes an optimal tracking trajectory with the best agricultural productivity, and the lower control layer-such as Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)-receives this optimized tracking trajectory first, and then steers the vehicle to track this trajectory with high accuracy. However, this two-layer structure cannot improve the agricultural productivity at the control layer online, which makes the agricultural operation sub-optimal. In this paper, we focus on agricultural machinery operational efficiency, to represent agricultural productivity; in order to realize optimizing control to further improve agricultural machinery operational efficiency, a new path-tracking control algorithm, named Efficiency-oriented Model Predictive Control (EfiMPC), is proposed. EfiMPC is intrinsically a nested structure, which can consider the global performance of the whole system defined in the operational layer-like the agricultural machinery operational efficiency considered in this paper-in the control layer online; thus, the agricultural machinery operational efficiency can be improved during the farming operation. An unreachable tracking point, denoted as the pseudo-point, has been proposed, to indicate the agricultural machinery operational efficiency objective in a receding horizon fashion; EfiMPC can utilize this pseudo-point to realize the optimizing control online. A simulation case study was used to test the superiority of the proposed EfiMPC algorithm, and the results show that, compared with the traditional NMPC algorithm, the agricultural machinery operational efficiency realized by EfiMPC was improved by 8.56%; thus, the effectiveness of the EfiMPC has been demonstrated.

DT Article
DE Autonomous navigation; Optimal control; Trajectory planning; Unmanned
   aerial vehicles
AB In this paper, we present a Decomposition Coordination (DC) method applied to solve the problem of safe trajectory planning for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a dynamic environment. The purpose of this study is to make the UAV more reactive in the environment and ensure the safety and optimality of the computed trajectory. In this implementation, we begin by selecting a dynamic model of a fixed-arms quadrotor UAV. Then, we define our multi-objective optimization problem, which we convert afterward into a scalar optimization problem (SOP). The SOP is subdivided after that into smaller sub-problems, which will be treated in parallel and in a reasonable time. The DC principle employed in our method allows us to treat non-linearity at the local level. The coordination between the two levels is achieved after that through the Lagrange multipliers. Making use of the DC method, we can compute the optimal trajectory from the UAV's current position to a final target practically in real-time. In this approach, we suppose that the environment is totally supervised by a Ground Control Unit (GCU). To ensure the safety of the trajectory, we consider a wireless communication network over which the UAV may communicate with the GCU and get the necessary information about environmental changes, allowing for successful collision avoidance during the flight until the intended goal is safely attained. The analysis of the DC algorithm's stability and convergence, as well as the simulation results, are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our method and validate its potential.

AB The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) components embedded in autonomous systems-so-called Learning-Enabled Systems (LESs)-has resulted in the pressing need to assure their functional safety. As for traditional functional safety, the emerging consensus within both, industry and academia, is to use assurance cases for this purpose. Typically assurance cases support claims of reliability in support of safety, and can be viewed as a structured way of organising arguments and evidence generated from safety analysis and reliability modelling activities. While such assurance activities are traditionally guided by consensus-based standards developed from vast engineering experience, LESs pose new challenges in safety-critical application due to the characteristics and design of ML models. In this article, we first present an overall assurance framework for LESs with an emphasis on quantitative aspects, e.g., breaking down system-level safety targets to component-level requirements and supporting claims stated in reliability metrics. We then introduce a novel model-agnostic Reliability Assessment Model (RAM) for ML classifiers that utilises the operational profile and robustness verification evidence. We discuss the model assumptions and the inherent challenges of assessing ML reliability uncovered by our RAM and propose solutions to practical use. Probabilistic safety argument templates at the lower ML component-level are also developed based on the RAM. Finally, to evaluate and demonstrate our methods, we not only conduct experiments on synthetic/benchmark datasets but also scope our methods with case studies on simulated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and physical Unmanned Ground Vehicles.

AB The fusion of electricity, automation, and sharing is forming a new Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) system in current urban transportation, in which the Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles (SAEVs) are a fleet to execute delivery, parking, recharging, and repositioning tasks automatically. To model the decision-making process of AMoD system and optimize multiaction dynamic dispatching of SAEVs over a long horizon, the dispatching problem of SAEVs is modeled according to Markov Decision Process (MDP) at first. Then two optimization models from short-sighted view and farsighted view based on combinatorial optimization theory are built, respectively. The former focuses on the instant and single-step reward, while the latter aims at the accumulative and multistep return. After that, the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is set as the baseline method to solve the first model to achieve optimal multiaction allocation instructions for SAEVs, and the combination of deep Q-learning algorithm and Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is designed to solve the second model to realize the global optimization. Finally, a toy example, a macrosimulation of 1 month, and a microsimulation of 6 hours based on actual historical operation data are conducted. Results show that (1) the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm ensures the computational effectiveness in the large-scale real-time application of the AMoD system; (2) the second optimization model considering long-term return can decrease average user waiting time and achieve a 2.78% increase in total revenue compared with the first model; (3) and integrating combinatorial optimization theory with reinforcement learning theory is a perfect package for solving the multiaction dynamic dispatching problem of SAEVs.

AB With the rapid development of Internet of Vehicles applications, more and more data are generated. How to effectively distribute content in the Internet of Vehicles to meet the service quality requirements of users has become one of the industry pain points in the field of smart cars and autonomous driving. In order to solve the shortage of local computing resources of vehicles, a vehicle edge network is proposed, which uses data-driven edge computing to offload vehicle tasks to a mobile edge computing server to reduce overall network energy consumption and meet task latency requirements. In addition, in order to reduce the end-to-end delay, caching technology is adopted at the network edge, which can reduce the content transmission delay. This paper focuses on the problem of computing offloading in the data-driven edge computing method in the context of the Internet of Vehicles. Simulation experiments have proved its superiority compared with the traditional offloading method, and the delay and energy consumption are better than the traditional method. First, the basic concepts of the Internet of Vehicles and MEC are introduced; second, the TOAI algorithm flow chart and the computing tasks of the offloading work of the Internet of Vehicles are introduced; then, based on MEC and partial offloading, the task offloading problem is modeled and solved; the problem of unloading collaborative content under networking is solved, and the simulation results are analyzed and verified. The simulation experiment not only shows that the proposed algorithm optimizes the efficiency of the task under the average unit but also shows the effectiveness of this method, which lays a foundation for the engineering implementation of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the average task completion rate is increased by 0.58%, and the average unit task energy consumption is increased by 0.32%, which improves the practicability of the system.

AB Diamond interchanges (DIs) allow movement of vehicles between surface streets and freeways for all types of vehicles, including normal non-connected human-driven vehicle (NHDV) traffic and the connected vehicles (CVs). Unlike simple intersections, DIs consist of a pair of closely spaced intersections that are controlled together with complicated traffic movements and heavy demand fluctuations. This paper reviews the movements being controlled at DIs and presents a dynamic programming (DP)-based real-time proactive traffic control algorithm called MIDAS, to control both NHDVs and CVs. Like seminal cycle-free adaptive control methods such as OPAC and RHODES, MIDAS uses a forward recursion DP approach with efficient data structures for any large set of phase movements being controlled at DIs, over a finite-time horizon that rolls forward, and then uses a backward recursion to retrieve the optimal phase sequence and duration of phases. MIDAS captures Eulerian measurements from fixed loop detectors for all vehicles, and also captures Lagrangian measurements like in-vehicle GPS from CVs to estimate link travel times, arrival times, turning movements, etc. For every time horizon MIDAS predicts future arrivals, estimates queues at the interchange, and then minimizes a user-defined metric like delays, stops, or queues at an interchange. The paper compares performances of MIDAS with those of an optimal fixed cycle time signal control (OFTC) scheme and RHODES control on a simulated DI. The simulation is of Phoenix, AZ, DI (on I-17/19th Ave.) that uses the VISSIM micro-simulation platform. Performance is evaluated for various traffic loads and various CV market penetrations. Results show that MIDAS control outperforms RHODES and OFTC.

AB Recently, with the development of autonomous driving technology, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technology that provides a wireless connection between vehicles, pedestrians, and roadside base stations has gained significant attention. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication should provide low-latency and highly reliable services through direct communication between vehicles, improving safety. In particular, as the number of vehicles increases, efficient radio resource management becomes more important. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based decentralized resource allocation scheme in the V2X communication network in which the radio resources are shared between the V2V and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks. Here, a deep Q-network (DQN) is utilized to find the resource blocks and transmit power of vehicles in the V2V network to maximize the sum rate of the V2I and V2V links while reducing the power consumption and latency of V2V links. The DQN also uses the channel state information, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of V2I and V2V links, and the latency constraints of vehicles to find the optimal resource allocation scheme. The proposed DQN-based resource allocation scheme ensures energy-efficient transmissions that satisfy the latency constraints for V2V links while reducing the interference of the V2V network to the V2I network. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of the sum rate of the V2X network, the average power consumption of V2V links, and the average outage probability of V2V links using a case study in Manhattan with nine blocks of 3GPP TR 36.885. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme greatly reduces the transmit power of V2V links when compared to the conventional reinforcement learning-based resource allocation scheme without sacrificing the sum rate of the V2X network or the outage probability of V2V links.

AB A ground vehicle navigation approach in a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-challenged environments is developed, which uses signals of opportunity (SOPs) in a closed-loop map-matching fashion. The proposed navigation approach employs a particle filter that estimates the ground vehicle's state by fusing pseudoranges drawn from ambient SOP transmitters with road data stored in commercial maps. The problem considered assumes the ground vehicle to have a priori knowledge about its initial states as well as the position of SOPs. The proposed closed-loop approach estimates the vehicle's states for subsequent time as it navigates without the GNSS signals. In this approach, a particle filter is employed to continuously estimate the vehicle's position and velocity along with the clock error states of the vehicle-mounted receiver and SOP transmitters. The simulation and experimental results with cellular long-term evolution (LTE) SOPs are presented, evaluating the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed framework in different driving environments. The experimental results demonstrate a position root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of: 1.6 m over a 825-m trajectory in an urban environment with five cellular LTE SOPs, 3.9 m over a 1.5-km trajectory in a suburban environment with two cellular LTE SOPs, and 3.6 m over a 345-m trajectory in a challenging urban environment with two cellular LTE SOPs. It is demonstrated that incorporating the proposed map-matching algorithm reduced the position RMSE by 74.88%, 58.15%, and 46.18% in these three environments, respectively, from the RMSE obtained by an LTE-only navigation solution.

AB This study presents a driving simulator experiment to evaluate three different motion cueing algorithms based on model predictive control. The difference among these motion strategies lies in the type of mathematical model used. The first one contains only the dynamic model of the platform, while the others integrate additionally two different vestibular system models. We compare these three strategies to discuss the tradeoffs when including a vestibular system model in the control loop from the user's viewpoint. The study is conducted in autonomous mode and in free driving mode, as both play an important role in motion cueing validation. A total of 38 individuals participated in the experiment; 19 drove the simulator in free driving mode and the remaining using the autonomous driving mode. For both driving modes, substantial differences is observed. The analysis shows that one of the vestibular system models is suitable for driving simulators, as it thoroughly restores high-frequency accelerations and is well noted by the participants, especially those in the free driving mode. Further tests are needed to analyze the advantages of integrating the chosen vestibular system model in the control design for motion cuieng algorithms. Regarding the autonomous mode, further research is needed to examine the influence of the vestibular system model on the motion performance, as the behavior of the autonomous model may implicitly interfere with subjective assessments.

AB In this article, we propose a trajectory planning algorithm that enables autonomous surface vessels to perform socially compliant navigation in a city's canal. The key idea behind the proposed algorithm is to adopt an optimal control formulation in which the deviation of movements of the autonomous vessel from nominal movements of human-operated vessels is penalized. Consequently, given a pair of origin and destination points, it finds vessel trajectories that resemble those of human-operated vessels. To formulate this, we adopt kernel density estimation (KDE) to build a nominal movement model of human-operated vessels from a prerecorded trajectory dataset, and use a Kullback-Leibler control cost to measure the deviation of the autonomous vessel's movements from the model. We establish an analogy between our trajectory planning approach and the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEntIRL) approach to explain how our approach can learn the navigation behavior of human-operated vessels. On the other hand, we distinguish our approach from the MaxEntIRL approach in that it does not require well-defined bases, often referred to as features, to construct its cost function as required in many of inverse reinforcement learning approaches in the trajectory planning context. Through experiments using a dataset of vessel trajectories collected from the automatic identification system, we demonstrate that the trajectories generated by our approach resemble those of human-operated vessels and that using them for canal navigation is beneficial in reducing head-on encounters between vessels and improving navigation safety.

AB In the era of internet of vehicles, both the traffic signal control and the rerouting of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are essential techniques to alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic efficiency. However, these two schemes have been treated separately without a unified framework allowing for joint optimization in the previous studies. In the case of traffic congestion at the bottleneck intersections, either of the two schemes alone is not enough. To this end, we propose to jointly control the traffic lights and the CAVs under the reinforcement learning (RL) framework. To lower the dimensionality of this learning problem, we propose to control the route choices of the CAVs through a few common scalar parameters instead of controlling the CAVs individually. In particular, the rerouting ratios are dynamically adjusted. A model-based method is further proposed to estimate the expected travel time with reduced estimation error. We then exploit the tools from deep RL and put forth an efficient algorithm that is able to control the green time allocation of traffic signals and the rerouting of CAVs jointly. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the validity of our proposed models and show the traffic efficiency can be significantly improved with our proposed algorithm.

AB In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained attention in the agricultural field, particularly in what is known as Precision Agriculture (PA). The use of these vehicles responds to the need for optimizing resources to have greater yields while reducing the negative impact on the environment. One of the main functions for UAVs in this field is the Remote Sensing (RS) of the crops. A UAV can fly over a large area to capture images that can be merged into an ortho-rectified photo mosaic, or orthomosaic. One of the main problems for that is to get the orthomosaic accurately georeferenced, which could be critical for decision making or to implement precise preventive/corrective actions in the crops. An accurate georeferenced orthomosaic can be obtained either by direct or indirect methods. Whereas indirect methods have been extensively studied before, there are few results reported in the literature for direct methods. In this work, the accuracy of an orthomosaic direct georeferenced using Real-Time Kinematics (RTK) applied during the UAV flight was evaluated. The aim was to obtain accurately referenced orthomosaics that could be used in the future by other autonomous vehicles. Results shown a reduction in the positioning error of up to 98% when compared with direct GPS georeferencing.

AB In this paper, we present an optimal path planning and speed control strategy for motion planning of unmanned ground vehicles to follow the desired path in various driving environments. The novelty of this work is that it integrates the longitudinal speed and lateral motion control by maximizing the longitudinal progression and minimizing the lateral path tracking errors and formulates a standard quadratic optimization problem. Firstly, a dynamic programming approach is introduced to convexify the corridor constraints in path pre-selection and replanned for obstacle avoidance. The idea is to find a convex feasible set for the optimization problem using the convex constraints. And then a standard quadratic convex problem is formulated to optimize the longitudinal motion and steering angle control in prediction and control horizon. The longitudinal progression and lateral tracking errors are decomposed in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. The centerline as well as road borders are also described by using cubic spline curves. Some challenge scenarios including static and moving participating obstacle vehicles are tested and validated for the proposed motion planning strategy. The feasibility and performance of the proposed strategy are demonstrated by numerical experiments in terms of the stability and maneuverability of unmanned ground vehicles in different driving conditions.

AB Flexibility in power demand, diverse usage patterns and storage capability of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) grow the elasticity of residential electricity demand remarkably. This elasticity can be used to form the daily aggregated demand profile and/or alter instantaneous demand of a system wherein a large number of residential PEVs share one electricity retailer. In this paper, we propose a demand response technique to manage vehicle-to-grid enabled PEVs' electricity assignments (charging and discharging) in order to reduce the overall electricity procurement costs for a retailer bidding to a two-settlement electricity market, i.e., a day-ahead and a spot or real-time (RT) market. We show that our approach is decentralized, scalable, fast converging and does not violate users' privacy. Extensive simulations show significant overall cost savings can be achieved for a retailer bidding to an operational electricity market by using the proposed algorithm. This technique becomes more needful when the power grid accommodates a large number of intermittent energy resources. There, RT demand altering is crucial due to more likely contingencies and hence more RT price fluctuations and even occurring the so-called black swan events. Finally, such retailer could offer better deals to customers as well to stay competitive.

AB This paper proposes a cooperative online target detection methodology by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (Multi-AUV) equipped with the side-scan sonar (SSS) sensor for real-time, accurate, and efficient underwater target detection and positioning in unknown environments. Due to the existence of unfavorable factors such as severe noises and geometric deformation of SSS images, this study incorporates the prior-based threshold segmentation with multi-scale cascaded networks (MSCNet) to reduce the high false alarm rate significantly. Specifically, to the real-time requirements of the AUVs computational platform, this study proposes the sequentially dual-branch lightweight block (LWBlock) as a baseline to obtain dense feature maps, which provide a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Meanwhile, this study establishes the comprehensive correction model, which obtains the accurate target positioning information fusing with the predicted results. Furthermore, according to the target information provided by the automatic target recognition (ATR) system, the data-driven behavior-based (DDBB) path re-planning algorithm is performed that endows each AUV to scan above the interest target autonomously and in detail by designed maneuver behavior. Simulation and actual sea trial experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, and achieves the recognition accuracy of 92.16%, inference speed of 2.45 s, and obtained the best FPR indicator in three SSS targets of 2.54% (metal ball),1.96% (seabed rock) and 1.03% (metal rod), respectively. At the same time, the proposed algorithm can improve detection efficiency by at least 40% compared with a single AUV, which can be widely used in marine mission exploration and resource deployment.

AB There are two indispensable methodologies for autonomous flights performed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The first is flight control, and the other is simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In the literature, these two issues are generally considered separately. However, they have very close relationships with each other. In this study, both methods were extensively examined in the literature, especially for quadrotors. Quadrotors, also known as quadrotors, are rotary-wing UAVs capable of vertical take-off and landing. As their use becomes widespread worldwide, the number of studies conducted to enable autonomous tasks is growing. The study was prepared under three subtitles. First, a fast and simple introduction of quadrotors was made, and the advances in this area were discussed. In the next section, studies on the position, attitude, and altitude control methods required for the autonomous use of such aircraft are analyzed based on linear, nonlinear, and intelligent methods. As the third subheading, research on SLAM techniques was widely discussed. Frequently used performance metrics, application environments, and results were presented in detailed tables for studies in both areas. Comparative studies were particularly emphasized, and the best results obtained were expressed in tables. The hardware implementations of the mentioned applications were also reviewed. Thus, hardware and method-based quick reference resource were created for researchers. As a consequence, the objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers working on quadrotor navigation systems to effectively select the flight control and SLAM methods they will employ.

AB Motion prediction systems play a crucial role in enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in complex traffic scenarios. Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches have emerged as a promising solution for capturing interactions among dynamic agents and static objects. However, they often lack transparency, interpretability and explainability - qualities that are essential for building trust in autonomous driving systems. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a comprehensive approach to enhance the explainability of graph-based motion prediction systems. We introduce the Explainable Heterogeneous Graph based Policy (XHGP) model based on an heterogeneous graph representation of the traffic scene and lane-graph traversals. Distinct from other graph-based models, XHGP leverages object level and type-level attention mechanisms to learn interaction behaviors, providing information about the importance of agents and interactions in the scene. In addition, capitalizing on XHGP's architecture, we investigate the explanations provided by the GNNExplainer and apply counterfactual reasoning to analyze the sensitivity of the model to modifications of the input data. This includes masking scene elements, altering trajectories, and adding or removing dynamic agents. Our proposal advances towards achieving reliable and explainable motion prediction systems, addressing the concerns of users, developers and regulatory agencies alike. The insights gained from our explainability analysis contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between dynamic and static elements in traffic scenarios, facilitating the interpretation of the results, as well as the correction of possible errors in motion prediction models, and thus contributing to the development of trustworthy motion prediction systems.The code to reproduce this work is publicly available at https://github.com/sancarlim/ Explainable-MP/tree/v1.1.

AB Map-matching based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a promising method for accurate self-localization and recently has gained a wider focus due to the availability of high definition (HD) maps and price-down of LiDARs. In this method, the input scan of the LiDAR is matched to the prebuilt map to get a centimeter-level accuracy position of the vehicle. However, in some places of the map, due to the lack of features, the presence of the repetitive features, the layout of the features, and other factors, the map-matching error might exceed the required bound for autonomous driving. In our previous work, four criteria for evaluation of the features of the map was introduced and it is shown that by examining the corresponding factors for each criterion, the map-matching error can be modeled. In this work, one of the map criteria called local similarity is further investigated and in order to quantify the fulfillment of this criterion, three new factors, namely pfh_similarity, pfh_entropy, and battacharya_similarity are introduced. In addition to this, a framework for pre-estimation of the map-matching error considering these four criteria based on random forest regression is proposed. To evaluate the accuracy of the framework, experiments were conducted for 3.6 km in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Experimental results show that using the proposed framework, in 64.1% of the cases, the localization error can be estimated with less than 2.5cm of the estimation error.

AB Linear quadratic (LQ) game has been widely used in shared driving to resolve conflicts between drivers and driving automation systems (DAS). However, the system model in LQ game is assumed to be linear time-invariant, which does not consider the effect of changing longitudinal speed on the lateral control. A novel cooperative LPV/MPC approach is proposed, which characterizes the longitudinal and lateral coupled vehicle control in a dynamic game. The stability of the cooperative LPV/MPC system is analyzed in the presence of inconsistent targets of driver and DAS. Driver behavior is studied using 2,701 lane-changing cases extracted from naturalistic driving data (NDD). A human-like risk assessment method is achieved according to the driver behavior characteristics. Finally, a shared driving strategy in lane-changing scenarios is presented based on the cooperative LPV/MPC algorithm and the human-like risk assessment method. Simulation validations show that the shared driving strategy can ensure vehicle stability when longitudinal control, lateral control and dynamic game are performed simultaneously. In addition, the shared driving strategy can realize the driving weight gradual handover, which can help to better assist the driver in risk avoidance.

AB Automated vehicle (AVs) technology is advancing at a rapid pace, offering new options for school travel. Parents play a decisive role in the choice of their child's school travel mode. To enable primary and secondary school students to take AVs to and from school, it is necessary to understand the factors that affect parents' intentions toward the new school travel mode. This study has three primary aims: (1) Discovering parents' intentions to escort children by AV and their potential determinants. (2) Constructing the Hybrid Choice Model (HCM) to examine the effects of parents' socioeconomic attributes, psychological factors, and travel attributes on using AVs to escort their children. (3) Raising practical implications to accelerate AV applications in school travel. The findings suggested that knowledge of AVs is the most important factor influencing parental intentions. Perceived usefulness, attitude, and perceived risk had significant effects on parental intentions. The direct effects of public engagement and perceived ease of use on parental intentions were not significant. Finally, this research can provide decision-making support for the government to formulate measures to promote AV application in school travel.

AB Automated vehicles (AV) testing on the public roads is ongoing in several states in the US as well as in Europe and Asia. As long as the automated vehicle technology has not achieved full automation (Level 5), human drivers are still expected to take over the steering wheel and throttles when there is an automated vehicle disengagement. However, contributing factors and the mechanism about automated vehicle-initiated disengagement has not been quantitatively and comprehensively explored and investigated due to the lack of field test data. Besides, understanding human drivers' perception and promptness of reaction to the AV disengagement is essential to ensure safety transition between automated and manual driving. By harnessing California's Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement Report Database, which includes the AV disengagement data from field tests in 2016-2017, this paper quantitatively investigated the AV disengagement using multiple statistical modeling approaches that involve statistical modeling and classification tree. Specifically, the paper identifies the contributing factors impacting human drivers' promptness to AV disengagements, and quantitatively investigates the underlying causes to AV disengagements. Results indicate that current AV disengagement on public roads is dominated by causes due to a planning issue. The cause of an AV disengagement is significantly induced by lacking certain numbers of radar and LiDAR sensors installed on the automated vehicles. These thresholds of these sensors needed are revealed. Cause of disengagement and roadway characteristics significantly impact drivers' take-over time when facing an AV disengagement. AV perception or control issue-based disengagement can significantly extend drivers' perception-reaction time to take over the driving. The quantitative knowledge obtained ultimately facilitates revealing the mechanisms of the automated vehicle disengagements to ensure safe AV operations on public roads.

AB The distributed driven agricultural vehicle platform studied in this paper is a basic carrying platform that can be used for a variety of agricultural activities (pesticide spraying, weeding, and other plant protection operations). It does not need to rely on traditional fuel engine to drive but is driven by electric power, which is more environmentally friendly and conducive to the development of ecological agriculture in the future. In this paper, according to the driving and structure characteristics of distributed driving electric agricultural vehicles, in order to ensure the vehicle trajectory tracking ability, under conditions of agricultural operation, the driving attitude and drive coordination control of electric agricultural vehicles are taken as the key research objectives. In this way, the driving path of the vehicle platform can be accurately controlled during the operation of pesticide spraying and herbicide, so as to reduce the excessive use or misuse of pesticides and herbicides and greatly reduce the field pollution. Considering the specific driving environment as well as complex and changeable motion patterns of agricultural vehicles, when a single motion model is used to track and estimate the driving state, there will be low filtering accuracy or even loss of the target during vehicle maneuvering. In this paper, interactive multiple model (IMM) algorithm is combined with extended Kalman filter to effectively track changes of the target's motion mode, thereby avoiding low filtering accuracy or serious state estimation inaccuracy. Finally, through the distributed electric drive agricultural operation experimental platform developed by the research group, the working conditions close to the actual agricultural production activities was set up according to the needs of actual agricultural production activities in this paper, and applicability and accuracy of the algorithm state estimation are verified by experiments.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive solution that allows a wirelessly connected electric vehicle (EV) to be autonomously charged and discharged, during long-term parking and/or transient stops. A bilayer power flow controller for bidirectional wireless power transfer system (BWPTS) in EVs applications is proposed. The proposed controller can manage the power flow between the EV and surrounding infrastructures, such as utility grid, home micro-grid, building micro-grid, road, or another vehicle. It consists of two control layers; the first is responsible for communicating with the surrounding infrastructures and gathering information from the vehicle operator, charging station, utility grid, and battery management system. These data are analyzed to generate the reference power signal with information about the mode of operation (charge, discharge, or abstain) and rate. The second layer receives the reference signal and predicts the control parameters for the resonant converters (on both the vehicle and grid sides) to track the desired power. The proposed algorithm is adaptively estimating the mutual inductance to consider the misalignments in the system, based on a new simple real-time mutual estimation algorithm using a single voltage measurement from the vehicle side. The second control layer is designed based on an accurate analytical model for the BWPTS's power flow. For verification purposes, a prototype for BWPTS was built and driven by the proposed controller, which was implemented using a field-programmable gate array integrated circuit. Also, a vehicle-level simulation was performed to validate the operation of the proposed controller in quasi-dynamic wireless charging at traffic signals. The proposed controller shows fast and stable response during both the transient and steady-state operation in comparison with the conventional proportional-integral controller.

AB Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are essential for detecting and tracking specific events, such as automatic navigation. The intelligent monitoring of people's social distances in crowds is one of the most significant events caused by the coronavirus. The virus is spreading more quickly among the crowds, and the disease cycle continues in congested areas. Due to the error that occurs when humans monitor their activity, an automated model is required to alert to social distance violations in crowds. As a result, this article proposes a two-step framework based on autonomous UAV videos, including human tracking and deep learning-based recognition of the crowd's social distance. The deep architecture is a modified-fast and lightweight ShuffleNet learning structure. First, the Kalman filter is used to determine the positions of individuals, and then the modified ShuffleNet is used to refine the bounding boxes obtained and determine the social distance. The social distance is calculated using the initial refinement of the bounding box obtained during the tracking step and the scale in frames of the human body. The observed average accuracy, average processing time (APT), and processed frame per second (FPS) for three congestion datasets were 97.5%, 84 milliseconds, and 11.5 FPS, respectively. Real-time decision-making was achieved by reducing the size and resolution of the frames. Additionally, the frames were re-labeled to reduce the computational complexity associated with detecting social distancing. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could operate more quickly and accurately on various resolution frames of UAV videos with difficult conditions.

AB Proliferation of deployed sea-going autonomous platforms, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USV), and sensor nodes anchored to the seabed, make the deployment of true underwater acoustic networks more and more feasible. An important feature of any network is the ability to synchronize the clocks of the participants, for the purpose of, e.g., time-slotted media access control (MAC) and navigation. Terrestrial clock synchronization protocols, such as the well-established network time protocol (NTP), are not readily applicable to underwater acoustic networks, because of long propagation times, low packet delivery success rates, communication ranges that vary over time in an unpredictable manner, and, in the presence of mobile nodes, the ad hoc nature of the composition of the network. This paper proposes a continuous estimation of internode clock offset and drift, based on the continuous exchange of modem packets, possibly containing transmission and reception timestamps. The proposed solution takes explicitly into account the limitations of the acoustic communication channel and network node mobility. This robust, opportunistic clock synchronization (ROCS) is robust against modem reset, and will work even if packet delivery success rates are not optimal or if no communication is possible for extended periods of time. Experimental results are given from the COLLaborative Asw Behaviours-Next Generation Autonomous Systems (COLLAB-NGAS14) campaign, held October 19-31, 2014, off the west coast of Italy. During the sea trial, the proposed clock synchronization algorithm was deployed and successfully tested within an underwater acoustic network composed of mobile and fixed nodes.

AB The fast-paced growth of artificial intelligence provides unparalleled opportunities to improve the efficiency of various industries, including the transportation sector. The worldwide transport departments face many obstacles following the implementation and integration of different vehicle features. One of these tasks is to ensure that vehicles are autonomous, intelligent and able to grow their repository of information. Machine learning has recently been implemented in wireless networks, as a major artificial intelligence branch, to solve historically challenging problems through a data-driven approach. In this article, we discuss recent progress of applying machine learning into vehicle networks for intelligent route decision and try to focus on this emerging field. Deep Extreme Learning Machine (DELM) framework is introduced in this article to be incorporated in vehicles so they can take human-like assessments. The present GPS compatibility issues make it difficult for vehicles to take real-time decisions under certain conditions. It leads to the concept of vehicle controller making self-decisions. The proposed DELM based system for self-intelligent vehicle decision makes use of the cognitive memory to store route observations. This overcomes inadequacy of the current in-vehicle route-finding technology and its support. All the relevant route-related information for the ride will be provided to the user based on its availability. Using the DELM method, a high degree of precision in smart decision taking with a minimal error rate is obtained. During investigation, it has been observed that proposed framework has the highest accuracy rate with 70% of training (1435 samples) and 30% of validation (612 samples). Simulation results validate the intelligent prediction of the proposed method with 98.88%, 98.2% accuracy during training and validation respectively.

AB Connected critical autonomous systems (C-CASs) are envisioned to significantly change our life and work styles through emerging vertical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and cooperative robots. However, as the scale of the connected nodes continues to grow, their heterogeneity and cybersecurity threats are more eminent, and conventional centralized communications and decision-making methodology are reaching their limit. This article is the first exploration of a trustworthy and fault-tolerant framework for C-CAS for achieving hyperreliable global decision making in a trustless environment, where the connected sensors/nodes are less reliable due to either communication failure or local decision error (e.g., by sensing algorithm/AI, etc.). The proposed framework is based on two iconic distributed consensus (DC) mechanisms: 1) practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) and 2) Raft, under the proposed perception-initiative-consensus-action (PICA) protocol with wireless connections among the nodes. We first analytically derived consensus reliability in six different system models. The other fundamental performance metrics, such as the consensus throughput and latency, node scalability, and reliability gain are also analytically derived. These analytical results provide basic design guidelines for wireless DC (WDC) usage in the C-CAS systems. The results show that WDC significantly improves overall system reliability with the increasing number of participating nodes.

AB Two complementary measurement systems-built upon an autonomous floating craft and a tethered balloon-for lake research and monitoring are presented. The autonomous vehicle was assembled on a catamaran for stability, and is capable of handling a variety of instrumentation for in situ and near-surface measurements. The catamaran hulls, each equipped with a small electric motor, support rigid decks for arranging equipment. An electric generator provides full autonomy for about 8 h. The modular power supply and instrumentation data management systems are housed in two boxes, which enable rapid setup. Due to legal restrictions in Switzerland (where the craft is routinely used), the platform must be observed from an accompanying boat while in operation. Nevertheless, the control system permits fully autonomous operation, with motion controlled by speed settings and waypoints, as well as obstacle detection. On-board instrumentation is connected to a central hub for data storage, with real-time monitoring of measurements from the accompanying boat. Measurements from the floating platform are complemented by mesoscale imaging from an instrument package attached to a He-filled balloon. The aerial package records thermal and RGB imagery, and transmits it in real-time to a ground station. The balloon can be tethered to the autonomous catamaran or to the accompanying boat. Missions can be modified according to imagery and/or catamaran measurements. Illustrative results showing the surface thermal variations of Lake Geneva demonstrate the versatility of the combined floating platform/balloon imagery system setup for limnological investigations.

AB To provide accurate path tracking and satisfactory soil loading and unloading for a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) based tractor-scraper land levelling system, a novel model-based control method with slip compensation was developed. A sideslip estimator was developed and adapted into a tractor-scraper kinematic model. The steering angle control law was calculated based on the kinematic model, and its stability was verified using Lyapunov functions. The method was validated via field experiments in which a GNSS-based tractor-scraper land levelling system was controlled to track planned paths in a wet field to complete an autonomous land levelling operation. The experimental results showed that compared with path tracking performance of a pure pursuit control (PPC) method, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the total lateral deviations of the tractor and the scraper under the proposed method were reduced by 0.433 and 0.169 m respec-tively in headland turning. Moreover, the elevation distribution (i.e. evenness) of the field increased by 33.314% after the autonomous land levelling operation driven by the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed method could realise accurate path tracking and satisfactory land evenness. It can also be integrated into current GNSS-based tractor-scraper land levelling systems to realise autonomous land levelling with improved performance. (c) 2021 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In general, proposed solutions for LiDAR-based localization used in autonomous cars require expensive sensors and computationally expensive mapping processes. Moreover, the global localization for autonomous driving is converging to the use of maps. Straightforward strategies to reduce the costs are to produce simpler sensors and use maps already available on the Internet. Here, an analysis is presented to show how simple can a LiDAR sensor be without degrading the localization accuracy that uses road and satellite maps together to globally pose the car. Three characteristics of the sensor are evaluated: the number of range readings, the amount of noise in the LiDAR readings, and the frame rate, with the aim of finding the minimum number of LiDAR lines, the maximum acceptable noise and the sensor frame rate needed to obtain an accurate position estimation. The analysis is performed using an autonomous car in complex field scenarios equipped with a 3D LiDAR Velodyne HDL-32E. Several experiments were conducted reducing the number of frames, the number of scans per 3D point-cloud and artificially adding up to 15% of error in the ray length. Among other results, we found that using only 4 vertical lines per scan and with an artificial error added up to 15% of the ray length, the car was capable to localize itself within 2.11 meters error average. All experimental results and the followed methodology are explained in detail herein.

AB X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV) is a navigation method using celestial X-ray source observations for spacecraft orbit determination. However, if the measurements are not reliable due to any kind of malfunction, the performance of XNAV may result in considerable errors and even divergence. In this study, a new algorithm called robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) is proposed for the lunar satellite autonomous navigation system, which is robust against measurement malfunctions. First, the satellite dynamic model applied perturbations is derived under the J2 perturbation of the Moon. The pulse time-of-arrival (TOA) is used to build the observation model. Second, the performance of XNAV system is discussed by analysing the transformation error of TOA, system observability and controllability. Then, an adaptive measurement noise scale factor (AMNSF) is designed by using the innovation sequence in REKF. Meanwhile, the gain matrix is modified by adding the AMNSF to reduce the influence of malfunction and enhance the robustness of XNAV system. Finally, the simulation results show the proposed navigation scheme is valid and feasible, and it is appropriate for lunar satellite autonomous navigation.

AB To reveal the impact mechanism of low-speed vehicles (LSVs) on expressway traffic safety, this paper uses the polynomial fitting method to establish evolution models of traffic density and average speed at different LSV speeds in order to explore the queuing and dissipation characteristics of vehicles affected by LSVs and investigate the impact range of LSVs on expressways. Based on the findings above, this paper builds a Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM)-based model to quantify driving safety and further explore the differences in vehicle conflicts when an LSV moves in different lanes at the same speed. The simulation experiment is conducted based on the field data from the Inner Ring North Road located along the Nanjing Inner Ring High Speed Road. The results show that the evolutionary features of lane traffic density and average speed under different LSV speeds satisfy the octuple polynomial law, reflecting the spatial heterogeneity of vehicle distribution at different LSV driving speeds. Meanwhile, LSVs with different speeds produced the most significant negative impact on the roadway within 400 m of the expressway entrance. The lower the speed of the LSV, the more significant the adverse effect. In addition, this paper finds that when an LSV travels in different lanes at the same speed, the inner, middle, and outer lanes have the highest number of total conflicts, rear-end conflicts, and lane-change conflicts, respectively. Meanwhile, vehicles in the outer lane are the most significantly affected by LSVs, while vehicles in the middle lane are the least affected with the highest traffic efficiency. Additionally, the Maximum Speed (MaxS) and Difference in Vehicle Speed (DeltaS) for the middle lane are 47.9% and 60.5% higher than the outer lane, respectively. Nevertheless, based on the Probability of Unsuccessful Evasive Actions, i.e., P(UEA), vehicles in the middle lane have the highest probability of potential traffic conflicts. The methods used in this paper will have positive implications for establishing autonomous vehicle risk avoidance systems which can improve the safety levels of expressways.

AB Vehicular automation is changing the conventional way of driving - e.g., the role of a driver is changing into an observer or a passenger due to the higher levels of automation. However, the success of this vehicle automation potentially leading to fully autonomous vehicles largely de-pends on the interest and comfort of consumers. Adoption of such disruptive technologies might have a retrospective aspect related to individuals' experiences, such as exposure to technologies over their life course. This study adopts a life history-oriented approach to investigate in-dividuals' preferences towards different levels of vehicle autonomy. The effects of historical ex-periences in different life domains such as technology usage in daily life and availability of vehicle technology, and the evolution of demographics such as historically living in an owned dwelling are explored. Data comes from a retrospective survey conducted in the Okanagan region of Canada. A random parameter rank-ordered logit model is developed to accommodate the relative ranked preferences of the alternatives and to capture unobserved heterogeneity. The model results suggest that individuals with historical exposure to vehicle technology have a higher likelihood of adopting higher levels of vehicle automation, whereas individuals having advanced technology only in the current vehicle reveal a lower interest towards higher vehicle autonomy. Individuals without a driver's license show a higher interest in full automation, whereas they are less interested in no automation. The model confirms the existence of hetero-geneity. For instance, pro-urban individuals prefer no automation, whereas pro-suburban in-dividuals are inclined towards full automation. Both variables show significant heterogeneity with a large standard deviation. The findings of this study demonstrate the need to accommodate the effects of historical experiences while analyzing the preferences towards different levels of automation. Such inclusion of life history-oriented attributes within the travel demand fore-casting models is expected to improve the demand and usage prediction accuracy of different levels of vehicle automation.

AB The rapid evolution of technology in connected automated and autonomous vehicles offers immense potential for revolutionizing future intelligent traffic control and management. This potential is exemplified by the diverse range of control paradigms, ranging from self-routing to centralized control. However, the selection among these paradigms is beyond technical consideration but a delicate balance between autonomous decision-making and holistic system optimization. A pivotal quantitative parameter in navigating this balance is the concept of the "price of anarchy" (PoA) inherent in autonomous decision frameworks. This paper analyses the price of anarchy for road networks with traffic of CAV. We model a traffic network as a routing game in which vehicles are selfish agents who choose routes to travel autonomously to minimize travel delays caused by road congestion. Unlike existing research in which the latency function of road congestion was based on polynomial functions like the well-known BPR function, we focus on routing games where an exponential function can specify the latency of road traffic. We first calculate a tight upper bound for the price of anarchy for this class of games and then compare this result with the tight upper bound of the PoA for routing games with the BPR latency function. The comparison shows that as long as the traffic volume is lower than the road capacity, the tight upper bound of the PoA of the games with the exponential function is lower than the corresponding value with the BPR function. Finally, numerical results based on real-world traffic data demonstrate that the exponential function can approximate road latency as close as the BPR function with even tighter exponential parameters, which results in a relatively lower upper bound.

AB Positioning technology is an important component of environmental perception. It is also the basis for autonomous decision-making and motion control of firefighting robots. However, some issues such as positioning in indoor scenarios still remain inherent challenges. The positioning accuracy of the fire emergency reaction dispatching (FERD) system is far from adequate to support some applications for firefighting and rescue in indoor scenarios with multiple obstacles. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fusion module based on the Blackboard architecture. This module aims to improve the positioning accuracy of a single sensor of the unmanned vehicles within the FERD system. To reduce the risk of autonomous decision-making of the unmanned vehicles, this module uses a comprehensive manner of multiple channels to complement or correct the positioning of the firefighting robots. Specifically, this module has been developed to fusion a variety of relevant processes for precise positioning. This process mainly includes six strategies. These strategies are the denoising, spatial alignment, confidence degree update, observation filtering, data fusion, and fusion decision. These strategies merge with the current scenarios-related parameter data, empirical data on sensor errors, and information to form a series of norms. This paper then proceeds to gain experience data with the confidence degree, error of different sensors, and timeliness of this module by training in an indoor scenario with multiple obstacles. This process is from data of multiple sensors (bottom-level) to control decisions knowledge-based (up-level). This process can obtain globally optimal positioning results. Finally, this paper evaluates the performance of this fusion module for the FERD system. The experimental results show that this fusion module can effectively improve positioning accuracy in an indoor scenario with multiple obstacles.

AB Despite the popularity of the buddy system, where a pair of divers look out for each other, scuba diving still poses significant risks with 15-30 deaths per 100 000 divers per year. In the 2015 edition of "Diving Medicine for Scuba Divers," it is reported that 86% of diving fatalities involve a lone diver, yet divers still elect to dive alone for a variety of reasons including buddy unavailability. A solution to this may lie in a dedicated autonomous dive-buddy robot, which could also operate as an assistant. The challenge is how would the diver interact and communicate with the robot in underwater conditions often involving low visibility. In this article, we detail and demonstrate a technological solution that involves the direct motion capture of fingers and hand using a smart dive glove with integrated stretch sensors alongside an inertial measurement unit. The hardware and gesture recognition protocol were initially evaluated in a lab-based study where 10 users participated in a virtual reality environment setup and interacted with a virtual robot using gestures. In total, 140 out of 175 gestures were correctly recognized, resulting in diver-robot commands. A full sea demonstration of the underwater motion-capture system followed with the underwater dive glove used to send gesture-based acoustic commands to a dedicated dive buddy, a modified autonomous underwater vehicle. The diver was able to command the robot to move in six directions with a total delay of 6 s or less between the beginning of the gesture and the initiation of the action by the robot.

AB Autonomous Surface Vehicles require path planning to navigate among complex shorelines and spatio-temporal environmental forces such as water currents. Path planning is performed to generate an energy-efficient route to a goal destination based on water current forecasts. Deterministic algorithms such as Dijkstra's Shortest Path First are able to generate an optimal solution, but scale exponentially with the size of the search space. In coastal navigation, the complex shorelines and forces require high resolution search spaces such that classical planning algorithms will require substantial time. Metaheuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) sacrifice guaranteed optimality to substantially reduce computation. However, there is a risk of premature convergence to local optima. After showing PSO struggling to reliably produce near-optimal solutions, we use Visibility Graphs (VGs) to initialize the PSO solution population. We demonstrate that this substantially improves PSO's ability to reliably achieve solutions that are competitive with Dijkstra. We also introduce the concept of opportunistic reward-based planning, and apply PSO to this planning problem. If a vessel is navigating to a goal destination, we propose taking advantage of nearby sampling opportunities to increase the scientific return of the mission. PSO is used to optimize routes that balance path efficiency and reward. Using a complex assignment of reward values across the search space, there are numerous opportunities for PSO to get stuck in local optima. Again, we use VGs to initialize the PSO population which we demonstrate increases solution consistency while improving both the reward and efficiency. We propose using VGs to generate an initial PSO population and demonstrate that the combination efficiently plans routes for two complex marine path planning problems.

AB There is considerable evidence that evaluating the subjective risk level of driving decisions can improve the safety of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) in both typical and complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach that uses scene-graphs as intermediate representations for modeling the subjective risk of driving maneuvers. Our approach includes a Multi-Relation Graph Convolution Network, a Long-Short Term Memory Network, and attention layers. To train our model, we formulate subjective risk assessment as a supervised scene classification problem. We evaluate our model on both synthetic lane-changing datasets and real-driving datasets with various driving maneuvers. We show that our approach achieves a higher classification accuracy than the stateof-the-art approach on both large (96.4% vs. 91.2%) and small (91.8% vs. 71.2%) lane-changing synthesized datasets, illustrating that our approach can learn effectively even from small datasets. We also show that our model trained on a lane-changing synthesized dataset achieves an average accuracy of 87.8% when tested on a real-driving lane-changing dataset. In comparison, the state-of-the-art model trained on the same synthesized dataset only achieved 70.3% accuracy when tested on the real-driving dataset, showing that our approach can transfer knowledge more effectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that the addition of spatial and temporal attention layers improves our model's performance and explainability. Finally, our results illustrate that our model can assess the risk of various driving maneuvers more accurately than the state-of-the-art model (86.5% vs. 58.4%, respectively).

AB This paper presents a novel approach, which is based on the integration of hybrid automata, real-time Unified Modeling Language (UML)/System Modeling Language (SysML) and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) in order to systematically develop controllers for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV5). This approach entirely covers the analysis, design, implementation and deployment phases focused on controllers for AUVs and also allows the designed control elements to be customizable and re-usable in the development of new applications of various AUV types. The paper brings out step-by-step the AUV dynamics together with the control structure, specializations of MDA's features such as the Computation Independent Model (CIM) with use-cases and hybrid automata, the Platform Independent Model (PIM) carried out by using the real-time UML, as well as its Platform Specific Model (PSM) implemented by sub-system paradigms and object-oriented mechanisms to completely perform the development lifecycle of AUV controllers. The transformation rules are then introduced and applied to convert the detailed design model of PIM into the implementation model of PSM by using open-source platforms in order to quickly simulate and realize AUV controllers. Based on this approach, a planar trajectory-tracking controller of a miniature autonomous submersible was completely developed and successfully taken on trial trip. In this application, the controller has been implemented with the simulation model in OpenModelica. The obtained simulation results then can permit us to mainly define the designed control elements and their properties, as well as building the implementation libraries for performing quickly the realization model in Arduino Mega2560 microcontroller.

AB When performing tasks in the field, the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) usually requires the ability of quickly adjusting the driving direction, and realizing the flexible motion control to deal with emergencies. In order to achieve the rapid adjustment of driving direction of the six-wheel independent drive and four independent steering unmanned ground vehicle with variable configuration, an adaptive counter-rotation hierarchical control strategy is proposed in this paper. Based on the expected yaw angle, the upper controller estimates the required yaw moment using PID-type sliding mode control, and constructs the function of structural and unstructured parameters as lumped uncertainty. Then, the sideslip angle of each tire is optimized by using PSO algorithm with the adaptive weight, and the influence of structural uncertainty is eliminated by the adaptive control of independent steering. In the lower controller, the desired yaw moment is distributed to six electric motors according to the vertical load. Finally, co-simulation under different operation conditions is carried out to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The simulation results show that the presented strategy enables the variable configuration UGV quickly adjust the driving direction, and has relatively good adaptability to the changes of the wheelbase and the track width.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) have promisingly contributed to the decarbonization of the transportation sector. Torque distribution in energy management is vital to enhance EV safety and efficiency; however, its nonlinearity and real-time executability have not been extensively researched. This paper proposes an integrated torque distribution strategy that simultaneously considers vehicle security and dynamic power allocation. In the upper active safety layer, the yaw stability control and active front steering control are coupled to maintain vehicle stability. Additionally, a linear time-varying model predictive controller is developed to address the system nonlinearity and online executability problems. In the lower energy distribution layer, the motor efficiency and dynamic tire-slip power are simultaneously optimized to maintain EV energy conservation. Numerical simulations and hardware experiments are conducted in this study. The results demonstrate that the proposed integrated strategy is superior to other typical torque distribution strategies in terms of reducing the risk of emergent accidents. Moreover, the energy consumption of the powertrain is reduced by 13.4% and 14.2% under the steering and straight driving conditions, respectively. Overall, our study further promotes the practical application of EVs in the future automotive market and lays a solid foundation for intelligent torque distribution in autonomous EVs.

AB An automatic parking system is an essential part of autonomous driving, and it starts by recognizing vacant parking spaces. This paper proposes a method that can recognize various types of parking slot markings in a variety of lighting conditions including daytime, nighttime, and underground. The proposed method can readily be commercialized since it uses only those sensors already mounted on off-the-shelf vehicles: an around-view monitor (AVM) system, ultrasonic sensors, and in-vehicle motion sensors. This method first detects separating lines by extracting parallel line pairs from AVM images. Parking slot candidates are generated by pairing separating lines based on the geometric constraints of the parking slot. These candidates are confirmed by recognizing their entrance positions using line and corner features and classifying their occupancies using ultrasonic sensors. For more reliable recognition, this method uses the separating lines and parking slots not only found in the current image but also found in previous images by tracking their positions using the in-vehicle motion-sensor-based vehicle odometry. The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated using a dataset obtained during the day, night, and underground, and it outperformed previous methods by showing a 95.24% recall and a 97.64% precision.

AB In navigation and motion control of an autonomous vehicle, estimation of attitude and heading is an important issue especially when the localization sensors such as GPS are not available and the vehicle is navigated by the dead reckoning (DR) strategies. In this paper, based on a new modeling framework an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is utilized for estimation of attitude, heading and gyroscope sensor bias using a low-cost MEMS inertial sensor. The algorithm is developed for accurate estimation of attitude and heading in the presence of external disturbances including external body accelerations and magnetic disturbances. In this study using the proposed attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) and an odometer sensor, a low-cost aided DR navigation system has been designed. The proposed algorithm application is evaluated by experimental tests in different acceleration bound and existence of external magnetic disturbances for a land vehicle. The results indicate that the roll, pitch and heading are estimated by mean value errors about 0.83%, 0.68% and 1.13%, respectively. Moreover, they indicate that a relative navigation error about 3% of the traveling distance can be achieved using the developed approach in during GPS outages. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the emergence of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), the mixed traffic environment where conventional human-driven vehicles (HVs) share the road space with CAVs is impending. Targeted management of such mixed traffic flow at intersections is of practical significance, inspiring the theoretical exploration of CAVs impacts on intersection capacity in this study. Penetration rate and platooning behavior of CAVs are the major concern. Not only the three core platooning parameters (intra-platoon gap, inter-platoon gap and platoon size) are investigated, but also the individual willingness of CAVs to form platoons is innovatively considered. Intersection capacity is modeled as an objective function of a linear program problem that maximizes the sum of throughput of each stream crossing the intersection under collision-free constraints. These constraints are determined by the conflicting relationship of vehicles on different streams and the vehicle's average occupation time of conflict points. The average occupation time is defined by adopting the service time concept in queueing theory, and specified by applying the Markov chain theory considering the spatial distribution of heterogeneous vehicle headways in mixed traffic. This study provides a practical procedure to analyze the influence of CAVs on mixed traffic at intersections, without the need to determine specific intersection management methods. Corollaries drawn are basically consistent with expectations, except that high CAV penetration does not necessarily correspond to high intersection capacity. In order for the influence of penetration to be positive, the platooning willingness must be controlled within the corresponding range, suggesting that CAV penetration rate and platooning willingness should be considered jointly when updating intersection management for mixed CAVs-HVs traffic flow. Furthermore, numerical analyses are carried out to corroborate the analytical conclusions.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the recent advancements in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), two important factors that play a vital role to avoid accidents and collisions are obstacles and track detection. AVs must implement an accident detection model to detect accident vehicles and avoid running into rollover vehicles. At present many trajectories-based and sensor-based multiple-vehicle accident prediction models exist. In Taiwan, the AV Tesla sedan's failure to detect overturned vehicles shows that an efficient deep learning model is still required to detect a single-car crash by taking appropriate actions like slowing down, tracking changes, and informing the concerned authorities. This paper proposes a novel car crash detection system for various car crashes using three deep learning models, namely VGG16(feature extractor using transfer learning), RPN (region proposal network), and CNN8L (region-based detector). The CNN8L is a novel lightweight sequential convolutional neural network for region-based classification and detection. The model is trained using a customized dataset, evaluated using different metrics and compared with various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results show that the VGG16 combined with the CNN8L model performed much better when compared to other models. The proposed system accurately recognizes car accidents with an Accident Detection Rate (ADR) of 86.25% and False Alarm Rate (FAR) of 33.00%.

ID GUIDANCE
AB The autonomous driving is rapid developing recently and model predictive controls (MPCs) have been widely used in unmanned vehicle trajectory tracking. MPCs are advantageous because of their predictive modeling, rolling optimization, and feedback correction. In recent years, most studies on unmanned vehicle trajectory tracking have used only linear model predictive controls to solve MPC algorithm shortcomings in real time. Previous studies have not investigated problems under conditions where speeds are too fast or trajectory curvatures change rapidly, because of the poor accuracy of approximate linearization. A nonlinear model predictive control optimization algorithm based on the collocation method is proposed, which can reduce calculation load. The algorithm aims to reduce trajectory tracking errors while ensuring real-time performance. Monte Carlo simulations of the uncertain systems are carried out to analyze the robustness of the algorithm. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation and actual vehicle experiments were also conducted. Experiment results show that under i7-8700, the calculation time is less than 100 ms, and the mean square error of the lateral deviation is maintained at10-3 m2, which proves the proposed algorithm can meet the requirement of real time and accuracy in some particular situations. The unmanned vehicle trajectory tracking method provided in this article can meet the needs of real-time control.

AB This paper addresses the trajectory tracking problem for the constrained dynamical underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) in the presence of dynamic uncertainties, sensory measurement noises, and time-varying external disturbances. An adaptive robust fast computational optimal control scheme is presented for the large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) constrained dynamical UVMS. The structure of our proposed scheme is based on a fast incremental model predictive controller (MPC) embedded with an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The EKF estimation part is used to compensate the unmodeled uncertainties, sensory noises, and external disturbances. The fast MPC (FMPC) part is a trajectory-tracking controller designed by the terminal constrained MPC with an approximately fast computational cost function, which guarantees the optimal batch control process satisfying the state and input constraints. By resorting to a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FMPC is proved to be asymptotically stable with a monotonic decrease in the cost function, and can guarantee the tracking performance of the constrained dynamical UVMS. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified through a series of comparative simulations of a six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) vehicle-6DOF manipulator system.

AB Smart monitoring has been studied and developed in recent years to create faster, cheaper, and more user-friendly on-site methods. The present study describes an innovative technology for investigative monitoring of heavy metal pollution (Cu and Pb) in surface water. It is composed of an autonomous surface vehicle capable of semiautonomous driving and equipped with a microfluidic device for detection of heavy metals. Detection is based on the method of square wave anodic stripping voltammetry using carbon-based screen-printed electrodes (SPEs). The focus of this work was to validate the ability of the integrated system to perform on-site detection of heavy metal pollution plumes in river catchments. This scenario was simulated in laboratory experiments. The main performance characteristics of the system, which was evaluated based on ISO 15839 were measurement bias (Pb 75%, Cu 65%), reproducibility (in terms of relative standard deviation: Pb 11-18%, Cu 6-10%) and the limit of detection (4 mu g/L for Pb and 7 mu g/L for Cu). The lowest detectable change (LDC), which is an important performance characteristic for this application, was estimated to be 4-5 mu g/L for Pb and 6-7 mu g/L for Cu. The life span of an SPE averaged 39 measurements per day, which is considered sufficient for intended monitoring campaigns. This work demonstrated the suitability of the integrated system for on-site detection of Pb and Cu emissions from large and medium urban areas discharging into small water bodies.

AB A fundamental problem in autonomous vehicle navigation is the identification of obstacle free space in cluttered and unstructured environments. Features such as walls, people, furniture, doors and stairs, etc are potential hazards. The approach taken in this paper is motivated by the recent development on infra-red time-of-flight cameras that provide video frame rate low resolution depth maps. We propose to exploit the temporal information content provided by the high refresh rate of such cameras to overcome the limitations due to low spatial resolution and high depth uncertainty and aim to provide robust and accurate estimates of planar surfaces in the environment. These surfaces' estimates are then used to provide statistical tests to identify obstacles and dangers in the environment. Classical 3D spatial RANSAC is extended to 40 spatio-temporal RANSAC by developing spatio-temporal models of planar surfaces that incorporate a linear motion model as well as linear environment features. A 4D-vector product is used for hypotheses generation from data that is randomly sampled across both spatial and temporal variations. The algorithm is fully posed in the spatio-temporal representation and there is no need to correlate points or hypothesis between temporal images. The proposed algorithm is computationally fast and robust for estimation of planar surfaces in general and the ground plane in particular. There are potential applications in mobile robotics, autonomous vehicular navigation, and automotive safety systems. The claims of the paper are supported by experimental results obtained from real video data for a time-of-flight range sensor mounted on an automobile navigating in an undercover parking lot.

AB This article discusses the highly autonomous robotic search and localization of radiation sources in outdoor environments. The cooperation between a human operator, an unmanned aerial vehicle, and an unmanned ground vehicle is used to render the given mission highly effective, in accordance with the idea that the search for potential radiation sources should be fast, precise, and reliable. Each of the components assumes its own role in the mission; the unmanned aerial vehicle (in our case, a multirotor) is responsible for fast data acquisition to create an accurate orthophoto and terrain map of the zone of interest. Aerial imagery is georeferenced directly, using an onboard sensor system, and no ground markers are required. The unmanned aerial vehicle can also perform rough radiation measurement, if necessary. Since the map contains three-dimensional information about the environment, algorithms to compute the spatial gradient, which represents the rideability, can be designed. Based on the primary aerial map, the human operator defines the area of interest to be examined by the applied unmanned ground vehicle carrying highly sensitive gamma-radiation probe/probes. As the actual survey typically embodies the most time-consuming problem within the mission, major emphasis is put on optimizing the unmanned ground vehicle trajectory planning; however, the dual-probe (differential) approach to facilitate directional sensitivity also finds use in the given context. The unmanned ground vehicle path planning from the pre-mission position to the center of the area of interest is carried out in the automated mode, similarly to the previously mentioned steps. Although the human operator remains indispensable, most of the tasks are performed autonomously, thus substantially reducing the load on the operator to enable them to focus on other actions during the search mission. Although gamma radiation is used as the demonstrator, most of the proposed algorithms and tasks are applicable on a markedly wider basis, including, for example, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear missions and environmental measurement tasks.

AB Featured Application
   The vehicle detection algorithm proposed in this work could be used in autonomous driving systems to understand the environment, or could be applied in surveillance systems to extract useful transportation information through a camera.
   Vehicle detection as a special case of object detection has practical meaning but faces challenges, such as the difficulty of detecting vehicles of various orientations, the serious influence from occlusion, the clutter of background, etc. In addition, existing effective approaches, like deep-learning-based ones, demand a large amount of training time and data, which causes trouble for their application. In this work, we propose a dictionary-learning-based vehicle detection approach which explicitly addresses these problems. Specifically, an ensemble of sparse-and-dense dictionaries (ESDD) are learned through supervised low-rank decomposition; each pair of sparse-and-dense dictionaries (SDD) in the ensemble is trained to represent either a subcategory of vehicle (corresponding to certain orientation range or occlusion level) or a subcategory of background (corresponding to a cluster of background patterns) and only gives good reconstructions to samples of the corresponding subcategory, making the ESDD capable of classifying vehicles from background even though they exhibit various appearances. We further organize ESDD into a two-level cascade (CESDD) to perform coarse-to-fine two-stage classification for better performance and computation reduction. The CESDD is then coupled with a downstream AdaBoost process to generate robust classifications. The proposed CESDD model is used as a window classifier in a sliding-window scan process over image pyramids to produce multi-scale detections, and an adapted mean-shift-like non-maximum suppression process is adopted to remove duplicate detections. Our CESDD vehicle detection approach is evaluated on KITTI dataset and compared with other strong counterparts; the experimental results exhibit the effectiveness of CESDD-based classification and detection, and the training of CESDD only demands small amount of time and data.

TI Optimization Drive on a Flat Tire Vehicular System for Autonomous

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

ID DESIGN
AB The run-on flat tire is an important technology in the area of vehicle safety technology. Nowadays, traveling by a personal vehicle from one place to another has increased due to the increase in the global economy. The main problem that is faced while traveling is tire puncture. The tire may get punctured by any sharp objects on the road such as screws and iron pins that traps the tire surface. A situation like this may be overcome by the usage of the drive on a puncher tire device which will be used to reach the destination without any need for a puncher shop. Using this device will reduce the damage of the tire and tube. This device is portable and can be placed in a vehicle itself. For this reason, a design has been developed by the CATIA 3D experience. The drive on a puncher tire device was designed using the software developed by the Dassault systems named CATIA 3D experience. Aluminum alloy was chosen as the base material to design and simulate this product. Also, the network distribution simulations were used to develop the mathematical equations to check the adequacy of the model. This device is very useful while traveling long distances if any puncher will occur. The sensors were attached to the product to receive the signal from the vehicle, so that the vehicle will run smoothly for a short distance. Drive on a puncher tire will be suitable for both two- and four-wheeler vehicles and also useful for all the areas like villages, towns, panchayats, and cities. If the tire is puncher, we cannot drive the vehicle; hence, a skating device is fixed at a tired bottom, which is used to move the vehicle. The proposal will be beneficial for a huge number of people who own two and four wheelers. This design and simulation will address the problem of the two- and four-wheeler owners traveling long distances.

AB This article proposes an autonomous aerial exploration framework for traversable path finding of ground robots in unknown environments to achieve a fast response in search and rescue (SAR) missions. Different from existing works, our method provides a task-oriented active exploration strategy that makes the aerial robot fully autonomous during the exploration and does not require human intervention. To identify the candidate regions which ground robots can go through, a fast incremental traversability estimation algorithm is presented, which can evaluate the traversability of the region of interest (ROI) efficiently. Based on the traversability map, we propose a highly efficient frontier detection algorithm that can guarantee both reachability and safety of the extracted frontiers. To reduce the total response time of the whole robot system, a new cost function considering both the time costs of the aerial and ground robots is designed that aims to avoid back-and-forth motion behavior during aerial exploration. The performance of our approach is evaluated in both simulation and real-world experiments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of traversability estimation and frontier detection time (about one order of magnitude faster) as well as the response time (at least 13% shorter on average).

AB In the past decades, we have witnessed significant progress in the domain of autonomous driving. Advanced techniques based on optimization and reinforcement learning become increasingly powerful when solving the forward problem: given designed reward/cost functions, how we should optimize them and obtain driving policies that interact with the environment safely and efficiently. Such progress has raised another equally important question: what should we optimize? Instead of manually specifying the reward functions, it is desired that we can extract what human drivers try to optimize from real traffic data and assign that to autonomous vehicles to enable more naturalistic and transparent interaction between humans and intelligent agents. To address this issue, we present an efficient sampling-based maximum-entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm in this letter. Different from existing IRL algorithms, by introducing an efficient continuous-domain trajectory sampler, the proposed algorithm can directly learn the reward functions in the continuous domain while considering the uncertainties in demonstrated trajectories from human drivers. We evaluate the proposed algorithm via real-world driving data, including both non-interactive and interactive scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves more accurate prediction performance with faster convergence speed and better generalization compared to other baseline IRL algorithms.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining growing interests due to the paramount roles they play, particularly these days, in enabling new services that help modernize our transportation, supply chain, search and rescue, among others. They are capable of positively influencing wireless systems through enabling and fostering emerging technologies such as autonomous driving, vertical industries, virtual reality and so many others. The Internet of Vehicles is a prime sector benefiting from the services offered by future cellular systems in general and UAVs in particular, and this paper considers the problem of content delivery to vehicles on road segments with either overloaded or no available communication infrastructure. Incoming vehicles demand service from a library of contents that is partially cached at the UAV; the content of the library is also assumed to change as new vehicles carrying more popular contents arrive. Each inbound vehicle makes a request and the UAV decides on its best trajectory to provide service while maximizing a certain operational utility. Given the energy limitation at the UAV, we seek an energy efficient solution. Hence, our problem consists of jointly finding caching decisions, UAV trajectory and radio resource allocation which is formulated mathematically as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP). However, owing to uncertainties in the environment (e.g., random arrival of vehicles, their requests for contents and their existing contents), it is often hard and impractical to solve using standard optimization techniques. To this end, we formulate our problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and we resort to tools such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a very promising Reinforcement Learning method, along with a set of crafted algorithms to solve our problem. Finally, we conduct simulation-based experiments to analyze and demonstrate the superiority of our solution approach compared with four counterparts and baseline schemes.

AB Driving articulated heavy vehicles (AHVs) at high-speeds is complicated due to their unstable motion modes. Accelerated motion trajectory planning is essential for collision avoidance (CA) maneuver in dynamic traffic conditions. This article proposes a new trajectory planning strategy for collision-free and feasible maneuver of a tractor semi-trailer truck in critical conditions in which the truck and the obstacles are moving with non-constant speeds. For this purpose, a convenient optimal practical trajectory for different tire-road frictional conditions, the physical limitation of the tires, and the stability status of the truck is suggested. The main strategy of the trajectory planning is to increase the capability of the control system using the longitudinal and lateral forces of the tires. A robust integrated controller is then proposed to control the longitudinal and lateral directions of the AHV of which the longitudinal controller is configured to track the longitudinal position considering the vehicle stability conditions, and the lateral controller is organized to follow the yaw rate, the lateral position of the tractor, and the articulation angle. The results show that the proposed novel strategy with integrated longitudinal and lateral control has convenient performance in high-speed and low friction conditions as well as normal situations.

AB This paper presents the modelling and simulation of an anti-tip-over control designed for a counterbalance forklift, a highly unstable vehicle in relation with roll and pith angles. The studied forklift is an automated guided vehicle and it does not depend on the human factor, being possible to enhance safety by improving stability. Therefore, the main purpose of this work is to design a control system that improves forklifts' stability and, at the same time, reduces the transportation times with the subsequent operating cost savings. Firstly, an analytical study is developed, focused on the pitch movement, in order to analyze the stability conditions of the vehicle. Based on this analysis, an anti-tip-over control is designed. This control is based on Model Predictive Control, a robust control technique that is being successfully used in the design of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is to show the feasibility of the MPC control in this type of vehicles. Several simulations have been done in order to analyze the feasibility of concluding that with the proposed control, it is possible to guaranty the forklift stability without the risk of tip-over, obtaining also better operational results with faster maneuvers than when no control is used.

AB In this paper, we aimed to achieve the indoor tracking control of a two-wheeled inverted pendulum (TWIP) vehicle. The attitude data are acquired from a low cost micro inertial measurement unit (IMU), and the ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is utilized to obtain an accurate estimation of the TWIP's position. We propose a dual-loop control method to realize the simultaneous balance and trajectory tracking control for the TWIP vehicle. A robust adaptive second-order sliding mode control (2-RASMC) method based on an improved super-twisting (STW) algorithm is investigated to obtain the control laws, followed by several simulations to verify its robustness. The outer loop controller is designed using the idea of backstepping. Moreover, three typical trajectories, including a circle, a trifolium and a hexagon, have been designed to prove the adaptability of the control combinations. Six different combinations of inner and outer loop control algorithms have been compared, and the characteristics of inner and outer loop algorithm combinations have been analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate its tracking performance and thus verify the validity of the proposed control methods. Trajectory tracking experiments in a real indoor environment have been performed using our experimental vehicle to further validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm in practice.

AB A wind power curtailment consumption strategy using electric vehicles (EVs) based on individual differential evolution quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (IDE-QPSO) is proposed, with the objective of reducing the system's wind curtailment in order to further improve the wind power consumption rate while effectively reducing wind power output fluctuation and amplitude. EV aggregators act as charging tariff setters, releasing dynamic time-of-use tariffs (DTOU) for EV clusters to respond to based on wind curtailment data accounted for by the dispatch center. This method first establishes an electric vehicle charging load model based on the travel chain theory and residents' travel rules, then establishes an EV users autonomous response model based on the sensitivity of electric vehicle users to the charging prices. Second, a multi-objective optimization function is established based on the aforementioned model, which integrates wind power curtailment consumption and minimizes wind power output fluctuation and amplitude, and it is solved using an improved quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, adequate simulation experiments show that this strategy can effectively smooth out the fluctuation of wind power output and improve the wind power consumption rate. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Drone deployment has become crucial in a variety of applications, including solutions to traffic issues in metropolitan areas and highways. On the other hand, data collected via drones suffers from several problems, including a wide range of object scales, angle variations, truncation, and occlusion. To process and manipulate visual data from the drones, a variety of image processing algorithms have been employed, each with a distinct aim. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning, have attracted broad interest and are being applied to many domains in the framework of smart cities, including road traffic monitoring. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of drone-based traffic monitoring systems from a deep learning perspective. This work focuses on vehicle detection, tracking, and counting, since they are fundamental building blocks towards founding solutions for traffic congestion, flow rate and vehicle speed estimation. Additionally, drone-based datasets are examined, which face issues and problems caused by the diversity of features inherent of drone devices. The review analysis presented in this work summarizes the literature solutions provided and deployed so far and discusses future research trends in establishing a comprehensive traffic monitoring system in support of the development of smart cities.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) methods for energy saving and greening have recently appeared in the field of autonomous driving. In inter-vehicle communication (IVC), a feasible and increasingly popular research direction of RL is to obtain the optimal action decision of agents in a special environment. This paper presents the application of reinforcement learning in the vehicle communication simulation framework (Veins). In this research, we explore the application of reinforcement learning algorithms in a green cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) platoon. Our aim is to train member vehicles to react appropriately in the event of a severe collision involving the leading vehicle. We seek to reduce collision damage and optimize energy consumption by encouraging behavior that conforms to the platoon's environmentally friendly aim. Our study provides insight into the potential benefits of using reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the safety and efficiency of CACC platoons while promoting sustainable transportation. The policy gradient algorithm used in this paper has good convergence in the calculation of the minimum energy consumption problem and the optimal solution of vehicle behavior. In terms of energy consumption metrics, the policy gradient algorithm is used first in the IVC field for training the proposed platoon problem. It is a feasible training decision-planning algorithm for solving the minimization of energy consumption caused by decision making in platoon avoidance behavior.

AB The rapid conceptual development and commercialization of connected automated vehicle (CAV) has led to the problem of mixed traffic, i.e., traffic mixed with CAVs and conventional human -operated vehicles (HVs). The paper studies cooperative decision-making for mixed traffic (CDMMT). Using discrete optimization, a CDMMT mechanism is developed to facilitate ramp merging, and to properly capture the cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors in mixed traffic. The CDMMT mechanism can be described as a bi-level optimization program in which state -constrained optimal control-based trajectory design problems are imbedded in a sequencing problem. A bi-level dynamic programming-based solution approach is developed to efficiently solve the problem. The proposed modeling mechanism and solution approach are generic to deterministic decisions and can guarantee system-efficient solutions. A micro-simulation environment is built for model validation and analysis of mixed traffic. The results show that compared to the scenario with 100% HVs, ramp-merging can be smoother in mixed traffic environment. At high CAV penetration, the section throughput increases about 18%. With the proposed CDMMT mechanism, traffic throughput can be further increased by 10-15%. The proposed methods form the basis of traffic analysis and cooperative control at ramp-merging sections under mixed traffic environment.y

AB Active collision avoidance system has received more and more attraction, which has the capability to avoid potential accidents and reduce driver burden. This paper proposes an active collision avoidance system which consists of a path planner and a coordinated lateral controller. In the path planner, cubic B-spline is developed to obtain collision-free trajectories to bypass the obstacle by steering. Based on this, a coordinated lateral dynamic control of autonomous ground vehicles is presented to improve the accuracy and robustness of path following and simultaneously ensure vehicle stability via active front steering and direct yaw moment control. Then, second-order sliding mode control, based on super-twisting algorithm, is applied to reduce lateral offset and heading angle deviation as much as possible and avoid chattering phenomenon of tradition sliding mode control. Meanwhile, a new form of sliding mode control based on improved reaching law is devoted to forcing the vehicle state sideslip angle and yaw rate to stability envelope with less chattering in the case of low road friction coefficient. Eventually, the effectiveness and robustness of active collision avoidance system against external disturbance and parametric uncertainties are confirmed through different test cases in the MATLAB/Simulink simulation platform.

AB Despite the potential of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), there are still many open questions on how road capacity can be influenced and what methods can be used to assess its expected benefits in the progressive transition towards fully cooperative driving. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the benefits of CAV technologies by investigating mobility-related issues of automated vehicles operating with a cooperative adaptive cruise control system on roundabout efficiency using microscopic traffic simulation. The availability of the adjustment factors for CAVs provided by the 2022 Highway Capacity Manual allowed to adjust the entry capacity equations to reflect the presence of CAVs on roundabouts. Two mechanisms of entry maneuver based on the entry lane type were examined to compare the capacity target values with the simulated capacities. The microscopic traffic simulator Aimsun Next has been of great help in building the "what-if" traffic scenarios that we analysed to endorse hypothesis on the model parameters which affect the CAVs' capabilities to increase roundabouts' throughput. The results highlighted that the increasing penetration rates of CAVs have greater impacts on the operational performances of roundabouts, and provided a synthetic insight to assess the potential benefits of CAVs from an efficiency perspective.

AB We explored the structure of public attitudes on whether self-driving vehicles (SDVs) should be allowed on public roads, through a four-way typology of attitudes (positive, negative, ambivalent, and indifferent). We segmented participants based on a single item, according to which participants allocated themselves to one of the four attitudinal groups, and characterized the demographic and psychological profiles of the four groups in a paper-and-pencil survey in Tianjin, China (N = 816). Nearly half of the participants were in the ambivalent group, followed by the positive group, with these two groups comprising 82% of the sample. Compared to the ambivalent group, the positive group had more participants who had heard of SDVs, more males, higher income, and more licensed drivers. The positive, negative, and two middle groups (ambivalent and indifferent) differed significantly on benefit and risk perceptions, whereas the two middle groups did not differ on benefit and risk perceptions, ambivalence, or interest in SDVs. These four groups clearly differed on two behavioral components of attitude, behavioral intention and willingness to pay. Their rank (from highest to lowest) was positive, ambivalent, indifferent, and negative, for both behavioral components. The findings offer novel insights into the complex structure of public attitudes toward SDVs.

AB New technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles are going to change the future of traffic signal control and management and possibly will introduce new traffic signal systems that will be based on floating car data (FCD). The use of floating car data to regulate traffic signal systems, in real time, has the potential for an increased sustainability of transportation in terms of energy efficiency, traffic safety and environmental issues. However, research has never explored how not connected vehicles would benefit by the implementation of such systems. This paper explores the use of floating car data to regulate traffic signal systems in real-time in a single intersection and in terms of cooperative-competitive paradigm between connected vehicles and conventional vehicles. In a dedicated laboratory, developed for testing regulation algorithms, results show that invisible vehicles for the system (which are not connected) in most simulated cases also benefit when real time traffic signal settings based on floating car data are introduced. Moreover, the study estimates the energy and air quality impacts of a single intersection signal regulation by evaluating fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Specifically, the study demonstrates that significant improvements in air quality are possible with the introduction of FCD regulated traffic signals.

AB The ambition of getting one common tool for a great variety of navigation tasks was the background for the development of NavLab (Navigation Laboratory). The main emphasis during the development has been a solid theoretical foundation with a stringent mathematical representation to ensure that statistical optimality is maintained throughout the entire system. NavLab is implemented in Matlab, and consists of a simulator and an estimator.
   Simulations are carried out by specifying a trajectory for the vehicle, and the available types of sensors. The output is a set of simulated sensor measurements.
   The estimator is a flexible aided inertial navigation system, which makes optimal Kalman filtered and smoothed estimates of position, attitude and velocity based on the available set of measurements. The measurements can be either from the simulator or from real sensors of a vehicle.
   This structure snakes NavLab useful for a wide range of navigation applications, including research and development, analysis, real data post-processing and as a decision basis for sensor purchase and mission planning. NavLab has been used extensively for mass-production of accurate navigation results (having post-processed more than 5000 hours of real data in four continents). Vehicles navigated by NavLab include autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), remote operated vehicles (ROVs), ships and aircraft.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB An essential aspect of intelligent driving systems is the automatic lane-changing function. However, in real -world traffic situations, the initially planned lane-changing trajectory can become hazardous due to the intricate and unpredictable nature of human driving behavior. Based on the assumption that vehicles have risks during lane-changing, an integrated methodology is proposed to assess the hazards associated with road conditions in real-time and to quickly adjust the predetermined vehicle trajectory, if deemed necessary, to mitigate the risks of conflicting lane changes. Vehicles are encouraged to adhere to lane changing behavior by adjusting their trajectory, aiming to enhance traffic efficiency. Instead of immediately abandoning lane changing, vehicles should strategically assess the situation before making decisions. Initially, an analysis of variables influencing re-planning is conducted, determining the circumstances conducive to maintaining lane -changing behavior. Subsequently, a trajectory re-planning module is introduced, facilitated by two neural network data-fitting models, allowing real-time performance. Finally, a series of numerical experiments confirm that the devised method effectively guides autonomous driving through quick and secure lane change re-planning in high-risk traffic environments. The proposed novel approach extends the capacity to target traffic flow gaps and dynamically re-plan lane switching motivations, ensuring the vehicle can persist in lane-changing rather than reverting to the original lane.

AB Truck platooning is the linking of two or more trucks in convoy, using connectivity technology and automated driving support systems. For the wide deployment of platooning, multi-brand, i.e. interoperable, solutions are paramount. To achieve this, the European ENSEMBLE (ENabling SafE Multi-Brand pLatooning for Europe) project has been conducted. In this project, amongst others, all European truck manufacturers worked together to define harmonized multi-brand specifications for two different levels of platooning: a Platooning Support Function (PSF) and a Platooning Autonomous Function (PAF). The PSF aims towards fast deployment, whereas the PAF gives an outlook on the future of platooning when more advanced automated driving technologies become available. This paper describes the definition and specifications for the first level of platooning, the Platooning Support Function. It comprises a set of use cases, specifications and requirements for the common functionality. Part of the specifications is an interaction protocol, which also encompasses a security framework. To verify the definitions and to expedite standardization, all truck manufacturers implemented the PSF and this was tested in several multi-brand settings to conclude that the specifications result in technically feasible solutions.

AB Automated vehicles (AV) will change transport supply and influence travel demand. To evaluate those changes, existing travel demand models need to be extended. This paper presents ways of integrating characteristics of AV into traditional macroscopic travel demand models based on the four-step algorithm. It discusses two model extensions. The first extension allows incorporating impacts of AV on traffic flow performance by assigning specific passenger car unit factors that depend on roadway type and the capabilities of the vehicles. The second extension enables travel demand models to calculate demand changes caused by a different perception of travel time as the active driving time is reduced. The presented methods are applied to a use case of a regional macroscopic travel demand model. The basic assumption is that AV are considered highly but not fully automated and still require a driver for parts of the trip. Model results indicate that first-generation AV, probably being rather cautious, may decrease traffic performance. Further developed AV will improve performance on some parts of the network. Together with a reduction in active driving time, cars will become even more attractive, resulting in a modal shift towards car. Both circumstances lead to an increase in time spent and distance traveled.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Recently, the research on the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) has been paid more attention by researchers with the quick development of the autonomous driving technology. In the VANET, vehicles can communicate with everything through the route established by routing algorithms. However, the topology of the VANET changes fast because the vehicles move fast. Also, as the number of vehicles increases, the probability of data collision and the transmission latency will also increase when communicating. Therefore, the VANET needs a stable, low-latency, and efficient route for vehicles to communicate with each other. However, the existing routing algorithms are either unable to aggregate data or are not suitable for the large-size VANET. In this paper, we consider the vehicle attribute information comprehensively and cluster the vehicles on the road by using the cluster algorithm we propose. We dynamically select the cluster heads at each moment according to their attribute information. We consider all kinds of nodes in the network and the vehicle nodes will communicate with each other through the cluster heads under the two-level communicating algorithm we propose. Compared with the existing cluster routing algorithm, the algorithm we propose is much more suitable for the large-size VANET because the cluster heads do not need a gateway to help them communicate. In the simulation part, we set some real street scenes in Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and the vehicles can move by the traffic rules like in the real world, which is more suitable for the VANET. After analysing the communication performance in Network Simulator version 2 (NS2), we can get a conclusion that the algorithm proposed is superior to the traditional routing algorithm. The route established by the algorithm we propose is much more stable and efficient. And the latency is also lower than the former.

ID HOLE ATTACK; IDENTIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; PACKETS
AB One of the network performance challenges of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) is the Black Hole attack. This destructive attack severely damages the network performance if succeeded. By replying to a route request with the minimum routing cost and the maximum sequence number (SN) value, the malicious vehicle can fool the source vehicle that it has the "freshest" and best cost-effective route to the destination vehicle. As a result, all data packets intended to a legitimate destination are caught and destroyed by the malicious vehicle. This may also cause a serious risk for autonomous vehicle control system or traffic warning applications. Previous published malicious detection algorithms suffer high error rates when the malicious node uses a "close-to-legitimate" SN value to attack or actively change the information in the route reply packet. This paper proposes a Black Hole Attack Detection Algorithm (BADA) based on a machine learning approach. In VANETs, it is a challenge to differentiate the behavior of malicious vehicles as they try to avoid detection by imitating that of the normal vehicles. The BADA classification algorithm outperforms existing solutions because it relies on the history of each vehicle's route request and response behavior, and it deploys the k-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm to identify malicious vehicles. The paper also proposes a Black hole Attack Detection Routing Protocol which utilizes the proposed BADA solution to realize a more secured and improved AODV-based protocol. Using the NS2 simulation system, the paper evaluates the performance of the proposed protocol and compares it with related solutions on the traffic network model in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam under black hole attacks using minimum SN values. Simulation results have shown that the proposed algorithm can correctly detect the malicious node higher than 99.0%, outperforming previously published algorithms.

AB With the evolution of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and intelligent transportation systems, intelligent connected vehicles (ICV) are becoming the trend in automobile industry worldwide. Assisted by road-side infrastructure and vehicle-mounted sensors, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) data services are gradually growing more popular with drivers and passengers. In particular, IVI data services are not only restricted to internal cabin, but also are being extended to the external environment (e.g., workplace and home). These data categories include personal demographics/bioinformatics, usage habits, travel patterns, real-time location, audio, video, etc., which in turn induce perceived risk concerns around the data privacy and security of occupants. In this paper, we collect answers from 500 valid respondents and then construct a structural equation model to investigate key factors influencing users' attitudes and behavioral intention (BI) towards IVI data services. Therein, trust is considered to play a vital role in attitude, and is assumed to be affected by perceived security risk (PSR), perceived privacy risk (PPR), and perceived performance risk (PFR). The results show that PSR and PPR have negative effects on user trust. The data breache anxiety positively influences PPR, which explain 75% of variance. In addition, trust can directly affect attitude and BI, which explain 28.6% of variance in attitudes towards IVI data services. Respondents score higher on average for attitude (Mean = 5.762, SD = 0.89) even where perceived risks exist. BI is influenced by the factors of PSR, PFR, trust, and attitude. Through this study, we intend to reveal the relationships among the factors of perceived risk, trust, attitude, and BI towards IVI data services, then provide guidelines for vehicular data governance in order to consolidate user trust for a safer mobility ecosystem.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; MOTION; NAVIGATION
AB Artificial potential field (APF) theory has been extensively applied in traffic path planning as an efficient method to avoid collision. However, studies in collision avoidance based on APF theory only considered the movement of single vehicle. In this paper, a vehicle cooperative control model for avoiding collision in the connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) environment is presented, using APF theory. The proposed model not merely guarantees the travel safety of vehicles in avoiding collision, but also promotes driving comfort and improves traffic efficiency. To verify the cooperative control model, simulations of four scenarios are designed and compared with the human driving environment. Five indicators are selected to evaluate the results, that is, time-space diagram, time mean speed (TMS), the rate of large deceleration time (large deceleration is that deceleration larger than -2 m/s(2)), the inverse time-to-collision (TTC-1), and lane-changing times. According to the simulation results, the cooperative control model could alleviate the capacity drop and increase the TMS to improve traffic efficiency, reduce the rate of the large deceleration time to promote driving comfort, and decreaseTTC-1to promote safety in small and large input flow rates. The results reveal the proposed model is significantly superior to the human driving environment whether in free or congested situations, except for the lane-change times, which are slightly larger.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) channel measurements have shown that the propagation environment of UAV channel is non-stationary. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary UAV multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model is proposed. In order to sufficiently describe the propagation environment of UAV-MIMO channel, the stationary scatterers and moving scatterers are investigated in the proposed model, which are mimicked using 3D cylinder and two-dimensional (2D) disc, respectively. The Doppler shifts associated with moving scatterers are also considered in the proposed model. The movement of UAV, receiver, and moving scatterers results in non-stationarities, and time-variant distances, azimuth angles, and elevation angles are investigated in the proposed model. The statistical properties of the moving scatterers are also investigated in the proposed channel model. In order to validate the proposed model, the spatial correlation is compared with the measurement results, and the numerical results show that the proposed channel model is applicable to describe the UAV-MIMO communication systems.

AB As electric cars become more widespread, the disposal and recycling of used batteries will become an important challenge. Typically, vehicle batteries are replaced if their capacity drops to 70-80% of initial capacity. However, they may still be useful for stationary applications.
   In this paper, results from a field test of a molten salt high-temperature electric vehicle battery repurposed as stationary storage for grid balancing are presented. In a previous study, we have shown that a mixed integer linear programming control strategy driven by a spot-market price for electricity is best suited for an implementation on hardware with limited computational resources.
   A 14-day experiment resulted in a round-trip energy efficiency (converter-battery-converter) of about 74.4%. The earnings per battery capacity per day achieved in this period amounted to 7.38 (sic)/MWh. An error analysis of the model underlying the optimization showed a root mean square error of 7.6% between the estimated and measured state of charge.
   The field test implementation shows a substantial economic deviation of 37.3% between theoretical and physical potential of grid-balancing measures due to model inaccuracies and technical characteristics, thereby demonstrating the urgent need for field tests of repurposed electric vehicle batteries for stationary applications.

AB To achieve the autonomous cable-laying operation under the varying depth, this note investigates the path following problem of underactuated cable-laying vehicles with constraints of the unknown actuator gain. A double-stage logical (DSL) guidance principle is developed to realize the practical laying path programming for the cable-laying vehicle. In the guidance law, the catenary model is incorporated to derive the towing distance, i.e., the horizontal projection distance between the cable landing point and the vehicle's gravity center. That can guarantee the cable-laying operation is solidly implemented in the condition of the varying depth. As for the control part, the composite neural event-triggered control algorithm is proposed by fusing the zero-order holder (ZOH) to stabilize the track error between the target position and the actual one. The event-triggered mechanism is employed to effectively reduce the occupancy of the communication channel between sensors and controllers. Moreover, for the merits of robust neural damping and composite learning techniques, the gain uncertainty of actuators can be compensated by updating two adaptive laws online. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system is rigorously performed via Lyapunov criterion and simulation results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed scheme.

AB Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is a promising reinforcement learning technique with the potential to resolve complicated tasks and handle high-dimensional state/action spaces. However, it suffers from sample inefficiency, requiring a high number of training samples. To speed up the training, we propose c-annealing and Q-learning switching methods to aid the training of DDPG with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller to solve priority calculation and merging of autonomous vehicles at roundabouts. We further expand the Q-learning switch with double replay memory and Nash Q-value updates. The performance of these switching methods are compared to DDPG and demonstrate that Nash switch outperforms other methods. To reduce conservativeness, we test training using variable traffic density. We test three selection methods inside Q-learning and show constant threshold switch has at least ten times higher mean reward for 50 episodes training. We also compare Q-learning with NMPC and PID assistance and show that NMPC has 114% higher mean reward. We compare Q-learning switch and novel Nash switch method under noise-free and noisy input conditions to prove an increase of 35% mean reward and decrease of 4% std for Nash updates. We analyze efficacy of Q-learning and Nash switch approaches w.r.t NMPC and demonstrate comparable performance between Nash switch and NMPC. We juxtapose driving results of switch Q-learning and Nash switch with DDPG algorithm to prove Nash switch strategy has higher overall performance. Finally, we compare Nash switch's performance with DDPG for highway merging scenario which shows 159% higher mean reward.

AB The extent and speed of marine environmental mapping is increasing quickly with technological advances, particularly with optical imaging from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This contribution describes a new deep-sea digital still camera system that takes high-frequency (> 1 Hz) color photographs of the seafloor, suitable for detailed biological and habitat assessment, and the means of efficient processing of this mass imagery, to allow assessment across a wide range of spatial scales from that of individual megabenthic organisms to landscape scales (> 100 km(2)). As part of the Autonomous Ecological Surveying of the Abyss (AESA) project, the AUV Autosub6000 obtained > 150,000 seafloor images (similar to 160 km total transect length) to investigate the distribution of megafauna on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (4850 m; NE Atlantic). An automated workflow for image processing was developed that corrected nonuniform illumination and color, geo-referenced the photographs, and produced 10-image mosaics ('tiles,' each representing a continuous strip of 15-20 m(2) of seafloor), with overlap between consecutive images removed. These tiles were then manually annotated to generate biological data. This method was highly advantageous compared with alternative techniques, greatly increasing the rate of image acquisition and providing a 10-50 fold increase in accuracy in comparison to trawling. The method also offers more precise density and biodiversity estimates [Coefficient of variation (CV) < 10%] than alternative techniques, with a 2-fold improvement in density estimate precision compared with the WASP towed camera system. Ultimately, this novel system is expected to make valuable contributions to understanding human impact in the deep ocean.

AB This article presents the dynamic modeling and trajectory tracking control of the industrial tractor-trailers vehicle composed of a full-size car-like tractor and multiple full trailers. To eliminate the high uncertainty of the kinematic and dynamic parameters of the trailers in the model, we propose to install a force sensor to monitor the forces exerted on the tractor in real time. With the force measurements, the tractor can be considered separately and the dynamic model is significantly simplified. The inaccurate parameters and varying configurations of the trailers can all be ignored, whereas their dynamic effects on the tractor are still precisely captured. A Lyapunov-based trajectory tracking controller is proposed to online compensate the forces and drive the tractor onto the desired trajectory. The controller is developed using backstepping techniques and the stability is rigorously proved. The performance is illustrated with practical implementations on a full-scale industrial tractor towing several full trailers. The robustness and accuracy of the controller with force compensation are verified with different trailer settings. Implementation results show that applying the simplified model has generally superior performance than using the whole-vehicle model.

DE Hierarchical fault diagnosis; System failure and fault recovery;
   Autonomous network of unmanned aerial vehicles; Discrete-event systems
AB This paper introduces and develops an optimal hybrid fault recovery methodology for a team of unmanned vehicles by taking advantage of the cooperative nature of the team to accomplish the desired mission requirements in presence of faults/failures. The proposed methodology is developed in a hybrid framework that consists of a low-level (an agent level and a team level) and a high-level (discrete-event system level) fault diagnosis and recovery modules. A high-level fault recovery scheme is proposed within the discrete-event system (DES) supervisory control framework, whereas it is assumed that a low-level fault recovery designed based on classical control techniques is already available. The low-level recovery module employs information on the detected and estimated fault and modifies the controller parameters to recover the team from the faulty condition. By taking advantage of combinatorial optimization techniques, a novel reconfiguration strategy is proposed and developed at the high-level so that the faulty vehicles are recovered with minimum cost to the team. A case study is provided to illustrate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for the icing problem in unmanned aerial vehicles, which is a well-known structural problem in the aircraft industry.

AB 3D vehicle detection based on LiDAR-camera fusion is becoming an emerging research topic in autonomous driving. The algorithm based on the Camera-LiDAR object candidate fusion method (CLOCs) is currently considered to be a more effective decision-level fusion algorithm, but it does not fully utilize the extracted features of 3D and 2D. Therefore, we proposed a 3D vehicle detection algorithm based onmultimodal decision-level fusion. First, project the anchor point of the 3D detection bounding box into the 2D image, calculate the distance between 2D and 3D anchor points, and use this distance as a new fusion feature to enhance the feature redundancy of the network. Subsequently, add an attention module: squeeze-and-excitation networks, weight each feature channel to enhance the important features of the network, and suppress useless features. The experimental results show that the mean average precision of the algorithm in the KITTI dataset is 82.96%, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art multimodal fusion-based methods, and the average accuracy in the Easy, Moderate and Hard evaluation indicators reaches 88.96%, 82.60%, and 77.31%, respectively, which are higher compared to the original CLOCs model by 1.02%, 2.29%, and 0.41%, respectively. Compared with the original CLOCs algorithm, our algorithm has higher accuracy and better performance in 3D vehicle detection.

ID MODEL; DYNAMICS
AB In this paper, we propose an advanced adaptive cruise control to evaluate the collision risk between adjacent vehicles and adjust the distance between them seeking to improve driving safety. As a solution for preventing crashes, an autopilot vehicle has been considered. In the near future, the technique to forecast dangerous situations and automatically adjust the speed to prevent a collision can be implemented to a real vehicle. We have attempted to realize the technique to predict the future positions of adjacent vehicles. Several previous studies have investigated similar approaches; however, these studies ignored the individual characteristics of drivers and changes in driving conditions, even though the prediction performance largely depends on these characteristics. The proposed method allows estimating the operation characteristics of each driver and applying the estimated results to obtain the trajectory prediction. Then, the collision risk is evaluated based on such prediction. A novel advanced adaptive cruise control, proposed in this paper, adjusts its speed and distance from adjacent vehicles accordingly to minimize the collision risk in advance. In evaluation using real traffic data, the proposed method detected lane changes with 99.2% and achieved trajectory prediction error of 0.065 m, on average. In addition, it was demonstrated that almost 35% of the collision risk can be decreased by applying the proposed method compared to that of human drivers.

AB Internet of vehicles (IoV) comprises connected vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles and offers numerous benefits for ensuring traffic and safety competence. Several IoV applications are delay-sensitive and need resources for computation and data storage that are not provided by vehicles. Therefore, these tasks are always offloaded to highly powerful nodes, namely, fog, which can bring resources nearer to the networking edges, reducing both traffic congestion and load. Besides, the mechanism of offloading the tasks to the fog nodes in terms of delay, computing power, and completion time remains still as an open concern. Hence, an efficient task offloading strategy, named Aquila Student Psychology Optimization Algorithm (ASPOA), is developed for offloading the IoV tasks in a fog setting in terms of the objectives, such as delay, computing power, and completion time. The devised optimization algorithm, known as ASPOA, is the incorporation of Aquila Optimizer (AO) and Student Psychology Based Optimization (SPBO). Task offloading in the IoV-fog system selects suitable resources for executing the tasks of the vehicles by considering several constraints and parameters to satisfy the user requirements. The simulation outcomes have shown that the devised ASPOA-based task offloading method has achieved better performance by achieving a minimum delay of 0.0009 s, minimum computing power of 8.884 W, and minimum completion time of 0.441 s.
   At first, Internet of vehicle simulation is done, and the vehicle requests are loaded at the bucket to serve by its corresponding roadside units in the fog layer. Then, validation is done to check if the fog node is overloaded or underloaded by considering a specific condition. Here, optimal offloading is done using the proposed Aquila Student Psychology Optimization Algorithm for handling the tasks of an overloaded fog node.image

AB Traffic object detection and recognition systems play an essential role in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV). In this research, we focus on four important classes of traffic objects: traffic signs, road vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights. We first review the major traditional machine learning and deep learning methods that have been used in the literature to detect and recognize these objects. We provide a vision-based framework that detects and recognizes traffic objects inside and outside the attentional visual area of drivers. This approach uses the driver 3D absolute coordinates of the gaze point obtained by the combined, cross-calibrated use of a front-view stereo imaging system and a non-contact 3D gaze tracker. A combination of multi-scale HOG-SVM and Faster R-CNN-based models are utilized in the detection stage. The recognition stage is performed with a ResNet-101 network to verify sets of generated hypotheses. We applied our approach on real data collected during drives in an urban environment with the RoadLAB instrumented vehicle. Our framework achieved 91% of correct object detections and provided promising results in the object recognition stage.

ID POLICY
AB Designing decision, control and information systems is motivated, in part, by the need to support the deployment of multiple aircraft, such as combat vehicles, unmanned combat air vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and weapons, in missions taking place in a dynamic, although uncertain, environment. Such systems aim at ensuring mission success without overloading the operating crew, the pilots, and the commanders. One of the main design challenges lies in obtaining some sort of coherent behaviour of the fleet, by means of solutions to potentially NP-hard problems, given incomplete and imperfect information, and despite limited computational and communication capabilities. In this context, this article proposes a hierarchical decision and information system aiming at providing, in real-time, coordinated aircraft path planning and deceptive engagement assignments. The blue-red engagement policy is obtained by minimizing, and balancing, the energy expenditure among the vehicles while constraining information exchanges to a minimum defined by a risk of inconsistency. The proposed system relies on dynamic programming, online heuristic techniques and stochastic, consistency-checking methods. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach compares advantageously to a random process and to a law that seeks to minimize the cost of the confrontation at a given time regardless of past moves. However, there is a trade-off between increasing the level of deception and the level of energy consumption.

ID MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY
AB It is a critical problem to improve energy efficiency for electric vehicle platooning systems. Moreover, different from internal combustion engine vehicles, the electric engine has higher efficiency, and further regenerating braking is widely used to recycle part of the energy in the electric vehicle when it is braking. What is more, if vehicles take a formation to drive, they can save more energy. Combining all the favorable factors, this paper presents a two-layer energy-efficiency optimization strategy for electric vehicle platooning. The upper layer presents an optimization method to find the optimal velocities and distances between vehicles under different road conditions during the cruise status of the electric vehicle platooning. Due to the nonconvex cost function and considering regenerative braking, the optimization problem is addressed by the dynamic programming method combined with the successive convex approximation method. Further, the lower layer presents a real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy, and it directly introduces the battery pack state of charge consumption as the input, which not only finishes the control mission but also consumes minimal energy. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods.
   Based on the bidirectional energy flow in the engine of EVs, the problems of how to find the optimal velocity and distance between vehicles, and how to control EVs with the minimal energy cost for EV platooning are addressed by a two-layer strategy. The upper-layer optimization strategy solves the problem of how to find the optimal velocity and distance between vehicles in different road sections for EV platooning. The dynamic programming method combined with the successive convex approximation method is introduced to solve the non-convex optimization problem for energy saving. The lower-layer control strategy solves the problem of how to control EVs with minimal energy cost for the EV platooning in the transient state process. Aiming at costing minimal energy, the new MPC form is presented.image

AB Object detection is an essential task for autonomous vehicles to ensure safety. Due to the complexity of mining environments, it is difficult to detect objects accurately and robustly. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel 3D LiDAR-based object detection method fusing semantic and geometric features for autonomous trucks in mining environments (3DSG). A road region extraction method is presented by establishing a semantic segmentation network with a region searching strategy to eliminate off-road point clouds. To deal with the complexity of unstructured road ground point-cloud segmentation, we propose a cascaded ground detection algorithm by performing semantic segmentation filtering and rectangular grid map filtering. A clustering method is proposed fusing adaptive distance thresholds of Euclidean clusters with semantic segmentation categories to solve the problem of the over- and undersegmentation of objects caused by the sparsity of point clouds. The performance of the proposed method is examined utilizing a real mining dataset named TG-Mine-3D. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieved higher precision of 66.39%. Moreover, for the truck and pedestrian categories, the performance of our method was significantly improved by 2.66% and 5.80%, respectively. The proposed method running at 51.35 ms achieved real-time performance.

AB Conventional fixed traffic detectors are limited to their installed locations and are unable to collect general traffic information or monitor microscopic traffic flows. Mobile detectors overcome spatial constraints by allowing the vehicle to act as a detector and can observe microscopic traffic flows by collecting high-resolution trajectory data from individual vehicles. The objective of this study is to estimate spatiotemporal traffic information based on the autonomous driving sensor headway distance and to calculate the appropriate spatiotemporal interval according to the sampling rate. First, individual vehicle trajectory data was collected, and a traffic information estimation was established. Travel speed was calculated based on generalized definitions, and its estimation and errors were analyzed. In addition, the appropriate spatiotemporal interval according to cell size, time interval, and sampling rate was analyzed. The analysis demonstrated that the estimation accuracy was improved by cell size, time interval, and sampling rate. Based on this, the appropriate time and space to minimize the error rate were calculated considering the sampling rate. When the sampling rate was 40% or more, the error rate was 5% or less in all time and space; however, error rate differences occurred in several cases at sampling rates below 40%. These results are anticipated for efficient management of collecting, processing and providing traffic information.

AB This paper presents a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging unit supplied by PV, wind and the battery in an autonomous mode of DC microgrid (MG) system. With the traditional control methods of PEV, the EV is charged without considering generation and the load limits. The control strategy proposed for PEV in this article is to increase the maximum rate of charging capacity of an EV only if generation exceeds the load demand using new current-loop control technique. The variation of photovoltaic irradiance, DC and AC loads, battery charging and discharging characteristics are considered which are directly coupled to a medium voltage DC bus. This tends to be an attractive option for increasing the efficiency and operation of electric vehicle charging station. The power reference based droop controller is designed for the battery to provide an efficient power management of a DC MG system by regulating the DC link voltage with less deviation. The effectiveness of the proposed MG system with Escape Ford EV vehicle has been validated by MATLAB/Simulink. The reported simulation results show that the approach presented is capable of governing the PEV charging unit and regulation of DC bus voltage.

AB The rapid growth of CAV (Connected and Automated Vehicle) market penetration highlights the need to gain insight into the overall stability of mixed traffic flows in order to better deploy CAVs. Several studies have examined the modelling process and stability analysis of traffic flow in a mixed traffic environment without considering its inner spatial distribution. In this paper, an innovative Markov chain-based model is established for integrating the spatial distribution of mixed traffic flow in the model process of car-following behaviour. Then the linear stability analysis of the mixed traffic flow is conducted for different CAV market penetration rates, different CAV platoon strength and different cooperation efficiency between two continuous vehicles. Moreover, several simulations under open boundary conditions in multiple scenarios are performed to explicate how CAV market penetration rate, platoon strength and cooperation efficiency jointly influence the stability performance of the mixed traffic flow. The results reveal that the performance of this mixed traffic flow stability could be strengthened in these three factors. In addition to stability, an investigation of the fuel consumption and emission reduction under different market penetration rates and the platoon strength of CAVs are explored, suggesting that substantial potential fuel consumption and emission could be reduced under certain scenarios.

AB An essential capability for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to extend its airborne duration without increasing the size of the aircraft is called the autonomous aerial refueling (AAR). This paper proposes a sensor-in-the-loop, non-tracking method for probe-and-drogue style autonomous aerial refueling tasks by combining sensitivity adjustments of a 3D Flash LIDAR camera with computer vision based image-processing techniques. The method overcomes the inherit ambiguity issues when reconstructing 3D information from traditional 2D images by taking advantage of ready to use 3D point cloud data from the camera, followed by well-established computer vision techniques. These techniques include curve fitting algorithms and outlier removal with the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to reliably estimate the drogue center in 3D space, as well as to establish the relative position between the probe and the drogue. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method on a real system, a ground navigation robot was designed and fabricated. Results presented in the paper show that using images acquired from a 3D Flash LIDAR camera as real time visual feedback, the ground robot is able to track a moving simulated drogue and continuously narrow the gap between the robot and the target autonomously.

AB Motivated by the emerging mixed autonomous paradigm in cobotic order picking operations, we investigate the optimal information design to navigate human workers (HWs) who cooperate with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) within an intralogistics system. We incorporate asymmetric information between AMRs and HWs in a routing game where connected AMRs are informed of the congestion state while HWs rely on information provided by the system. The system designs a communication policy aiming to navigate HWs away from congestion. Without strategic communications, we show that the deployment of AMRs cannot mitigate congestion unless the automation level reaches a threshold. Interestingly, we illustrate a substitution effect between automation and strategic communications when information distortion is mild. In contrast, severe information distortion complements automation due to exacerbated congestion. Furthermore, an in-house AMR fleet is economically more efficient than a third-party logistics service. Consequently, in-house automation can be achieved with mild information distortion, while severe information distortion is required to complement the lack of efficiency in the third-party AMR fleet. With simulated numerical examples to complement the analytical results, we provide managerial insights concerning the optimal information policies under different levels of automation, guiding warehouse managers in their communications with workers to achieve the best performance of the cobotic system.

AB In this paper, the design of a quadrotor vehicle having a person-tracking and observation system, which uses human gesture recognition, is described. The system has three operating functions, namely, object tracking, human gesture recognition, and fixed-point cruising. The tracking-learning-detection (TLD) algorithm was used to enable the autonomous tracking of the object from images. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) provides an estimate of the current position of the quadrotor vehicle, and a fuzzy-proportional integral derivative (PID) controller provides position error compensation. The principle of the human gesture recognition system is as follows. A background model is first built from images using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to detect the foreground image. A nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) is then employed to recognize changes of gesture and establish interactivity between the vehicle and the user. The coordinates of the vehicle are marked using a GPS for fixed-point cruising. The coordinates and parameters of the points are set so that the quadrotor vehicle can follow them during cruising. Lastly, all of the functions are incorporated into the person-tracking and gesture-recognition system in the quadrotor. The experimental results show the feasibility of the above-mentioned methods, which can help us easily recognize the various gestures in this study.

AB Industry 4.0, smart homes, and the Internet of Things are boosting the employment of autonomous aerial vehicles in indoor environments, where localization is still challenging, especially in the case of close and cluttered areas. In this paper, we propose a Visual Inertial Odometry localization method based on fiducial markers. Our approach enables multi-rotor aerial vehicle navigation in indoor environments and tackles the most challenging aspects of image-based indoor localization. In particular, we focus on a proper and continuous pose estimation, working from take-off to landing, at several different flying altitudes. With this aim, we designed a map of fiducial markers that produces results that are both dense and heterogeneous. Narrowly placed tags lead to minimal information loss during rapid aerial movements while four different classes of marker size provide consistency when the camera zooms in or out according to the vehicle distance from the ground. We have validated our approach by comparing the output of the localization algorithm with the ground-truth information collected through an optoelectronic motion capture system, using two different platforms in different flying conditions. The results show that error mean and standard deviation can remain constantly lower than 0.11 m, so not degrading when the aerial vehicle increases its altitude and, therefore, strongly improving similar state-of-the-art solutions.

AB This study examines drivers' responses to automated driving technology failures in semi-automated vehicles. The study is executed in a human-in-the-loop setting, within a high-fidelity integrated car simulator capable of handling both manual and automated driving. A population of 40 individuals was tested, with metrics for control takeover quantification given by vehicle maximum lane offset with respect to the lane centerline, and integral offset over an S-curve turn to compare performance during recovery after automation technology failure and conventional manual driving. Independent variables for the study are the age of the driver, the speed at the time of disengagement, and time at which the disengagement occurs (i.e., how long automation was engaged for). Overall results show better performance for lower speed settings with maximum drift increasing over 116% for higher speed settings. Moreover, contrary to expectations, the age factor was found to be not statistically significant for drift performance, with older participants performing better than or equal to the younger age groups. The time dependency observed was non-linear, and the results highlighted the need for additional testing for this variable. A detailed analysis of variance, as well as preliminary recommendations for regulatory operational limitations, are presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a road-network search route planning algorithm by which multiple autonomous vehicles are able to efficiently visit every road identified in the map in the context of the Chinese postman problem. Since the typical Chinese postman algorithm can be applied solely to a connected road-network in which ground vehicles are involved, it is modified to be used for a general type of road map including unconnected roads as well as the operational and physical constraints of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For this, a multi-choice multi-dimensional knapsack problem is formulated to find an optimal solution minimising flight time and then solved via mixed integer linear programming. To deal with the dynamic constraints of the UAVs, the Dubins theory is used for path generation. In particular, a circular-circular-circular type of the Dubins path is exploited based on a differential geometry to guarantee that the vehicles follow the road precisely in a densely distributed road environment. Moreover, to overcome the computational burden of the multi-choice multi-dimensional knapsack algorithm, a nearest insertion and auction-based approximation algorithm is newly introduced. The properties and performance of the proposed algorithm are evaluated via numerical simulations operating on a real village map and randomly generated maps with different parameters.

DE automated roadside detection and counting; vehicle occupants; traffic

AB The monitoring and control of traffic volume is becoming a constant social, economic, and environmental pressure in the UK and elsewhere, because of landmass and current infrastructure strain under a swelling and increasingly mobile population. The viability of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes for easing traffic congestion, and hence maximising traffic flow, has been proven in countries worldwide. The USA, Australia, and Canada have had HOV installations for some time, controlling the flux of traffic into their most densely populated areas. Experience in these cases has dictated that it is enforcement which is crucial to the successful implementation of such a traffic policy.
   To date, all enforcement has been manual, i.e. a police officer counting the occupants in a vehicle as it passes by. Studies have concluded that manual enforcement is typically only 65 per cent accurate and, considering the pressures which one individual is put under in these circumstances, this statistic is not surprising. Lighting and environmental conditions, skin tone, and location of the occupants and the alertness of the officer are all variables affecting the accuracy of manually collected data. Hence there is the need for an autonomous detection system to count the occupancy within a vehicle. This could provide the basis of an enforcement or congestion strategy.

AB The increasing demand for efficient and safe transportation systems has led to the development of autonomous vehicles and vehicle platooning. Truck platooning, in particular, offers numerous benefits, such as reduced fuel consumption, enhanced traffic flow, and increased safety. In this paper, we present a drone-based decentralized framework for truck platooning in highway monitoring scenarios. Our approach employs multiple drones, which communicate with the trucks and make real-time decisions on whether to form a platoon or not, leveraging Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for drone formation control. The proposed framework integrates a simple truck model in the existing drone-based simulation, addressing the truck dynamics and constraints for practical applicability. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in maintaining the desired platoon formations while ensuring collision avoidance and adhering to the vehicle constraints. This innovative drone-based truck platooning system has the potential to significantly improve highway monitoring efficiency, traffic management, and safety. Our drone-based truck platooning system is primarily designed for implementation in highway monitoring and management scenarios, where its enhanced communication and real-time decision-making capabilities can significantly contribute to traffic efficiency and safety. Future work may focus on field trials to validate the system in real-world conditions and further refine the algorithms based on practical feedback and evolving vehicular technologies.

AB Vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is an improvement from conventional cloud computing to new revolutionized computing services including intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and vehicle control, Internet browsing, online documentation, and infotainment. It enables vehicles to autonomously share heterogeneous computational resources while solving unanticipated critical problems dynamically. However, in a world of black hats, technology often has a dark side as well. Therefore, the VCC is limited by considerable security and privacy challenges. The special characteristics of VCC, including the multitenancy nature of clouds, intermittent wireless communications, high mobility of vehicles, and rapid resource elasticity with decentralized operations, have promoted security solutions used in vehicular ad hoc networks and conventional cloud computing to be revised. This paper first presents a state-of-the-art study of VCC that focuses on VCC architecture, its features analysis, and extensive VCC applications. Second, the proposed threats identification taxonomy and an exhaustive survey on security and privacy issues in VCC are presented under a layered approach: physical resource layer, vehicle-to-anything (V2X) network layer, and vehicular cloud layer, as well as at a complete system level. Finally, we highlight and discuss challenges and open research issues that can be considered as future research directions.

AB Maize is one of the major food crops in China. Traditionally, field operations are done by manual labor, where the farmers are threatened by the harsh environment and pesticides. On the other hand, it is difficult for large machinery to maneuver in the field due to limited space, particularly in the middle and late growth stage of maize. Unmanned, compact agricultural machines, therefore, are ideal for such field work. This paper describes a method of monocular visual recognition to navigate small vehicles between narrow crop rows. Edge detection and noise elimination were used for image segmentation to extract the stalks in the image. The stalk coordinates define passable boundaries, and a simplified radial basis function (RBF)-based algorithm was adapted for path planning to improve the fault tolerance of stalk coordinate extraction. The average image processing time, including network latency, is 220 ms. The average time consumption for path planning is 30 ms. The fast processing ensures a top speed of 2 m/s for our prototype vehicle. When operating at the normal speed (0.7 m/s), the rate of collision with stalks is under 6.4%. Additional simulations and field tests further proved the feasibility and fault tolerance of our method.

AB Accurate obstacle detection plays a crucial role in the creation of high-precision maps within unstructured terrain environments, as it supplies vital decision-making information for unmanned engineering vehicles. Existing works primarily focus on the semantic segmentation of terrain environments, overlooking the safety aspect of vehicle driving. This paper presents a hazardous obstacle detection framework in addition to driving safety-assured semantic information in the generated high-precision map of unstructured scenarios. The framework encompasses the following key steps. Firstly, a continuous terrain point cloud model is obtained, and a pre-processing algorithm is designed to filter noise and fill holes in the point cloud dataset. The Sobel-G operator is then utilized to establish a digital gradient model, facilitating the labeling of hazardous obstacles. Secondly, a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network is trained on obstacle categories. Finally, by considering the geometric driving state of the vehicle, obstacles that pose safety risks to the vehicle are accurately extracted. The proposed algorithm is validated through experiments conducted on existing datasets as well as real, unstructured terrain point clouds reconstructed by drones. The experimental results affirm the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed algorithm for obstacle information extraction in unstructured scenes.

AB The potential for an intelligent transportation system (ITS) has been made possible by the growth of the Internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), resulting in the integration of IoT and ITS-known as the Internet of vehicles (IoV). To achieve the goal of automatic driving and efficient mobility, IoV is now combined with modern communication technologies (such as 5G) to achieve intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs). However, IoV is challenged with security risks in the following five (5) domains: ICV security, intelligent device security, service platform security, V2X communication security, and data security. Numerous AI models have been developed to mitigate the impact of intrusion threats on ICVs. On the other hand, the rise in explainable AI (XAI) results from the requirement to inject confidence, transparency, and repeatability into the development of AI for the security of ICV and to provide a safe ITS. As a result, the scope of this review covered the XAI models used in ICV intrusion detection systems (IDSs), their taxonomies, and outstanding research problems. The results of the study show that XAI though in its infancy of application to ICV, is a promising research direction in the quest for improving the network efficiency of ICVs. The paper further reveals that XAI increased transparency will foster its acceptability in the automobile industry.

AB In this study, a EURO VI heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) has been retrofitted with an exhaust gas heater (EGH) with the objective to reduce its NOx emissions below the current EURO VI and EURO VII limits. Results show that an EGH of 5 kW is enough to produce a significant NOx emissions abatement below the EURO VI and EURO VII limits. A conventional after-treatment system heated using a 5 kW EGH could work at its maximum catalytic conversion efficiency of 95% regardless of the engine operating speed. Consequently, exhaust gas heaters are a potential solution to high NOx emission at low engine regimes. With the use of an EGH, urea can be injected sooner, and catalytic reactions could cut much more NOx emissions. However, its incorporation would increase the vehicle's fuel consumption by 1.47% if it is connected directly to the vehicle's electrical system. Finally, it is also demonstrated that an automotive thermoelectric generator (ATEG) can supply the energy required by the EGH through the conversion of the waste heat from exhaust gases into electricity. This system could work electrically autonomous so there is no extra consumption of fuel.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; PUBLIC TRANSPORT; DEMAND
AB This paper reports the results of a stated preference survey of regular transit users' willingnesstoride and concerns about driverless buses in the Philadelphia region. As automated technologies advance, driverless buses may offer significant efficiency, safety, and operational improvements over traditional bus services. However, unfamiliarity with automated vehicle technology may challenge its acceptance among the general public and slow the adoption of new technologies. Using a mixed logit modeling framework, this research examines which types of transit users are most willing to ride in driverless buses and whether having a transit employee on board to monitor the vehicle operations and/or provide customer service matters. Of the 891 surveyed members of University of Pennsylvania's transit pass benefit program, two-thirds express a willingness to ride in a driverless bus when a transit employee is on board to monitor vehicle operations and provide customer service. By contrast, only 13% would agree to ride a bus without an employee on board. Males and those in younger age groups (18-34) are more willing to ride in driverless buses than females and those in older age groups. Findings suggest that, so long as a transit employee is onboard, many transit passengers will willingly board early generation automated buses. An abrupt shift to buses without employees on board, by contrast, will likely alienate many transit users.

ID SECURITY
AB The internet-of-Vehicle (IoV) can facilitate seamless connectivity between connected vehicles (CV), autonomous vehicles (AV), and other IoV entities. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for IoV networks can rely on machine learning (ML) to protect the in-vehicle network from cyber-attacks. Blockchain-based Federated Forests (BFFs) could be used to train ML models based on data from IoV entities while protecting the confidentiality of the data and reducing the risks of tampering with the data. However, ML models are still vulnerable to evasion, poisoning and exploratory attacks by adversarial examples. The BFF-IDS offers partial defence against poisoning but has no measure for evasion attacks, the most common attack/threat faced by ML models. Besides, the impact of adversarial examples transferability in CAN IDS has largely remained untested. This paper investigates the impact of various possible adversarial examples on the BFF-IDS. We also investigated the statistical adversarial detector's effectiveness and resilience in detecting the attacks and subsequent countermeasures by augmenting the model with detected samples. Our investigation results established that BFF-IDS is very vulnerable to adversarial examples attacks. The statistical adversarial detector and the subsequent BFF-IDS augmentation (BFF-IDS(AUG)) provide an effective mechanism against the adversarial examples. Consequently, integrating the statistical adversarial detector and the subsequent BFF-IDS augmentation with the detected adversarial samples provides a sustainable security framework against adversarial examples and other unknown attacks.

AB As one of the research focuses in the field of intelligent driving, improving the performance of path tracking has become a goal for many scholars. Among many path tracking control algorithms, model predictive control (MPC) controllers are widely used due to their excellent control performance. However, the traditional MPC control has shortcomings because it does not consider the particularity of the driving car with preview driving characteristics, i.e., it is only directly controlling from the vehicle state. To fully retain the advantages of the MPC controller and simultaneously exert the preview characteristic of the intelligent vehicle to improve the path tracking performance, this work proposes a model predictive control with adaptive preview characteristics and an algorithm of longitudinal vehicle speed-assisted constraint for the path tracking algorithm. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: The MPC controller with adaptive preview characteristic is proposed based on the lateral error and target curvature; The longitudinal vehicle speed-assisted constraint algorithm based on the largest ideal lateral acceleration becomes a supplementary part of the algorithm as a supplementary constraint of the MPC controller. Series of simulations based on the Simulink/CARSIM software individually verified the model predictive control with adaptive preview characteristics and an algorithm of longitudinal vehicle speed-assisted constraint for the path tracking algorithm. The proposed adaptive preview strategy is suitable for the path tracking algorithm controlled by the MPC controller and improves the path tracking performance.

AB Experts predict that new automobiles will be capable of driving themselves under limited conditions within 5-10 years, and under most conditions within 10-20 years. Automation may affect road vehicle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a host of ways, positive and negative, by causing changes in travel demand, vehicle design, vehicle operating profiles, and choices of fuels. In this paper, we identify specific mechanisms through which automation may affect travel and energy demand and resulting GHG emissions and bring them together using a coherent energy decomposition framework. We review the literature for estimates of the energy impacts of each mechanism and, where the literature is lacking, develop our own estimates using engineering and economic analysis. We consider how widely applicable each mechanism is, and quantify the potential impact of each mechanism on a common basis: the percentage change it is expected to cause in total GHG emissions from light-duty or heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. Our primary focus is travel related energy consumption and emissions, since potential lifecycle impacts are generally smaller in magnitude. We explore the net effects of automation on emissions through several illustrative scenarios, finding that automation might plausibly reduce road transport GHG emissions and energy use by nearly half - or nearly double them - depending on which effects come to dominate. We also find that many potential energy-reduction benefits may be realized through partial automation, while the major energy/emission downside risks appear more likely at full automation. We close by presenting some implications for policymakers and identifying priority areas for further research. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The increasing need for food in recent years means that environmental protection and sustainable agriculture are necessary. For this, smart agricultural systems and autonomous robots have become widespread. One of the most significant and persistent problems related to robots is 3D path planning, which is an NP-hard problem, for mobile robots. In this paper, efficient methods are proposed by two metaheuristic algorithms (Incremental Gray Wolf Optimization (I-GWO) and Expanded Gray Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). The proposed methods try to find collision-free optimal paths between two points for robots without human intervention in an acceptable time with the lowest process costs and efficient use of resources in large-scale and crowded farmlands. Thanks to the methods proposed in this study, various tasks such as tracking crops can be performed efficiently by autonomous robots. The simulations are carried out using three methods, and the obtained results are compared with each other and analyzed. The relevant results show that in the proposed methods, the mobile robots avoid the obstacles successfully and obtain the optimal path cost from source to destination. According to the simulation results, the proposed method based on the Ex-GWO algorithm has a better success rate of 55.56% in optimal path cost.

AB An autonomous driving control system for a robotic mower was designed using a low-cost dual-frequency global navigation satellite system (GNSS) compass, a low-cost dual-frequency real-time kinematic GNSS (RTK-GNSS), and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The intended application is to save labor by autonomously mowing sloped terrains. To investigate the effectiveness of the prototype GNSS compass on an inclined terrain, the roll, pitch, and yaw angles were varied using an inclined stage, and the heading accuracy was evaluated. The root mean square (RMS) of the heading error was within 1.5 degrees when the roll and pitch angles were both less than 45 degrees. Autonomous driving tests were conducted on the slope of an agricultural dam with an incline of approximately 25 degrees. The prototype GNSS compass was capable of continuous and consistent heading measurements even on the slope. The cross-track error for the set path was 7.2 cm RMS when starting near the top and driving down the slope. When the robot started near the bottom of the slope and ran up, the cross -track error was 6.6 cm RMS. For the mower and experimental conditions used in this study, this was sufficient accuracy for autonomous driving when mowing on a slope.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic is currently having disastrous effects on every part of human life everywhere in the world. There have been terrible losses for the entire human race in all nations and areas. It is crucial to take good precautions and prevent COVID-19 because of its high infectiousness and fatality rate. One of the key spreading routes has been identified to be transportation systems. Therefore, improving infection tracking and healthcare monitoring for high-mobility transportation systems is impractical for pandemic control. In order to enhance driving enjoyment and road safety, 5G-enabled vehicular fog computing may gather and interpret pertinent vehicle data, which open the door to non-contact autonomous healthcare monitoring. Due to the urgent need to contain the automotive pandemic, this paper proposes a COVID-19 vehicle based on an efficient mutual authentication scheme for 5G-enabled vehicular fog computing. The proposed scheme consists of two different aspects of the special flag, SF = 0 and SF = 1, denoting normal and COVID-19 vehicles, respectively. The proposed scheme satisfies privacy and security requirements as well as achieves COVID-19 and healthcare solutions. Finally, the performance evaluation section shows that the proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of communication and computation costs as compared to most recent related works.

AB A promising way to improve efficiency in highway on-ramp regions is to control connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to pass the merging section sequentially. The primary objective of this paper is to incorporate the reinforcement learning (RL) technique into vehicle merging control to achieve global cooperation. A communication protocol among RL agents is integrated with the Soft Actor-Critic (CSAC) algorithm. The parallel SAC agents with a parameter-sharing structure cooperate to optimize the common reward function. It enables CAVs to know the actions of each other so that they proactively negotiate to adjust speeds. We designed a parsimonious state representation containing crucial merging information to speed up the RL training. The effects of the merging control strategy were investigated with the simulation model in scenarios with different CAV penetration rates and traffic flow compositions. Results showed that the CSAC-based merging strategy generated collision-free merging trajectories with a short travel time while guaranteeing traffic safety in various traffic conditions. Four baselines (including two rule-based and two RL-based merging strategies) were applied in the same scenarios for comparison. It was found that the proposed merging strategy took the safest merging behaviors (zero traffic conflicts) and reduced the most significant travel time (56.9%).

AB This paper describes the software architecture of an integrated simulator for the realistic simulation of multi Unmanned aerial vehicle applications. The integrated simulator exploits some already existing tools to simulate a specific part of the overall Unmanned aerial vehicle hardware and software structure: a 3D visualization engine, a physics simulator, a flight control stack and a network simulator to handle communications among Unmanned aerial vehicles. These features are provided by the tools Gazebo, ArduCopter and ns-3 that, however, are not designed to work together in an integrated manner. The solution proposed in this paper is based on a software middleware that coordinates all of these tools, which may optionally be run on multiple interconnected computers, and lets them have a common notion of simulated time during the simulation; moreover, the middleware coordinates the activities of the High-level Logic, which is the software part that implements the strategy and control of the multi Unmanned aerial vehicle application. A Python API is provided to allow developers to write their Unmanned aerial vehicle application (cooperative missions, flocking, etc.) in such a way as to be first simulated and then run onto the real platform with no or few modifications.

AB In this paper, we expolore Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cluster. Considering that the current UAV cluster is still in the program control stage, the fully autonomous and intelligent cooperative combat has not been realised. In order to realise the autonomous planning of the UAV cluster according to the changing environment and cooperate with each other to complete the combat goal, we propose a new MARL framework. It adopts the policy of centralised training with decentralised execution, and uses Actor-Critic network to select the execution action and then to make the corresponding evaluation. The new algorithm makes three key improvements on the basis of Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. The first is to improve learning framework; it makes the calculated Q value more accurate. The second is to add collision avoidance setting, which can increase the operational safety factor. And the third is to adjust reward mechanism; it can effectively improve the cluster's cooperative ability. Then the improved MADDPG algorithm is tested by performing two conventional combat missions. The simulation results show that the learning efficiency is obviously improved, and the operational safety factor is further increased compared with the previous algorithm.

ID UNMANNED SURFACE VEHICLE; ENVIRONMENT; ALGORITHM
AB In this research, a hybrid approach for global path planning for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS) is proposed, which generates the shortest path considering the collision risk and the proximity between path and obstacles. The collision risk concerning obstacles is obtained using Time-Varying Collision Risk (TCR) concept, taking into account the velocity constraint of the ship that can achieve during operation. The influence of proximity from obstacles is measured with the Fast Marching (FM) algorithm. A new cost function is proposed allowing to combine the influence of obstacle proximity and collision risk in the region. Finally, the Fast Marching Square algorithm is applied to generate the globally optimal path that can reach the pre-set destination. The contribution of this work is two-fold: 1) considering the velocity constraint of the own ship, together with its influences of collision risk into the global path planning stage of autonomous navigation. 2) measuring the collision risk induced by the obstacles from their comprehensive influences on the achievable velocity range using TCR concept, instead of numerical integration of risk measurement. The results of the case study indicate that the proposed approach can find an optimal path considering the collision risk and proximity from the obstacles.

ID ALGORITHM; NETWORK
AB Accurate and rapid response in complex driving scenarios is a challenging problem in autonomous driving. If a target is detected, the vehicle will not be able to react in time, resulting in fatal safety accidents. Therefore, the application of driver assistance systems requires a model that can accurately detect targets in complex scenes and respond quickly. In this paper, a lightweight feature extraction model, ShuffDet, is proposed to replace the CSPDark53 model used by YOLOX by improving the YOLOX algorithm. At the same time, an attention mechanism is introduced into the path aggregation feature pyramid network (PAFPN) to make the network focus more on important information in the network, thereby improving the accuracy of the model. This model, which combines two methods, is called ShuffYOLOX, and it can improve the accuracy of the model while keeping it lightweight. The performance of the ShuffYOLOX model on the KITTI dataset is tested in this paper, and the experimental results show that compared to the original network, the mean average precision (mAP) of the ShuffYOLOX model on the KITTI dataset reaches 92.20%. In addition, the number of parameters of the ShuffYOLOX model is reduced by 34.57%, the Gflops are reduced by 42.19%, and the FPS is increased by 65%. Therefore, the ShuffYOLOX model is very suitable for autonomous driving applications.

AB In view of the complexity of the ramp traffic system on the expressway and the diversity of hybrid automatic driving, the safety distance of vehicles and the corresponding car following model are analyzed based on the combination of driver's personality characteristics and the characteristics of different automatic driving levels of the vehicle-road coordination system, and the risk model is established to screen the potentially dangerous vehicles in the ramp merging process. Based on game theory, this paper constructs a ramp coordination and merging control model suitable for hybrid automatic driving. The model takes the safety benefit and efficiency benefit as the objective function, predicts the benefit value under different strategies and makes the optimal strategy under the current conditions. The proposed model is verified by the joint simulation of Python and sumo. the simulation results show that the average number of combined vehicles is 1.91 times higher, the combined position is 50.11% earlier and the average driving time is 28.35% less than that without control strategy and there is obvious advantage when the density is high compared with vehicles without control strategy.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB In the era of autonomous cars, accurate vehicular positioning becomes very essential. The global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) suffer from signal blockage and severe multipath in urban canyons, which degrades the positioning accuracy and availability. Therefore, vehicles solely relying on positioning from GNSS receivers have limited performance. In this research, we present a novel unified cooperative positioning solution which enhances positioning accuracy and availability in urban canyons. The proposed system exploits the fact that vehicles have different positioning resources and is based on angle approximation, which artificially generates the hindered pseudorange by sharing angle information between vehicles using dedicated short-range communication. In addition, we propose a system that employs the proposed cooperative technique to assist the loose integration between the inertial navigation system (INS) and the GPS system (using extended Kalman filter) during partial GPS outages. Using raw data from inertial sensors and GPS receivers in the real road trajectories, we implement the cooperative INS/GPS loose integration and show that our cooperative integrated system outperforms the non-cooperative integrated system. The performance metrics used are the 2-D positioning root-mean-square error, the maximum 2-D positioning error, and the positioning accuracy gain (PAG). Specifically, the PAG gain is around 88, 80, and 60 when the number of blocked satellites is one, two, and three, respectively.

AB Autonomous shipping has been identified as the way forward in the maritime transport. However, the time -optimal path planning, anti-disturbance trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance are still ongoing challenging problems, which have not been properly addressed for autonomous ship. To fill the knowledge gap, we propose a novel nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), which integrates the time-optimal path planning, anti -disturbance tracking and obstacle avoidance. The proposed controller is designed as a 2-level hierarchical controller. In the high level, a planned path considering time minimum and obstacle avoidance is generated by nonlinear MPC in spatial formulation. A spatial reformulation is adopted to express manoeuvring time as a function mathematically. In the spatial coordinate, the manoeuvring time is minimised by MPC to generate a reference path for tracking. In the low level, vessel tracks the time-optimal planning trajectory by nonlinear MPC with extended Kalman filter in temporal formulation. The deviation of the tracking path in longitudinal direction is 15% ship length and the deviation in width direction is 1% under disturbances. The obstacle avoidance is implemented by using the proposed control method, and the tolerance of obstacle avoidance is 2L (ship length) to meet the safety requirement.

AB Efficient understanding of the environment is a crucial prerequisite for autonomous driving, but explicitly modeling the environment is hard to come true. In contrast, imitation learning, in theory, can arrive at the direct mapping from visual input to driving command, but the inscrutability of scene representation in imitation learning is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to enhance the abstract representation of visual scene from two aspects for better scene understanding, i.e. Visual Guide path and Driving Affordances path. For Visual Guide path, we leverage semantic information as visual priors to learn the intuitive state of the environment, e.g. the spatial semantic occupation of the visual scene. For Driving Affordances path, several driving affordance indicators reflecting the relationship between environment and vehicle behavior are learned as the global guidance to guide the driving system to learn safe and efficient driving policies. With the complementarity of these two paths, a Bilateral Guide Network is designed to realize the complete mapping from visual input to driving command. Our method is evaluated on the CARLA simulator with various scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness. Besides, comparative analyses are made with some state-of-the-art methods to justify the performance of our method in the aspect of autonomous driving.

AB The new generation of artificial intelligence technology has improved the autonomous monitoring capabilities of marine equipment. The ocean monitoring platform based on edge computing realizes the autonomous collaboration of multi-agent equipment groups. Autonomous Underwater Glider (AUG) is a new type of energy-saving marine equipment that can realize long-range ocean exploration. However, the non-negligible power constraints, time delays, communication failures and other unfavorable factors in the special underwater working environment have brought great challenges to the underwater monitoring operations of multi-AUG systems. This research establishes an improved artificial potential field method scheme based on the Maritime Internet of Things, which is based on the AUG leader's edge device to control multi-AUGs. In this process, an improved artificial potential field method is designed to solve the local optimal problem through behavior-based path optimization. Then, multi-AUGs are controlled to adapt to the task team plan based on the edge computing of the AUG leader. From the experimental results, it effectively realizes the AUG group cooperative control in the leader mode. Meanwhile, we established a marine communication model and AUG physics engine control model to complete a digital twin of multi-AUG monitoring tasks.

TI STUNS-Planner: a Spatiotemporal Motion Planner with Unbending and

   Motion and path planning
AB Motion planning is fundamental for the autonomous navigation of quadrotors in unknown environments, which often consists of path searching and trajectory generation. However, existing path searching approaches overlook the influence of the tortuosity of the path, and trajectory generation methods usually ignore optimizing the time allocation. They both threaten the security and limit the efficiency of autonomous navigation. In this paper, we propose a SpatioTemporal motion planner with UNbending and conSistent awareness (STUNS-Planner) to generate a safe, feasible and efficient trajectory by reducing the tortuosity of the path and improving time allocation of the trajectory. At the path searching stage, the unbending-aware path searching algorithm is proposed to search a local safe and unbending path before the trajectory generation. At the trajectory generation, we propose a fast scaling time adjustment method that can rapidly improve the efficiency of the trajectory while ensuring feasibility. In addition, to ensure the consistency between sequential replanning trajectories, a consistency-aware trajectory preserving and connecting mechanism is designed. The planner is integrated into a fully autonomous navigation system on a quadrotor. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments verify the performance of our system in terms of safety, tortuosity (about 8%-13% lesser) and trajectory time (about 3%-8% shorter) compared with existing approaches.

AB This paper develops an automatic online Behavior Tree (BT) synthesis and execution technique to guide an autonomous agent to accomplish a series of missions expressed in Fragmented-Linear Temporal Logic (F-LTL). For this purpose, a novel top-down, divide-and-conquer method is developed to decompose the original F-LTL formulas into simpler sub-formulas, followed by synthesizing the corresponding sub-BTs. Then, the safe and reachable regions are calculated to identify the winning set for the sub-BTs and the associated winning paths. If the computed winning set is non-empty, the sub-BTs are composed to form a coordinator whose execution guarantees the satisfaction of the original F-LTL formulas. The correctness of the proposed method is proved. Unlike most existing methods which manually design BTs and suffer from high computation cost, the proposed method can automatically synthesize the BTs on-the-fly for F-LTL formulas with polynomial complexity in the size of the formula and the environment. The developed method is applied to several scenarios with different missions and sizes of the environment using a physics-based simulator. The simulation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method to handle missions described by F-LTL formulas and the scalability of the approach in terms of the size of the environment.

AB The first Autonomous Drone Racing (ADR) was launched in the IEEE IROS 2016, and continued to be organised in IROS 2017, 2018 and 2019. Inspired by this competition, other international competitions were launched: the AlphaPilot organised by Lockheed Martin in collaboration with the Drone Racing League, and the Game of Drones, organised by Microsoft and Stanford University. A distinctive feature in the IROS ADR and AlphaPilot competitions is that competing drones had to perform on-board processing only. Hence, along these years, teams have presented novel solutions for on-board processing based on a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), a FieldProgrammable Gate Array (FPGA), microcontrollers and embedded computers such as the Odroid or Intel Stick computers. Motivated by the variety of these solutions, the goal of this work is that of providing the reader with a detail description of the hardware used for the competitions, their benefits as much as limitations, including those microchips used in specialised sensors such as the RGB-D and stereo cameras whose data processing is carried out on the sensor itself. It is expected to conclude that GPU will stand out as the best hardware to compute complex processing on-board, in particular due to the use of deep learning not only to address the gate detection problem, but also to address the control and planning tasks involved in this challenge.

AB Due to the increasing use of automobiles, the transportation industry is facing challenges of increased emissions, driver safety concerns, travel demand, etc. Hence, automotive industries are manufacturing vehicles that produce fewer emissions, are fuel-efficient, and provide safety for drivers. Artificial intelligence has taken a major leap recently and provides unprecedented opportunities to enhance performance, including in the automotive and transportation sectors. Artificial intelligence shows promising results in the trucking industry for increasing productivity, sustainability, reliability, and safety. Compared to passenger vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles present challenges due to their larger dimensions/weight and require attention to dynamics during operation. Data collected from vehicles can be used for emission and fuel consumption testing, as the drive cycle data represent real-world operating characteristics based on heavy-duty vehicles and their vocational use. Understanding the activity profiles of heavy-duty vehicles is important for freight companies to meet fuel consumption and emission standards, prevent unwanted downtime, and ensure the safety of drivers. Utilizing the large amount of data being collected these days and advanced computational methods such as artificial intelligence can help obtain insights in less time without on-road testing. However, the availability of data and the ability to apply data analysis/machine learning methods on heavy-duty vehicles have room for improvement in areas such as autonomous trucks, connected vehicles, predictive maintenance, fault diagnosis, etc. This paper presents a review of work on artificial intelligence, recent advancements, and research challenges in the trucking industry. Different applications of artificial intelligence in heavy-duty trucks, such as fuel consumption prediction, emissions estimation, self-driving technology, and predictive maintenance using various machine learning and deep learning methods, are discussed.

DE Disability; human rights; autonomous weapons; artificial intelligence
AB Autonomous weapons systems have been the subject of heated debate since 2010, when Philip Alston, then Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions, brought the issue to the international spotlight in his interim report to the United Nations (UN) General Assembly 65th Session. Alston affirmed that "automated technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and artificial intelligence reasoning and decision-making abilities are actively being researched and receive significant funding. States' militaries and defence industry developers are working to develop fully autonomous capability', such that technological advances in artificial intelligence will enable unmanned aerial vehicles to make and execute complex decisions, including the identification of human targets and the ability to kill them."(1) Later, in 2013, Christof Heyns, who was Special Rapporteur for Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions at the time, published a report that elaborated further on the issues raised by what he called "lethal autonomous robotics".(2) Following a recommendation by Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters at the UN General Assembly 68th Session, the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, as amended on 21 December 2021, started discussing autonomous weapons systems in 2014. Then, the Group of Governmental Experts on Emerging Technologies in the Area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (GGE on LAWS)(3) was created in 2016 to focus on this issue.(4) While the group has kept meeting since then, no clear steps have been taken yet towards a normative framework on autonomous weapons as of September 2022.
   In all these years, persons with disabilities - including conflict survivors - have not been included in discussions, nor has the disability perspective been reflected in international debate on autonomous weapons. Only recently has there been any effort to consider the rights of persons with disabilities when examining ethical questions related to artificial intelligence (AI). In this article, we will examine how and why autonomous weapons have a disproportionate impact on persons with disabilities, because of the discrimination that results from a combination of factors such as bias in AI, bias in the military and the police, barriers to justice and humanitarian assistance in situations of armed conflict, and the lack of consultation and participation of persons with disabilities and their representative organizations on issues related to autonomy in weapons systems.

AB Implementing reliable lane changes is crucial for reducing collisions and enhancing traffic safety. However, existing research lacks comprehensive investigation into the optimal path for maintaining driving quality, and little attention has been given to determining the appropriate lane changing time point. This paper addresses these gaps by presenting a novel hierarchical strategy. First, a synthesized safety distance for lane changing, which considers variable execution duration, is designed to reduce collision risk. Next, a hierarchy of optimization control strategies is proposed to obtain the optimal path. An upper neural network-fuzzy control algorithm is established to identify an appropriate lane-changing time point. Additionally, a lower neural network-improved firefly algorithm is formulated to optimize the preliminary safety path based on multiple driving criteria. Furthermore, the dynamics characteristics of the vehicle are incorporated into the model predictive control algorithm to ensure the vehicle follows the optimal path. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed hierarchical control strategy is validated through typical lane-changing scenarios conducted on the Carsim-Simulink platform.
   This study proposes a hierarchical optimization control strategy that includes a synthesized safety distance for lane changing, an upper neural network-fuzzy control algorithm to determine the lane changing timing, and a lower neural network-improved firefly algorithm to optimize the safety path based on multiple driving criteria.image

AB Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are a promising paradigm for implementing intelligent transportation systems. However, in CAVs scenarios, the sensing blind areas cause serious safety hazards. Existing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology is difficult to break through the sensing blind area and ensure reliable sensing information. To overcome these problems, considering infrastructures as a means to extend the sensing range is feasible based on the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. The mmWave base station (mmBS) transmits multiple beams consisting of communication beams and sensing beams. The sensing beams are responsible for sensing objects within the CAVs blind area, while the communication beams are responsible for transmitting the sensed information to the CAVs. To reduce the impact of inter-beam interference, a joint multiple beamwidth and power allocation (JMBPA) algorithm is proposed. By maximizing the communication transmission rate under the sensing constraints. The proposed non-convex optimization problem is transformed into a standard difference of two convex functions (D.C.) problem. Finally, the superiority of the proposed JMBPA algorithm is verified by iterative solutions. The average transmission rate of communication beams remains over 3.4 Gbps, showcasing a significant improvement compared to other algorithms. Moreover, the satisfaction of sensing services remains steady.

AB A frequent cause of auto accidents is disregarding the proximal traffic of an ego-vehicle during lane changing. Presumably, in a split-second-decision situation we may prevent an accident by predicting the intention of a driver before her action onset using the neural signals data, meanwhile building the perception of surroundings of a vehicle using optical sensors. The prediction of an intended action fused with the perception can generate an instantaneous signal that may replenish the driver's ignorance about the surroundings. This study examines electromyography (EMG) signals to predict intention of a driver along perception building stack of an autonomous driving system (ADS) in building an advanced driving assistant system (ADAS). EMG are classified into left-turn and right-turn intended actions and lanes and object detection with camera and Lidar are used to detect vehicles approaching from behind. A warning issued before the action onset, can alert a driver and may save her from a fatal accident. The use of neural signals for intended action prediction is a novel addition to camera, radar and Lidar based ADAS systems. Furthermore, the study demonstrates efficacy of the proposed idea with experiments designed to classify online and offline EMG data in real-world settings with computation time and the latency of communicated warnings.

ID DATA-REDUCTION ALGORITHM
AB The development of automotive-information & communication technology (ICT) convergence has resulted in various vehicle-based electrical/electronic (E/E) systems. An automotive E/E system consists of one or more electronic control units (ECUs), sensors and actuators. With the commercialization of connected/autonomous cars, vehicle-based wireless communication systems have appeared, and are expected to grow in popularity. This increases the number of attack surfaces that can potentially threaten in-vehicle controller area network (CAN). To combat the vulnerabilities of the CAN protocol, the CAN data field should be encrypted and transmitted with authentication codes. Recently, a method of transmitting authentication codes by modifying the CAN protocol was proposed. However, changing the original CAN protocol can cause serious problems in CAN systems. In this paper, to enhance CAN security, a data compression algorithm is used to reduce the data frame length so that there is space for a message authentication code (MAC) to be contained inside the data field. The proposed algorithm guarantees that all CAN frames are authenticated by a MAC of at least four bytes without any change of the original CAN protocol. Simulations using CAN data from Kia Sorento, Kia Soul, and LS Mtron vehicles show that the proposed algorithm works successfully with only a slight increase in the peak load.

AB There is a broad range of diverse technologies under the generic topic of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that holds the answer to many of the transportation problems. In this paper, one approach to ITS is presented. One of the most important research topics in this. field is adaptive cruise control (ACC). The main features of this kind of controller are the adaptation of the speed of the car to a predefined one and the keeping of a safe gap between the controlled car and the preceding vehicle on the road. We present an ACC controller based on fuzzy logic, which assists the speed and distance vehicle control, offering driving strategies and actuation over the throttle of a car. The driving information is supplied by the car tachometer and a RTK differential GPS, and the actuation over the car is made through an electronic interface that simulates the electrical signal of the accelerator pedal directly to the onboard computer. This control is embedded in an automatic driving system installed in two testbed mass-produced cars instrumented for testing the work of these controllers in a real environment. The results obtained in these experiments show a very good performance of the gap controller, which is adaptable to all the speeds and safe gap selections..

AB The development of neuroscience-based control methodologies and their integration with the high-lift unsteady hydrodynamics of control surfaces inspired by swimming and flying animals are the subjects of this paper. A biology-inspired rigid autonomous undersea vehicle called the biorobotic autonomous undersea vehicle (BAUV) has been developed at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC), Newport, RI. The BAUV is equipped with six simultaneously rolling and pitching fins for generating large unsteady control forces for performing agile maneuvers. First, as an exploratory example, we introduce the van der Pol oscillator as an oscillatory controller for the BAUV and we describe experiments performed to examine the fin forces (thrust and lift) and electric power requirement, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the oscillator's limit cycle property for disturbance rejection effectiveness. We then describe a BAUV control system that includes six inferior-olive (IO) neuron models for control of the pitch and roll motion of the six foils. These IO neurons exhibit limit cycle oscillation (LCO). For control of the BAUV, these IO neurons must oscillate in synchronism with specific relative phases. We present here four feedback linearizing control systems of varying complexity for control of the relative phases of the IO neurons. It is shown that each of the IO control systems accomplishes asymptotic regulation of the phases and thus enables the foils to produce the required control forces. The first controller has a global synchronization property, but the remaining controllers accomplish local synchronization. We present simulation results for tracking piecewise, time-varying phase angle commands as well as experimental results for control of the BAUV by IO neurons. The results show that with appropriate phasing of the fins, an optimal graceful gait of the BAUV is achieved where no untoward force or moment is present. An analog hardware version of the local controller with a cluster of six IO neurons has also been built, which allows five of the signals to rapidly synchronize to the reference, with or without prescribed phase shift, much like in the simulations. The designed controllers can be used in any platform or multivariate BAUV-like system requiring fast, accurate phase control. Laboratory test results for the phase synchronization of two servomotors (roll and pitch) using the designed analog hardware controller are also shown.

AB For autonomous driving, perception is a primary and essential element that fundamentally deals with the insight into the ego vehicle's environment through sensors. Perception is challenging, wherein it suffers from dynamic objects and continuous environmental changes. The issue grows worse due to interrupting the quality of perception via adverse weather such as snow, rain, fog, night light, sand storms, strong daylight, etc. In this work, we have tried to improve camera-based perception accuracy, such as autonomous-driving-related object detection in adverse weather. We proposed the improvement of YOLOv8-based object detection in adverse weather through transfer learning using merged data from various harsh weather datasets. Two prosperous open-source datasets (ACDC and DAWN) and their merged dataset were used to detect primary objects on the road in harsh weather. A set of training weights was collected from training on the individual datasets, their merged versions, and several subsets of those datasets according to their characteristics. A comparison between the training weights also occurred by evaluating the detection performance on the datasets mentioned earlier and their subsets. The evaluation revealed that using custom datasets for training significantly improved the detection performance compared to the YOLOv8 base weights. Furthermore, using more images through the feature-related data merging technique steadily increased the object detection performance.

AB Edge federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that trains a global parametric model from distributed datasets based on wireless communications. This paper proposes a unit-modulus over-the-air computation (UMAirComp) framework to facilitate efficient edge federated learning, which simultaneously uploads local model parameters and updates global model parameters via analog beamforming. The proposed framework avoids sophisticated baseband signal processing, leading to low communication delays and implementation costs. Training loss bounds of UMAirComp FL systems are derived and two low-complexity large-scale optimization algorithms, termed penalty alternating minimization (PAM) and accelerated gradient projection (AGP), are proposed to minimize the nonconvex nonsmooth loss bound. Simulation results show that the proposed UMAirComp framework with PAM algorithm achieves a smaller mean square error of model parameters' estimation, training loss, and test error compared with other benchmark schemes. Moreover, the proposed UMAirComp framework with AGP algorithm achieves satisfactory performance while reduces the computational complexity by orders of magnitude compared with existing optimization algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the implementation of UMAirComp in a vehicle-to-everything autonomous driving simulation platform. It is found that autonomous driving tasks are more sensitive to model parameter errors than other tasks since the neural networks for autonomous driving contain sparser model parameters.

AB Agricultural operations are constantly becoming technology-driven mainly due to labor shortages, increase in labor cost, and trends in new and advanced technology applications. In this paper, we have presented a system-of-systems approach to design and development of a mobile robotic platform for agricultural applications. Similar to other field robots, the mobile platform for agricultural applications requires a different set of predefined attributes for its operation. We have designed, fabricated, and demonstrated the mobile platform for pesticide spraying application. The design and development includes synergistic integration of mechanical, sensor and actuator, navigational and control, and electronic and software interfacings. The autonomous navigation aspect of the development was achieved via three stages: learning stage, implementation stage (training stage), and testing stage. In the learning stage, we defined the path patterns and studied and recorded the behavior of the vehicle in real-world environment. In the training stage, various steering algorithms for four-wheel driving system were developed and inherent errors were compensated using advanced tools and methods. In the testing stage, we put the robotic platform on an arbitrary path pattern and demonstrated its success in autonomous navigation. The medium-sized mobile robot can be commercialized for greenhouse-based agricultural operations.

AB The safety of vehicles is one of the major goals of driving automation. The safety distance is longer for rail vehicles such as trams because of the adherence limitations of the wheel-to-rail system. The major issues of fixed frontal sensing are fake target detection, blind spots related to rail slopes, curves, and random changes in the target's illumination or reflectivity. In this experimental study, distance measurements were performed using a scaled tram model equipped with a LiDAR sensor with a narrow field of view, under different conditions of illumination, size, and reflectivity of the target objects, and using different track configurations, to evaluate the effectiveness of such sensors in collision-avoidance systems for rail applications. The experimental findings are underlining the sensor's sensitivity to fake targets, objects in the sensor's blind spots, and special optical interferences, which are important for evaluating long-range LiDAR capabilities in sensing safety distance for vehicles. The conclusions can help developers to produce a dedicated colliding prevention system for trams and to identify the zones with high risk in the track where additional protection methods should be used. The LiDAR sensor must be used in conjunction with additional sensors to perform all the security tasks of an anti-colliding system for the tram.

AB Following the success story of passive and autonomous active safety systems, cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems based on vehicular communication are the next important step to the vision of accident-free driving. In recent years, various research projects have contributed solutions for the fundamental technological requirements of vehicle communication. Cost-efficient positioning and radio hardware is available and standardization is underway. Today, the focus of the work on vehicular communication shifts from research topics to preparing deployment. This is also reflected in the fact that publicly funded projects in all regions of the world move from clearly targeted research activities to the integrative measure of field operational tests. In this paper, we give an overview of how research on vehicular communication evolved in Europe and, especially, in Germany. We then describe the German field operational test sim(TD). The project sim(TD) is the first field operational test to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of applications based on vehicular communication in a setup that is representative for a realistic deployment environment. It is, therefore, the next necessary step to prepare for an informed deployment decision of cooperative systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The autonomous navigation of unmanned vehicles in GPS denied environments is an incredibly challenging task. Because cameras are low in price, obtain rich information, and passively sense the environment, vision based simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) has great potential to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel VSLAM framework based on a stereo camera. The proposed approach combines the direct and indirect method for the real-time localization of an autonomous forklift in a non-structured warehouse. Our proposed hybrid method uses photometric errors to perform image alignment for data association and pose estimation, extracts features from keyframes, and matches them to acquire the updated pose. By combining the efficiency of the direct method and the high accuracy of the indirect method, the approach achieves higher speed with comparable accuracy to a state-of-the-art method. Furthermore, the two step dynamic threshold feature extraction method significantly reduces the operating time. In addition, a motion model of the forklift is proposed to provide a more reasonable initial pose for direct image alignment based on photometric errors. The proposed algorithm is experimentally tested on a dataset constructed from a large scale warehouse with dynamic lighting and long corridors, and the results show that it can still successfully perform with high accuracy. Additionally, our method can operate in real time using limited computing resources.

ID EXPERIMENTAL HYDRODYNAMICS; FINS
AB A novel ostraciiform swimming, vision-based autonomous robotic fish is developed in this paper. Its feasibility and capability are shown by implementing a dynamic target following task in a swimming pool. Inspired by boxfish that is highly stable and fairly maneuverable, the robotic fish is designed and constructed by locating multiple propulsors peripherally around a rigid body. Swimming locomotion of the robotic fish is achieved through harmonic oscillations of the tail and pectoral fins. The forces and moments acting on the fins and body are analyzed and the governing motion equations are derived. Through coordinating the movements of the propulsors, several typical swimming patters are empirical designed and realized. A digital camera is integrated in the robotic fish, and the visual information is processed with the embedded microcontroller. To treat the degradation of underwater image, a continuously adaptive mean shift (Camshift) algorithm is modified to keep Visual lock on the moving target. A fuzzy logic controller is designed for motion regulation of a hybrid swimming pattern, which employs synchronized pectoral fins for thrust generation and tail fin for steering. A simple target following task is designed via an autonomous robotic fish swimming after a manually controlled robotic fish with fixed distance. The swimming performance of the robotic fish is tested and the effectiveness of the proposed target following method is verified experimentally.

AB Automated vehicles are emerging on the transportation networks as manufacturers test their automated driving system (ADS) capabilities in complex real-world environments in testing operations like California's Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program. A more comprehensive understanding of the ADS safety performances can be established through the California Department of Motor Vehicle disengagement and crash reports. This study comprehensively examines the safety performances (159,840 disengagements, 124 crashes, and 3,669,472 automated vehicle miles traveled by the manufacturers) documented since the inauguration of the testing program. The reported disengagements were categorized as control discrepancy, environmental conditions and other road users, hardware and software discrepancy, perception discrepancy, planning discrepancy, and operator takeover. An applicable subset of disengagements was then used to identify and quantify the 5 W's of these safety-critical events: who (disengagement initiator), when (the maturity of the ADS), where (location of disengagement), and what/why (the facts causing the disengagement). The disengagement initiator, whether the ADS or human operator, is linked with contributing factors, such as the location, disengagement cause, and ADS testing maturity through a random parameter binary logit model that captured unobserved heterogeneity. Results reveal that compared to freeways and interstates, the ADS has a lower likelihood of initiating the disengagement on streets and roads compared to the human operator. Likewise, software and hardware, and planning discrepancies are associated with the ADS initiating the disengagement. As the ADS testing maturity advances in months, the probability of the disengagement being initiated by the ADS marginally increases when compared to human-initiated. Overall, the study contributes by understanding the factors associated with disengagements and exploring their implications for automated systems.

AB Biomolecular analyses are used to investigate the dynamics of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs), with samples collected during monitoring often analyzed by qPCR and sometimes amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. However, cyanoHAB research and monitoring programs face operational constraints due to the reliance on human resources for sample collections. To address this impediment, a third-generation Environmental Sample Processor (3G ESP) integrated with a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV) was tested during seasonal blooms of Microcystis in western Lake Erie (WLE) in 2018 and 2019. The LRAUV-3G ESP successfully performed flexible, autonomous sampling across a wide range of cyanoHAB conditions, and results indicated equivalency between autonomous and manual methods. No significant differences were found between LRAUV-3G ESP and manual sample collection and handling methods in the 12 parameters tested. Analyzed parameters included concentrations of total cyanobacteria and microcystin toxin gene via qPCR; relative abundances of bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; and community diversity measures from both 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. The LRAUV-3G ESP provided additional sampling capacity and revealed differences between field seasons for bacterial taxa and concentrations of total cyanobacteria and microcystin toxin gene. Metagenomic analysis of multiple microcystin toxin genes corroborated the use of the mcyE gene as a proxy for the genomic potential of WLE cyanoHABs to produce microcystin. Overall, this study provides support for the use of autonomous 'omics capability in WLE to help expand the spatial and temporal coverage of cyanoHAB monitoring operations.

   driving
AB In recent years, with the rapid development of sensing technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors play increasingly important roles in traffic control, medical monitoring, industrial production and etc. They generated high volume of data in a streaming way that often need to be processed in real time. Therefore, streaming data computing technology plays an indispensable role in the real-time processing of sensor data in high throughput but low latency. However, there are two problems in deploying streaming data process ability in cloud computing data centre. Firstly, massive sensor nodes simultaneously upload data to the remote cloud computing data centre, which requires a large number of bandwidth resources supports. The existing network infrastructure cannot provide enough bandwidth at a reasonable price. Secondly, due to the geographical distribution characteristics of the cloud computing data centre, there will inevitably be large transmission delay during the process of data transmission. Such end-to-end delay is intolerable to mobile applications especially for those latency sensitive tasks. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes an autonomous driving oriented edge streaming data processing framework, which migrates the computing and storage capability from the remote cloud data centre to the edge data centre. It focuses on the change of vehicle flow in a specific geographical area, and uses the computing power sunk to edge node to process the massive streaming data generated by autonomous vehicles nearby. The proposed framework is implemented on top of Spark Streaming, which builds up a gray model based traffic flow monitor, a traffic prediction orientated prediction layer and a fuzzy control based Batch Interval dynamic adjustment layer for Spark Streaming. It could forecast the variation of sensors data arrive rate, make streaming Batch Interval adjustment in advance and implement real-time streaming process by edge. Therefore, it can realise the monitor and prediction of the data flow changes of the autonomous driving vehicle sensor data in geographical coverage of edge computing node area, meanwhile minimise the end-to-end latency but satisfy the application throughput requirements. The experiments show that it can predict short-term traffic with no more than 4% relative error in a whole day. By making batch consuming rate close to data generating rate, it can maintain system stability well even when arrival data rate changes rapidly. The Batch Interval can be converged to a suitable value in two minutes when data arrival rate is doubled. Compared with vanilla version Spark Streaming, where there has serious task accumulation and introduces large delay, it can reduce 35% latency by squeezing Batch Interval when data arrival rate is low; it also can significantly improve system throughput by only at most 25% Batch Interval increase when data arrival rate is high.

AB Autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) have cost and mobility benefits, making them ideal robotic platforms for applications including aerial photography, surveillance, and search and rescue. As the platform scales down, MAVs become more capable of operating in confined environments, but it also introduces significant size and payload constraints. A monocular visual-inertial navigation system (VINS), consisting only of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera, becomes the most suitable sensor suite in this case, thanks to its light weight and small footprint. In fact, it is the minimum sensor suite allowing autonomous flight with sufficient environmental awareness. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve reliable online autonomous navigation using monocular VINS. Our system is built on a customized quadrotor testbed equipped with a fisheye camera, a low-cost IMU, and heterogeneous onboard computing resources. The backbone of our system is a highly accurate optimization-based monocular visual-inertial state estimator with online initialization and self-extrinsic calibration. An onboard GPU-based monocular dense mapping module that conditions on the estimated pose provides wide-angle situational awareness. Finally, an online trajectory planner that operates directly on the incrementally built three dimensional map guarantees safe navigation through cluttered environments. Extensive experimental results are provided to validate individual system modules as well as the overall performance in both indoor and outdoor environments.

AB Lack of consumer acceptance is a prominent barrier to the large-scale adoption of automated vehicles (AVs). This study investigated the underlying mechanisms for AV acceptance and how the mechanisms differed across subgroups by reviewing and synthesizing existing literature. We proposed AV acceptance models by extending the basic Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with trust and perceived risk factors. Data from 36 studies were extracted to fit the models using meta-analytic structural equation modeling technique. The results suggested that trust contributed most in determining AV acceptance, followed by perceived usefulness and perceived risk, and perceived ease of use makes the least contribution. The subgroup analyses showed that the model parameters differed across the levels of three variables, i.e., sample origin (Europe/Asia/America), automation level (full/ partial), and age (young/middle-aged). Specifically, trust was unanimously identified as the most important determinant of AV acceptance across all subgroups. Perceived risk only remained significant in America, fully AVs, and middle-aged subgroups. Perceived ease of use was insignificant in the above-mentioned three subgroups while remained significant in the rest subgroups. Building trust could be the most useful and universal way to improve AV acceptance, and policy makers should consider the characteristics of consumers when making AV promotion strategies.

ID MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM
AB For microgrids (MGs) with electric vehicle prosumers, effective time-of-use based energy trading is important for multi-vehicles-to-MG system. In this paper, a Stochastic Stackelberg game (SSG) model is proposed. The model is based on the Stackelberg game, where the sellers act as leader and the buyers are considered as follower. First, according to the distributed generation's (DG) output and load distribution, MGs are classified as sellers and buyers, whose strategies set are established separately. Then the utility models of sellers and buyers are established, which include a stochastic variable model for electric vehicles (EVs). Moreover, with the proof of equilibrium and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium, sellers are obligated to coordinate the sharing of energy with maximization of the profit, while the buyers are autonomous to maximize their utilities with demands response to availabilities. Finally, the game equilibrium is solved to deal with the uncertainty of EV's energy and plugging-in time. By using the collected data from realistic EVs, the effectiveness of the model is verified in terms of seller profit, the utilities of buyers, and the net energy usage in MG. The results of the static pricing model and SSG model were compared to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SSG model.

AB This paper proposes an optimal dynamic supply of parking permits under uncertainties in the mixed traffic environment of regular vehicles (RVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). The uncertainties from queuing delay and cruising-for-parking time, respectively, are derived from parking permit holders' unascertainable early arrival/late departure and the randomness of vehicle speed for cruising-for-parking users. We formulate the dynamic system optimum as a stochastic optimal control problem, aiming to minimize the total time lost for all parking users. On this basis, we express the optimality condition as Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and propose an optimal control strategy for dynamic supply of parking permits (called optimal parking supply scheme). The proposed scheme is determined by two observable and measurable variables, i.e., queuing time and cruising-for-parking time. We find that the scheme can significantly reduce the total system time lost, especially when the uncertainty from parking permit holders is at a high level or the percentage of AVs is small. Finally, a case study of a selected sample area in Beijing is conducted, which verifies the efficiency of the proposed scheme numerically.

AB Landmark-based vehicle localization is a key component of both autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Previously used landmarks in highways such as lane markings lack information on longitudinal positions. To address this problem, lane endpoints can be used as landmarks. This paper proposes two essential components when using lane endpoints as landmarks: lane endpoint detection and its accuracy evaluation. First, it proposes a method to efficiently detect lane endpoints using a monocular forward-looking camera, which is the most widely installed perception sensor. Lane endpoints are detected with a small amount of computation based on the following steps: lane detection, lane endpoint candidate generation, and lane endpoint candidate verification. Second, it proposes a method to reliably measure the position accuracy of the lane endpoints detected from images taken while the camera is moving at high speed. A camera is installed with a mobile mapping system (MMS) in a vehicle, and the position accuracy of the lane endpoints detected by the camera is measured by comparing their positions with ground truths obtained by the MMS. In the experiment, the proposed methods were evaluated and compared with previous methods based on a dataset acquired while driving on 80 km of highway in both daytime and nighttime.

AB For safe autonomous driving, deep neural network (DNN)-based perception systems play essential roles, where a vast amount of driving images should be manually collected and labeled with ground truth (GT) for training and validation purposes. After observing the manual GT generation's high cost and unavoidable human errors, this study presents an open-source automatic GT generation tool, CarFree, based on the Carla autonomous driving simulator. By that, we aim to democratize the daunting task of (in particular) object detection dataset generation, which was only possible by big companies or institutes due to its high cost. CarFree comprises (i) a data extraction client that automatically collects relevant information from the Carla simulator's server and (ii) a post-processing software that produces precise 2D bounding boxes of vehicles and pedestrians on the gathered driving images. Our evaluation results show that CarFree can generate a considerable amount of realistic driving images along with their GTs in a reasonable time. Moreover, using the synthesized training images with artificially made unusual weather and lighting conditions, which are difficult to obtain in real-world driving scenarios, CarFree significantly improves the object detection accuracy in the real world, particularly in the case of harsh environments. With CarFree, we expect its users to generate a variety of object detection datasets in hassle-free ways.

AB A control design approach to achieve fully autonomous takeoff and flight maneuvers with a tethered aircraft is presented and demonstrated in real-world flight tests with a small-scale prototype. A ground station equipped with a controlled winch and a linear motion system accelerates the aircraft to takeoff speed and controls the tether reeling in order to limit the pulling force. This setup corresponds to airborne wind energy (AWE) systems with ground-based energy generation and rigid aircrafts. A simple model of the aircraft's dynamics is introduced and its parameters are identified from experimental data. A model-based, hierarchical feedback controller is then designed, whose aim is to manipulate the elevator, aileron, and propeller inputs in order to stabilize the aircraft during the takeoff and to achieve figure-of-eight flight patterns parallel to the ground. The controller operates in a fully decoupled mode with respect to the ground station. Parameter tuning and stability/robustness aspect are discussed, too. The experimental results indicate that the controller is able to achieve satisfactory performance and robustness, notwithstanding its simplicity, and confirm that the considered takeoff approach is technically viable and solves the issue of launching this kind of AWE systems in a compact space and at low additional cost.

AB To maintain a safe distance between the autonomous vehicle and the leader, ensure that the vehicle runs at its expected speed as far as possible, and achieve various control requirements such as speed, distance and collision avoidance, a model-free prescribed performance adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithm based on funnel control is proposed. The contributions of this paper are that the designed ACC algorithm only requires the speed and position information and can constrain their tracking errors within a predetermined range. When the follower is far away from the leader, the speed-prescribed performance controller adjusts the follower vehicle's speed to the reference velocity. When the follower vehicle approaches the leader vehicle, a distance-prescribed performance controller is designed to adjust the distance between the follower and the leader. On this basis, the prescribed performance function can expand the switching interval, thereby improving the robustness of the speed and distance control switching process. The effectiveness of the designed algorithm is demonstrated in three scenarios, such as approaching and following, emergency braking, and frequent starting and stopping. The results show that during the speed control stage, the designed algorithm allows the vehicle's operating speed to vary within a predetermined spatial range; in the distance control stage, the designed algorithm strictly limits the distance error within the preset range. The speed and distance of the vehicle change smoothly, and there is no overshoot during the initial state adjustment, emergency braking, and frequent start and stop stages, demonstrating a good control effect.

ID ALGORITHM
AB In recent years, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have been widely utilized in various applications, including robotics and autonomous driving. However, LiDAR sensors have relatively low resolutions, take considerable time to acquire laser range measurements, and require significant resources to process and store large-scale point clouds. To tackle these issues, many depth image sampling algorithms have been proposed, but their performances are unsatisfactory in complex on-road environments, especially when the sampling rate of measuring equipment is relatively low. Although region-of-interest (ROI)-based sampling has achieved some promising results for LiDAR sampling in on-road environments, the rate of ROI sampling has not been thoroughly investigated, which has limited reconstruction performance. To address this problem, this article proposes a solution to the budget distribution optimization problem to find optimal sampling rates according to the characteristics of each region. A simple yet effective mean absolute error (MAE)-aware model of reconstruction errors was developed and employed to analytically derive optimal sampling rates. In addition, a practical LiDAR sampling framework for autonomous driving was developed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all previous approaches in terms of both the object and overall scene reconstruction performances.

AB Principal objectives of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are to improve traffic safety, facilitate informed traffic decision making, and enhance quality of life and services in a smart traffic environment. Vehicle crashes at urban traffic intersections are among the rudimentary sources of injuries and fatalities in the cities. According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), in every 25 seconds, one vulnerable road-user is being killed by a vehicle crash. Therefore, it is necessary to take a novel and smart approach for improving the safety and reducing vehicle crashes. This leads to a contextual perception and spatial awareness of driver to increase security and safety for the driver, vehicle, and road users. Autonomous vehicles collects the information from the environment through equipped sensors on the vehicle such as camera, laser, radar, and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The main challenge arises when the person or objects are located beyond the driver's Field of View (FOV) and cannot be detected by embedded sensors on the vehicles. This paper proposes an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) to increase the safety on road intersections by taking advantage of existing infrastructures (e.g road camera) being used for traffic control. The aim of this research is improving the driver's FOV using a computer vision approach (e.g background subtraction algorithm) and Location Based Service (LBS). The case study results at Tehran metropolitan demonstrate the reduction in traffic collision risk and improvement of pedestrian safety using the proposed system.

AB In this paper, we study minimum-time motion planning and routing problems for the Dubins vehicle, i.e., a nonholonomic vehicle that is constrained to move along planar paths of bounded curvature, without reversing direction. Motivated by autonomous aerial vehicle applications, we consider the Traveling Salesperson Problem for the Dubins vehicle (DTSP): given n points on a plane, what is the shortest Dubins tour through these points, and what is its length? First, we show that the worst-case length of such a tour grows linearly with n and we propose a novel algorithm with performance within a constant factor of the optimum for the worst-case point sets. In doing this, we also obtain an upper bound on the optimal length in the classical point-to-point problem. Second, we study a stochastic version of the DTSP where the n targets are randomly and independently sampled from a uniform distribution. We show that the expected length of such a tour is of order at least n(2/3) and we propose a novel algorithm yielding a solution with length of order n(2/3) with probability one. Third and finally, we study a dynamic version of the DTSP: given a stochastic process that generates target points, is there a policy that guarantees that the number of unvisited points does not diverge over time? If such stable policies exist, what is the minimum expected time that a newly generated target waits before being visited by the vehicle? We propose a novel stabilizing algorithm such that the expected wait time is provably within a constant factor from the optimum.

AB The use of vehicles to control pests and crop diseases is needed to maintain agricultural production. This paper describes how to design and implement a low cost intelligent telecontrol system applied for agricultural machinery that are designed for use in places where human presence is not adequate, such as pesticide spraying tasks in farming environments as greenhouses. The intelligent system designed basically consists of these parts: States Encoding, Console Automaton, Vehicle Automaton, Communication System and Security of Communications. This system has been developed with a special-purpose UHF narrow band modem that interchanges digital operative commands/states from the console to the vehicle. The intelligent telecontrol system acts as a security system to protect against outsiders, and loss of communications due to fading or others interference. The originality of this system is based on the fact that it is 10 times cheaper than autonomous systems; those systems need electronic systems, GPS, a complex sensorial system, and a beforehand mapping performed on the new work environment. Related to classic remote control, our system protects from potential oversights of the operator. In addition, in the proposed system, the vehicle state is shown in the console, due the bidirectional communications. The system was successfully applied in prototype vehicle used for spraying tasks, and the result shows that the system operated stably and has confirmed the effectiveness of this intelligent telecontrol system. The proposed technology will help providing solutions for humans and robots working together in agricultural environments considered to be harmful to humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a three-layered approach for the mission route planning problems involving a team of autonomous vehicles where they have to collectively navigate to a number of target locations in an environment with both static and dynamic obstacles. The first layer computes the maximum distance that need to be traveled to complete a mission by a team of vehicles. We have developed a nearest-neighbor-search based approach to assign closely located tasks to each vehicle in the team. We developed a stochastic optimization based path planning algorithm that can compute the collision-free (with both static and dynamic obstacles) trajectory for a vehicle to navigate from start to the target location. By combining task assignment with path planning algorithm, we can estimate the maximum traveled distance for a mission with a team of vehicles. The second layer determines the optimal number of vehicles required for a mission based on any user defined constraint by casting it as a multiobjective optimization problem with two competing objectives, i.e. time vs cost. The methods derived in layer one are utilized to evaluate the objective functions in layer two. Finally, we have proposed a data driven neural network-based prediction model that will forecast the mission completion time with a reasonable accuracy which will utilize the historical information of the previous missions. The forecasting model is intended to facilitate the effective planning of parallel and subsequent missions. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach with numerical simulation results for every layer mentioned above.

AB This paper proposes a hierarchical model for cooperative on-ramp merging control (CORMC) in mixed traffic with both connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs). The upper-layer of the CORMC model employs an anticipatory position searching (APS) algorithm to determine the anticipatory positions at which merging vehicles (MVs) should merge from the on-ramp lane to the adjacent mainline lane, and to assign cooperative vehicles (CVs) for each MV. A collaborative utility choice (CUC) model is presented to determine the optimal maneuver of CVs to create proper gaps for MVs. The driver compliance rate is introduced to account for CHVs' unwillingness to follow the instructions given by the CUC model. The lower-layer comprises a cooperative merging control (CMC) model that ensures safe and smooth merging execution for MVs. Longitudinal and lane changing models are developed for mainline vehicles to facilitate an efficient and safe merging process. Simulation results show that the performance benefits of the CUC model are marginal when the CHV compliance rate is relatively low. However, the performance improvement is significant at higher compliance rates (>50%). Furthermore, the CORMC model has the potential to increase merging and mainline throughput by over 75% at sufficiently high CAV penetration rates. Comparison of three control strategies shows that the APS algorithm plays an important role in the CORMC model. A comparison with the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) indicates that the CORMC model significantly mitigates the propagation of congestion waves across varying levels of CAV penetration and on-ramp flow rates.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea leads to excessive daytime sleepiness and cognitive dysfunction, which are risk factors for motor vehicle collisions. We aimed to clarify if vehicles with an advanced emergency braking system could reduce motor vehicle collisions caused by falling asleep while driving among patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea. We enrolled patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea who underwent polysomnography. The questionnaires included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, history of drowsy driving accidents, and use of an advanced emergency braking system. Multivariate analysis was performed, and odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. This study included 1097 patients (mean age, 51.2 +/- 12.9 years). Collisions caused by falling asleep while driving were recorded in 59 (5.4%) patients, and were more frequently observed in vehicles without an advanced emergency braking system (p = 0.045). Multivariate analysis showed that these collisions were associated with use of an advanced emergency braking system (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.39 [0.16-0.97], p = 0.04), length of driving (2.79 [1.19-6.50], p = 0.02), total sleep time (2.40 [1.62-3.55], p < 0.0001), sleep efficiency (0.94 [0.90-0.98], p = 0.003) and periodic limb movement index (1.02 [1.01-1.03], p = 0.004). The collision risk caused by falling asleep while driving in vehicles with an advanced emergency braking system was significantly lower. This study indicates that advanced emergency braking systems may be a preventive measure to reduce motor vehicle collisions among patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea.

AB A novel fault-tolerant model predictive control (MPC)-based trajectory tracking approach for an aerial vehicle is presented in this study. A generalised online sequential extreme learning machine is introduced first to identify the corresponding coefficients of actuator faults. Subsequently, a robust trajectory tracking control is developed based on MPC, where the system constraints can be effectively considered in the designed control scheme. Trajectory tracking control is achieved by controlling only the acceleration of the aerial robot in the MPC structure. This leads to less computational burden and faster closed-loop dynamics. In addition, an effective disturbance observer is employed, which can satisfactorily capture the effects of unmodelled dynamics and external disturbances on the system dynamics. The stability of the proposed control algorithm is proved based on the Lyapunov theory under realistic assumptions. Finally, the proposed control strategy is applied to a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced fault-tolerant control scheme. The obtained results suggest that the designed control approach is capable of stabilising the attitude and providing acceptable performance in tracking a predefined trajectory in a three-dimensional environment in the simultaneous presence of actuator faults and external disturbances.

AB To avoid an expected traffic jam, drivers make detours based on limited information; however, the majority following the alike routes may result in an unexpected congestion. Conventional navigation approaches are unable to respond to the unexpected congestion because these approaches do not consider the routes taken by other vehicles. Navigation systems that utilize global traffic information can improve gas consumption, CO2 emissions and travel time. Therefore, in this paper, the authors propose an autonomic navigation system (ANS) operating over vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). The proposed ANS adopts a hierarchical algorithm to plan vehicle routes. The proposed ANS imitates the human nervous system when managing the navigation system, in which vehicles monitor traffic via VANETs. Moreover, this paper proposes a time-dependent routing algorithm that uses a novel traffic prediction method based on the routes of vehicles. This paper adopts EstiNet as simulator tool that dominates hundreds or thousands of VANET-based vehicles routing in two maps, Manhattan area, and Taipei city. The results show that the proposed ANS improves the average speed by 60.02 % when compared with the shortest path first (SPF) algorithm and by 15.49 % when compared with the distributed method of a traffic simulation in the Manhattan area. The proposed ANS also improves the average speed by 30.5 % when compared with the SPF algorithm and by 15.8 % when compared with the distributed method of a traffic simulation in the Taipei area. Furthermore, to emulate real environments, there is a scenario in which only a portion of the vehicles complies with the proposed ANS.

AB When will automated vehicles come onto the market? This question has puzzled the automotive industry and society for years. The technology and its implementation have made rapid progress over the last decade, but the challenge of how to prove the safety of these systems has not yet been solved. Since a market launch without proof of safety would neither be accepted by society nor by legislators, much time and many resources have been invested into safety assessment in recent years in order to develop new approaches for an efficient assessment. This paper therefore provides an overview of various approaches, and gives a comprehensive survey of the so-called scenario-based approach. The scenario-based approach is a promising method, in which individual traffic situations are typically tested by means of virtual simulation. Since an infinite number of different scenarios can theoretically occur in real-world traffic, even the scenario-based approach leaves the question unanswered as to how to break these down into a finite set of scenarios, and find those which are representative in order to render testing more manageable. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of related safety-assessment publications that deal precisely with this question. Therefore, this paper develops a novel taxonomy for the scenario-based approach, and classifies all literature sources. Based on this, the existing methods will be compared with each other and, as one conclusion, the alternative concept of formal verification will be combined with the scenario-based approach. Finally, future research priorities are derived.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are already part of the surface transportation system. In order for a CAV to operate safely, it needs information such as static data (high-resolution navigation maps) and real-time dynamics from various sensors, some of which exchange information with other vehicles or roadside units. High resolution navigation maps can integrate historical on-road driving performance data to help CAVs and drivers operating vehicles with low level automation make informed proactive decisions. This study proposes that navigation maps on CAVs come pre-installed with historical driving data and that they work together with real-time sensors to help CAVs plan maneuvers. Historical driving data offers insights about decisions made by drivers at locations along a route, e.g., where drivers often make sharp turns or where they accelerate and decelerate hard. A pre-installed record of historical driving decisions will support informed decision-making and proactively "warn" CAVs and drivers about potential hazards. This study explores location-based driving volatility as a key to improving safety through CAVs. Location-based volatility is a measure of historical driving performance, defined as the percentage of extreme maneuvers performed on a location in road network. For demonstration, we modeled and visualized real-world high-resolution geo-referenced data. The data comes from a connected vehicle safety pilot program in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We found measured location-based volatility is significantly related to safety outcomes. Therefore, location-based driving volatility can serve as a valuable piece of information to be added to navigation maps in CAVs in order to help them navigate volatile hot-spots.

DT Article
DE Intrusion detection; machine learning; autonomous vehicles
ID ARCHITECTURE; ATTACKS; SYSTEMS; NETWORK
AB Detection of cyber attacks against vehicles is of growing interest. As vehicles typically afford limited processing resources, proposed solutions are rule-based or lightweight machine learning techniques. We argue that this limitation can be lifted with computational offloading commonly used for resource-constrained mobile devices. The increased processing resources available in this manner allow access to more advanced techniques. Using as case study a small four-wheel robotic land vehicle, we demonstrate the practicality and benefits of offloading the continuous task of intrusion detection that is based on deep learning. This approach achieves high accuracy much more consistently than with standard machine learning techniques and is not limited to a single type of attack or the in-vehicle CAN bus as previous work. As input, it uses data captured in real-time that relate to both cyber and physical processes, which it feeds as time series data to a neural network architecture. We use both a deep multilayer perceptron and recurrent neural network architecture, with the latter benefitting from a long-short term memory hidden layer, which proves very useful for learning the temporal context of different attacks. We employ denial of service, command injection and malware as examples of cyber attacks that are meaningful for a robotic vehicle. The practicality of computation offloading depends on the resources afforded onboard and remotely, and the reliability of the communication means between them. Using detection latency as the criterion, we have developed a mathematical model to determine when computation offloading is beneficial given parameters related to the operation of the network and the processing demands of the deep learning model. The more reliable the network and the greater the processing demands, the greater the reduction in detection latency achieved through offloading.

ID ROBOT LOCALIZATION; MULTITARGET; TRACKING
AB The solution to the problem of mapping an environment and at the same time using this map to localize (the simultaneous localization and mapping, SLAM, problem) is a key prerequisite in the synthesis of truly autonomous vehicles. By far the most common formulation of the SLAM problem is founded on a vector based stochastic framework, where the sensor models and the vehicle models are represented in state-space form and the joint posterior or its statistics are obtained based on recursive Bayesian estimation. All of these SLAM solutions leading from the stochastic vector state-space approach require that we solve certain parallel problems in each recursion. These include effective solutions to the problems of data association, feature extraction, clutter filtering, and landmark or map management. In this paper, we propose an alternative framework based on finite set statistics (FISST), where the SLAM problem is reformulated so that the landmark map and the measurements are represented using random finite sets and the landmark map is jointly estimated with the vehicle state vector, whilst explicitly accounting for measurement detection uncertainty, data-association uncertainty, false alarms and map management in the SLAM filter framework. Similar to FastSLAM, the proposed formulation is based on a factorization of the full SLAM posterior into a product of the vehicle trajectory posterior and the landmark map posterior conditioned on the vehicle trajectory. The vehicle trajectory posterior is then estimated using a particle filter and the map posterior conditioned on the vehicle trajectory via a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) implementation of the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. Simulation results of the proposed algorithm are presented and benchmarked against FastSLAM to demonstrate the effectiveness and improved performance of the FISST-SLAM in the presence of significant clutter.

AB This work investigated the cooperative control of a highway on-ramp under a connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) environment based on improved variable time headway (IVTH). A mainline section with a connected on-ramp and off-ramp of an intelligent highway were used as research objects. An IVTH model was developed and its stability was proved. The traffic flow model of the section was established and then verified in experiments. A cooperative control strategy of highway on-off-ramps is proposed. The cooperative merging control model (CMCM) based on IVTH (CMCM-IVTH) was constructed in which the influence of off-ramp separation is considered. The model predictive control method based on particle swarm optimization is used to obtain the acceleration and deceleration of platoon leaders with CMCM-IVTH and the time headway of the following vehicles with the traffic flow model based on IVTH. The control effects were determined via simulation experiments. The results indicate that the acceleration and deceleration times of vehicles, fuel consumption, and collision possibility decreased significantly using the proposed method. Under a 20% diverging rate, the maximum number of slow-moving vehicles was reduced by as much as 75.0% and 33.3%, total delay time was reduced by as much as 72.9% and 18.9%, the average traveling velocity was increased by as much as 21.9% and 2.1%, compared with the no-optimization-control method and a method with only cooperative merging control, respectively. The operating efficiency and safety level can be enhanced.

AB With the unprecedented shift towards automated urban environments in recent years, a new paradigm is required to study pedestrian behaviour. Studying pedestrian behaviour in futuristic scenarios requires modern data sources that consider both the Automated Vehicle (AV) and pedestrian perspectives. Current open datasets on AVs predominantly fail to account for the latter, as they do not include an adequate number of events and associated details that involve pedestrian and vehicle interactions. To address this issue, we propose using Virtual Reality (VR) data as a complementary resource to current datasets, which can be designed to measure pedestrian behaviour under specific conditions. In this research, we focus on the context-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework for automated vehicles at mid-block unsignalized crossings. For this purpose, we develop a novel multi-input network of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and fully connected dense layers. In addition to past trajectories, the proposed framework incorporates pedestrian head orientations and distance to the upcoming vehicles as sequential input data. By merging the sequential data with contextual information of the environment, we train a model to predict the future pedestrian trajectory. Our results show that the prediction error is reduced by considering contextual information extracted from the crossing environment, as well as the addition of time-series behavioural information to the model. To analyse the application of the methods to real AV data, the proposed framework is trained and applied to pedestrian trajectories extracted from an open-access video dataset. Finally, by implementing a game theory-based model interpretability method, we provide detailed insights and propose recommendations to improve the current automated vehicle sensing systems from a pedestrian-oriented point of view.

AB Weaving sections are components of highway networks that introduce a heightened likelihood for bottlenecks and collisions. Automated vehicle technology could address this as it holds considerable promise for transportation mobility and safety improvements. However, the implications of combining automated vehicles (AuVs) with traditional human-driven vehicles (HuVs) in weaving freeway sections have not been quantitatively measured. To address this gap, this paper objectively experimented with bidirectional (i.e., longitudinal and lateral) motion dynamics in a microscopic modeling framework to measure the mobility and safety implications for mixed traffic movement in a freeway weaving section. Our research begins by establishing a multilane microscopic model for studied vehicle types (i.e., AuV and HuV) from model predictive control with the provision to form a CACC platoon of AuV vehicles. The proposed modeling framework was tested first with HuV only on a two-lane weaving section and validated using standardized macroscopic parameters from the Highway Capacity Manual. This model was then applied to incrementally expand the AuV share for varying inflow rates of traffic. Simulation results showed that the maximum flow rate through the weaving section was attained at a 65% AuV share. At the same time, steadiness in the average speed of traffic was experienced with increasing AuV share. The results also revealed that a 95% AuV share could reduce potential conflicts by 94.28%. Finally, the results of simulated scenarios were consolidated and scaled to report expected mobility and safety outcomes from the prevailing traffic state and the optimal AuV share for the current inflow rate in weaving sections.

AB Vehicle automation is expected to reduce the cost of shared demand-responsive transport (DRT) services. In this context, questions regarding the conditions under which fixed-route public transport can be replaced with shared on-demand services have emerged. The expected increase in competitiveness between fixed-route and on-demand services requires the development of frameworks that enable the analysis of transportation costs of alternative modes. In this research, we develop a total cost minimization model for demand-responsive door-to-door shared transportation services, including operator and user costs. Optimization variables are vehicle size and fleet size for operation with human-driven and automated vehicles. A hybrid approach is used in which the relevant variables are analytically and numerically modeled, using data from a largescale agent-based simulation applied to the city of Munich. We compare the case in which all trip requests must be served with the case in which request rejections are allowed, based on waiting and travel times. Different demand levels and alternative scenarios for vehicle automation are analyzed. The results indicate that the performance of door-to-door on-demand shared systems depends on the operational scheme selected. For the DRT setup and vehicle assignment strategy studied, we find that if the system is forced to have no trip rejections, economies of scale are not present, and the high user costs hinder the system's competitiveness even under the assumption of automated vehicles. In contrast, in a system that allows for trip rejections, economies of scale are present, and vehicle automation can especially reduce operator costs, increasing the system's competitiveness against other transportation modes. Therefore, in our setting, the efficiency of the demand-responsive service depends on the ability to reject customers, which is against the spirit of a truly public transportation service. On scenario analysis, we show that a theoretical improvement in the performance of the real-time vehicle assignment strategy can significantly reduce total cost, with economies of scale under no-rejection operation. Future research needs to address whether the actual application of more complex vehicle assignment strategies can indeed make DRT systems more cost competitive while serving all trip requests.

AB Automated Vehicles aim to increase road safety as automated driving systems (ADS) take over the human driving task in the operational design domain (ODD), introducing severe challenges for safety validation. Pure driving over many kilometers to gather enough evidence for a safety argument is not feasible. Scenario-based testing is an approach to overcome this, but challenges like parameter discretization still prevail, hindering safety assurance. This work proposes contributions towards a traceable and efficient safety argumentation for ADS built upon ODD coverage. First, ODD coverage is thoroughly quantified across all scenario levels, assuming distribution functions' availability for the scenario parameters. Secondly, a sampling method for n-dimensional scenario parameter distributions is proposed. The provided algorithms adapt an initial k-means clustering using pre-defined boundary conditions requiring significantly fewer scenarios. Furthermore, a risk metric for urban intersections is presented for scenario evaluation. The risk metric consists of two parts, scene prediction of traffic participants (TPs) and risk assessment. The scene prediction uses a manoeuvre-based motion model with a data-driven approach towards trajectory prediction, increasing the validity. For the risk assessment, a probabilistic risk prediction for the TPs is performed for each scenario scene. The risk metric shows a reasonable tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity, outperforming time-to-collision. These contributions are exemplarily applied at an intersection using a simplified setup for generating TPs and ego vehicle trajectories. The results indicate that an increased safety argumentation is enabled using the proposed methods alongside a coverage process, facilitating further research.

AB The quality of Third-Party Logistics (3PL) services represented by delivery time decides the outcome of customer satisfaction. The result of this satisfaction judges the type of Word of Mouth (WoM) that, if positive, plays a vital role in attracting non-customers who are willing in 3PL services to join as customers.In this paper, we investigate the effect of an essential factor represented by Word of Mouth on the number of customers in 3PL companies. Therefore, an agent-based model for parcel delivery is developed to investigate the impact of social factors such as WoM and other operational factors, including vehicle number and speed, on customer number and satisfaction, average service time, and vehicle utilization.As a methodology, state charts of Vehicle, Customer, Hub agents are developed to mimic the messaging protocols between these agents under the WoM concept. A case study based in 3PL in Jordan is used as a test bench of the developed model. A sensitivity analysis study is conducted to test the developed model's performance, including different levels of influential model parameters such as targeting non-customers parameters by Loyal/ Unhappy customers.Key results reveal that the best scenario is achieved when the WoM value equals 10, the vehicle number equals 30, and the vehicle speed equals 60 km/h. These model parameters result in higher customer numbers of 873, vehicle utilization equals 63%, and customer satisfaction equals 99%.

AB Gap acceptance is one of the crucial components of lane-changing analysis and an important parameter in microsimulation modeling. Drivers' poor gap judgment, and failure to accept a necessary safety gap, make it one of the major causes of lane-changing crashes on roadways. Several studies have been conducted to investigate lane-changing gap acceptance behavior; however, very few studies examined the behavior in complex real-world situations, such as in naturalistic settings. This study examined lane-changing gap acceptance behavior from the big Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) datasets using a nonparametric multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) approach to better understand the complex effects of different factors in gap acceptance behavior. The study developed a unique methodology to identify lane-changing events of the non-NDS-vehicles using the front-mounted radar data from NDS vehicles and extract necessary parameters for analyzing gap acceptance behavior. In addition, surrogate measures of safety, that is, time-to-collision (TTC), was utilized to understand the impact of lane-changing on the NDS following vehicle safety. Moreover, different distributions of gap acceptance were fitted to identify the trend of gap acceptance behavior. The results from the MARS model revealed that different factors including relative speed between lane-changing vehicle (LCV) and lead vehicle (LV)/following vehicle (FV), traffic conditions, acceleration of LCV and FV, and roadway geometric characteristics have significant effects on gap acceptance behavior. The results of this study have significant implications, which could be used in microsimulation model calibration and safety improvements in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV).

AB Global primary energy supply mainly comes from fossil fuels that are limited in supply and have negative impacts on the environment. A large number of conventional vehicles, present on the streets, mainly consume fossil fuels and emit greenhouse gases. The popularity of electric vehicles is increasing rapidly due to various social and economic factors as well as significant environmental impacts. Governments across the world are shifting their sentiments towards electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce these negative effects. Due to this support from governments and public awareness, EVs are increasing rapidly and bringing new types of problems to the existing power system. The rapid increase in charging high-power electric vehicles (EVs) poses challenges to the power system, including load profile distortion, voltage deviation, frequency imbalance, harmonic injection, distribution system component capacity overloading, excess power loss, and grid instability. This study quantitatively analyzes the impact of EV charging on the power system. With an increase in EV penetration from 25% to 50%, the peak power demand on the system rises by 166%. However, implementing a smart charging system optimizes system parameters, leading to reduced power loss, decreased voltage deviation, and a remarkable 96% decrease in the grid's peak power demand compared to conventional uncoordinated charging. Smart charging not only solves existing problems but also facilitates the integration of next-generation technologies like autonomous vehicles, connected mobility, and the energy internet. This research highlights the significant benefits of smart charging in addressing the challenges posed by the rapid growth of EVs while promoting sustainability and technological advancement in the power system.

AB There is an increasing trend in the use of wireless communication along with new traffic signal control (TSC) algorithms to leverage and accommodate connected and autonomous vehicles. However, this development has increased the potential for cyber-attacks on TSC that can undermine the benefits of these new algorithms. An advanced persistent adversary can learn the behavior of TSC algorithms and launch attacks to preferentially get green time and/or to create traffic congestion in one intersection which can spread to the entire network. In this paper, we consider backpressure-based (BP-based) TSC algorithms and compare their performance under two misinformation attacks 1) time spoofing attack in which vehicles alter their arrival times at the intersection and 2) ghost vehicle attack in which vehicles disconnect the wireless communication and thereby hide from the TSC. We show that these misinformation can influence the signal phases determined by BP-based TSC algorithms. We consider an adversary that determines a set of arriving vehicles to be attack vehicles from many candidate sets (attack strategies) in order to maximize the number of disrupted signal phases. We show that by formulating the problem as a 0/1 Knapsack problem, the adversary can explore the space of attack strategies and determine the optimal strategy that maximally compromises the performance in terms of average delay and fairness. We propose two protection algorithms, namely, auction-based (APA) and hybrid-based (HPA) algorithms and show that they are able to mitigate the impacts of the misinformation attacks.

AB In this paper, we propose a human-robot interaction (HRI) framework to reduce the vulnerability of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) platoon under cyber attacks. An observer-based autonomous resilient control strategy is first designed to mitigate the effects of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cyber attacks. Rigorous proof of the safety conditions of the platoon under V2V cyber attacks is derived. Next, to facilitate human supervision in emergencies and uncertainties, a decision-making aid system is developed, which consists of an anomaly reporting system (ARS), a trust-based information management system (TIMS), and a graphical user interface (GUI). ARS is designed to detect the abnormality of the neighbor UGVs based on the model-based residual generation and analysis. TIMS is developed to rule out information with low trustworthiness, which is fulfilled by a Bayesian-based information pre-processor followed by an enhanced median filter with trustworthiness regulation. It is rigorously proved that TIMS can recover the tempered information under the mild cyber attack scenario autonomously. To deal with unexpected severe vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) cyber attacks, human observations can also be leveraged to bolster the resilience of the TIMS. Representative simulation and humans-in-the-loop experiment (fulfilled by the designed GUI) demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively guide human operators when working with UGV platoons under cyber attacks. On average, compared to a multi-screen surveillance benchmark approach, the proposed framework can achieve 78.4% decrements of platoon vulnerability and 39.0% decrements in human workload.

AB We present an alternative approach to the forecasting of motor vehicle collision rates. We adopt an oft-used tool in mathematical finance, the Heston Stochastic Volatility model, to forecast the short-term and long-term evolution of motor vehicle collision rates. We incorporate a number of extensions to the Heston model to make it fit for modelling motor vehicle collision rates. We incorporate the temporally-unstable and non-deterministic nature of collision rate fluctuations, and introduce a parameter to account for periods of accelerated safety. We also adjust estimates to account for the seasonality of collision patterns. Using these parameters, we perform a shortterm forecast of collision rates and explore a number of plausible scenarios using long-term forecasts. The shortterm forecast shows a close affinity with realised rates (over 95% accuracy), and outperforms forecasting models currently used in road safety research (Vasicek, SARIMA, SARIMA-GARCH). The long-term scenarios suggest that modest targets to reduce collision rates (1.83% annually) and targets to reduce the fluctuations of month-to month collision rates (by half) could have significant benefits for road safety. The median forecast in this scenario suggests a 50% fall in collision rates, with 75% of simulations suggesting that an effective change in collision rates is observed before 2044. The main benefit the model provides is eschewing the necessity for setting unreasonable safety targets that are often missed. Instead, the model presents the effects that modest and achievable targets can have on road safety over the long run, while incorporating random variability. Examining the parameters that underlie expected collision rates will aid policymakers in determining the effectiveness of implemented policies.

AB We have developed a visually based autopilot which is able to make an air vehicle automatically take off, cruise and land, while reacting appropriately to wind disturbances (head wind and tail wind). This autopilot consists of a visual control system that adjusts the thrust so as to keep the downward optic flow (OF) at a constant value. This autopilot is therefore based on an optic flow regulation loop. It makes use of a sensor, which is known as an elementary motion detector (EMD). The functional structure of this EMD was inspired by that of the housefly, which was previously investigated at our Laboratory by performing electrophysiological recordings while applying optical microstimuli to single photoreceptor cells of the insect's compound eye.
   We built a proof-of-concept, tethered rotorcraft that circles indoors over an environment composed of contrasting features randomly arranged on the floor. The autopilot, which we have called OCTAVE (Optic flow based Control sysTem for Aerial VEhicles), enables this miniature (100 g) rotorcraft to carry out complex tasks such as ground avoidance and terrain following, to control risky maneuvers such as automatic take off and automatic landing, and to respond appropriately to wind disturbances. A single visuomotor control loop suffices to perform all these reputedly demanding tasks. As the electronic processing system required is extremely light-weight (only a few grams), it can be mounted on-board micro-air vehicles (MAVs) as well as larger unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) or even submarines and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). But the OCTAVE autopilot could also provide guidance and/or warning signals to prevent the pilots of manned aircraft from colliding with shallow terrain, for example.

AB Criticality metrics are not only essential for collision avoidance systems but also play a vital role for verification and validation of automated vehicles. With respect to the first application, criticality metrics should be real-time capable and applicable in various traffic situations. For the second application, holistic safety evaluation by criticality metrics is desired. However, existing criticality metrics hardly meet these two requirements. They are either only applicable in post-processing or only assess the safety of maneuvers in longitudinal direction. Therefore, we propose a new acceleration-based criticality metric, which is real-time capable and applicable in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The theory of the proposed criticality metric is introduced and the definition is explained according to different scenarios. A simulation platform is established to validate the criticality metric. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed criticality metric takes all possible maneuvers into account when meeting a critical situation. Apart from the longitudinal behavior, the lateral behavior of automated vehicles can also be evaluated in real-time. Consequently, it has a wider application scope than other criticality metrics. To demonstrate its contribution to verification and validation of automated vehicles, we apply the criticality metric to a naturalistic driving dataset. The results prove that our criticality metric has a higher precision and recall than Time to Collision. Additionally, it combines the abilities of Time to Collision and Time Head Way to assess the safety of automated vehicles in the longitudinal direction. The proposed criticality metric is real-time capable and is suitable for different situations.

AB With the development of automated driving technology and communication technology, the emergence of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) will significantly improve traffic efficiency and safety. To study the influence of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) on mixed traffic flow, this study proposes a cellular automata (CA) model of mixed traffic flow considering the driving behavior of the platoon of CAVs. Firstly, three car-following modes, Human-driven vehicle (HDV), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), in mixed traffic flow are analyzed. Secondly, on the bias of the safety distance model and platoon behavior analysis, the acceleration, deceleration, and randomization rules of the cellular automata model of mixed traffic flow are developed. The time step is introduced into the model in the rule design, and the reaction time of the vehicle is considered in the randomization rule. Finally, a numerical simulation is conducted to analyze the fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow, traffic congestion, and speed volatility under different penetration rates of CAVs. The result shows that (1) the road capacity under the pure CAV environment has increased by 3.24 times compared with the pure HDVs; (2) the maximum congestion reduction percentage can reach 63.36%; and (3) when the penetration rate reaches 80%, the velocity fluctuation decreases significantly. Sensitivity analysis shows that when the penetration rate of CAVs is 100%, the maximum platoon size increase can improve the road capacity. Furthermore, the maximum platoon size has an optimal value in a specific density range. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging technology and has been introduced into intelligent driving and transportation systems to digitize and synergize connected automated vehicles. However, existing studies focus on the design of the automated vehicle, whereas the digitization of the human driver, who plays an important role in driving, is largely ignored. Furthermore, previous driver-related tasks are limited to specific scenarios and have limited applicability. Thus, a novel concept of a driver digital twin (DDT) is proposed in this study to bridge the gap between existing automated driving systems and fully digitized ones and aid in the development of a complete driving human cyber-physical system (H-CPS). This concept is essential for constructing a harmonious human-centric intelligent driving system that considers the proactivity and sensitivity of the human driver. The primary characteristics of the DDT include multimodal state fusion, personalized modeling, and time variance. Compared with the original DT, the proposed DDT emphasizes on internal personality and capability with respect to the external physiological-level state. This study systematically illustrates the DDT and outlines its key enabling aspects. The related technologies are comprehensively reviewed and discussed with a view to improving them by leveraging the DDT. In addition, the potential applications and unsettled challenges are considered. This study aims to provide fundamental theoretical support to researchers in determining the future scope of the DDT system

AB Today, up to hundreds of RGB and W-LEDs are positioned in a vehicle's interior context and are able to be individually controlled in intensity, color and sequence. However, which kind of illumination distracts or supports car occupants and how to define such a modern illumination system is still under discussion and unknown. For that, first a definition for an in-vehicle lighting system is introduced. Second, a globally distributed study was performed based on a free-access online survey to investigate in-vehicle lighting for visual signaling within 10 colors, eight positions and six dynamic patterns. In total, 238 participants from China and Europe rated color preferences, color moods, light-position preferences, differences between manual and autonomous driving and also different meanings for dynamic lighting patterns. Out of these, three strong significant (p < 0.05) color preference groups were identified with a polarized, accepted or merged character. For the important driving-signaling mood attention, we found a significant hue dependency for Europeans which was missing within the Chinese participants. In addition, we identified that light positioned at the door and foot area was globally favored. Furthermore, we evaluated qualitative results: men are primarily focusing on fast-forward, whereas women paid more attention on practical light usage. These findings conclude the need for a higher lighting-car-occupant adaptation in the future grounded by deeper in-vehicle human factors research to achieve a higher satisfaction level. In interdisciplinary terms, our findings might also be helpful for interior building or general modern cockpit designs for trains or airplanes.

AB The present paper discusses two fuzzy Surrogate Safety Metrics (SSMs) for rear-end collision, the Proactive Fuzzy SSM (PFS) and Critical Fuzzy SSM (CFS). The objective is to investigate their applicability for evaluating the real-time rear-end risk of collision of vehicles to support the operations of advanced driver assistance and automated vehicle functionalities (from driving assistance systems to fully automated vehicles). The proposed Fuzzy SSMs are evaluated and compared to other traditional metrics on the basis of empirical observations. To achieve this goal, an experimental campaign was organized in the AstaZero proving ground in Sweden. The campaign consisted of two main parts: a car-following experiment with five vehicles solely driven by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems and a safety critical experiment, testing the response of the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system to avoid collisions on a static target. The proposed PFS is compared with the safe distance defined by the well-known Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) model, showing that it can produce meaningful results in assessing safety conditions also without the use of crisp safety thresholds (like in the case of RSS). The CFS outperformed the well-known Time-To-Collision (TTC) SSM in the a-priori identification of the cases, where the tested vehicles were not able to avoid the collision with the static target. Moreover, results show that CFS at the time of the first deceleration is correlated with the velocity of the vehicle at the time of collisions with the target.

AB Nowadays, the increasing availability of commercial off-the-shelf underwater acoustic and non-acoustic (e.g., optical and electromagnetic) modems that can be employed for both short-range broadband and long-range low-rate communication, the increasing level of autonomy of underwater vehicles, and the refinement of their underwater navigation systems pave the way for several new applications, such as data muling from underwater sensor networks and the transmission of real-time video streams underwater. In addition, these new developments inspired many companies to start designing hybrid wireless-driven underwater vehicles specifically tailored for off-shore operations and that are able to behave either as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), depending on both the type of mission they are required to perform and the limitations imposed by underwater communication channels. In this paper, we evaluate the actual quality of service (QoS) achievable with an underwater wireless-piloted vehicle, addressing the realistic aspects found in the underwater domain, first reviewing the current state-of-the-art of communication technologies and then proposing the list of application streams needed for control of the underwater vehicle, grouping them in different working modes according to the level of autonomy required by the off-shore mission. The proposed system is finally evaluated by employing the DESERT Underwater simulation framework by specifically analyzing the QoS that can be provided to each application stream when using a multimodal underwater communication system specifically designed to support different traffic-based QoSs. Both the analysis and the results show that changes in the underwater environment have a strong impact on the range and on the stability of the communication link.

AB The stability of traffic flow reflects the ability to resist traffic perturbation and reveals the formation mechanism of congestion in a non-bottleneck link. To study the stability of mixed traffic flow in the non-fully connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) environment, this paper takes time delay, platooning intensity and CAVs degradations into consideration. Firstly, the vehicle types in the mixed traffic flow are analyzed considering degraded CAVs. Then time delays of different types of vehicles are discussed. The proportion of each type of vehicle under the influence of platooning intensity is determined. Based on this, the linear internal stability condition of mixed traffic flow is derived by using the characteristic equation-based method. The stability condition is related to CAVs degradations, time delay, and platooning intensity. In addition, the influence of CAV penetration rates, platooning intensity, and time delay on traffic stability are analyzed. Finally, the simulation experiments are carried out to verify theoretical results. The results show that: (1) CAV penetration rates and platooning intensity are conducive to maintaining the stability of the mixed traffic flow; (2) CAVs degradations and time delay have a negative effect on stability; (3) when the penetration rate of CAVs is more significant than 90.4%, the traffic flow is stable in the entire speed range. To a certain extent, these conclusions can enrich and expand the existing research results on the stability of the mixed traffic flow. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Smart vehicles are equipped with onboard computing units designed to run in-vehicle applications. However, due to limited computing power, the onboard units are unable to execute compute-intensive tasks and those that require near real-time processing. Therefore tasks are offloaded to nearby fog/edge devices that have more powerful processors. However, the fog devices are static, placed at fixed locations such as intersections, and have a limited communication range. Therefore, they can only facilitate vehicles in their immediate vicinity and only limited areas of the city can be covered to provide services on demand. In this article, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based computing framework design termed Skywalker to provide computing in regions where there are no static fog units thereby extending coverage. Skywalker's contributions are threefold: 1) it allows for load-aware UAV placement and provisions a swarm of UAVs to fly to areas experiencing a gap in service where the size of the swarm is proportional to the demand; 2) it implements multiple scheduling algorithms that the UAVs swarm employs to divide up the task processing responsibility for individual UAVs within the swarm; and 3) a zone-based delivery mechanism is being proposed to facilitate the return of completed tasks, either through direct delivery or relay-based methods. The choice between these options depends on the distance covered by the requesting vehicle from the UAV swarm. The efficiency of the framework is compared with existing techniques and it is found that it can greatly extend coverage during peak traffic hours while providing low communication delay and consuming minimum energy.

AB Automated vehicles used as public transport show a great promise of revolutionizing current transportation systems. Still, there are many questions as to how these systems should be organized and operated in cities to bring the best out of future services. In this study, an agent-based model (ABM) is developed to simulate the on-demand operations of shared automated vehicles (SAVs) in a parallel transit service (PTS) and a tailored time-varying transit service (TVTS). The proposed TVTS system can switch service schemes between a door-to-door service (DDS) and a station-to-station service (SSS) according to what is best for the service providers and the travelers. In addition, the proposed PTS system that allows DDS and SSS to operate simultaneously is simulated. To test the conceptual design of the proposed SAV system, simulation experiments are performed in a hypothetical urban area to show the potential of different SAV schemes. Simulation results suggest that SAV systems together with dynamic ridesharing can significantly reduce average waiting time, the vehicle kilometres travelled and empty SAV trips. Moreover, the proposed optimal vehicle assignment algorithm can significantly reduce the empty vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) for the pickups for all tested SAV systems up to about 40% and improve the system capacity for transporting the passengers. Comparing the TVTS system, which has inconvenient access in peak hours, with the PTS systems, which always makes available door-to-door transport, we conclude that the latter could achieve a similar system performance as the former in terms of average waiting time, service time and system capacity.

AB Autonomous driving in an urban environment with surrounding agents remains challenging. One of the key challenges is to accurately predict the traversability map that probabilistically represents future trajectories considering multiple contexts: inertial, environmental, and social. To address this, various approaches have been proposed; however, they mainly focus on considering the individual context. In addition, most studies utilize expensive prior information (such as HD maps) of the driving environment, which is not a scalable approach. In this study, we extend a deep inverse reinforcement learning-based approach that can predict the traversability map while incorporating multiple contexts for autonomous driving in a dynamic environment. Instead of using expensive prior information of the driving scene, we propose a novel deep neural network to extract contextual cues from sensing data and effectively incorporate them in the output, i.e., the reward map. Based on the reward map, our method predicts the ego-centric traversability map that represents the probability distribution of the plausible and socially acceptable future trajectories. The proposed method is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated in real-world traffic scenarios with various baselines. The experimental results show that our method improves the prediction accuracy compared to other baseline methods and can predict future trajectories similar to those followed by a human driver.

AB With the development of autonomous unmanned intelligent systems, such as the unmanned boats, unmanned planes and autonomous underwater vehicles, studies on Wireless Sensor-Actor Networks (WSANs) have attracted more attention. Network connectivity algorithms play an important role in data exchange, collaborative detection and information fusion. Due to the harsh application environment, abnormal nodes often appear, and the network connectivity will be prone to be lost. Network self-healing mechanisms have become critical for these systems. In order to decrease the movement overhead of the sensor-actor nodes, an autonomous connectivity restoration algorithm based on finite state machine is proposed. The idea is to identify whether a node is a critical node by using a finite state machine, and update the connected dominating set in a timely way. If an abnormal node is a critical node, the nearest non-critical node will be relocated to replace the abnormal node. In the case of multiple node abnormality, a regional network restoration algorithm is introduced. It is designed to reduce the overhead of node movements while restoration happens. Simulation results indicate the proposed algorithm has better performance on the total moving distance and the number of total relocated nodes compared with some other representative restoration algorithms.

AB The aerobiology of fungi in the genus Fusarium is poorly understood. Many species of Fusarium are important pathogens of plants and animals and some produce dangerous secondary metabolites known as mycotoxins. In 2006 and 2007, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used to collect Fusarium 40-320 m above the ground at the Kentland Farm in Blacksburg, Virginia. Eleven single-spored isolates of Fusarium graminearum (sexual stage Gibberella zeae) collected with autonomous UAVs during fall, winter, spring, and summer months caused Fusarium head blight on a susceptible cultivar of spring wheat. Trichothecene genotypes were determined for all 11 of the isolates; nine isolates were DON/15ADON, one isolate was DON/3ADON, and one isolate was NIV. All of the isolates produced trichothecene mycotoxins in planta consistent with their trichothecene genotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a NIV isolate of F. graminearum in Virginia, and DON/3ADON genotypes are rare in populations of the fungus recovered from infected wheat plants in the eastern United States. Our data are considered in the context of a new aerobiological framework based on atmospheric transport barriers, which are Lagrangian coherent structures present in the mesoscale atmospheric flow. This framework aims to improve our understanding of population shifts of F. graminearum and develop new paradigms that may link field and atmospheric populations of toxigenic Fusarium spp. in the future.

AB The advent of transportation network companies (TNCs), also known as commercial ridesharing providers, has disrupted transportation systems leading to new facility designs. Dedicated pickup/dropoff areas can facilitate the future shift to autonomous vehicles. In this study, angled stalls and parallel curbside parking, along with signage and education, were investigated using pedestrian and wheelchair simulators. Human behavior was examined with regard to safety, efficiency, and accessibility. Microsimulation and Surrogate Safety Assessment Model were used to examine the effect of increased demand on design capacity and number of conflicts. In simulations, both stall and curbside designs performed comparably in crosswalk usage, but the stall design was safer when passengers waited longer for vehicle arrival. It is preferable to wait to approach the loading area until the TNC vehicle arrives. Stall design was more accessible but curbside design had greater efficiency because of shorter vehicle waiting time (-7.31 s [p < 0.01]). Signage and education were found to be effective in increasing sidewalk usage, decreasing deviations from the crosswalk, and reducing vehicle waiting time. Post-simulator surveys showed similar ratings for safety (80.65%), with stall design scoring higher in accessibility (90% versus 52%) and curbside design slightly higher in efficiency (77% versus 68%). Participants reported almost equal preference for stall or curbside designs (48% versus 52%), and over 90% found the signage and education effective. Microsimulation indicated that stall design had higher capacity (500 vehicles per hour) than curbside design (350 vehicles per hour) within 180 linear feet, and fewer overall conflicts at 300 loadings.

AB At an intersection with complex traffic flow, the early detection of the intention of drivers in surrounding vehicles can enable advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to warn the driver in advance or prompt its subsystems to assess the risk and intervene early. Although different drivers show various driving characteristics, the kinematic parameters of human-driven vehicles can be used as a predictor for predicting the driver's intention within a short time. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach for vehicle behavior recognition at intersections based on time series prediction and deep learning networks. First, the lateral position, longitudinal position, speed, and acceleration of the vehicle are predicted using the online autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm. Next, a variant of the long short-term memory network, called the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network, is used to detect the vehicle's turning behavior using the predicted parameters, as well as the derived parameters, i.e., the lateral velocity, lateral acceleration, and heading angle. The validity of the proposed method is verified at real intersections using the public driving data of the next generation simulation (NGSIM) project. The results of the turning behavior detection show that the proposed hybrid approach exhibits significant improvement over a conventional algorithm; the average recognition rates are 94.2% and 93.5% at 2 s and 1 s, respectively, before initiating the turning maneuver.

AB Traction electricity (TE) consumption in rail transportation (rail transport) is determined by factors (determinant) related to the characteristics of railway lines and vehicles. They have an impact on driving speeds, which, in turn, affect energy consumption. The scientific research presented here combined the results of expert, direct and indirect measurement methods, including brainstorming, mind mapping, system approach, heuristics, failure mode and effect analysis. The main objective was to demonstrate the influence of the determinants of TE consumption, depending on the route (road) geometry and characteristics of the traction of electric vehicles and whole trains (catenary-supplied electric vehicles, non-autonomous electric vehicles, and network traction vehicles, especially electric locomotives and electric multiple units, electric multiple-units (EMUs)). Using a new approach, the TE consumption equation, we applied values for the movement resistances of electric locomotives during braking for a jointed railway track M-res JRT braking and continuous welded rail tracks M-res CWRt braking. The values of the movement resistances of the electric locomotives during startup on the jointed railway track M-res JRT startup and continuous welded rail tracks M-res CWRt startup were also applied. They showed a strong correlation with the existing speeds of catenary-supplied electric vehicles. The implementation of the new innovative approach is an important contribution to the development of engineering and technical sciences, in particular, the disciplines of civil engineering, surveying/geodesy, and transport.

AB A large autonomous undersea vehicle (AUV), the Seahorse, has been designed, constructed, and tested by the Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University (ARL/PSU, University Park, PA) for the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO, Stennis Space Center, MS). The vehicle is required to launch in shallow water-(< 10 m) and to hover without propulsion. Additionally, due to the very large size of the vehicle, low operating speeds and very long missions, small changes in vehicle trim resulting from battery replacement, sensor exchanges, and water temperature variations can result in significant drag-induced energy penalties over the duration of a mission. It is, therefore, important to continually maintain the AUV in fore-aft trim over the course of the mission. The vehicle is equipped with a two tank variable buoyancy system (VBS) to meet these requirements. The resulting control problem is one where the control variable, pump rate, is proportional to the third derivative of the sensed variable, depth; there are significant delays, and forces are nonlinear (including discontinuous) and highly uncertain. This paper describes the design of the VBS and the control software operating in two modes: depth control mode and trim control mode. In-water test data and simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the VBS controller. The benefits of the presented approach lie in the intuitiveness and simplicity of the design and the robustness as evidenced by the performance in both fresh and salt water. This paper provides practical insight into the operation of a VBS with an AUV and discusses actual operational experience. To our knowledge, no previous work considers the significance of an observed surface capture phenomenon to the design of a VBS control system, especially in very shallow water.

AB With the development of technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are playing an increasingly important role in the inspection of high-voltage power transmission line. The traditional inspection method relies on the operator to manually control the drone for inspection. Although many companies are using real-time dynamic carrier phase differencing technology to achieve high-precision positioning of UAVs, when UAVs fly autonomously at high altitudes to photograph specific objects, the objects tend to deviate from the center of the picture. To address this error, in this article, an autonomous UAV inspection system based on object detection is designed: 1) to detect inspection objects, the corresponding dataset is established on the basis of the UAV autonomous inspection task; 2) to obtain the position information of the target object, a lightweight object detector based on the YOLOX network model is designed. First, the backbone is replaced with MobileNetv3. Next, in the neck structure, the Ghost module is introduced and depthwise convolution is applied instead of normal convolution. Then, to embed the location information into the channel attention, coordinate attention (CA) is introduced after the output feature layer of the backbone, enabling the lightweight network to operate on a larger area of focus. Finally, to improve the accuracy of the bounding box regression, the ${\alpha }$ -distance-IoU (DIOU) loss function is introduced; 3) to obtain the best image acquisition position, the results of object detection combined with the real-time status of the UAV are used; and 4) to enable the UAV to complete the final corrections, position control and altitude control are used. Compared with the original YOLOX_tiny, the new model improves the mAP_0.5:0.95 metric by about 2% points, with a significant reduction in the number of parameters and computation, while running at 56 frames/s on Nvidia NX. This system can effectively solve the problem of the target deviating from the center of the picture when the UAV takes pictures during a high-altitude autonomous inspection, verified by many actual flight experiments.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; SYSTEM; TIME; COMMUNICATION; DEPLOYMENT
AB The safety, mobility, environmental, energy, and economic benefits of transportation systems, which are the focus of recent connected vehicle (CV) programs, are potentially dramatic. However, realization of these benefits largely hinges on the timely integration of digital technology into upcoming as well as existing transportation infrastructure. CVs must be enabled to broadcast and receive data to and from other CVs [vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication], to and from infrastructure [vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication], and to and from other road users, such as bicyclists or pedestrians (vehicle-to-other road users communication). Further, the infrastructure and transportation agencies that manage V2I-focused applications must be able to collect, process, distribute, and archive these data quickly, reliably, and securely. This paper focuses on V2I applications and investigates current digital roadway infrastructure initiatives. It highlights the importance of including digital infrastructure investment alongside investment in more traditional transportation infrastructure to keep up with the auto industry's push toward increasing intervehicular communication. By studying current CV testbeds and smart-city initiatives, this paper identifies digital infrastructure components (i.e., communication options and computing infrastructure) being used by public agencies. It also examines public agencies' limited budgeting for digital infrastructure and finds that current expenditure is inadequate for realizing the potential benefits of V2I applications. Finally, the paper presents a set of recommendations, based on a review of current practices and future needs, designed to guide agencies responsible for transportation infrastructure. It stresses the importance of collaboration for establishing national and international platforms for the planning, deployment, and management of digital infrastructure to support connected transportation systems across political jurisdictions.

AB Today, communication technologies enable smart cities to become more effective in terms of satisfactory provision of services. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can be considered key elements for today's Intelligent Transportation Systems. A small number of research investigations is found to aim at exploiting the resources of CAVs for services provisioning within a smart city. Moreover, and to the best of our knowledge, no research investigations have yet investigated exploiting the computational capabilities of CAVs to become an added value to the computational power of smart cities. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Vehicle as a Computational Resource (VaCR) and develop a system that enables vehicles to share their computational resources within smart cities. Users rely on Service Provider (SP) to acquire the required services that meet their Quality of Experience (QoE) preferences. The device capabilities of VaCR are one of the main indicators in QoE preferences. To that end, evaluation models are developed based on aggregate statistics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the discovery and selection of the appropriate VaCRs to participate in the provisioning of services. The deployment is modeled using a multiagent system. Then, game theory is used to model the recruitment that aims at optimizing QoE for Connected Vehicles (CVs). Thorough simulations, analyses, and evaluations of the proposed VaCR system are carried out. The performed validations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in optimizing QoE and the successful VaCR system operation, while attaining appealing performance characteristics.

AB This paper i) compares parametric and semi-parametric representations of unobserved heterogeneity in hierarchical Bayesian logit models and ii) applies these methods to infer distributions of willingness to pay for features of shared automated vehicle (SAV) services. Specifically, we compare the multivariate normal, the finite mixture of normals and the Dirichlet process mixture of normals (DP-MON) mixing distributions. The latter promises to be particularly flexible regarding the shapes it can assume, and unlike other semi-parametric approaches does not require that its complexity is fixed before estimation. We evaluate the different mixing distributions, using simulated data and real data from a stated choice study on preferences for SAVs in New York City. In the considered data settings, the DP-MON mixing distribution provides an excellent data fit and performs at least as well as the other methods at out-of-sample prediction. The DP-MON mixing distribution also offers substantive behavioural insights into the adoption of SAVs. We find that preferences for in-vehicle travel time by SAV with ride-pooling are strongly polarised. Whereas one-third of the sample is willing to pay between 10 and 80 USD/h to avoid pooling a vehicle with strangers, the remainder of the sample is either indifferent to ride-pooling or even desires it. We also estimate that vehicle automation and powertrain electrification are relatively unimportant to travellers. Consequently, travellers may primarily derive indirect, rather than immediate benefits from these new technologies through increases in operational efficiency and lower operating costs.

AB Vehicular communications is an important enabler for enhancing the safety on roads by supporting mutual awareness of vehicles as well as for improving the efficiency of transportation through smart traffic management by intelligent transport systems (ITSs). Governments around the world have set ambitious goals for road fatality reduction in the near future; e. g., the European Union targets a 50% reduction of road fatalities by 2020 as compared to the year 2010. -Furthermore, traffic telematic systems aim to minimize the environmental impact of transportation and maximize the utilization of available road infrastructure by adaptive traffic management. To realize these challenging targets, autonomous wireless information exchange among vehicles--vehicle to vehicle (V2V)-and with roadside infrastructure-vehicle to infrastructure (V2I)-are central ingredients. In addition to traffic efficiency and safetyrelated issues, vehicular communications is increasingly recognized as an important revenue driver by car manufacturing companies since it enables wirelessly connected in-vehicle entertainment systems that support on-demand video streaming and online Internet access for passengers. Also, in the future, machine-type communication is expected to play a major role in vehicular environments, with more sensors that monitor the internal state of vehicles and autonomously exchange service and maintenance information with cloud servers of manufacturers. Depending on the considered use-case, distinct quality of service (QoS) requirements come into play [1]: infotainment applications for in-car users require high bandwidth and network capacity, active road safety relies on delay-and outage-critical data transmission, whereas information exchange for road traffic efficiency management typically comes without strict QoS requirements and exhibits graceful degradation of performance with increasing latency.

AB The main aim of this work is to investigate the effect of the biomimetic spine-covered protrusions structure (BSCPs) inspired by pufferfish spines on the small autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) hull drag. The BSCPs with eight different heights (0.3-1 mm, 0.1 mm interval) and two arrangements (average and staggered arrays) are applied to a bare submarine hull (SUBOFF) at zero angle of pitch and yaw, and a plain hull is introduced for comparison. CFD-RANS method is used to simulate flow over the hull at a Reynolds number of 1.4 x 10(6). The drag results show that the staggered arrays have the optimal drag reduction performance, with a maximum drag reduction of 9.47% for the BSCPs height of 0.3 mm. Although the hull pressure drag with BSCPs increases, the reduction in viscous drag is superior. Skin-friction coefficient reflects significantly lower BSCPs hull shear stress than plain hull. The reverse vortex prevents the ejection of low-velocity fluids and impedes sweeping of high-velocity fluids, effectively reducing the generation of Reynolds stresses near the wall. The combined reduction in shear and Reynolds stress leads to viscous drag decrease. The boundary layer developing downstream of the small-scale BSCPs has the more strong anti-separation ability. Furthermore, the BSCPs inhibit the vorticity motion, thereby hinders turbulent outbursts and reduces turbulence intensity. Future activities may involve the application of optimized BSCPs structure parameters on different AUVs hulls.

AB The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has asserted that risks in deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within disaster response must be reduced by careful development of best-practice standards before implementing such systems. With recent humanitarian field tests of cargo UAVs as indication that implementation may soon become reality, a priori assessment of a smart-navigated (autonomous) UAV disaster cargo fleet via simulation modeling and analysis is vital to the best-practice development process. Logistical problems with ground transport of relief supplies in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria (2017) pose a compelling use scenario for UAV disaster cargo delivery. In this context, we introduce a General Purpose Assessment Model (GPAM) that can estimate the potential effectiveness of a cargo UAV fleet for any given response region. We evaluate this model using the following standards: (i) realistic specifications; (ii) stable output for various realistic specifications; and (iii) support of humanitarian goals. To this end, we discuss data from humanitarian cargo delivery field tests and feedback from practitioners, perform sensitivity analyses, and demonstrate the advantage of using humanitarian rather than geographic distance in making fleet delivery assignments. We conclude with several major challenges faced by those who wish to implement smart-navigated UAV cargo fleets in disaster response, and the need for further GPAM development. This paper proposes the GPAM as a useful simulation tool to encourage and guide steps toward humanitarian use of UAVs for cargo delivery. The model's flexibility can allow organizations to quickly and effectively determine how best to respond to disasters.

AB Almost every research project that focuses on the cooperation of autonomous robots for underwater operations designs their own architectures. As a result, most of these architectures are tightly coupled with the available robots/vehicles for their respective developments, and therefore the mission plan and management is done using an ad-hoc solution. Typically, this solution is tightly coupled to just one underwater autonomous vehicle (AUV), or a restricted set of them selected for the specific project. However, as the use of AUVs for underwater operations increases, there is the need to identify some commonalities and weaknesses of these architectures, specifically in relation to mission planning and management. In this paper, we review a selected number of architectures and frameworks that in one way or another make use of different approaches to mission planning and management. Most of the selected works were developed for underwater operations. Still, we have included some other architectures and frameworks from other domains that can be of interest for the survey. The explored works have been assessed using selected features related to mission planning and management, considering that underwater operations are performed in an uncertain and unreliable environment, and where unexpected events are not strange. Furthermore, we have identified and highlighted some potential challenges for the design and implementation of mission managers. This provides a reference point for the development of a mission manager component to be integrated in architectures for cooperative robotics in underwater operations, and it can serve for the same purposes in other domains of application.

AB Nowadays, the development of hydrogen economy in the transportation sector is hindered by the principal barriers arising from the lack of adequate infrastructure and the small fleet of hydrogen-based road vehicles.
   This study investigates the potential of small-scale autonomous hydrogen refuelling stations with onsite production via an alkaline electrolysis apparatus powered by a small wind turbine. In this context, an urban area with promising wind resources has been selected. Based on the wind conditions and an indicative hydrogen demand for refuelling light-duty fuel cell electric vehicles such as bicycles, the sizing of the wind turbine and the electrolyser has been theoretically calculated. For supporting the daily hydrogen refuelling demand of the fuel cell electric bicycles, which is estimated at approximately 6 kg, it is calculated that a 50 kW wind turbine should be installed in order to power a 70 kW alkaline electrolyser for producing hydrogen. The capital cost of the hydrogen station is calculated at (sic) 248,130, while the retail price of the produced hydrogen is estimated to be more than 50.2 (sic)/kg(H2) in order to achieve a positive internal rate of return.
   Ultimately, the present paper aims at delivering a feasibility study of a small-scale H-2 refuelling station for fuel cell bicycles in order to provide investors with initiatives to implement such schemes in urban environments where problems of low air quality and high traffic are intense.

AB This paper describes the results of the experimental verification of the idea of wave-like aquatic propulsion of autonomous and man-inhabited vessels first published about 10 years ago by one of the present authors (V.V.K.). The idea is based on employing the unique type of localised flexural elastic waves propagating along edges of wedge-like structures immersed in water (wedge elastic waves). Such wedge-like structures supporting localised elastic waves can be attached like fish fins to a body of a small ship or a submarine and used for their propulsion. The proposed principle of employing localised flexural waves as a source of aquatic propulsion has been biologically inspired by the specific swimming mode used in nature by stingrays. To verify the idea experimentally, the first working prototype of a small catamaran using the above-mentioned wave-like propulsion via the attached rubber keel has been build and tested in Loughborough University. The tests have been carried out in two phases, in a water tank and then in open water. The test results have shown that the catamaran was propelled very efficiently and could achieve the speed of 36 cm/s, i.e., about one vehicle length per second, thus demonstrating that the idea of wave-like propulsion of small man-inhabited craft is viable. The reported proof of the viability of this idea may open new opportunities for marine craft propulsion, which can have far reaching implications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) are likely to bring paradigm shift in the future of transportation and in the transformation of urban space as they could reduce traffic accidents, energy consumption, and pollution while also lowering congestion expenses. To provide meaningful insights, there is a substantial need for investigation into the macroscopic evaluation of various evolutions of AVs using several measures of effectiveness. The main focus of this study is to evaluate the macroscopic operational impacts of AVs in terms of their driving logics, automation levels, and roadway type, all of which are adopted based on their passenger car unit (PCU) factors at various penetration rates, in order to assess the coexistence of AVs with heterogeneous traffic. The daily vehicle hours travelled, daily vehicle kilometers travelled, sum of delays on links, speed variation, and sum of vehicle volumes on links are used as measures of effectiveness parameters based on outputs of PTV Visum scenario manager. The results of the various scenario combinations depicted an overall improvement with advancement of driving logics, automation levels, and roadway types for each studied parameter. For instance, for better roadway condition with the motorway scenario and at higher AV penetration, the cautious driving behavior negatively affects the network performance, whereas favorable improvements are observed for the parameters of the normal and aggressive driving behaviors. Decision makers could make use of the insights obtained from the results to further shape the AV deployment aspects and extend the study considering infrastructure AV-readiness along with AV communication systems.

DE autonomous UAV; intelligent agents; multi-layer architecture
AB State-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are typically able to autonomously execute a pre-planned mission. However, UAVs usually fly in a very dynamic environment which requires dynamic changes to the flight plan; this mission management activity is usually tasked to human supervision. Within this article, a software system that autonomously accomplishes the mission management task for a UAV will be proposed. The system is based on a set of theoretical concepts which allow the description of a flight plan and implemented using a combination of Soar intelligent agents and traditional control techniques. The system is capable of automatically generating and then executing an entire flight plan after being assigned a set of objectives. This article thoroughly describes all system components and then presents the results of tests that were executed using a realistic simulation environment.

DT Article
DE collision avoidance; autonomous UAVs; swarm intelligence
AB In this article, several basic swarming laws for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are developed for both two-dimensional (2D) plane and three-dimensional (3D) space. Effects of these basic laws on the group behaviour of swarms of UAVs are studied. It is shown that when cohesion rule is applied an equilibrium condition is reached in which all the UAVs settle at the same altitude on a circle of constant radius. It is also proved analytically that this equilibrium condition is stable for all values of velocity and acceleration. A decentralised autonomous decision-making approach that achieves collision avoidance without any central authority is also proposed in this article. Algorithms are developed with the help of these swarming laws for two types of collision avoidance, Group-wise and Individual, in 2D plane and 3D space. Effect of various parameters are studied on both types of collision avoidance schemes through extensive simulations.

AB This paper presents a probabilistic model of ultrasonic range sensors using backpropagation neural networks trained on experimental data. The sensor model provides the probability of detecting mapped obstacles in the environment, given their position and orientation relative to the transducer. The detection probability can be used to compute the location of an autonomous vehicle from those obstacles that are more likely to be detected. The neural network model is more accurate than other existing approaches, since it captures the typical multilobal detection pattern of ultrasonic transducers. Since the network size is kept small, implementation of the model on a mobile robot can be efficient for real-time navigation. An example that demonstrates how the credence could be incorporated into the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the numerical values of the final neural network weights are provided in the Appendixes.

SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH

DE Surf zone bathymetry
AB This study reviews the design and subsequent effectiveness of a prototype autonomous survey vehicle built to collect data specifically in the surf zone. The breaking wave transitional zone between ocean and land is an important location to survey due to its impact on human infrastructure and vulnerability to the effects of climate change. However, this environment is notoriously difficult to survey due to its shallow depth and the turbulence of waves and currents. Three distinctive design choices were made at the beginning of the project with the goal of operating in the surf zone: First, the surface vehicle is light (15 kg) and fast (up to 7 m/s), both characteristics intended to enable one person to deploy it quickly and easily into the surf zone. Second, an electric motor that is connected to a jet drive eliminates a combustion engine's air intake, which can be contaminated with seawater and sand. The jet drive also removes any danger of spinning propellers and allows the vessel to run in very shallow water. Finally, the vessel has a foam bulb hatch cover that is watertight and allows the vessel to right itself if capsized by a wave. The outcome of this development effort is an unmanned vessel that has the maneuverability and power sufficient for surf zone operations and is self-righting. It runs off the waypoint based Ardupilot Mavlink program, which allows rapid transitions from autonomous modes to remote controlled modes and has a runtime of approximately 1.5 hours. The vessel has initially been used with a single beam echosounder and precision GPS to create highly detailed shallow water bathymetric maps. This study demonstrates this technique as a highly efficient method of creating bathymetric maps in coastal environments.

TI A particle filter-based approach for tracking undersea narrow

DE Cable tracking; Underwater vision; Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)
AB The surveillance and inspection of underwater installations such as telecommunication cables are currently carried out by trained operators who, from the surface, guide a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with cameras mounted over it. This manual visual control is, however, a very tedious job that tends to fail if the operator loses concentration. This paper describes a tracking system for underwater narrow telecommunication cables, the main objective of which is to allow an autonomous underwater vehicle to video-document the whole length of a cable. The approach is based on particle filters (PFs) because of their natural ability to model multi-dimensional multi-modal PDFs, which allows handling in a more appropriate way the ambiguities that naturally arise from undersea environments. In effect, despite the special visual features that artificial objects present, which allow distinguishing them in natural scenarios such as the seabed, distracting background such as rocks or algae growing on top and nearby cables, complicate the detection and tracking and give rise to ambiguities when rocks or marine growth form shapes and textures that resemble the cable. Apart from the different models that a PF requires, the paper also describes a set of added features, which successfully compensate some large errors in the cable pose estimation when the non-enhanced tracker is applied. Extensive experimental results over a test set of more than 10,000 frames, for which a ground truth has been manually generated, have shown the usefulness of the solution proposed. Besides, results for a set of six video sequences accounting for almost 150,000 frames and around one hour and a half of successful continuous video tracking are also discussed. All those images come from inspection runs captured by ROVs navigating over real telecommunication undersea cables.

AB One of the most notable global transportation trends is the accelerated pace of development in vehicle automation technologies. Uncertainty surrounds the future of automated mobility as there is no clear consensus on potential adoption patterns, ownership versus shared use status, and travel impacts. Adding to this uncertainty is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which has triggered profound changes in mobility behaviors as well as accelerated the adoption of new technologies at an unprecedented rate. Accordingly, this study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's intention to adopt the emerging technology of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Using data from a survey disseminated in June 2020 to 700 respondents in the United States, a difference-in-difference regression is performed to analyze the shift in willingness to use AVs as part of an on-demand mobility service before and during the pandemic. The results reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive and highly significant impact on the intention to use AVs. This shift is present regardless of tech-savviness, gender, or urban/rural household location. Results indicate that individuals who are younger, politically left-leaning, and frequent users of on-demand modes of travel are expected to be more likely to use AVs once offered. Understanding the systematic segment and attribute variation determining the increase in consideration of AVs is important for policy making, as these effects provide a guide to predicting adoption of AVs-once available-and to identify segments of the population likely to be more resistant to adopting AVs.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential in delivering Internet-of-Things (IoT) services from a great height, creating an airborne domain of the IoT. In this article, we address the problem of autonomous UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments by formulating it as a Markov decision process with sparse rewards and propose an algorithm named deep reinforcement learning (RL) with nonexpert helpers (LwH). In contrast to prior RL-based methods that put huge efforts into reward shaping, we adopt the sparse reward scheme, i.e., a UAV will be rewarded if and only if it completes navigation tasks. Using the sparse reward scheme ensures that the solution is not biased toward potentially suboptimal directions. However, having no intermediate rewards hinders the agent from efficient learning since informative states are rarely encountered. To handle the challenge, we assume that a prior policy (nonexpert helper) that might be of poor performance is available to the learning agent. The prior policy plays the role of guiding the agent in exploring the state space by reshaping the behavior policy used for environmental interaction. It also assists the agent in achieving goals by setting dynamic learning objectives with increasing difficulty. To evaluate our proposed method, we construct a simulator for UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments and compare our algorithm with several baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that LwH significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms handling sparse rewards and yields impressive navigation policies comparable to those learned in the environment with dense rewards.

AB Benefiting from opportunities offered by connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a concept called Combined Alternate-Direction Lane Assignment and Reservation-based Intersection Control (CADLARIC) was proposed recently for management of directionally unrestricted traffic flows in urban environments. In CADLARIC, resolution of vehicular conflicts is distributed between links and intersections to prevent intersections from turning into traffic bottlenecks. Although CADLARIC has shown promising results, it has been observed that, once traffic volume on a certain lane reaches "physical capacity," adding more traffic on that lane degrades performance of the entire system, as each lane is exclusively dedicated to a particular movement. To overcome this problem, Combined Flexible Lane Assignment and Reservation-based Intersection Control (CFLARIC) is proposed, which offers more flexible lane assignment possibilities. While CFLARIC allows left- and right-turning lanes to be shared with through traffic, it is unclear how much through traffic should be assigned to turning lanes. Thus, this study investigates which strategy is the most beneficial when reassigning extra through traffic to the turning lanes. This goal is divided into two objectives: 1. Identify which lanes should be shared, and 2. Find a close-to-optimal amount of through traffic that should be assigned to the identified shared lane. The proposed CFLARIC strategies are compared with Fixed-Time Control (FTC), Full Reservation-based Intersection Control (FRIC), and CADLARIC for multiple demand scenarios. The results show that the best performing CFLARIC strategies outperform FTC, FRIC, and CADLARIC for delay and number of stops, and reduce the number of conflicting situations compared with FRIC and CADLARIC.

AB This paper presents an examination of the primary applications of solar energy as the main power source in the maritime sector, focusing on recent developments. A comprehensive review of the existing literature, including journal articles, proceedings, and patents, is conducted to identify three prominent areas for advancing solar energy-powered boats: maritime drones, sporting boats, and short-range touristic vessels. Maritime drones primarily serve as small autonomous boats for research, conservation, or military operations. On the other hand, sporting boats include nautical and energy design competitions involving students and enthusiasts. In terms of commercial interest, there is a growing demand for environmentally friendly and low-noise boats suitable for tourist activities, particularly in protected areas. Furthermore, specific and illustrative cases are explored in a dedicated section. Lastly, potential future perspectives are discussed and elucidated.

AB ABSTR A C T This paper presents an autonomous humanoid robot, namely, LABOR, for apple harvesting. Comprised of a binocular camera, a humanoid dual-arm operating system, and a mobile vehicle platform, the devised robot is capable of identifying, positioning, grasping, and picking up apples via its vision identification and dual-arm harvesting systems. Both the robot structure design and the functional systems, as well as their implementations are described in detail and were verified via experiments in a simulated orchard environment. Results show success rates of 82.5% and 72% for the apple recognition and harvesting functions respectively, and the average apple harvesting time was approximately 14.6 s. The wide flexibility and high scalability in the robotic structure, dual-arm coordinate control, and independent harvest planning may facilitate its application in agriculture for the harvesting of other fruits, such as tomatoes, pomegranates, and pears.

AB This paper describes an iterative decentralized planning and learning method, based on stochastic learning automata theory and heuristic search techniques, to generate construction and motion strategies to build different types of three-dimensional structures using multiple quadrotors. This architecture is proposed to simultaneously solve three main problems: 1) the iterative generation of feasible construction and motion plans for each quadrotor; 2) the optimization with constraints on power and assembly while taking into account the dynamic nature of the environment, and 3) the planning of the translational speeds and selection of breakpoints for each vehicle. The quadrotors learn the optimal action policy to construct the structures while avoiding collisions during the loading and unloading procedures. In order to demonstrate the generality of the solution, simulated trials of the proposed autonomous construction system are presented where different three-dimensional structures are built.

AB There could be no smart city without a reliable and efficient transportation system. This necessity makes the ITS a key component of any smart city concept. While legacy ITS technologies are deployed worldwide in smart cities, enabling the next generation of ITS relies on effective integration of connected and autonomous vehicles, the two technologies that are under wide field testing in many cities around the world. Even though these two emerging technologies are crucial in enabling fully automated transportation systems, there is still a significant need to automate other road and transportation components. To this end, due to their mobility, autonomous operation, and communication/processing capabilities, UAVs are envisaged in many ITS application domains. This article describes the possible ITS applications that can use UAVs, and highlights the potential and challenges for UAV-enabled ITS for next-generation smart cities.

AB This paper presents an efficient planning and execution algorithm for the navigation of an autonomous rotary wing UAV (RUAV) manoeuvering in an unknown and cluttered environment. A Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) variant is used for the generation of a collision free path and linear Model Predictive Control(MPC) is applied to follow this path. The guidance errors are mapped to the states of the linear MPC structure by using the nonlinear kinematic equations. The proposed path planning algorithm considers the run time of the planning stage explicitly and generates a continuous curvature path whenever replanning occurs. Simulation results show that the RUAV with the proposed methodology successfully achieves autonomous navigation regardless of its lack of prior information about the environment.

AB We introduce patch models, a computational modeling formalism for multivehicle combat domains, based on spatio-temporal abstraction methods developed in the computer science community. The framework yields models that are expressive enough to accommodate nontrivial controlled vehicle dynamics while being within the representational capabilities of common artificial intelligence techniques used in the construction of autonomous systems. The framework allows several key design requirements of next-generation network-centric command and control systems, such as maintenance of shared situation awareness, to be achieved. Major features include support for multiple situation models at each decision node and rapid mission plan adaptation. We describe the formal specification of patch models and our prototype implementation, i.e., Patchworks. The capabilities of patch models are validated through a combat mission simulation in Patchworks, which involves two defending teams protecting a camp from an enemy attacking team.

ID CONTEXT; VISION
AB In recent years, active research has been conducted on computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) for autonomous driving to increase the understanding of the importance of object detection technology using a frontal-viewing camera. However, using an RGB camera as a frontal-viewing camera can generate lens flare artifacts due to strong light sources, components of the camera lens, and foreign substances, which damage the images, making the shape of objects in the images unrecognizable. Furthermore, the object detection performance is significantly reduced owing to a lens flare during semantic segmentation performed for autonomous driving. Flare artifacts pose challenges in their removal, as they are caused by various scattering and reflection effects. The state-of-the-art methods using general scene image retain artifactual noises and fail to eliminate flare entirely when there exist severe levels of flare in the input image. In addition, no study has been conducted to solve these problems in the field of semantic segmentation for autonomous driving. Therefore, this study proposed a novel lens flare removal technique based on a class attention map-based flare removal network (CAM-FRN) and a semantic segmentation method using the images in which the lens flare is removed. CAM-FRN is a generative-based flare removal network that estimates flare regions, generates highlighted images as input, and incorporates the estimated regions into the loss function for successful artifact reconstruction and comprehensive flare removal. We synthesized a lens flare using the Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (KITTI) datasets, which are road scene open datasets. The experimental results showed that semantic segmentation accuracy in images with lens flare was removed based on CAM-FRN, exhibiting 71.26% and 60.27% mean intersection over union (mIoU) in the CamVid and KITTI databases, respectively. This indicates that the proposed method is significantly better than state-of-the-art methods.

AB Model-based verification uses a model to reason about the correctness of a real system. This requires the model and the system to be conformant, such that verification results on the model can be transfered to the real system. Especially for hybrid systems, which combine discrete and continuous behavior, defining and checking conformance is a difficult task. In this work, we present reachset conformance for hybrid systems that transfers safety properties from a model to the real system. We show how a model can be adapted to be conformant to measurements of a real system and demonstrate this for a real autonomous vehicle. The obtained reachset conformant model can be used for the verification of safety-critical properties, such as collision avoidance.

AB Driverless cars, often viewed as low-carbon tourism mobility and can contribute to sustainable tourism, have generated much discussion. This study adds to ongoing but uncommon discussion about driverless cars' impact on tourist behaviour. With context of nature- and rural-based tourist destination with widely dispersed attractions, this study uses leisure constraints, experience economy, travel motivations, and technology readiness to appreciate future potential of driverless car in tourism. Partial least square analysis on 198 returns revealed that driverless car rental intention at the destination is influenced positively by aesthetic experience expectation and by technology readiness (innovativeness), but negatively by technology readiness (insecurity).

AB This paper proposes a novel bioinspired neurodynamics-based position-tracking control approach for hovercrafts, where smooth and continuous velocity commands are desirable for safe steering control. The control algorithm is derived from the tracking error dynamics by incorporating backstepping technique and neurodynamics model derived from biological membrane equation. The tracking error is proved to converge to a small neighbourhood of the origin by a Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed approach is capable of generating smooth and continuous control signals with zero initial velocities, dealing with the velocity-jump problem. In addition, it can track any sufficiently smooth-bounded curves with constant or time-varying velocities. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated by simulation and comparison results.

ID NAVIGATION; SYSTEMS
AB This brief deals with the problem of path planning for 3-D vehicles. The problem is simplified by resolving the workspace into horizontal and vertical planes. The flight path angle and the heading angle are linear functions of the visibility line angles in the vertical and horizontal planes, respectively. Other terms for the deviation and heading regulation are added to the navigation law. The navigation law has two navigation proportionality factors and two deviation parameters corresponding to the horizontal and vertical planes. The method has the ability to generate non-straight paths to the goal. Obstacles and dangerous zones are avoided by correcting the path by changing the values of the parameters. The dynamic constraints are transformed to a restriction in the navigation parameters' space. Our results are illustrated using simulation.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have become increasingly common and the trend will continue. Examples of AI systems include autonomous vehicles (AV), computer vision, natural language processing and AI medical experts. To allow for safe and effective deployment of AI systems, the reliability of such systems needs to be assessed. Traditionally, reliability assessment is based on reliability test data and the subsequent statistical modelling and analysis. The availability of reliability data for AI systems, however, is limited because such data are typically sensitive and proprietary. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) oversees and regulates an AV testing program, in which many AV manufacturers are conducting AV road tests. Manufacturers participating in the program are required to report recurrent disengagement events to California DMV. This information is being made available to the public. In this paper, we use recurrent disengagement events as a representation of the reliability of the AI system in AV, and propose a statistical framework for modelling and analysing the recurrent events data from AV driving tests. We use traditional parametric models in software reliability and propose a new non-parametric model based on monotonic splines to describe the event process and to estimate the cumulative baseline intensity function of the event process. We develop inference procedures for selecting the best models, quantifying uncertainty and testing heterogeneity in the event process. We then analyse the recurrent events data from four AV manufacturers, and make inferences on the reliability of the AI systems in AV. We also describe how the proposed analysis can be applied to assess the reliability of other AI systems. This paper has online supplementary materials.

AB The increasing demand for underwater robotic intervention systems around the world in several application domains requires more versatile and inexpensive systems. By using a wireless communication system, supervised semi-autonomous robots have freedom of movement; however, the limited and varying bandwidth of underwater radio frequency (RF) channels is a major obstacle for the operator to get camera feedback and supervise the intervention. This paper proposes the use of progressive (embedded) image compression and region of interest (ROI) for the design of an underwater image sensor to be installed in an autonomous underwater vehicle, specially when there are constraints on the available bandwidth, allowing a more agile data exchange between the vehicle and a human operator supervising the underwater intervention. The operator can dynamically decide the size, quality, frame rate, or resolution of the received images so that the available bandwidth is utilized to its fullest potential and with the required minimum latency. The paper focuses first on the description of the system, which uses a camera, an embedded Linux system, and an RF emitter installed in an OpenROV housing cylinder. The RF receiver is connected to a computer on the user side, which controls the camera monitoring parameters, including the compression inputs, such as region of interest (ROI), size of the image, and frame rate. The paper focuses on the compression subsystem and does not attempt to improve the communications physical media for better underwater RF links. Instead, it proposes a unified system that uses well-integrated modules (compression and transmission) to provide the scientific community with a higher-level protocol for image compression and transmission in sub-sea robotic interventions.

TI A rigorous multi-population multi-lane hybrid traffic model for

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS

ID SCALAR CONSERVATION-LAWS; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; FLOW
AB In this paper, a multi-lane multi-population microscopic model, which presents stop-and-go waves, is proposed to simulate traffic on a ring-road. Vehicles are divided between human-driven and autonomous vehicles (AV). Control strategies are designed with the ultimate goal of using a small number of AVs (less than 5% penetration rate) to represent Lagrangian control actuators that can smooth the multilane traffic flow and dissipate the traffic instabilities, and in particular stop-and-go waves. This in turn may reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The lane-changing mechanism is based on three components that we treat as parameters in the model: safety, incentive and cool-down time. The choice of these parameters in the lane-change mechanism is critical to modeling traffic accurately, because different parameter values can lead to drastically different traffic behaviors. In particular, the number of lane-changes and the speed variance are highly affected by the choice of parameters. Despite this modeling issue, when using sufficiently simple and robust controllers for AVs, the stabilization of uniform flow steady state is effective for any realistic value of the parameters, and ultimately bypasses the observed modeling issue. Our approach is based on accurate and rigorous mathematical models. The interest, among others, is that such mathematical model has been shown to allow a limit procedure that is termed, in gas dynamic terminology, mean-field. In simple words, from increasing the human-driven population to infinity, a system of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations are obtained. Finally, we explore collaborative driving by assuming that a fraction of human drivers is instructed to drive smoothly to stabilize traffic. We show that this approach also leads to dissipation of waves.

AB The global Connected and Autonomous Mobility industry is growing at a rapid pace. To ensure the successful adoption of connected automated mobility solutions, their safety, reliability and hence the public acceptance are paramount. It is widely known that in order to demonstrate that L3 automated systems are safer with respect to human drivers, upwards of several millions of miles need to be driven. The only way to efficiently achieve this amount of tests in a timely manner is by using simulations and high fidelity virtual environments. Two key components of being able to test an automated system in a synthetic environment are validated sensor models and noise models for each sensor technology. In fact, the sensors are the element feeding information into the system in order to enable it to safely plan the trajectory and navigate. In this paper, we propose an innovative real-time LiDAR sensor model based on beam propagation and a probabilistic rain model, taking into account raindrop distribution and size. The model can seamlessly run in real-time, synchronised with the visual rendering, in immersive driving simulators, such as the WMG 3xD simulator. The models are developed using Unreal engine, therefore demonstrating that gaming technology can be merged with the Automated Vehicles (AVs) simulation toolchain for the creation and visualization of high fidelity scenarios and for AV accurate testing. This work can be extended to add more sensors and more noise factors or cyberattacks in real-time simulations.

AB The explosive growth of user demands for mobile data puts forward higher requirements for existing network architecture. In this case, many novel technologies, such as edge computing, ultra-dense network (UND), are recently proposed to alleviate the network burden of cellular macro base stations (MBSs). However, their performance is limited by dynamic user requests and uncertain user mobility since they highly rely on the fixed infrastructure. Along with the advent of autonomous driving era, autonomous vehicles possess strong computing and communication ability, which provide a new idea to resolve the limitation of infrastructure based network architecture. In this paper, we exploit the performance of a vehicular caching scheme where the role of moving vehicles is changed from service consumers in traditional networks to service providers and service consumers. As such, a prediction based vehicular caching scheme is proposed. Specifically, an optimization problem is firstly formulated by exploring the relationship of caching vehicles and mobile users, in order to optimize the network energy efficiency. The nonconvex optimization problem is solved by decomposing it into a nonlinear programming problem. By applying the Lyapunov method and autoregressive neural network (ANN), an online caching decision algorithm is finally proposed to make caching decisions. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the caching scheme in different scenarios. Results show that the vehicular caching scheme can obviously improve network energy efficiency with different requests, but the increment is reduced under the scenario of intensive requests. The comparison between online and offline caching also shows the necessity of online caching decision making due to its benefit in resource utilization where system gain is increased from 8.4% to 59.24%.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to propose a parallel automated assembly line system to produce multiple products in a semi-continuous system.
   Design/methodology/approach - The control system developed in this research consists of a manufacturing system for two-level hierarchical dynamic decisions of autonomous/automated/automatic-guided vehicles (AGVs) dispatching/next station selection and machining schedules and a station control scheme for operational control of machines and components. In this proposed problem, the assignment of multiple AGVs to different assembly lines and the semi-continuous stations is a critical objective. AGVs and station scheduling decisions are made at the assembly line level. On the other hand, component and machining resource scheduling are made at the station level.
   Findings - The proposed scheduler first decomposes the dynamic scheduling problems into a static AGV and machine assignment during each short-term rolling window. It optimizes weighted completion time of tasks for each short-term window by formulating the task and resource assignment problem as a minimum cost flow problem during each short-term scheduling window. A comprehensive decision making process and heuristics are developed for efficient implementation. A simulation study is worked out for validation.
   Originality/value - Several assembly lines are configured to produce multiple products in which the technologies of machines are shared among the assembly lines when required. The sequence of stations is pre-specified in each assembly line and the components of a product are kept in machine magazine. The transportation between the stations in an assembly line (intra assembly line) and among stations in different assembly lines (inter assembly line) are performed using AGVs.

AB High-precision navigation solutions are a main requirement for autonomous vehicle (AV) applications. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are the prime source of navigation information for such applications. However, some places such as tunnels, underpasses, inside parking garages, and urban high-rise buildings suffer from GNSS signal degradation or unavailability. Therefore, another system is required to provide a continuous navigation solution, such as the inertial navigation system (INS). The vehicle's onboard inertial measuring unit (IMU) is the main INS input measurement source. However, the INS solution drifts over time due to IMU-associated errors and the mechanization process itself. Therefore, INS/GNSS integration is the proper solution for both systems' drawbacks. Traditionally, a linearized Kalman filter (LKF) such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is utilized as a navigation filter. The EKF deals only with the linearized errors and suppresses the higher orders using the Taylor expansion up to the first order. This paper introduces a loosely coupled INS/GNSS integration scheme using the invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF). The IEKF state estimate is independent of the Jacobians that are derived in the EKF; instead, it uses the matrix Lie group. The proposed INS/GNSS integration using IEKF is applied to a real road trajectory for performance validation. The results show a significant enhancement when using the proposed system compared to the traditional INS/GNSS integrated system that uses EKF in both GNSS signal presence and blockage cases. The overall trajectory 2D-position RMS error reduced from 19.4 m to 3.3 m with 82.98% improvement and the 2D-position max error reduced from 73.9 m to 14.2 m with 80.78% improvement.

AB Intersection is one of the most accident-prone urban scenarios for autonomous driving wherein making safe and computationally efficient decisions is non-trivial. Current research mainly focuses on the simplified traffic conditions while ignoring the existence of mixed traffic flows, i.e., vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. For urban roads, different participants lead to a quite dynamic and complex interaction, posing great difficulty to learn an intelligent policy. This paper develops the dynamic permutation state representation in the framework of integrated decision and control (IDC) to handle signalized intersections with mixed traffic flows. Specially, this representation introduces an encoding function and summation operator to construct driving states from environmental observation, capable of dealing with different types and variant number of traffic participants. A constrained optimal control problem is built wherein the objective involves tracking performance and the constraints for different participants, roads and signal lights are designed respectively to assure safety. We solve this problem by gradient-based optimization, wherein the reasonable state will be given by the encoding function and then served as the input of policy and value function. An off-policy training is designed to reuse observations from driving environment and backpropagation through time is utilized to update the policy function and encoding function jointly. Verification result shows that the dynamic permutation state representation can enhance the driving performance of IDC, including comfort, decision compliance and safety with a large margin. The trained driving policy can realize efficient and smooth passing in the complex intersection, guaranteeing driving intelligence and safety simultaneously.

AB To address the complex trajectory tracking problem of AUH near the seabed when performing high-precision operations such as comprehensive underwater inspections for offshore engineering structures, a prescribed performance control strategy with a finite-time performance function (FTPF) and the fast terminal sliding surface is proposed. The influence of ocean current is fully considered by the combination of ocean current velocity estimated by a current observer and ocean current disturbance in the dynamic model. An arctan-type disturbance observer and neural network are designed to compensate for environmental disturbances, model uncertainty, and thruster failure effects on the system. The system stability is proven by the Lyapunov method, and the numerical simulation shows that the proposed scheme is effective, robust, and efficient, even under disturbances and thruster failure.

AB The direct time-of-flight (d-ToF) technique is the most promising method for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems in long-range autonomous applications. However, the receiver cannot distinguish its own pulse signal from those of other LiDAR systems. This causes mutual interference between LiDAR systems, which degrades object recognition. The optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) modulation technique can be used to avoid mutual interference. However, it is difficult to secure sufficient orthogonal codes, because each laser channel uses a designated codeword. In addition, when interference occurs in a specific direction, it can occur continuously. Adversarial attacks on a LiDAR system can trick a vehicle to perform false object recognition without physical contact. This can endanger passengers, pedestrians, and other vehicles. Therefore, we propose an OCDMA codeword switching technique that can effectively solve these problems in driving environments. First, we analyzed the characteristics of optical orthogonal codes (OOC) and defined the interference generated in LiDAR systems. The proposed technique exhibits interference robustness by using a code index buffer based on differences in the received optical signal power. In addition, verification of the hardware implementation and its complexity was analyzed using LiDAR testbench and an FPGA. The interference and continuous interference of the proposed technique in various driving environments were verified using simulation model. Compared with using only a designated codeword, the proposed technique reduces interference by 82.59% and 85.51%, and continuous interference by 92.24% and 96.94% in straight-line and curved driving, respectively.

AB Fuel cell/battery hybrid energy storage system (HESS) powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has the outstanding advantage of long endurance time. Trajectory tracking motion is a commonly used task execution mode of UAVs, especially in autonomous UAVs. This study aims at developing a control architecture to coordinate energy management with trajectory tracking control for fuel cell/battery hybrid UAVs. Its position tracking control adopts model predictive control (MPC) and an extended state observer to eliminate the modeling errors and effect of interference. The attitude tracking control adopts an autodisturbance rejection controller having a quick response. The obtained control parameters are given as an input to the energy management block. Energy management strategies (EMSs) based on online dynamic programming and hierarchical MPC have been proposed. The results obtained from a simulation show that the proposed trajectory tracking control architecture can track the target trajectory stably with a small tracking error. The tracking performance is stable under interference. Experimental results show that dynamic programming is solved online with good control performance. Compared to ordinary EMSs, dynamic programming and hierarchical MPC can increase endurance time by 2.69% and 1.27%, respectively. The proposed control architecture verifies the coordination of energy management , trajectory tracking control , prospected the advantages of the com-bination of fuel cell and autonomous driving for long endurance UAVs in the future.

AB The ability to remotely detect and map chemical vapour clouds in open air environments is a topic of significant interest to both defence and civilian communities. In this study, we integrate a prototype miniature colorimetric chemical sensor developed for methyl salicylate (MeS), as a model chemical vapour, into a micro unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and perform flights through a raised MeS vapour cloud. Our results show that that the system is capable of detecting MeS vapours at low ppm concentration in real-time flight and rapidly sending this information to users by on-board telemetry. Further, the results also indicate that the sensor is capable of distinguishing clean air from dirty, multiple times per flight, allowing us to look towards autonomous cloud mapping and source localization applications. Further development will focus on a broader range of integrated sensors, increased autonomy of detection and improved engineering of the system.

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive trajectory prediction framework that combines a multimodal trajectory generation network with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and risk aversion (RA) modules. Specifically, we first construct a multimodal spatial-temporal Transformer network (mmSTTN) to generate multiple trajectory candidates, using trajectory coordinates as inputs. Accounting for spatio-temporal features, we formulate the IRL reward function for evaluating all candidate trajectories. The optimal trajectory is then selected based on the computed rewards, a process that mimics human drivers' decision-making. We further develop the RA module based on the driving risk field for optimal risk-averse trajectory prediction. We conduct experiments and ablation studies using the inD dataset at an urban unsignalized intersection, demonstrating impressive human trajectory alignment, prediction accuracy, and the ability to generate risk-averse trajectories. Our proposed framework reduces prediction errors and driving risks by 25% and 30% compared to baseline methods. Results validate vehicles' human-like risk-averse diverging-and-concentrating behavior as they traverse the intersection. The proposed framework presents a novel approach for forecasting multimodal vehicular trajectories by imitating human drivers and incorporating physics-based risk information derived from the driving field. This research offers a promising direction for enhancing the safety and efficiency of connected and autonomous vehicles navigating urban environments.

AB Edge devices that operate in real-world environments are subjected to unpredictable conditions caused by environmental forces such as wind and uneven surfaces. Since most edge systems such as autonomous vehicles exhibit dynamic properties, it is clear that reinforcement learning can be a powerful tool for improving system accuracy. Successful maintenance of the position of a vehicle in such environments has been recently achieved with the aid of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that dynamically adjusts the Reconfigurable Wireless Network (RWN) response. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often seen as black boxes, as neither the acquired knowledge nor the decision rationale can be explained. This raises issues with the transparency and trustworthiness of the system because the underlying AI models are not governed by any mathematical or physics laws. In this paper, we explain the process of a DNN utilisation in an autonomous dynamic positioning system by gauging reactions of the DNN to predefined constraints and capturing the associated conditions that influence the DNN in a time series. We introduce a novel digitisation technique that reduces interesting patterns of time series data into single-digits to obtain a cross comparable view of the conditions. By analysing the clusters formed on this cross comparable view, we discovered multiple intensities of environmental conditions spanning across 44% of moderate conditions and 33% and 23% of harsh and mild conditions respectively. Our analysis showed that the proposed system can provide stable responses to uncertain conditions by predicting randomness.

AB This paper aims to investigate the safety impact of connected vehicles and connected vehicles with the lower level of automation features under vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and infrastructure-to vehicle (I2V) communication technologies. Examining the lower level of automation is more realistic in the foreseeable future. This study considered two automated features such as automated braking and lane keeping assistance which are widely available in the market with low penetration rates. Driving behavior of connected vehicles (CV) and connected vehicles lower level automation (CVLLA) were modeled in the C++ programming language with considering realistic car following models in VISSIM. To this end, safety impact on both segment and intersection crash risks were explored through surrogate safety assessment techniques under various market penetration rates (MPRs). Segment crash risk was analyzed based on both time proximity-based and evasive action-based surrogate measures of safety: time exposed time-to-collision (fm), time integrated time-to-collision (TIT), time exposed rear-end crash risk index (TERCRI), lane changing conflicts (LCC), and number of critical jerks (NCJ). However, the intersection crash risk was evaluated through the number of conflicts extracted from micro simulation (VISSIM) using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). A logistic regression model was also developed to quantify the crash risk in terms of observed conflicts obtained in the intersection influence areas. The results suggest that both CV and CVLLA reduce segment crash risk significantly in terms of the five surrogate measures of safety. Furthermore, the logistic regression results clearly showed that both CV and CVLLA have lower intersection crash risks compared to the base scenario. In terms of both segment and intersection crash risks, CVLLA significantly outperforms CV when MPRs are 60% or higher. Thus, the results indicate a significant safety improvement resulting from implementing CV and CVLLA technologies at both segments and intersections on arterials.

ID BELIEF PROPAGATION
AB In autonomous vehicles, depth information for the environment surrounding the vehicle is commonly extracted using time-of-flight (ToF) sensors such as LiDARs and RADARs. Those sensors have some limitations that may potentially degrade the quality and utility of the depth information to a substantial extent. An alternative solution is depth estimation from stereo pairs. However, stereo matching and depth estimation often fails at ill-posed regions including areas with repetitive patterns or textureless surfaces which are commonly found on planar surfaces. This paper focuses on designing an efficient framework for stereo depth estimation, using deep learning technique, that is robust against the mentioned ill-posed regions. With the observation that disparities of all pixels belonging to planar areas (scene plane) viewed by two rectified stereo images can be described using affine transformations, our proposed method predicts pixel-wise affine transformation parameters based on the depth information encoded in the aggregated cost volume. We also introduce a propagation term which enforces all pixels belonging to the same scene plane to be transformed using the same parameters. Disparity can then be computed by multiplying the predicted affine parameters with the corresponding pixel locations. The proposed method was evaluated on several benchmark datasets. We are able to obtain competitive results and at the same time reducing the processing time of common convolution neural network (CNN) in stereo matching by 50%. Analysis of the findings shows that our method can produce reliable results at the ill-posed regions which are challenging to the current state-of-the-arts methods.

AB Innovative last-mile logistics solutions are needed to reduce delivery costs, traffic congestion, and pollution in cities. A promising concept in this context are truck-and-robot systems with robot depots, as they enable significant cost and traffic reduction compared to classic truck deliveries. The system relies on small autonomous delivery robots to cover the last meters to a customer. Existing concepts consider home deliveries by robots, while trucks are only used to transport robots and not for deliveries. This assumption disregards the fact that regular truck deliveries are still needed for some delivery requests, such as for the delivery of bulky items, or for customers who do not accept robots. Our research addresses this issue and proposes the first mixed truck and robot delivery concept with robot depots in which both robots and the delivery truck can visit customers. Our tailored solution approach is based on a General Variable Neighborhood Search that efficiently solves the routing problem and outperforms existing truck-and-robot routing algorithms (reducing the runtime by 37 to 94% in experiments). The numerical experiments show that this approach enables cost reductions of up to 43% compared to classical truck deliveries and up to 22% compared to a truck-and-robot system that does not allow deliveries by both truck and robots on the same tour. Further analyses reveal additional benefits of such mixed tours and the robustness of our approach for different problem settings. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the advent of autonomous driving, the issue of human intervention during safety-critical events is an urgent topic of research. Supervisory monitoring, taking over vehicle control during automation failures and then bringing the vehicle to safety under time pressure are cognitively demanding tasks that pose varying difficulties across the driving population. This underpins a need to investigate individual differences (i.e., how people differ in their dispositional traits) in driver responses to automation system limits, so that autonomous vehicle design can be tailored to meet the safety-critical needs of higher-risk drivers. However, few studies thus far have examined individual differences, with self-report measures showing limited ability to predict driver takeover performance. To address this gap, the present study explored the utility of an established brain activity-based objective index of trait attentional control (frontal theta/beta ratio; TBR) in predicting driver interactions with conditional automation. Frontal TBR predicted drivers' average takeover reaction time, as well as the likelihood of accident after takeover. Moving towards practical applications, this study also demonstrated the utility of streamlined estimates of frontal TBR measured from the forehead electrodes and from a single crown electrode, with the latter showing better fidelity and predictive value. Overall, TBR is behaviourally relevant, measurable with minimal sensors and easily computable, rendering it a promising candidate for practical and objective assessment of drivers' neurocognitive traits that contribute to their AV driving readiness.

AB This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme for the medium-level control of a small-scale autonomous bulldozer to accurately and safely displace crushed materials of masonry in construction contexts. For this purpose, the controller is required to minimize the error between the achieved and required paths; additionally, the control actions must be smooth for minimizing the mistreatment of equipment, which is intended to operate in the long term, as it is usual in industrial-grade solutions. The proposed NMPC based path-follower can adequately handle the platform's constraints and usual perturbations. In terms of state estimation, a map-based localizer is implemented via an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on the platform nominal process model and light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors measurements. The localizer provides estimates of the platform's pose, necessary for the MPC controller's state feedback. An actual experiment on a modified UGV (Clearpaths Husky A-200) is performed to validate the performance of the proposed control scheme. The UGV is retrofitted with a blade (for pushing material) and appropriate sensors for the necessary perception tasks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed control scheme is robust and suitable for safely pushing the crushed materials, presenting appropriately low deviation from the nominal path and requiring reasonably low processing time.

AB Recent development in wireless communications has provided many reliable solutions to emergency response issues, especially in scenarios with dysfunctional or congested base stations. Prior studies on underwater emergency communications, however, remain understudied, which poses a need for combining the merits of different underwater communication links (UCLs) and the manipulability of unmanned vehicles. To realize energy-efficient underwater emergency communications, we develop a novel underwater emergency communication network (UECN) assisted by multiple links, including underwater light, acoustic, and radio-frequency links, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for collecting and transmitting underwater emergency data. First, we determine the optimal emergency response mode for an underwater sensor node (USN) using greedy search and reinforcement learning (RL), so that isolated USNs (I-USNs) can be identified. Second, according to the distribution of I-USNs, we dispatch AUVs to assist I-USNs in data transmission, i.e., jointly optimizing the locations and controls of AUVs to minimize the time for data collection and underwater movement. Finally, an adaptive clustering-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the number of AUVs and the transmit power of I-USNs, subject to a given set of constraints on transmit power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs), outage probabilities, and energy, achieving the best tradeoff between the maximum emergency response time (ERT) and the total energy consumption (EC). Simulation results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of energy efficiency (EE), contributing to underwater emergency communications.

AB Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) has a broad application prospect and autonomous path planning as its crucial technology has developed into a hot research direction in the field of USV research. This paper proposes an Improved Dueling Deep Double-Q Network Based on Prioritized Experience Replay (IPD3QN) to address the slow and unstable convergence of traditional Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithms in autonomous path planning of USV. Firstly, we use the deep double Q-Network to decouple the selection and calculation of the target Q value action to eliminate overestimation. The prioritized experience replay method is adopted to extract experience samples from the experience replay unit, increase the utilization rate of actual samples, and accelerate the training speed of the neural network. Then, the neural network is optimized by introducing a dueling network structure. Finally, the soft update method is used to improve the stability of the algorithm, and the dynamic epsilon-greedy method is used to find the optimal strategy. The experiments are first conducted in the Open AI Gym test platform to pre-validate the algorithm for two classical control problems: the Cart pole and Mountain Car problems. The impact of algorithm hyperparameters on the model performance is analyzed in detail. The algorithm is then validated in the Maze environment. The comparative analysis of simulation experiments shows that IPD3QN has a significant improvement in learning performance regarding convergence speed and convergence stability compared with DQN, D3QN, PD2QN, PDQN, PD3QN. Also, USV can plan the optimal path according to the actual navigation environment with the IPD3QN algorithm.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a new approach for robust control of an autonomous quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in automatic take-off, hovering and landing mission and also to improve the stabilizing performance of the quadrotor with inherent time-varying disturbance.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, the dynamic model of the aerial vehicle is mathematically formulated. Then, a combination of a nonlinear backstepping scheme with the intelligent fuzzy system as a new key idea to generate a robust controller is designed for the stabilization and altitude tracking of the vehicle. For the problem of determining the backstepping control parameters, a new heuristic algorithm, namely, Gravitational Search Algorithm has been used.
   Findings - The control law design utilizes the backstepping control methodology that uses Lyapunov function which can guarantee the stability of the nominal model system, whereas the intelligent system is used as a compensator to attenuate the effects caused by external disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can achieve favorable control performances for automatic take-off, hovering and landing mission of quadrotor UAV even in the presence of unknown perturbations.
   Originality/value - This paper propose a new robust control design approach which incorporates the backstepping control with fuzzy system for quadrotor UAV with inherent time-varying disturbance. The originality of this work relies on the technique to compensate the disturbances acting on the quadrotor UAV. In this new approach, the fuzzy system is introduced as an auxiliary control effort to compensate the effect of disturbances. Because the proposed control technique has the capability of robustness against disturbance, thus, it is also suitable to be applied for a broad class of uncertain nonlinear systems.

AB The mobility of the vectored thruster AUV in different environment is the important premise of control system design. The new type of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with rudders and vectored thrusters which are combined to control the course is studied. Firstly, Euler angles representation and quaternion method are applied to establish six-DOF kinematic model respectively, then Newton second law and Lagrangian approach are used to deduce the vectored thruster AUV's nonlinear dynamic equations with six degrees of freedom (DOF) respectively in complex sea conditions based on the random wave theory according to the structural and kinetic characteristics of the vectored thruster AUV in this paper. The kinematic models and dynamic models based on different theories have the same expression and conclusion, which shows that the kinematic models and dynamic models of the vectored thruster AUV are accurate. The Runge-Kutta arithmetic is used to solve the dynamic equations, which not only can simulate the motions such as cruise and hover but also can describe the vehicle's low-frequency and high-frequency motion. The results of computation show that the mobility of the vectored thruster AUV in interference-free environment and the integrated signals including low-frequency motion signal and high-frequency motion signal in environmental disturbance accord with practical situation, which not only solve the problem of especial singularities when the pitch angle theta = +/- 90 degrees but also clears up the difficulties of computation and display of the coupled nonlinear motion equations in complex sea conditions. Moreover, the high maneuverability of the vectored thruster AUV equipped with rudders and vectored thrusters is validated, which lays a foundation for the control system design.

AB Platooning technologies enable trucks to drive cooperatively and automatically, providing benefits including less fuel consumption, greater road capacity, and safety. To establish trust during dynamic platooning formation, ensure vehicular data integrity, and guard platoons against potential attackers in mixed fleet environments, verifying any given vehicle's identity information before granting it access to join a platoon is pivotal. Besides, due to privacy concerns, truck owners may be reluctant to disclose private vehicular information, which can reveal their business data to untrusted third parties. To address these issues, this is the first study to propose an aggregated zero-knowledge proof and blockchain-empowered system for privacy-preserving identity verification in truck platooning. We provide the correctness proof and the security analysis of our proposed authentication scheme, highlighting its increased security and fast performance. The platooning formation procedure is re-designed to seamlessly incorporate the proposed authentication scheme, including the 1st catch-up and cooperative driving steps. The blockchain performs the role of verifier within the authentication scheme and stores platooning records on its digital ledger to guarantee data immutability and integrity. In addition, the proposed programmable access control policies enable truck companies to define who is allowed to access their platoon records. We implement the proposed system and perform extensive experiments on the Hyperledger platform. The results show that the blockchain can provide low latency and high throughput, the aggregated approach can offer a constant verification time of 500 milliseconds regardless of the number of proofs, and the platooning formation only takes seconds under different strategies. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our design for use in real-world truck platooning.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm technology is one of the research hotspots in recent years. With the continuous improvement of autonomous intelligence of UAV, the swarm technology of UAV will become one of the main trends of UAV development in the future. This paper studies the behavior decision-making process of UAV swarm rendezvous task based on the double deep Q network (DDQN) algorithm. We design a guided reward function to effectively solve the problem of algorithm convergence caused by the sparse return problem in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the long period task. We also propose the concept of temporary storage area, optimizing the memory playback unit of the traditional DDQN algorithm, improving the convergence speed of the algorithm, and speeding up the training process of the algorithm. Different from traditional task environment, this paper establishes a continuous state-space task environment model to improve the authentication process of UAV task environment. Based on the DDQN algorithm, the collaborative tasks of UAV swarm in different task scenarios are trained. The experimental results validate that the DDQN algorithm is efficient in terms of training UAV swarm to complete the given collaborative tasks while meeting the requirements of UAV swarm for centralization and autonomy, and improving the intelligence of UAV swarm collaborative task execution. The simulation results show that after training, the proposed UAV swarm can carry out the rendezvous task well, and the success rate of the mission reaches 90%.

AB Due to the ever-growing concerns over air pollution and energy security, more and more cities have started to replace their conventional taxi fleets with electric ones. Even though environmentally friendly, the rapid promotion of electric taxis raises problems to both taxi drivers and governments, e.g., prolonged waiting/charging time, unbalanced utilization of charging infrastructures, and inadequate taxi supply due to the long charging time. In this article, we conduct the first longitudinal measurement study to understand the long-term evolution of mobility and charging patterns by utilizing 5-year data from one of the largest electric taxi networks in the world, i.e., the Shenzhen electric taxi network in China. In particular, (1) we first perform an electric taxi contextualization about their operation and charging activities; (2) then we design a generic charging event extraction algorithm based on GPS data and charging station data, and (3) based on the contextualization and extracted charging activities, we perform a comprehensive measurement study called ePat to explore the evolution of the electric taxi network from the mobility and charging perspectives. Our ePat is based on 4.8 TB taxi GPS data, 240 GB taxi transaction data, and metadata from 117 charging stations, during an evolution process from 427 electric taxis in 2013 to 13,178 in 2018. Moreover, ePat also explores the impacts of various contexts and benefits during the evolution process. Our ePat as a comprehensive measurement of the electric taxi network mobility and charging evolution has the potential to advance the understanding of the evolution patterns of electric taxi networks and pave the way for analyzing future shared autonomous vehicles.

AB In industrial environments, over several decades, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) have served to improve efficiencies of intralogistics and material handling tasks. However, for system integrators, the choice and effective deployment of improved, suitable and reliable communication and control technologies for these unmanned vehicles remains a very challenging task. Specifics of communication for AGVs and AMRs imposes stringent performance requirements on latency and reliability of communication links which many existing wireless technologies struggle to satisfy. In this paper, a review of latest AGVs and AMRs research results in the past decade is presented. The review encompasses results from different past and present research domains of AGVs. In addition, performance requirements of communication networks in terms of their latencies and reliabilities when they are deployed for AGVs and AMRs coordination, control and fleet management in smart manufacturing environments are discussed. Integration challenges and limitations of present state-of-the-art AGV and AMR technologies when those technologies are used for facilitating AGV-based smart manufacturing and factory of the future applications are also thoroughly discussed. The paper also present a thorough discussion of areas in need of further research regarding the application of 5G networks for AGVs and AMRs fleet management in smart manufacturing environments. In addition, novel integration ideas by which tactile Internet, 5G network slicing and virtual reality applications can be used to facilitate AGV and AMR based factory of the future (FoF) and smart manufacturing applications were motivated.

AB The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is highly desirable for collecting data from seafloor sensor platforms within a close range. With the recent innovations in underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) for deep-sea exploration, UWOC could be used in conjunction with AUVs for high-speed data uploads near the surface. In addition to absorption and scattering effects, UWOC undergoes scintillation induced by temperature and salinity-related turbulence. However, studies on scintillation have been limited to emulating channels with uniform temperature and salinity gradients, rather than incorporating the effects of turbulent motion. Such turbulent flow results in an ocean mixing process that degrades optical communication. This study presents a turbulent model for investigating the impact of vehicle-motion induced turbulence via the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate. This scintillation-related parameter offers a representation of the change in the refractive index due to the turbulent flow and ocean mixing. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to validate the impact of turbulent flow on optical scintillation. In experimental measurements, the scintillation index (SI) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are similar with (SI = 0.4824; SNR = 5.56) and without (SI = 0.4823; SNR = 5.87) water mixing under uniform temperature channels. By introducing a temperature gradient of 4 degrees C, SI (SNR) with and without turbulent flow changed to 0.5417 (5.06) and 0.8790 (3.40), respectively. The experimental results show a similar trend to the simulation results. Thus, turbulent flow was shown to significantly impact underwater optical communications.

AB The coming 6G communication technology introduces the possibility of practice underwater Internet of Things (UIoT) applications with high-speed and reliable underwater communications. Among them, the cooperative coverage path planning (CPP) with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is a promising approach for enabling deep ocean exploration. The cooperative CPP in underwater is challenged by several marine factors, typically the harsh underwater communication environment, which brings difficulties in sharing the coverage progresses of AUVs and the environmental information such as the seafloor bathymetry, obstacles, etc. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel CPP method based on 6G enabled cooperative AUVs, named the Pac-AUV. As the name suggests, the method is based on the mechanism of the Ms. Pac-Man game, where AUV-assisted subsea exploration is considered as cooperative Pac-Men sharing the Pac-Dots distributed on the seafloor. The Pac-AUV involves two steps in cooperative CPP. One is a dot-spreading-based mission assignment (DMA), which is discretely performed by each AUV and requires support from reliable underwater communication in sharing the Pac-Dots. The other step is virtual attraction-based coverage path planning (V-CPP), which adopts the virtual attraction force from the Pac-Dots, results in low computational complexities in generating the coverage paths and avoids obstacles. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the performance of the Pac-AUV, and the results prove the advantages of cooperative and balanced CPP executions.

AB The decision-making module that operates in real-time is extensively valued for promoting traffic flow stability and throughput during autonomous driving. However, it may become problematic for autonomous vehicles to conduct Lane-changing (LC) decisions for acceleration in challenging urban scenarios, which poses certain risks to driving safety. This study develops a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Artificial Potential Field (APF) model with appropriate feature selection for safe and efficient accelerating LC decisions. Firstly, a two-lane driving scenario with 5+1 vehicles is established. In the course of accelerating LC, 7 analysis methods are exploited to identify areas of vehicle concern with consideration of 30 different features. Secondly, the methods of DNN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) that commonly used in the prediction of decision classification are analysed and compared, based on which the DNN model is selected and obtained with an optimal decision effect and potential improvement extent. Furthermore, taking into account the security considerations of LC decision and the possible improvement of DNN model, the risk monitoring method of APF with extensive application background is introduced into the DNN results. Finally, the proposed DNN-APF approach is compared with pure DNN in terms of fitting degree, safety factor, and velocity enhancement efficiency. The results indicate that under the premise of reasonable feature extraction, the DNN-APF approach achieves the accelerated LC behaviour decision with high accuracy and safety performance in comparison with SVM, KNN, and the DNN without security considerations.

ID TRACKING
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are often used to inspect the condition of submerged structures in oil and gas fields. Because the use of global positioning systems to aid AUV navigation is not feasible, object detection is an alternative method of supporting underwater inspection missions by detecting landmarks. Objects are detected not only to plan the trajectory of the AUVs, but their inspection can be the ultimate goal of the mission. In both cases, detecting an object's distance and orientation with respect to the AUV provides clues for the vehicle's navigation. Accordingly, we introduce a novel multi-object detection system that outputs object position and rotation from sonar images to support AUV navigation. To achieve this aim, two novel convolutional neural network-based architectures are proposed to detect and estimate rotated bounding boxes: an end-to-end network (RBoxNet), and a pipeline comprised of two networks (YOLOv2+RBoxDNet). Both proposed networks are structured from one of three novel representations of rotated bounding boxes regressed deep inside. Experimental analyses were performed by comparing several configurations of our proposed methods (by varying the backbone, regression representation, and architecture) with state-of-the-art methods using real sonar images. Results showed that RBoxNet presents the optimum trade-off between accuracy and speed, reaching an averaged mAP@[.5,.95] of 90.3% at 8.58 frames per second (FPS), while YOLOv2+RBoxDNet is the fastest solution, running at 16.19 FPS but with a lower averaged mAP@[.5,.95] of 77.5%. Both proposed methods are robust to additive Gaussian noise variations, and can detect objects even when the noise level is up to 0.10. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show great potential in modern transportation and communication networks, respectively. However, with growing demands for such technologies, the limited energy infrastructure becomes the bottleneck for their future growth. It might be of high cost and low energy efficiency for all the operators to each have their own dedicated energy infrastructure, such as charging stations. In this paper, we analyze a wireless charging infrastructure sharing strategy in UAV and EV-involved networks. We consider a scenario where UAVs can charge in EV charging stations and pay for the sharing fee. On the EVs' side, sharing infrastructure can earn extra profit but their service quality, such as waiting time, might slightly reduce. On the UAVs' side, if renting EV charging stations can achieve an acceptable system performance, say high coverage probability, while considering the cost, they may not need to build their dedicated charging stations. In this case, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the locations and propose an optimization problem that captures the aforementioned trade-offs between cost or profit and quality of service. Our numerical results show that sharing infrastructure slightly increases the waiting time of EVs, say within 5 min, but dramatically decreases the waiting time of drones, say more than 50 min, and deploying more charging stations do achieve better performances, but all these better performances are expected to cost more.

ID SELF-CALIBRATION; LIDAR
AB LiDAR and camera are two commonly used sensors in autonomous vehicles. In order to fuse the data collected by these two sensors to accurately perceive the 3D world, it is necessary to perform accurate internal parameters' and external parameters' calibration on the two sensors. However, during the long-term deployment and use of autonomous vehicles, factors such as aging of the equipment, transient changes in the external environment, and interference can cause the initially correctly calibrated camera internal parameters to no longer be applicable to the current environment, requiring a recalibration of the camera internal reference. Since most of the current work is focused on the research of perception algorithms and the calibration of various sensors, there has not been much research in identifying when a sensor needs to be recalibrated. Consequently, this paper proposed a data-driven detection method for the miscalibration of RGB cameras to detect the miscalibrated camera internal parameters. The specific operation process is to first add a random perturbation factor to the correctly calibrated camera internal parameters to generate an incorrect camera internal parameter and then calibrate the raw image with the incorrect internal parameter to generate a miscalibrated image data. The miscalibrated image data are used as the input data of the neural network to train the network model and generate a network model for detecting the miscalibration parameters. On the KITTI dataset, we conducted training as well as model deployment with the data collected from Cam2 and Cam3, respectively, and evaluated the abovementioned two models. The experimental results show that our proposed method has some application value in detecting errors in the calibration of the camera's internal parameters.

AB The potential functions (PFs) have generally shown good performances in real-time path planning with computation efficiency conforming to the requirements of lower control systems in autonomous driving. However, several inherent limitations exist in using the PFs, including a local minimum in specific scenarios and no passage between closely spaced obstacles. Recent studies have focused on conventional scenarios where PFs are assumed to work normally, without malfunctioning, occurring during perilous situations. Therefore, we propose a specific safety tunnel (ST)-based model predictive controller (MPC) combined with PFs (PF-STMPC) to handle path-planning in extreme-emergency traffic scenarios (e.g., emergency braking and lane-changing obstacles). To further guarantee driving safety, we improve PFs with the responsibility-sensitive safety (RSS) model that accurately calculates the minimum safe longitudinal and lateral distances. Furthermore, a sigmoid-based ST is designed for emergency navigation if the PFs fail to plan a safe path due to the aforementioned inherent limitations, enabling the controller with planning functionality if necessary. The ST is embedded in the MPC-based tracking controller as a safe constraint sensitive to surrounding environments (e.g., road structure and obstacles). The proposed PF-STMPC was co-simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim Simulator under the constant speed condition. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the proposed method demonstrated better performance in finding a safe path and eliminating severe yawing of the ego-vehicle (82.8% less in sideslip yawing amplitude and 57.7% shorter in the oscillation period of yaw angle) when facing traffic emergencies.

AB The present study proposes an ensemble-based deep neural network (DNN) model for autonomous detection of visual faults such as glass breakage, burn marks, snail trail, and discoloration, delamination on various photovoltaic modules (PVM). The proposed technique utilizes an image dataset captured by RGB (Red, Green, Blue) camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In the first step, the images are preprocessed by deriving spatial and frequency domain features, such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), texture, grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), fast Fourier transform (FFT), and grey level difference method (GLDM). The processed images are inserted as input in the proposed ensemble-based deep neural network (DNN) model in order to detect any visual faults on the photovoltaic modules (PVM). The performance of the proposed model is evaluated through classification accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and confusion matrix. The results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble-based deep neural network (DNN) model, along with the random forest classifier, achieved a classification accuracy of 99.68% for detecting visual faults on the PV modules. To verify the performance and robustness of the proposed model, we compare our model's results to those of various classification approaches described in the literature. The suggested approach is compatible with the commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) embedded flight management system for fault detection. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reliable scene analysis, under varying conditions, is an essential task in nearly any assistance or autonomous system application, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are no exception. ADAS commonly involve adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, lane change assistance, traffic sign recognition, and parking assistance with the ultimate goal of producing a fully autonomous vehicle. The present paper addresses detection and tracking of moving objects within the context of ADAS. We use a multisensor setup consisting of a radar and a stereo camera mounted on top of a vehicle. We propose to model the sensors uncertainty in polar coordinates on Lie Groups and perform the objects state filtering on Lie groups, specifically, on the product of two special Euclidean groups, i.e., SE(2)(2). To this end, we derive the designed filter within the framework of the extended Kalman filter on Lie groups. We assert that the proposed approach results with more accurate uncertainty modeling, since used sensors exhibit contrasting measurement uncertainty characteristics and the predicted target motions result with banana-shaped uncertainty contours. We believe that accurate uncertainty modeling is an important ADAS topic, especially when safety applications are concerned. To solve the multitarget tracking problem, we use the joint integrated probabilistic data association filter and present necessary modifications in order to use it on Lie groups. The proposed approach is tested on a real-world dataset collected with the described multisensor setup in urban traffic scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) have been fueled by the rapid development of communication technologies, sensor technologies, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Nonetheless, due to the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle networks, it is rather challenging to make timely and accurate decisions of vehicle behaviors. Moreover, in the presence of mobile wireless communications, the privacy and security of vehicle information are at constant risk. In this context, a new paradigm is urgently needed for various applications in dynamic vehicle environments. As a distributed machine learning technology, federated learning (FL) has received extensive attention due to its outstanding privacy protection properties and easy scalability. We conduct a comprehensive survey of the latest developments in FL for ITS. Specifically, we initially research the prevalent challenges in ITS and elucidate the motivations for applying FL from various perspectives. Subsequently, we review existing deployments of FL in ITS across various scenarios, and discuss specific potential issues in object recognition, traffic management, and service providing scenarios. Furthermore, we conduct a further analysis of the new challenges introduced by FL deployment and the inherent limitations that FL alone cannot fully address, including uneven data distribution, limited storage and computing power, and potential privacy and security concerns. We then examine the existing collaborative technologies that can help mitigate these challenges. Lastly, we discuss the open challenges that remain to be addressed in applying FL in ITS and propose several future research directions.

AB With the era of fully automated vehicles (AVs) quickly approaching, ridesharing services could have an important role in increasing vehicle occupancy, reducing vehicle miles traveled, and improving traffic conditions. However, the extent to which these potentials can be achieved depends on consumers' disposition to sharing rides. From a travel behavior perspective, two essential elements to the adoption of shared rides are individuals' acceptance of increased travel times associated with pickup/drop-off of other passengers and their approval of strangers sharing the same vehicle. The current study develops the notion of willingness to share (WTS), which represents the money value attributed by an individual to traveling alone compared to riding with strangers, to investigate the adoption of shared rides. Using a multivariate integrated choice and latent variable approach, we examine current choices and future intentions regarding the use of shared rides and estimate individuals' WTS as well as their values of travel time for two distinct trip purposes. Results show that users are less sensitive to the presence of strangers when in a commute trip compared to a leisure-activity trip. We also observe that the travel time added to the trip to serve other passengers may be a greater barrier to the use of shared services compared to the presence of a stranger. However, the potential to use travel time productively may help overcome this barrier especially for high-income individuals.

AB Automatic Vehicles Counting and Recognizing (AVCR) is a very challenging topic in transport engineering having important implications for the modern transport policies. Implementing a computer-assisted AVCR in the most vital districts of a country provides a large amount of measurements which are statistically processed and analyzed, the purpose of which is to optimize the decision-making of traffic operation, pavement design, and transportation planning. Since, the advent of computer vision technology, video based surveillance of road vehicles has become a key component in developing autonomous intelligent transportation systems. In this context, this paper proposes a Pattern Recognition system which employs an unsupervised clustering algorithm with the objective of detecting, counting and recognizing a number of dynamic objects crossing a roadway. This strategy defines a virtual sensor, whose aim is similar to that of an inductive-loop in a traditional mechanism, i.e. to extract from the traffic video streaming a number of signals containing anarchic information about the road traffic. Then, the set of signals is filtered with the aim of conserving only motion's significant patterns. Resulted data are subsequently processed by a statistical analysis technique so as to estimate and try to recognize a number of clusters corresponding to vehicles. Finite mixture models fitted by the EM algorithm are used to assess such clusters, which provides important information about the traffic such as the instantaneous number of vehicles, their weights, velocities and intervehicular distances.

AB In this paper, we present a decentralized sparse Gaussian process regression (DSGPR) model with event-triggered, adaptive inducing points. We address common issues inherent in decentralized frameworks such as high computation costs, inter-agent message bandwidth restrictions, and data fusion integrity. We also improve real-time sparse Gaussian process regression models by introducing an adaptation of the mean shift and fixed-width clustering algorithms called radial clustering. Radial clustering enables real-time SGPR models to have an adaptive number of inducing points through an efficient inducing point selection process. The entire DSGPR framework is evaluated on multiple simulated random vector fields. The results show that this framework effectively estimates vector fields using multiple autonomous agents. We also show the practical use of these algorithms by testing them on hardware typical for small autonomous vehicles

AB With the emergence of the fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, not only is the increase in mobile broadband targeted, but also the support of various novel use cases, such as industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, e-health, and Internet of Things together with their requirements leading to highly heterogeneous wireless networks. This requires a re-design of the network architecture to ensure the coexistence of these use cases and guarantee user experience and service requirements. Therefore, 5G networks will be highly flexible and support online learning and autonomous decision making capabilities in a centralized and distributed manner to ensure highly efficient management of wireless and network resources. In this paper, the main features enabling flexibility and autonomy in 5G networks are discussed together with potential applications in different layers of the wireless network.

AB This paper continues the previous effort on the development of a trajectory generation platform that assures minimum-control expenditure and collision-free manoeuvre of a torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) into a funnel-shaped stationary docking station (DS). The earlier-developed guidance system was based on the Inverse Dynamics in the Virtual Domain (IDVD) method accounting for AUV's dynamics and producing a smooth trackable trajectory, thus guaranteeing safe arrival to DS. The optimality of the real-time generated solutions has been assessed via comparing them with the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto pseudo-spectral (PS) method solutions that could only be obtained off-line. This paper explores a possibility of employing a more advanced hp-adaptive Radau (hp-AR) PS method for the same Hamiltonian two-point boundary-value problem. The considered approach explicitly encapsulates all realistic vehicular and environmental constraints such as the AUV's dynamics, ocean current disturbances, no-fly zones, and DS pose while minimizing the vehicle's controls expenditure and permitting precise manoeuvring into DS. The performance evaluation of the hp-AR PS based optimization routine is carried out through extensive software-in-the-loop simulations. For completeness, computational effectiveness and solution optimality of the trajectory generator engine based on the hp-AR method is compared with two other well-known PS methods based on Legendre and Chebyshev polynomial approximation. The results of this study show the superb performance of the hp-AR method-based trajectory generator among all other PS methods and a possibility of using it along with IDVD in the real-time implementation.

AB Currently, a few agricultural corporations are developing and producing a kind of radio-controlled agricultural airboat which could be used to weed and fertilize instead of human in the paddy fields. The authors improved the airboat realizing autonomous navigation by a global-positioning-system (GPS) compass in the previous research. To solve the limitation of GPS-based navigation in bad environment (e.g., areas with tall trees, bad weather conditions, etc.), a new positioning system was proposed by using a computer vision system mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide position information for an agricultural airboat engaged in autonomous fertilizing and herbicide application in this study. The computer vision system included a minicomputer, a color camera with a wide-angle lens, and a Bluetooth transmitter. The UAV was operated to hover high enough to overlook the paddy field by the computer vision system. The colored concentric circular markers were made to put at the corners of the paddy field to facilitate the paddy field recognition using Fitzgibbon ellipse fitting algorithm. Utilize the geographic position by GPS and image position by computer vision system of each markers to obtain the perspective transformation matrix for transforming the top view image of the paddy field. At the created paddy-field-based coordinate, the UAV detects the airboat position by using the white color feature and central symmetrical contour feature of the airboat and transmits the position information to airboat in real time by Bluetooth for airboat navigation. The results of navigation experiment showed that the RMS lateral errors were 0.17 m, 0.10 m and 0.11 m in 3 predefined paths, respectively. This accuracy level was better than that of differential-GPS (DGPS). It is acceptable for providing positioning service for the airboat autonomous navigation in paddy fields. Furthermore, this UAV-airboat solution was a beneficial attempt which can not only prevent the instability of GPS-based airboat navigation in bad environment, but also avoid the herbicide spray drift problem that occurs in UAV-spraying in the air.

AB This paper shows how non-linear attractor dynamics can be used to control teams of two autonomous mobile robots that coordinate their motion in order to transport large payloads in unknown environments, which might change over time and may include narrow passages, corners and sharp U-turns. Each robot generates its collision-free motion online as the sensed information changes. The control architecture for each robot is formalized as a non-linear dynamical system, where by design attractor states, i.e. asymptotically stable states, dominate and evolve over time. Implementation details are provided, and it is further shown that odometry or calibration errors are of no significance. Results demonstrate flexible and stable behavior in different circumstances: when the payload is of different sizes; when the layout of the environment changes from one run to another; when the environment is dynamice.g. following moving targets and avoiding moving obstacles; and when abrupt disturbances challenge team behavior during the execution of the joint transportation task.

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted increased attention from academic and in-dustrial research communities, owing to their wide range of potential applications in military and civilian do-mains. A collaborative group of UAVs operating in an ad hoc manner known as a flying ad hoc network (FANET) can accomplish complex tasks more efficiently. However, owing to the high mobility of UAVs, such applications remain limited by a few key challenges, including dynamic time-varying topologies, energy constraints, frequent link breakages, inter-UAV collisions, and external obstacle avoidance. A proper topology control algorithm (TCA) for UAV swarms with reasonable overhead helps to optimize both mission and communication performance in FANET. Thus, TCA provides wider coverage ensuring the quality of service in aerial connectivity. Additionally, it supports the efficient energy management, better target exploration, improved formation stability while ensuring inter-UAV collision avoidance, external obstacle avoidance, lower interference, and the enhanced autonomy of UAV swarms. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of available TCAs for FANET, and provide a novel taxonomy of TCAs based on the FANET topology architectures and underlying mathematical models. Through an in-depth assessment of recent innovative research articles and their comparative studies, we aim to provide novel insights into the latest technologies for autonomous cooperative coordination. The key open research issues and their respective solutions are addressed as future research directions.

AB The present paper is concerned with an instance of automatic control for autonomous vehicles based on the theory of virtual attractive-repulsive potentials (VARP). The first part of this paper presents a review of the VARP control theory as developed specifically by B. Nguyen, Y.-L. Chuang, D. Tung, C. Hsieh, Z. Jin, L. Shi, D. Marthaler, A. Bertozzi and R. Murray, in the paper 'Virtual attractive-repulsive potentials for cooperative control of second order dynamic vehicles on the Caltech MVWT', which appeared in the Proceedings of the 2005 American Control Conference, (Portland, OR, USA) held in June 2005 (pp. 1084-1089). The aim of the first part of the present paper is to recall the mathematical and logical steps that lead to controlling an autonomous robot by a VARP-based control theory. The concepts recalled in the first part of the present paper, with special reference to the physical interpretation of the terms in the developed control field, serve as the starting point to develop a more convoluted control theory for (second-order) dynamical systems whose state spaces are (possibly high-dimensional) curved manifolds. The second part of this paper is, in fact, devoted to extending the classical VARP control theory to regulate dynamical systems whose state spaces possess the mathematical structure of smooth manifolds through manifold calculus. Manifold-type state spaces present a high degree of symmetry, due to mutual non-linear constraints between single physical variables. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments complements the review of the VARP theory and the theoretical developments towards its extension to smooth manifolds.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) find a greater application like analysing toxic areas, geo-mapping with 3D modelling, where human beings can not be physically present. UAV plays a substantial contribution in discovering victims from the disaster zones, where a human has to risk their life in the process of disaster management. The existing UAV system suffers from problem in 3 significant factors, namely image processing, navigation and communication. The proposed UAV integrates autonomous vision-based navigation through the disaster atmosphere based on general graph theory with active changes on the length between 2 or more nodes, where a node is a pathway for the UAV to enter. The dynamic changes are based on the measurement of the traveled distance between nodes and adjusting the distance from the current node to the root node. The model designed will be adapted to computation speed, fetching speed, Frames per second (FPS) and accuracy. MobileNet v1-SSD is a variant of the standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, where speed, accuracy and FPS are equally managed than other models for a System on chip (SOC). It identifies the victims in the disaster zones and the paths offered for traversal. Experimental results show that the MobileNet v1-SSD model achieves 72.4% mAP on VOC2012 along with a custom dataset having a speed of 46 FPS for 300 x 300 image resolution. It also validates that the UAV acquires a navigation policy which reaches a high accuracy in real-time environments.

AB Mucilage bloom is a current issue, especially for countries in the Mediterranean Basin, due to economic activities and ecological effects. The main causes are increased nutrient load due to organic and industrial pollution in the sea, global warming, and meteorological conditions at a level that can trigger mucilage bloom. It is important to take permanent measures to combat the increased nutrient load causing mucilage. However, there are various actions that can be performed during the mucilage bloom period, especially the collection of mucilage on the sea surface. Surface vehicles can be used to monitor and collect mucilage on the sea surface. The aim of this study is to design an autonomous marine mucilage monitoring system for systems such as unmanned surface vehicles (USV). We suggest monitoring the risky Marmara Sea continuously and recording some of the key parameters using a USV. The onboard solution proposed in this study has an architect based on a three-tier mucilage monitoring system. In the first tier, the sea surface is scanned with camera(s) in a certain radius in real time. When mucilage-candidate areas are determined, the vehicle is directed to this region autonomously. In the second tier, seawater in the region is measured in real time with some onboard sensors, pH level, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen level. The third tier is where real samples at three different depths are collected (if possible) for detailed posterior lab analysis. We have compared image processing, CNN (ResNet50), kNN, SVM, and FFNN approaches and have shown that the accuracy of our proposed mucilage classification method offers better and more promising performance.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to briefly review the development of drive tourism in the past 75 years, highlight contemporary issues that will shape the structure of drive tourism in the near future and speculate on how drive tourism may develop in future decades.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a range of academic and grey literature to identify the major trends that are now emerging in the drive tourism sector. These trends form the basis for observations on how new and emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles may offer new drive tourism opportunities in coming decades.
   Findings - Recent and near-future advances in automobile technologies, including propulsion and control, are likely to radically alter the structure and operation of drive tourism, offering new opportunities for participation in this form of tourism. The paper observes that the tourism industry must act in a proactive rather than reactive manner if it is to maximise the opportunities that will emerge "from" the coming period of climate change and technology-generated disruption.
   Social implications - Drive tourism has opened many previously remote areas for tourism bringing benefits such as employment and business opportunities. However, the growth of drive tourism may also have social costs including disruption to local social norms as people migrate into and out of these areas in search of new economic opportunities. Future developments in drive tourism may create similar disruptions.
   Originality/value - Despite the size and value of the global drive tourism market, academic investigation has been limited. The value of this paper lies in its identification of a range of issues that need further research, including the need to rethink the structure of drive tourism and how new technologies and future responses to climate change may affect this sector.

AB In this article, an adaptive control allocation scheme for a class of nonlinear vehicles is proposed. The parameter uncertainty of the effectors is considered in the design of the control allocation algorithm. A reference model is integrated in the framework to overcome the negative effects brought by the parameter uncertainty. The optimum of the solution is discussed for a class of objectives. Stability proof is given. Compared to most existing methods, the conditions to guarantee the stability of the system are relaxed, which is addressed in the theoretical analysis and the experiment. Finally, a digital simulation and an experiment based on a spacecraft simulator are implemented. The results of the simulation and the experiment validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed adaptive control allocator.

AB The formation control problem for underactuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is addressed by a distributed strategy based on virtual leader strategy. The control system takes account of disturbance induced by external environment. With the coordinate transformation, the advantage of the proposed scheme is that the control point can be any point of the ship instead of the center of gravity. By introducing bio-inspired model, the formation control problem is addressed with backstepping method. This avoids complicated computation, simplifies the control law, and smoothes the input signals. The system uniform ultimate boundness is proven by Lyapunov stability theory with Young inequality. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness and robust of the proposed controller.

AB This paper presents an exhaustive, extensive and detailed experimental assessment of different types of visual key-points in terms of robustness, stability and traceability, in images taken in marine areas densely colonized with Posidonia Oceanica (P.O.). This work has been focused mainly in two issues: a) evaluating the capacity of several image color and contrast enhancing preprocessing techniques to increase the image quality and the number of stable features, and b) finding the pair feature detector/descriptor, from a wide range of different combinations, that maximizes the number of inlier correspondences in consecutive frames or frames that close a loop (images that overlap, taken at distant time instants, from different viewpoints or even with different environmental conditions). Conclusions extracted from both evaluations will affect directly the quality of visual odometers and/or the image registration processes involved in visual SLAM approaches.

AB We consider a single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) routing problem where there are multiple depots and the vehicle is allowed to refuel at any depot. The objective of the problemis to find a path for the UAV such that each target is visited at least once by the vehicle, the fuel constraint is never violated along the path for the UAV, and the total fuel required by the UAV is a minimum. We develop an approximation algorithm for the problem, and propose fast construction and improvement heuristics to solve the same. Computational results show that solutions whose costs are on an average within 1.4% of the optimum can be obtained relatively fast for the problem involving five depots and 25 targets.
   Note to Practitioners-The motivation for this paper stems from the need to develop path planning algorithms for small UAVs with resource constraints. Small autonomous UAVs are seen as ideal platforms for many monitoring applications. Small UAVs can fly at low altitudes and can avoid obstacles or threats at low altitudes more easily. These vehicles can also be hand launched by an individual without any reliance on a specific type of terrain. Even though there are several advantages with using small platforms, they also come with other resource constraints due to their size and limited payload. This paper addresses a path planning problem involving a small UAV with fuel constraints, and presents fast and efficient algorithms for finding good feasible solutions.

AB A novel driving behaviour oriented (DBO) trajectory planner and hierarchical analytic hierarchy process (HAHP) decision maker are presented for intelligent vehicle. Since driving on structural road should satisfy actuator constraints and improve comfortableness as soon as possible, which strictly obeys traffic rules other than making traffic mess, it is rather than purely pursuing the shortest route/time. By analysis traffic rules, the DBO framework is employed to produce trajectories. To make trajectory drivable, cubic B-spline and clothoid curve are modeled to keep continuous curvature, and cubic polynomial curve is to schedule velocity profile satisfying stability and comfort. To pick out the best trajectory, HAHP decision maker is developed to evaluate the candidates. The first layer selects optimal paths considering smoothness and economy, and the second layer selects best trajectory taking smoothness, comfortableness and economy in account. Moreover, DBO rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) replanner is embedded to ensure algorithm completeness. Finally, several typical scenarios are designed to verify the real-time and reliability of the algorithm. The results illustrate that the algorithm has highly real-time and stability evaluated by Statistical Process Control method as the probability for the peak time less than 0.1s is 100% except three obstacles avoidance scenario is 59.31% in 1000 cycles. Since the planned trajectory is smooth enough and satisfy the constraints of the actuator, the mean lateral tracking error is less than 0.2m with 0.5m peak error, and the mean speed error less than 0.5km/h with 1.5km/h peak error for all scenarios.

AB Controlling and quantifying the presence of Posidonia Oceanica (P.O.) in the Mediterranean sea is crucial for the conservation of these endemic ecosystems and to underscore the negative impact of many anthropogenic activities. These activities, which include uncontrolled leisure anchoring or illegal drag fishing, directly affect the tourism and fishing industries. Nowadays, the control and quantification of P.O. is done by divers, in a slow and imprecise process achieved in successive missions of a duration limited by the capacity of the oxygen scuba tanks. This paper proposes the application of robotic and computer vision technologies to upgrade the current P.O. control methods, building large scale coverage maps using the imagery provided by an autonomous underwater vehicle endowed with a bottom-looking camera. The process includes four main steps: 1) training a classifier based on two different Gabor filter image patch descriptors and a support vector machine; 2) detecting P.O. autonomously, both on-line and off-line, in each individual image; 3) color photo-mosaicking the area explored by the vehicle to obtain a global view of the meadow structure; these mosaics are extremely useful to analyze the structure and extension of the meadow and to calculate some of the biological descriptors needed to diagnose its state; and 4) building a binary coverage map in which the classification results of areas with image overlap are fused according to four different strategies. The experiments, performed in coastal areas of Mallorca and Girona, evaluate and compare the proposed descriptors and fusion techniques, showing, in some cases, accuracies and precisions above 90% in the detection of different patterns of P.O., from video sequences at different locations, in different seasons and with different environmental conditions.

AB Purpose - Autonomous obstacle avoidance is important in unmanned surface vehicle (USV) navigation. Although the result of obstacle detection is often inaccurate because of the inherent errors of LIDAR, conventional methods typically emphasize on a single obstacle-avoidance algorithm and neglect the limitation of sensors and safety in a local region. Conventional methods also fail in seamlessly integrating local and global obstacle avoidance algorithms. This paper aims to present a cooperative manoeuvring approach including both local and global obstacle avoidance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The global algorithm used in our USV is the Artificial Potential Field-Ant Colony Optimization (APF-ACO) obstacle-avoidance algorithm, which plans a relative optimal path on the specified electronic map before the cruise of USV. The local algorithm is a multi-layer obstacle-avoidance framework based on a single LIDAR to present an efficient solution to USV path planning in the case of sensor errors and collision risks. When obstacles are within a layer, the USV uses a corresponding obstacle-avoidance algorithm. Then the USV moves towards the global direction according to fuzzy rules in the fuzzy layer.
   Findings - The presented method offers a solution for obstacle avoidance in a complex environment. The USV follows the global trajectory planed by the APF-ACO algorithm. While, the USV can bypass current obstacle in the local region based on the multi-layer method effectively. This fact was validated by simulations and field trials.
   Originality/value - The method presented in this paper takes advantage of algorithm integration that remedies errors of obstacle detection. Simulation and experiments were also conducted for performance evaluation.

AB The paper presents a new nonlinear adaptive control system for the dive-plane control of multi-input multi-output submarine models with input constraints, in the presence of external disturbances. It is assumed that all the system parameters, except the signs of the principal minors of the input matrix, are unknown. The objective is to design an adaptive control law for the tracking of reference depth and pitch angle trajectories, despite constraints on the rotation angles of the bow and stern hydroplanes. For the derivation of a singularity-free adaptation law, the decomposition of the input matrix as a product of a positive-definite symmetric matrix, a diagonal matrix, and an upper triangular matrix (termed SDU decomposition) is obtained. Then an adaptive control system is designed which accomplishes uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system trajectories. The control system includes an auxiliary dynamic system to counter the effect of control input saturation. Simulation results show that the designed adaptive law accomplishes precise depth and pitch angle trajectory control, despite symmetric and non-symmetric input constraints, parametric uncertainties and external disturbance inputs. These results also show that the designed saturating adaptive controller can accomplish certain dive-plane maneuvers using either of the hydroplanes; but the bow hydroplane can execute larger maneuvers than the stern hydroplane. The robust performance of the controller, despite non-symmetric input constraints, is useful in situations in which partial failure of actuators causes rotation of the hydroplanes in unequal ranges.

AB The automotive industry has started its transformation towards Software-Defined Vehicles. This transformation is driven by the rise of the number of vehicle features, the high complexity of these features and their constraining availability requirements which affect all the players (Original Equipment Manufacturers, Tier1 and Tier2) of the sector. In the context of this transformation, our target, from functional safety point of view, is to, inter alia, provide an easy-to-use and safety-compliant execution and development flow and simplify the development and argumentation for safety by providing a) a pre-certified execution environment with safety design patterns and best-in-class safety measures and b) processes and tooling to minimize the system integrator's effort. Therefore, in this work we propose a top-down approach where we first define a New Generation In-Vehicle Network, NGIVN, capable of fulfilling the performance (e.g. high bandwidth, low end-2-end delay), safety-related availability (e.g. Autonomous Driving / Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (AD/ADAS) up to SAE level 5) and safety requirements of modern vehicles. Also, we illustrate the advantages of this approach by deriving the functional and safety attributes of an Automotive Gateway SoC, named Elastic Gateway and destined to be part of the NGIVN. Through the deployment of the Elastic Gateway functional safety concept we demonstrate the flexibility provided by our approach with regards to the design of elements of the NGIVN.

AB Delivery vehicles that are able to actively seek and precisely locate targeted tissues using concentration gradients of signaling molecules have hardly been explored. The directed movement toward specific cell types of cargo-loaded polymeric nanomotors along a hydrogen peroxide concentration gradient (chemotaxis) is reported. Through self-assembly, bowl-shaped poly(ethylene glycol)-b-polystyrene nanomotors, or stomatocytes, were formed with platinum nanoparticles entrapped in the cavity while a model drug was encapsulated in the inner compartment. Directional movement of the stomatocytes in the presence of a fuel gradient (chemotaxis) was first demonstrated in both static and dynamic systems using glass channels and a microfluidic flow. The highly efficient response of these motors was subsequently shown by their directional and autonomous movement towards hydrogen peroxide secreting neutrophil cells.

AB In this article, a path planning system is presented, which enables the vehicle to move in a non-predefined way. Taking into account the situation detected by the sensors and on the basis of a spatial-temporal criterion, the proposed system is able to decide whether a new reference trajectory must be planned. If an update is necessary, the reference is computed taking into account the measured states (the three-dimensional (3D) positions, the flight path and heading angles, as well as the velocity), the limitations on curvature and torsion, and the next way-point that could be the final destination. As the simple geometric path planning procedure presented in this article can be implemented in real time, updated paths can easily be generated to accommodate a slowly drifting wind direction and/or wind speed.

AB Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) aim to provide various smart transportation applications which have computation-intensive tasks. The vehicles having less availability of computational re-sources offload tasks to roadside units (RSUs) for processing. Renewable energy-powered RSUs have limited energy, storage, and computational capabilities. To reduce the computation load at RSUs, vehicular fog computing is used for computation-intensive tasks. Vehicular fog computing brings the computational resources nearer to the requesting devices for reducing the latency in the request fulfillment. RSU computes the tasks either locally or offloads computation-intensive tasks to the fog server for further processing. In vehicular fog computing, one of the most important problems is to find an optimal association of RSUs with fog servers for computation offloading. A significant energy consumption occurs across RSUs in offloading computation-intensive tasks to fog servers. On the other hand, fog servers may have uneven computation load due to varying offloading rate across the road segments. The non-uniform distribution of computation load across fog servers may increase the latency in the request fulfillment. In this paper, we propose an online Federated Deep Q-learning -based Offloading technique for Vehicular fog computing (FedDOVe) which jointly optimizes the energy consumption across RSUs and load balancing across fog servers. FedDOVe is a model-free reinforcement learning approach that uses the global information for finding an optimal association between RSUs and fog servers. Simulation results show that the proposed FedDOVe reduces the energy consumption by about 47%-49% and improves load balancing by about 60%-65% as compared to other existing offloading techniques.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Locomotion is basic to all human needs. Modern-day transport has come a long way but still far away from perfection and all-around safety. Lane Detection is a concept of demarcating lanes on the roads while the vehicle is moving. Lane detection algorithm is crucial aspect in making intelligent driving systems that can be used in autonomous self-driving vehicles, road safety, and accidents prevention systems, testing and analyzing driving skills, etc. Lane detection systems using hand crafted features fails in complex scenarios like adverse weather condition, low illumination, sharp turns and occlusion. Recently, deep learning models have been used remarkable in driving assistance systems and shows a significant improvement in their performance. Although, deep learning based methods has shown significant success in lane detection using hybrid techniques, that includes FCN, CNN and RNN. But, a safe driving assistance system can be used to save lives by avoiding accidents, it is crucial to have a real-time lane detection method. We have proposed a lightweight model that can detect lane with high accuracy and low execution time. The size of model has been kept short to make it hardware deployable and perform in real-time. We have designed and trained a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for lane detection since a CNN based model is known to work best for image classification datasets. We have used multiple networks and optimization criteria as hyper-parameters and proposed the one with higher F1 score and execution time in comparison to other methods. The training part is done on Supercomputer NVIDIA DGX V100.

AB Understanding how systems with many semi-autonomous parts reach a desired target is a key question in biology (e.g., Drosophila larvae seeking food), engineering (e.g., driverless navigation), medicine (e.g., reliable movement for brain-damaged individuals), and socioeconomics (e.g., bottom-up goal-driven human organizations). Centralized systems perform better with better components. Here, we show, by contrast, that a decentralized entity is more efficient at reaching a target when its components are less capable. Our findings reproduce experimental results for a living organism, predict that autonomous vehicles may perform better with simpler components, offer a fresh explanation for why biological evolution jumped from decentralized to centralized design, suggest how efficient movement might be achieved despite damaged centralized function, and provide a formula predicting the optimum capability of a system's components so that it comes as close as possible to its target or goal.

TI See-and-Avoid Comparison of Performance in Manned and Remotely Piloted
   Aircraft
SO IEEE AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS MAGAZINE

DT Article
AB See-and-avoid is the current FAA approved method for pilots to avoid objects and other aircraft while flying in visual meteorological conditions (VMC). Although fully autonomous "sense-and-avoid" or "detect-and-avoid" systems are in development, none are currently certified. Thus existing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations are limited to case-by-case restricted airspace or require escort by manned aircraft [1,2]. Many UAVs are equipped with at least a forward-looking camera. In the transition between current technology and future fully autonomous, certified sense-and-avoid systems, it seems reasonable to require a ground-based operator to perform the see-and-avoid function.
   This discusses the flight-testing performed to establish air traffic detection ranges for low-time pilots, and for a low-cost UAV camera system. The system was evaluated to determine if it could provide the equivalent see-and-avoid performance as the tested pilots.

AB As an emergent Internet-of-Underwater-Things (IoUT) system, the underwater wireless networks (UWNs), especially the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based UWNs are considered to be future of deep-sea exploration. Instead of underwater exploring or data collection based on an independent AUV, the multi-AUVs cooperative system or the AUV flock-based UWNs perform more efficiently and accurately in some particular underwater exploring tasks. In this article, we focus on improving the scalability or controllability of the AUV flock-based UWNs and utilize the paradigm of software-defined networking (SDN) to improve the flexibility and controllability of the AUV flock-based UWNs. With the proposed SDN-enabled architecture for the AUV flock-based UWNs, the UWNs are divided into three layers, and the data transmission, synchronization, and collection among the AUVs are implemented by the proposed software-defined beacon and control frameworks. By the centralized management feature of SDN, we define the concept of AUV flock and the united control model based on the artificial potential field theory. Then, we propose an exact path planning scheme for the AUV flock, especially when potential underwater obstacles or "no-go" areas are taken into account. We will show how an SDN controller can be a director/leader for the AUV flock-based UWNs to perform an exact underwater path planning mission. The simulation results show that our proposal is efficient in managing the operation of the AUV flock, especially the proposal SDN controller-guided path planning scheme performs more efficiently than the normal-distributed path planning scheme.

TI Robust Centroid Estimation Method with the Rough and Refined Estimation

ID IMAGE; ALGORITHM
AB As the interest in probing deep space increases, it is necessary to enhance the autonomous navigation capabilities of the spacecraft. Since traditional navigation methods rely on ground-based radiometric tracking, the vehicle has a significant communication delay resulting in no ability to handle unexpected situations on time. Image-based optical navigation allows interplanetary spacecraft to determine their orbits autonomously. This paper explores how to accurately extract optical observations from the original images to perform autonomous navigation. First, we introduce a simple and efficient idea to locate valuable contours of the celestial body based on gradient variations. Then, we establish a rough estimation with RANSAC to remove the outliers around the edges. Next, we propose a refined estimation based on the hybrid genetic algorithm to precisely estimate the navigation observations. Lastly, numerous experiments have confirmed that our method achieves outstanding accuracy and robustness.

AB The paper describes the design for manufacturability of a prototype product as part of a manufacturing engineering capstone course. The product chosen was a vertically launched unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-the "Flying Eye." The Flying Eye is an autonomous parafoil surveillance platform equipped with sensors, controllers, mechanical components, and software. Once the autonomous UAV is deployed, it is designed to follow a predetermined flight path down to the ground. The design effort of the prototype device took place over a three-year period as a collaborative effort between the Aerospace Engineering and Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering departments at California Polytechnic State University. This project proved to be an excellent tool for the "project-based learning environment," which is the focus of Cal Poly's hands-on engineering programs. Details of the Flying Eye project and lessons learned during the course of this educational experience are provided.

AB The rapid development of the automobile industry has resulted in the development of many vehicles, increased traffic, and frequent accidents. The complexity of road conditions is a major contributor to the occurrence of traffic accidents. Drivers are distracted and hence unable to fully observe all road information and make optimal and timely driving decisions. This study proposes an auxiliary steering control system with force/tactile guidance (ASCFT) and its corresponding control strategy to address this problem. We combined vehicle autonomous path planning based on road condition information and the human-machine sharing control strategy, which integrated the manipulative force of the driver and a virtual guidance force on the steering wheel. Consequently, the ASCFT eliminated the mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the steering wheels in favor of a force/tactile-assisted steering structure, providing the driver with a sense of steering force based on road information. Additionally, we proposed a smooth vehicle trajectory optimization method based on the improved RRT algorithm and a path-following controller based on the forecast information to achieve auxiliary safety driving. The ASCFT's performance was confirmed through constructing a fixed-base simulator experimental platform with the ASCFT. The results revealed that at the vehicle speed of 60 km/h and a handwheel rotation of 60 & DEG;, the steering wheel was instantly released and turned back in about 3.5 s. Furthermore, predictive haptic feedback warned the driver of an upcoming obstacle.

AB A lightweight rotational object detection algorithm, R-YOLOv5, is proposed to address the limitations of traditional object detection algorithms that do not consider the diversity of vehicle scales in drone images and fail to obtain information on rotation angles. The proposed algorithm incorporated an angle prediction branch and introduced a circular smooth label (CSL) angle classification method to make it suitable for detection scenarios based on rotational boxes. A cascaded Swin Transformer block (STrB) is used to reduce computational complexity during feature fusion in the backbone network, further enhancing semantic information and global perception capabilities for small objects. A feature enhancement attention module (FEAM) is proposed to improve the utilization of detailed information through local feature self-supervision. An adaptive spatial feature fusion structure (ASFF) is introduced, which employs features extracted from different levels of the backbone network to perform multi-scale feature fusion. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy reaches 84.91% on the Drone-Vehicle dataset and 90.23% on the UCAS-AOD remote sensing dataset. The lightweight model has a parameter count of only 2.02 million and can achieve 82.6 FPS for high-resolution images, which is significantly better than existing lightweight models and more suitable for real-time detection of rotating vehicles in dense scenes, making it suitable for deployment on a large majority of embedded platforms.

AB The computational burden of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) often limits its use to short planning horizons, simple systems with slow dynamics, offline applications, or approximations of the optimal control problem. This article introduces a novel concept for NMPC, to help enable real-time integrated motion planning and control with a long planning horizon for automated vehicles. The proposed framework cascades plant models of different levels of complexity within a single planning horizon, in a single optimization problem. Leveraging the receding nature of MPC, a high-fidelity plant model in the first part of the planning horizon continuously provides a high quality of control, while the planning horizon is extended significantly at low computational cost with a lower fidelity model. Cascading the model complexity serially in a single planning horizon, rather than in different control loops, avoids infeasible reference trajectories between control loops. The concept is successfully validated with real-time motion planning and control of a full-scale automated race car, featuring combined lateral and longitudinal control and operating the vehicle near the limits of tire-road friction. The framework is deployed with open-source numerical optimization tools. In the real-world experiment, the proposed design both better approaches the optimal minimum-time solution and has a lower median solve time compared to a benchmark architecture with a single-vehicle model and a necessarily shorter planning horizon.

AB Co-operative automated driving (CAD) is a key fifth generation mobile networks (5G) use case in which autonomous vehicles communicate over vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links requiring a wide range of rate-reliability-delay performance. One key 5G enabler for CAD sidelink radio resource management (RRM) in a multi-operator environment is the virtualization of RRM at the cloud server. This, however, is challenging due to an increase in control plane delay, signaling overhead and complexity. This paper introduces an edge cloud-enabled end-to-end vehicle-to-everything (V2X) architecture to support sidelink RRM in CAD scenarios. Analyzing the problem of a cloud-based sidelink resource allocation for CAD, a utility-based multi-objective optimization problem is described and is translated to three tasks: 1) a vehicle cluster formation as a solution to the clique partitioning problem ensuring vehicle reachability on the control plane, 2) an inter-cluster resource block pool (RB-pool) allocation as a solution to a max-min fairness problem and 3) an intra-cluster resource allocation. The proposed solution framework aims to achieve high modularity, low complexity and decouples cluster formation and RB-pool assignment from the intra-cluster optimum resource allocation, which may be performed on different time scales at different edge cloud entities. Simulation results in a realistic vehicular deployment show significant gains in terms of sidelink throughput and delay while maintaining high link quality.

AB Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) have been steadily increasing the share of total trips in metropolitan areas across the world. Micro-modeling TNC operation is essential for large-scale transportation systems simulation. In this study, an agent-based approach for analyzing supply and demand aspects of ride-sourcing operation is done using POLARIS, a high-performance simulation tool. On the demand side, a mode-choice model for the agent and a vehicle-ownership model that informs this choice are developed. On the supply side, TNC vehicle-assignment strategies, pick-up and drop-off operations, and vehicle repositioning are modeled with congestion feedback, an outcome of the mesoscopic traffic simulation. Two case studies of Bloomington and Chicago in Illinois are used to study the framework's computational speed for large-scale operations and the effect of TNC fleets on a region's congestion patterns. Simulation results show that a zone-based vehicle-assignment strategy scales better than relying on matching closest vehicles to requests. For large regions like Chicago, large fleets are seen to be detrimental to congestion, especially in a future in which more travelers will use TNCs. From an operational point of view, an efficient relocation strategy is critical for large regions with concentrated demand, but not regulating repositioning can worsen empty travel and, consequently, congestion. The TNC simulation framework developed in this study is of special interest to cities and regions, since it can be used to model both demand and supply aspects for large regions at scale, and in reasonably low computational time.

AB Featured Application The model and analysis results established in this paper can be used for dynamic analyses of the autonomous driving control of articulated steering vehicles, as well as for the design of hybrid or pure electric power articulated steering vehicles. Articulated steering vehicles (ASVs), with brilliant maneuverability and efficiency, are being widely applied in mining, construction, agriculture, and forestry. However, their special structures result in them having complex dynamic characteristics, but there are no reliable models for further research. This study established a simulation platform with the dynamic model of ASVs, where the subsystems of the power train, steering systems, tires, and frames were also included. The dynamic model was validated with field test data of typical working cycles, in which the focus was on longitudinal and lateral motions and the characteristics of steering and power train systems. Then, the distribution of hydraulic and drive power was revealed using the simulation platform and test data. For a load-haul-dump (LHD) vehicle with a 6 m(3) capacity, the maximum power of the system was about 289 kW; the power of the motor accounted for the majority of the power at the beginning stage of loading, being about 74%, and then the hydraulic power dominated in the later stage of loading. During the transport stage, the power of the motor accounted for about 79% of the total power. Finally, the influence of the dynamic parameters on lateral and longitudinal motions was analyzed based on the validated platform.

AB More robust intelligent transportation systems including autonomous driving systems are in full flourish with the revolution of deep learning and the 6G wireless communication network. Vehicle Re-Identification, an indispensable branch of the intelligent transportation system, aims to retrieve specific vehicles captured from non-overlapping cameras. However, this is fundamentally challenging with the substantial inter-class similarity and substantial intra-class divergence. Embedding semantic information into vehicle re-identification task has gained ample interest, but the performance needs to be further improved. This work proposes a semantic-oriented feature coupling transformer (SOFCT) for vehicle re-identification as a solution. Specifically, the knowledge-based transformer is first embedded to model images with discriminative attributes. Second, original patches are divided into five semantic groups via semantics-patches coupling, and the feature extractions for different semantics are performed in the semantic feature extraction (SFE) transformer. Third, patch features are weighted via semantics-patches coupling in the patch feature weighting (PFW) transformer, the weighted feature is fed into subsequent encoders to excavate information. Finally, two groups of learnable semantics are embedded to automatically learn semantic features in the learnable semantic extraction (LSE) transformer. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SOFCT method surpasses other state-of-the-arts with the mAP/Rank-1 of 80.7%/96.6%, 89.8%/84.5%, 86.4%/80.9%, and 84.3%/78.7% on VeRi776 and VehicleID.

TI Robust Neurocontrol for Autonomous Dynamic Soaring

DT Article
AB The flight endurance of small unmanned aerial vehicles can be significantly extended through the exploitation of naturally occurring wind phenomena. However, due to the limited computational hardware on board such aircraft and the uncertain, stochastic nature of real-world environments, there is a need for efficient and robust strategies that exhibit generalized behavior. In addressing these objectives, recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence training algorithms and neural networks for the design of autonomous control schemes that exploit such wind phenomena. This study incorporates the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm with domain randomization to train robust neurocontrollers that can control an aircraft along sustained traveling dynamic soaring trajectories in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. This work presents the developed strategy for integrating robustness in neural network control systems, provides a method for quantifying and comparing robustness, and introduces an approach for identifying the network characteristics that contribute to the evolved robust behavior.

AB This paper proposes a novel robotic animal herding system based on a network of autonomous barking drones. The objective of such a system is to replace traditional herding methods (e.g., dogs) so that a large number (e.g., thousands) of farm animals such as sheep can be quickly collected from a sparse status and then driven to a designated location (e.g., a sheepfold). In this paper, we particularly focus on the motion control of the barking drones. To this end, a computationally efficient sliding mode based control algorithm is developed, which navigates the drones to track the moving boundary of the animals' footprint and enables the drones to avoid collisions with others. Extensive computer simulations, where the dynamics of the animals follow Reynolds' rules, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB This paper studies the spatial path following control of an autonomous underactuated airship in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, the nonlinear dynamics model, kinematics model and path following error dynamics model are given. And the control objective is formulated. Then, an adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller is designed. Besides, to overcome the disadvantage of dependence on the accurate vehicle model, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) is adopted to estimate the attack and sideslip angular velocities. In addition, when backstepping technique is uesd, the complex analytic computation of command derivative is required to be known. To handle this problem, a sliding mode differentiator is implemented to generate the command derivatives. Finally, the closed loop stability for the system is proved using Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Humankind's urbanization and luxuriousneed increase the number of vehicles day by day. Alongside the advancement of technologies, autonomous vehicles have now come into a greater existence. Due to the resource constraints for obtaining a high processing rate in performing the intelligent tasks, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has been introduced. However, a delay occurs in transferring the information due to the traits of automotive tasks. In this paper, a Federated Learning empowered computation Offloading and Resource management (FLOR) is proposed, which offloads and manages the resources with low latency. The FLOR framework operates over heterogeneous networks that include Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), 5G millimeter-wave (5G-mmWave), and 6G Vehicle-to-Vehicle (6G-V2V) communication. FLOR employs the stochastic network calculus mechanism for computing the upper bound delay of the heterogeneous communication and obtains the probability of offloading mechanism. Upon the detected probability value, the FLOR offloads the computation task to the optimal network. Further, to avoid the increase in resource cost and utilize the available resources efficiently, an effective Radio Resource Management (e-RRM) based on Federated Q-Learning is proposed in FLOR, for allocating and using the available resources optimally. The simulation result shows that the proposed FLOR framework effectively offloads the computation between the available heterogeneous networks with optimal resource allocation by 20.69% than the existing solutions.

AB This paper proposes a target classification method using radar frontal imaging measured by millimeter-wave multiple-input multiple-output (MW-MIMO) radar through deep convolutional neural networks. Autonomous vehicles must classify targets in front of the vehicle to attain better situational awareness. We use 2D sparse array radar to capture the frontal images of objects on the road, such as sedans, vans, trucks, humans, poles, and trees. The frontal image includes information regarding not only the shape of a target but also the reflection characteristics of each part of the target. The measured frontal images are classified by deep convolutional neural networks, and the classification rate yielded 87.1% for six classes and 92.6% for three classes.

AB In this era of active development of autonomous vehicles, it becomes crucial to provide driving systems with the capacity to explain their decisions. In this work, we focus on generating high-level driving explanations as the vehicle drives. We present BEEF, for BEhavior Explanation with Fusion, a deep architecture which explains the behavior of a trajectory prediction model. Supervised by annotations of human driving decisions justifications, BEEF learns to fuse features from multiple levels. Leveraging recent advances in the multi-modal fusion literature, BEEF is carefully designed to model the correlations between highlevel decisions features and mid-level perceptual features. The flexibility and efficiency of our approach are validated with extensive experiments on the HDD and BDD-X datasets.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective This study investigated drivers' subjective feelings and decision making in mixed traffic by quantifying driver's driving style and type of interaction. Background Human-driven vehicles (HVs) will share the road with automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed traffic. Previous studies focused on simulating the impacts of AVs on traffic flow, investigating car-following situations, and using simulation analysis lacking experimental tests of human drivers. Method Thirty-six drivers were classified into three driver groups (aggressive, moderate, and defensive drivers) and experienced HV-AV interaction and HV-HV interaction in a supervised web-based experiment. Drivers' subjective feelings and decision making were collected via questionnaires. Results Results revealed that aggressive and moderate drivers felt significantly more anxious, less comfortable, and were more likely to behave aggressively in HV-AV interaction than in HV-HV interaction. Aggressive drivers were also more likely to take advantage of AVs on the road. In contrast, no such differences were found for defensive drivers indicating they were not significantly influenced by the type of vehicles with which they were interacting. Conclusion Driving style and type of interaction significantly influenced drivers' subjective feelings and decision making in mixed traffic. This study brought insights into how human drivers perceive and interact with AVs and HVs on the road and how human drivers take advantage of AVs. Application This study provided a foundation for developing guidelines for mixed transportation systems to improve driver safety and user experience.

ID MODEL
AB This paper presents a hierarchical Green-Light Approach Speed (h-GLAS) strategy for controlling heavy-duty trucks traveling through urban/suburban environments, where future intersection signal phase and timing (SPaT) information is non-deterministic. Through vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, past SPaT information is sent to the vehicle and is used to forecast future predictions of the signal timing using a Gaussian Process (GP) model. The h-GLAS strategy uses the predicted SPaT information to generate an efficient desired velocity profile that navigates through intersections where the probability of a green light is maximized. This velocity profile is tracked by a convex model predictive controller (MPC) that simultaneously minimizes mechanical energy expenditure and braking effort over its prediction horizon. Downstream from the MPC, we implement a command governor (CG) that adjusts the MPC output by the minimum amount necessary to maintain safe vehicle following and ensure that the vehicle stops at all red lights. Using a proprietary medium-fidelity Simulink model provided by Volvo Trucks, we characterize the h-GLAS strategy's performance over a real suburban route, consisting of 10 actuated signalized intersections, using actual SPaT information provided by the NC Department of Traffic (DOT). Simulation results demonstrate a 30-43% reduction in fuel consumption, as compared to a baseline control strategy, which is attributable primarily to avoiding the massive energy losses associated with braking. Furthermore, we evaluate the computational efficiency of our approach by assessing average simulation execution times.

AB The rapid evolution of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) industry has significantly increased interest in UAV design with trans-domain capabilities. It is still a major challenge to achieve miniaturization and enhance the maneuverability and underwater reliability of trans-domain UAVs. In this paper, a novel bullet shape Trans-Domain Amphibious Vehicle (TDAV) is proposed which achieves free trans-domain motion and has the advantages of small size, high maneuverability and high reliability for both rotary-wing UAV and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operation. Compared with traditional amphibious machines, the TDAV design is streamlined and thus inherits the advantages of both the Bamboo Dragonfly and underwater AUVs. The proposed TDAV has a coaxial counter-propeller-tilting platform which satisfies the power and small diameter fuselage requirements, and the blades fold to reduce underwater drag and facilitate transportation. Further, a stable and efficient trans-domain attitude adjustment system is presented which effectively realizes trans-domain attitude switching. Based on the characteristics of the symmetric TDAV body, a rudder blade allocation algorithm is proposed to realize free movement in water. Finally, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to obtain suitable hierarchical fractional-order PID parameters. Both simulation and outdoor tests were performed and the results demonstrate that the proposed TDAV achieves outstanding performance in terms of lift altitude, trans-domain attitude switching time, and free trans-domain movement in both water and air.

AB Human-vehicle classification is an essential component to avoiding accidents in autonomous driving. The classification technique based on the automotive radar sensor has been paid more attention by related researchers, owing to its robustness to low-light conditions and severe weather. In the paper, we propose a hybrid support vector machine-convolutional neural network (SVM-CNN) approach to address the class-imbalance classification of vehicles and pedestrians with limited experimental radar data available. A two-stage scheme with the combination of feature-based SVM technique and deep learning-based CNN is employed. In the first stage, the modified SVM technique based on these distinct physical features is firstly used to recognize vehicles to effectively alleviate the imbalance ratio of vehicles to pedestrians in the data level. Then, the residual unclassified images will be used as inputs to the deep network for the subsequent classification, and we introduce a weighted false error function into deep network architectures to enhance the class-imbalance classification performance at the algorithm level. The proposed SVM-CNN approach takes full advantage of both the locations of underlying class in the entire Range-Doppler image and automatical local feature learning in the CNN with sliding filter bank to improve the classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed method with theF1score of0.90and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of0.99over several state-of-the-art methods with limited experimental radar data available in a 77 GHz automotive radar.

AB This paper presents a cost-based adaptive planning agent and knowledge layers that is operating at one level of a deliberative hierarchical planning system for autonomous road driving. At this level, the planning agent is responsible for developing fundamental driving maneuvers that allow a vehicle to travel safely amongst moving and stationary objects. This is facilitated through the application of knowledge to the graph creation process and the use of dynamic cost function within the incrementally created planning graph. The cost function varies to comply with particular road, regional, or event driven situations, and when coupled with the incremental graph expansion allows for the agent to implement hard and soft system constraints. Further discussion will be provided that details one of the expert systems that is implemented to provide the planning system with this knowledge in real-time. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper is presented a new scheme for autonomous navigation of a mobile robot, based on improved artificial potential fields and a genetic algorithm. In conventional artificial potential field methods, the robot is attracted by the goal position only, and rejected by several obstacles. Use of a single attraction point can lead to trap situations where the method is unable to produce the resultant force needed to avoid large obstacles. In the scheme presented here, multiple auxiliary attraction points have been used to allow the robot to avoid large, or closely spaced, obstacles. The configuration of the optimum potential field is automatically determined by a genetic algorithm. Simulation experiments performed with three different obstacle configurations, and ten different routes, showed that the scheme reported has a good performance in environments with high obstacle densities, achieving a success rate of 93 per cent.

AB The third-generation partnership project (3GPP) defined several scenarios of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks such as vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-pedestrian, and vehicle-to-infrastructure. Un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs) exploiting such scenarios for vehicular applications like vehicular-platooning, autonomous driving, and traffic management have shown improved networks' performance in UAV-V2X (U-V2X) communications. This promising performance is typically obtained by considering high directional UAV antennas. However, the UAV vibration makes UAV antennas' beam-width sensitive to UAV fluctuations which results in degrading the networks' performance. Thus, in this paper, the performance of a U-V2X network in the presence of UAV fluctuations is investigated. The UAVs are modeled using an independent homogeneous Poisson Point Process and the vehicular-nodes are modeled using an independent Poisson Line Process. To this end, the association probability and success probability of various links such as vehicular-node connected to a UAV link, vehicular-node connected to a near-by vehicular-node link, and the overall U-V2X link are derived. In addition, the effect of different network settings such as the number of vehicular-nodes, UAVs, roads, and antennas is quantified. Moreover, the spectral efficiency of a U-V2X network is evaluated. Extensive simulations revealed that V2X networks facilitate UAVs and that for less dense areas with fewer roads, buildings, and crowds; UAVs provide more reliable links for connectivity than vehicular-nodes. Furthermore, it is also revealed that UAVs provide less reliable connection for V2X networks with larger UAV antenna fluctuations.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned vehicles are currently facing many difficulties and challenges in improving safety performance when running in complex urban road traffic environments, such as low intelligence and poor comfort perfor-mance in the driving process. The real-time performance of vehicles and the comfort requirements of passengers in path planning and tracking control of unmanned vehicles have attracted more and more attentions. In this paper, in order to improve the real-time performance of the autonomous vehicle planning module and the comfort requirements of passengers that a local granular-based path planning method and tracking control based on multi -segment Bezier curve splicing and model predictive control theory are pro-posed. Especially, the maximum trajectory curvature satisfying ride comfort is regarded as an important constraint condition, and the corresponding curvature threshold is utilized to calculate the control points of Bezier curve. By using low-order interpolation curve splicing, the planning computation is reduced, and the real-time performance of planning is improved, com-pared with one-segment curve fitting method. Furthermore, the comfort performance of the planned path is reflected intuitively by the curvature information of the path. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is verified by the co-simulation platform built by MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim. The simulation results show that the path tracking effect of multi -segment Bezier curve fitting is better than that of high-order curve planning in terms of real-time performance and comfort.

AB Land use-transportation interaction models can be useful planning support systems to assess the long-term implications of emerging transportation technologies like mobility-on-demand and automated vehicles. We propose an agent-based simulation framework (SimMobility Long-Term) that uses econometrically robust behavioral models to model the potential impacts of accessibility changes in "car-lite" communities on the choice of housing-mobility bundles. Residential relocation and private mobility holding decisions are jointly considered in a sequential simulation modeling approach. Different types of market responses to the car-lite pilot are modeled through various scenarios via assumptions of changes in model parameters, and compared to a baseline where the car-lite pilot is never implemented. A comparatively vehicle-free study area with a low vacancy rate is chosen to obtain conservative estimates of policy impacts. Our findings indicate that initial awareness of the pilot is quite effective in making the study area more vehicle-free relative to the baseline. However, as market effects start impacting housing prices and bidding results, the vehicle-free gains are significantly reduced due to neighborhood gentrification. In conclusion, we highlight how land use-transportation interaction models can be used to explore market dynamics to see where market pressures matter, along with the need to align car-lite policies with market conditions regarding vacancy and car ownership rates.

AB Trolleybus transport refers to contemporary challenges related to a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases and CO2 into the atmosphere formulated by international institutions, such as the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or the European Union. Departure from fossil fuels in urban transport is one of the key challenges for the coming years. Trolleybuses are an important tool in this task, even though their importance was declining in the past. Nowadays, due to, among others, technological development, in particular the availability of high-capacity batteries, their long life and low weight, trolleybus transport is becoming popular again. The use of the existing overhead contact infrastructure of the trolleybus network and small on-board batteries allow expanding the spatial accessibility of zero-emission public transport. Thus, this reduces the social differentiation in access to environmentally friendly transport that does not emit pollutants at the place of operation. The article presents possibilities of using on-board batteries in shaping trolleybus connections with the optimal use of the existing overhead contact lines (OHL). It presents a procedure that allows for the evaluation of the extent to which the OHL should cover the routes of bus lines in order to qualify for trolleybus service in the In-Motion-Charging (IMC) technology. Analysis of the literature shows inadequate scientific studies on combining the advantages of overhead wiring and the development of on-board battery technology in popularising zero-emission transport. This article addresses the key issues related to the use of partially autonomous trolleybuses.

AB This paper presents the potential human health impacts from connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in the San Francisco, Bay Area, U.S. The study concentrates on impacts derived from CAVs' outcomes on travel demand, safety, and environmental emissions. The paper combines travel modeling practices, critical literature review, and the authors' expert inference, to quantify the human health impacts using the Integrated Transport and Health Impacts Model (ITHIM). Specifically, ITHIM estimates impact considering changes in travel demand, level of physical activity, emissions, and safety features. This study estimates a 10% increase in car travel mileage and an 11% decrease in walk/bike trip mode share at the presence of CAVs; a 70%-90% crash reduction because of safer CAVs; and significant emission reduction by several CAV-enabled mechanisms such as eco-driving (over 30% CO(2)emission reduction) and engine performance adjustment (over 20% CO(2)emission reduction). The health impact assessments show significant opportunities for road traffic injury reductions (annual saving of more than 300 deaths and 14,000 life years). However, reduced physical activity because of the mode shift to the car could cause negative health outcomes (increased annual deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by more than 30-60 and 700-900, respectively). A set of (active transport [AT] and vehicle electrification) scenarios were developed that could mitigate the potential health-related risks and evaluated their effectiveness. The results show enormous benefits from 50% increased travel-related physical activity which offset the CAV health drawbacks and generates additional benefits by preventing premature deaths and saving life years.

AB In this paper a nonlinear suboptimal stabilizing control strategy based on Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF) is synthesized and applied to a quadrotor helicopter. Sufficient conditions are obtained for this control law to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed loop system. Furthermore, a particular methodology to find a CLF candidate for nonlinear affine system is also presented, which is highly relevant because the dynamical model representing the VTOL aerial vehicles have this affine structure. Using this CLF candidate, we are able to synthesize a nonlinear stabilizing optimal control law which allows energy saving. Numerical simulations were developed for both control strategies and real time experiments have been performed using the nonlinear stabilizing control algorithm. The numerical simulations have shown a successful performance of the autonomous aerial vehicle.

AB Autonomous path planning of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) in an urban environment is a challenging task because urban environments are dynamic and have variety of obstacles, and the locations of these obstacles may not be available a priori. In this paper we develop a reactive guidance strategy for collision avoidance using bearing-only measurements. The guidance strategy can be used to avoid collision from circular obstacles and to follow straight and curved walls at safe distance. The guidance law moves a obstacle in the sensor field-of-view to a desired constant bearing angle, which causes the MAV to maintain a constant distance from the obstacle. We use sliding mode control theory to derive the guidance law, which is fast, computationally inexpensive, and guarantees collision avoidance.

TI Three-Dimensional Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm for UAV Based

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING

DT Article
AB This paper proposes an innovative and efficient three-dimensional (3D) autonomous obstacle algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which works by generating circular arc trajectories to avoid obstacles. Firstly, information on irregular obstacles is obtained by an onboard detection system; this information is then transformed into standard convex bodies, which are used to generate circular arc avoidance trajectories, and the obstacle avoidance problem is turned into a trajectory tracking strategy. Then, on the basis of the geometric relationship between a UAV and obstacle modeling, the working mechanism of the avoidance algorithm is developed. The rules of obstacle detection, avoidance direction, and the criterion of avoidance success are defined for different obstacle types. Finally, numerical simulations of different obstacle scenarios show that the proposed algorithm can avoid static and dynamic obstacles effectively and can implement obstacle avoidance missions for UAVs well.

AB In the development of autonomous driving technologies, 3-D car detection based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been recognized as a key research topic. However, the performance of LiDAR-based methods is limited by the incomplete point cloud problem caused by signal missing and object occlusion. To this end, we introduce a novel early fusion method called key supplement to tackle this challenge. Specifically, we supplement the key area, where there is a high probability of incomplete point cloud problem, by using the pseudo point cloud generated by images. In addition, we propose a method that takes full advantage of multimodality to reconstruct incomplete point cloud. The experiment results show that the performances of the examined state-of-the-art LiDAR-based methods are improved by incorporating our proposed key supplement method.

AB The Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) systems have been actively studied for the safety enhancement and commercialized for the past few years. Because the driver tends to overly rely upon active safety systems, AEB needs to be designed to reflect the real road situations such as various road slope and friction coefficient. In this study, an AEB control algorithm is proposed to compensate for the effects of the slope and the friction of road. Based on the maximum possible deceleration for the real road conditions, the minimum braking distance is described with margin parameters for AEB activation control. The deceleration controller with a feedforward term is designed to avoid the collision during AEB operation on real road conditions. The proposed algorithm is validated in simulations first and the experimental verification is performed in the various slope conditions.

AB Vanishing-point detection is an important component for the visual navigation system of an autonomous mobile robot. In this paper, we present a novel line space voting method for fast vanishing-point detection. First, the line segments are detected from the road image by the line segment detector (LSD) method according to the pixel's gradient and texture orientation computed by the Sobel operator. Then, the vanishing-point of the road is voted on by considering the points of the lines and their neighborhood spaces with weighting methods. Our algorithm is simple, fast, and easy to implement with high accuracy. It has been experimentally tested with over hundreds of structured and unstructured road images. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective and can meet the real-time requirements of navigation for autonomous mobile robots and unmanned ground vehicles.

AB In this article, the authors propose an efficient algorithm for finding a risk-averse path for use in autonomous vehicle navigation systems. When no dynamic traffic information is available, a risk-averse path can be found by a constrained A* search. The accuracy of navigation on the basis of static network data is improved by taking travel-time uncertainty into account. When dynamic traffic information in the form of broadcast traffic messages is available, rerouting is achieved by a constrained A* search, which takes congestion propagation into account. By making use of information computed at the start of the trip, the authors propose a responsive version of the constrained A* search, which reduces the on-demand response time. An experimental performance analysis of the proposed methods on grid graphs demonstrates their efficiency.

AB Seismic surveying requires placing a large number of sensors (geophones) in a grid pattern, triggering a seismic event, and recording vibration readings. The goal of the surveying is often to locate subsurface resources. Traditional seismic surveying employs human laborers for sensor placement and retrieval. The major drawbacks of surveying with human deployment are the high costs and time, and risks to humans due to explosives, terrain, and climatic conditions. We propose an autonomous, heterogeneous sensor deployment system using unmanned aerial vehicles to deploy mobile and immobile sensors. The proposed system begins to overcome some of the problems associated with traditional systems. This paper provides detailed analysis and comparison with traditional survey techniques. Hardware experiments and simulations show promise for automation reducing cost and time. Autonomous aerial systems will have a substantial contribution to make in future seismic surveys.

It considers the efficacy of this approach in modern war fighting (including in limited war-like scenarios), comparing it to the mutual assured destruction phenomenon created by atomic weaponry and the Zanryu Nipponhei ('Japanese holdout') scenario. The deterrent, immediate and long-term impacts of the non-recallable control technology are considered from a warfighting perspective. The ethical and societal implications of the development of this technology and the proverbial opening of Pandora's Box that its development represents are also considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, operating the drone to produce desired videos upon a moving object is hard to achieve. This letter proposes an autonomous aerial videography system that integrates customized shots and drone dynamics. We design a user-friendly interface for the operator to create the desired shot in real-time. The shot information is then transmitted to the kinodynamic path search process, in which a safe shooting path will be evaluated. Later, feasible regions and safe flight corridors are constructed for safety and visibility. Finally, a joint optimization is carried out to generate the trajectory of the quadrotor and the gimbal to maintain the required image composition. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. The supplementary video(1) presents the results.

The adaptation framework is implemented within the behavior-based mission-oriented operating suite-interval programming (MOOS-IvP) marine autonomy architecture and uses a new embedded high-fidelity acoustic modeling infrastructure, the generic robotic acoustic model (GRAM), to provide real-time estimates of the acoustic environment under changing environmental and situational scenarios. A set of behaviors that combine adaptation to the current acoustic environment with strategies that extend the decision horizon beyond that of typical behavior-based systems have been developed, implemented, and demonstrated in a series of field experiments and virtual experiments in a MOOS-IvP simulation.

In this study, detailed research is carried out for different control methods that can be implemented to a quadrotor which is defined as a popular example of UAVs. In order to fulfill the scenario of this study, two different optimal controllers based on Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms, are designed for a quadrotor that autonomously follows a moving platform from an arbitrary initial position and performs landing on the platform with high precision. Accordingly, the results of these controllers are presented comparatively via the simulation studies and the necessary analysis is given in order to show the efficiency of proposed controllers for the landing mission on a moving platform.

AB The backdrop to the rapidly expanding use of drones is described, including development of drone technology, followed by an overview of current civilian use, focusing on use in and around the urban environment. The inhibitors to further use are considered including technological and societal aspects. The operation and control issues are reviewed including autonomous or semi-autonomous operation. Issues of lack of regulation, safety, lack of endurance/payload, noise, inability to fly well in adverse weather are considered. Research into how these issues may be overcome is discussed and comparisons are drawn with how equivalent-sized natural flyers (bird and larger flying insects) cope within the urban environment are made. The paper concludes with an overview of possible and planned use in the urban environment.

AB The vision of the upcoming 6G technologies that have fast data rate, low latency, and ultra-dense network, draws great attentions to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication for intelligent transportation systems. There is an urgent need for distributed machine learning techniques that can take advantages of massive interconnected networks with explosive amount of heterogeneous data generated at the network edge. In this study, a two-layer federated learning model is proposed to take advantages of the distributed end-edge-cloud architecture typical in 6G environment, and to achieve a more efficient and more accurate learning while ensuring data privacy protection and reducing communication overheads. A novel multi-layer heterogeneous model selection and aggregation scheme is designed as a part of the federated learning process to better utilize the local and global contexts of individual vehicles and road side units (RSUs) in 6G supported vehicular networks. This context-aware distributed learning mechanism is then developed and applied to address intelligent object detection, which is one of the most critical challenges in modern intelligent transportation systems with autonomous vehicles. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method, which demonstrates a higher learning accuracy with better precision, recall and F1 score, outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under 6G network configuration by achieving faster convergence, and scales better with larger numbers of RSUs involved in the learning process.

AB This work addresses the formation phase of automatic platooning. The objective is to optimally control the throttle of vehicles, with a given arbitrary initial condition, such that desired ground speed and inter-vehicular spacings are reached. The steering of the vehicles is also controlled, because the vehicles should track a desired path while forming the platoon. In order to address the platoon formation problem, a cooperative strategy is formed by constructing a discrete state space model which represents the dynamics of a set of n vehicles. Once this model is set, a control method known as Interpolating Control, which aims at regulating to the origin an uncertain and/or time-varying linear discrete-time system with state and control constraints, is utilized. The performance of this control method is evaluated and compared with other approaches such as Model Predictive Control (MPC).
   Simulations are conducted which suggest that the Interpolating Control approach can be seen as an alternative to optimization-based control schemes such as Model Predictive Control, especially for problems for which finding the optimal solution requires calculations, where the Interpolating Control approach can provide a straightforward suboptimal solution.
   In the experimental part of this work, the control algorithms for the platoon formation and path tracking problems are combined, and tested in a laboratory environment, using three mobile robots equipped with wireless routers. Validation of the proposed models and control algorithms is achieved by successful experiments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lidar became an important component of the perception systems in autonomous driving. But challenges of training data acquisition and annotation made emphasized the role of the sensor to sensor domain adaptation. In this letter, we address the problem of lidar upsampling. Learning on lidar point clouds is rather a challenging task due to their irregular and sparse structure. Here we propose a method for lidar point cloud upsampling which can reconstruct fine-grained lidar scan patterns. The key idea is to utilize edge-aware dense convolutions for both feature extraction and feature expansion. Additionally applying a more accurate Sliced Wasserstein Distance facilitates learning of the fine lidar sweep structures. This in turn enables our method to employ a one-stage upsampling paradigm without the need for coarse and fine reconstruction. We conduct several experiments to evaluate our method and demonstrate that it provides better upsampling.

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
ID VISION
AB As an essential feature of autonomous road vehicles, obstacle detection must be executed on a real-time onboard platform with high accuracy. Cameras are still the most commonly used sensors in autonomous driving. Most detections using cameras are based on convolutional neural networks. In this regard, a recent teacher-student approach, called transfer learning, has been used to improve the neural network training process. This approach has only been used with a neural network acting as a teacher to the best of our knowledge. This paper proposes a novel way of improving training data based on attention transfer by getting the attention map from a human. The proposed method allows the dataset size reduction by 50%, which leads to up to a 60% decline in the training time. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can enhance the F1-score of the network by up to 10% in winter conditions.

AB Existing autonomous robot navigation systems allow robots to move from one point to another in a collision-free manner. However, when facing new environments, these systems generally require re-tuning by expert roboticists with a good understanding of the inner workings of the navigation system. In contrast, even users who are unversed in the details of robot navigation algorithms can generate desirable navigation behavior in new environments via teleoperation. In this letter, we introduce appld, Adaptive Planner Parameter Learning from Demonstration, that allows existing navigation systems to be successfully applied to new complex environments, given only a human-teleoperated demonstration of desirable navigation. appld is verified on two robots running different navigation systems in different environments. Experimental results show that appld can outperform navigation systems with the default and expert-tuned parameters, and even the human demonstrator themselves.

AB With increasing vehicle automation, drivers are likely to engage in non-driving related tasks. However, before fully autonomous vehicles can be achieved, drivers remain the fallback when automation limits are reached and/or in unexpected situations. Transition from automated to manual control could be particularly difficult for drivers who are "out-of-the-loop". To support safe and smooth control transition, we adopted the blended sonification approach in manipulating background music to convey information about the reliability level of the automation. A driving simulator study consisting of 36 participants was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of sonification feedback-three levels of system reliability was mapped to background music pitch levels-on takeover events. Participants were assigned to one of three groups that received continuous sonification feedback, intermittent sonification feedback, or no feedback about automation reliability. The proposed blended music sonification was found effective in increasing monitoring behavior and decreasing visual response times to takeover requests during automated driving. Steering control in a takeover scenario that required substantial amount of maneuvering also benefitted from having sonification feedback. There was some evidence that sonification feedback provided continuously was more effective than when it was provided intermittently, possibly related to observed differences in the associated glance patterns. In conclusion, blended sonification may be an effective approach in helping drivers stay on the loop during automated driving, although the study was limited to the choice of music examined. Our future work will investigate how best to combine automation reliability information and traffic situational information to better support situation awareness and facilitate task-switching in automated driving.

An electronic board, called AuRoRA Board, is designed and manufactured to integrate the instrumentation and the actuators already included in the commercial vehicles. AuRoRa is implemented to exchange information with such a board and an external computer (ground control station), performing as a high level Hardware-in-the-Loop platform, capable of running simulations and real experiments. In the last case it works as a ground station responsible for sending control signals to the servomotors of the aircraft. In terms of real flights, the AuRoRa Platform was already tested with the AR.Drone Parrot quadrotor and the ALIGN T-REX 450 and T-REX 600 miniature helicopters. The AuRoRa platform also has a characteristic of being a decentralized system, in terms of computer effort. It avoids overloading a single computer with the synthesis of the control signals and the online exhibition of the flight data. The user can enable such feature, and the online exhibition of the flight data start running in a second computer, using an UDP communication channel. Simulation and experimental results are run using the AuRoRa platform, some of which are presented in this paper. The most important characteristics of our proposal is the integration of modelling, control, simulation, experimentation and data display, as detailed in this manuscript.

AB Co-operative control architectures for implementation of motion plan and coordination strategies for a team of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) using different optimization techniques are presented in this paper. The paper addresses the leader-follower formation control of multiple non-holonomic AUVs where one AUV is designated as Leader and the other participating AUVs are treated as the followers. In this scenario, the leader operates according to its optimized path, while each follower is required to follow the leader accurately maintaining desired separations and orientation with respect to the leader. A communication strategy is also designed so that the AUVs can exchange information to obtain the designated waypoints that are sent from the leader following the area coverage problem. Optimization is necessary to determine the optimal path as functions of sensor nodes for control coordination of a team of AUVs satisfying the time minimization. Various optimization algorithms have been employed for control coordination and search strategies of co-operative motion control of a group of AUVs without incorporating learning and memory to evaluate the objective function. The CLONAL selection algorithm is found to be one of the best approaches to plan the formation leader motion utilizing the triangular sensor-based grid coverage technique. The efficacy of the proposed optimization approach to solve the co-operation motion of a group of AUVs is verified through MATLAB simulation studies and the results confirmed the robustness and efficiency of the proposed technique over existing search methodologies, such as Coordinate, Multi-directional, Simplex and Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation.

AB Collision risk identification is necessary for autonomous ships to recognize the risk when facing different encounter situations and make the proper collision avoidance decision. For achieving quantitative assessment of collision risk, this paper proposed a collision risk identification method based on field theory. Specifically, the method first combines the uncertainty model of ship position prediction to improve the quaternion ship domain (QSD). Then, based on the field theory and the situation of encounters, the ship risk field is constructed, which transform the ship domain overlapping index into the field energy superposition problem. The validation and superiority of this approach is examined by simulation studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can overcome some deficiencies of the conventional risk assessment methods. Moreover, the approach can effectively identify the collision risk in real time and provide a reference on furthering enhance the navigational safety for the autonomous ships. Therefore, the approach gives it a significant potential for use in collision risk identification in the future.

AB One of the most significant challenges for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is to autonomously navigate in complex environments, as the signals from the global positioning system (GPS) are subject to disturbance and interference. To improve the autonomy and availability of the UAV navigation system without GPS, we design a new autonomous navigation system and implement it for real applications in this paper, in which one integrates the inertial measurement unit (IMU), the bionic polarization sensor (BPS), and the air data system (ADS). The BPS can provide effective heading angle measurement, and the ADS is used to output information for continuous velocity and height. The combination of BPS and ADS is a solution the inertial error drift. Kalman filter is selected to estimate the error state of the integrated navigation system based on the measurements from the BPS and ADS, and then the estimation is used to correct the navigation system error in real time. The simulation and experimental results have shown that the new integrated navigation system can perform with high precision and autonomy without GPS signal.

AB There are numerous real-time and low latency application scenarios of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), such as autonomous driving. The efficient use of limited computing and communication resources to perform IoV tasks is a hot topic in current research. Many idle vehicles (IVs) are parked around driving busy vehicles (BVs) on urban roads. This paper envisions a multi-vehicle side communication and edge computing collaboration framework with all vehicles acting as edge nodes to reduce BV task computation latency and maximize the use of each vehicle's communication and computation resources. We simulate the matching and resource allocation problem between BVs and IVs. The optimization goal is to minimize the latency, and the energy consumption is comprehensively considered. For the one-to-one matching case of BVs and IV, a new low-complexity reformulation linearization method solution is proposed. To solve the one-to-many matching problem between BVs and IVs, an improved biogeography-based optimization (IBBO) algorithm is used. Finally, the performance of the proposed task offloading and allocation method is evaluated by average task execution delay, the task computation time of BVs and IVs, energy consumption, and other metrics. The results show that for one-to-one and one-to-many matching, the proposed method can effectively guarantee the latency requirements of BVs. Compared with existing methods, our method in this paper can improve task execution efficiency by 118% while reducing the average task execution latency by 54.2%.

AB Reliable estimation of the vehicle position is the main prerequisite in all autonomous mobile robotic applications. Image-scale uncertainty in correlation-based monocular visual odometry systems negatively affects the accuracy of the vehicle motion estimation. This paper presents the development of a new technique and algorithm to estimate image-scale variations due to camera height fluctuations when the vehicle is driven on uneven terrains or when the height of vehicle from ground changes as a result of changes in load or number of passengers in the vehicle. This technique depends on marking the image frames by two red laser points, as independent reference points, which have a certain distance between them. The image-scale variations can be estimated by monitoring the variations in the distance between these two reference points. The proposed technique eliminates the need for camera recalibration and the use of sensors to measure the variations of camera height from ground, such as laser range finders and acceleration sensors. The developed system uses a single downward-facing monocular camera supported by a lighting module and installed underneath the test vehicle to avoid the negative effect of directional sunlight and shadows, which can disturb the correlation. Indoor and outdoor experiments have proven the efficiency of the suggested technique in resolving image-scale uncertainty and ensuring an image-scale-invariant correlation-based matching, with only less than 5% additional computational time.

AB The persistent observation of oceanographic phenomena is nowadays hampered by technological limitations, that prevent marine robotic platforms to autonomously execute scientific surveys for extended periods of time. The propulsion and course-over-ground (COG) of wave-propelled unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) rely primarily on the forces exerted by the environment and, for this reason, ensuring an intended navigational behavior at sea is a challenging task. In this article we discuss the design and experimental validation of a gain-scheduled steering control system that governs the course of a wave-propelled USV subject to different sea surface currents. A theoretical investigation of the vehicle nonlinear dynamics identifies in a scalar scheduling variable gamma the major source of model nonlinearities due to vehicle's and ocean current velocities. The impact of such nonlinearities on the control of the course-over-ground is investigated with a quasi-linear model analysis in the frequency domain. This provides a basis for the design of a gain-scheduled steering controller, whose theoretical assumptions are supported and validated by extensive simulations and experimental results. Moreover, we show that scheduling of the autopilot gains can still be achieved despite the lack of sea current measurements onboard the USV. Finally, it is demonstrated that the navigation and course keeping performances improve significantly when the gain-scheduled controller is employed, as compared to the nominal fixed-gain autopilot.
   The presented control system is assessed with simulations and validated on a series of field experiences meant to quantify the autopilot robustness and the vehicle course-keeping capabilities.

AB This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in machine ethics, that is, considerations of how to implement ethical behaviour in robots, unmanned autonomous vehicles, or software systems. The emphasis is on covering the breadth of ethical theories being considered by implementors, as well as the implementation techniques being used. There is no consensus on which ethical theory is best suited for any particular domain, nor is there any agreement on which technique is best placed to implement a particular theory. Another unresolved problem in these implementations of ethical theories is how to objectively validate the implementations. The paper discusses the dilemmas being used as validating 'whetstones' and whether any alternative validation mechanism exists. Finally, it speculates that an intermediate step of creating domain-specific ethics might be a possible stepping stone towards creating machines that exhibit ethical behaviour.

AB In this study a fuzzy logic controller for mobile robot navigation has been designed. The designed controller deals with the uncertainty and ambiguity of the information the system receives. The technique has been used on an experimental mobile robot which uses a set of seven ultrasonic sensors to perceive the environment. The designed fuzzy controller maps the input space (information coming from ultrasonic sensors) to a safe collision-avoidance trajectory (output space) in real time. This is accomplished by an inference process based on rules (a list of IF-THEN statements) taken from a knowledge base. The technique generates satisfactory direction and velocity maneuvers of the autonomous vehicle which are used by the robot to reach its goal safely. Simulation and experimental results show the method can be used satisfactorily by wheeled mobile robots moving on unknown static terrains. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soft computing techniques are generally well suited for vehicular control, systems that are usually modeled by highly nonlinear differential equations and working in unstructured environments. To demonstrate their applicability in real-world applications, two intelligent controllers based on fuzzy logic and artificial neural network are designed for performing a wall-following task. Based on performance and flexibility considerations, the two controllers are implemented onto a reconfigurable hardware platform, namely a field-programmable gate array. As comparative studies of these two embedded hardware controllers designed for the same vehicular application are limited in literature, this research also presents an evaluation of the two controllers, comparing them in terms of hardware resource requirements, operational speeds, and trajectory tracking errors in following different predefined trajectories.

AB The unmanned surface vehicle has the characteristics of high maneuverability and flexibility. Object detection and tracking skills are required to improve the ability of unmanned surface vehicle to avoid collisions and detect targets on the surface of the water. Mean-shift algorithm is a classic target tracking algorithm, but it may fail when pixel interference and occlusion occur. This article proposes a tracking algorithm for unmanned surface vehicle based on an improved mean-shift optimization algorithm. The method uses the self-organizing feature map spatial topology to reduce the interference of the background pixels on the target object and predicts the center position of the object when the target is heavily occluded according to the extended Kalman filter. First, a self-organizing feature map model is built to classify pixels in a rectangular frame and the background pixels are extracted. Then, the method optimizes the extended Kalman filter solution process to complete the prediction and correction of the target center position and introduces a similarity function to determine the target occlusion. Finally, numerical analyses based on a ship model sailing experiment are performed with the help of OpenCV library. The experimental results validated that the proposed method significantly reduces the cumulative error in the tracking process and effectively predicts the position of the target between continuous frames when temporary occlusion occurs. The research can be used for target detection and autonomous navigation of unmanned surface vehicle.

AB This paper introduces a novel method for road target segmentation in the context of autonomous driving based on stereo disparity maps. The proposed method utilizes topological persistence threshold analysis to address the challenges of selecting appropriate thresholds. The approach involves converting stereo road images into uv-disparity maps, extracting road planes using v-disparity maps, and calculating occupancy grid maps using u-disparity maps. Persistence diagrams are then constructed by generating segmentation results under various threshold parameters. By establishing persistence boundaries in these diagrams, the most significant regions are identified, enabling the determination of robust segmentation thresholds. Experimental validation using KITTI stereo image datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, with low error rates and superior performance compared to other segmentation methods. The research holds potential for application in autonomous driving systems.

AB Underwater gliders are autonomous robots that follow a slow, see-saw path and may be deployed for months on end. Gliders have a dramatically lower payload capacity than research vessels and are thus limited to more simple instrumentation. They have the advantage, however, of being deployable for long periods of time without the high running costs of a ship. Recent years have seen development of the use of gliders to undertake acoustic surveys of biomass in the pelagic environment, highlighting their potential to fill future survey gaps. Here it is shown, using simulation of sampling, that gliders can resolve acoustic targets at greater resolutions than ships, due to their diving pattern, but that survey accuracy is strongly dependent on the speed of the target.

AB The development of high-performance, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles paired with rapid progress in vision-based perception systems herald a new era of autonomous flight systems with mission-ready capabilities. One of the key features of an autonomous UAV is a robust mid-air collision avoidance strategy. This paper proposes a vision-based in-flight collision avoidance system based on background subtraction using an embedded computing system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The pipeline of proposed in-flight collision avoidance system is as follows: (i) subtract dynamic background subtraction to remove it and to detect moving objects, (ii) denoise using morphology and binarization methods, (iii) cluster the moving objects and remove noise blobs, using Euclidean clustering, (iv) distinguish independent objects and track the movement using the Kalman filter, and (v) avoid collision, using the proposed decision-making techniques. This work focuses on the design and the demonstration of a vision-based fast-moving object detection and tracking system with decision-making capabilities to perform evasive maneuvers to replace a high-vision system such as event camera. The novelty of our method lies in the motion-compensating moving object detection framework, which accomplishes the task with background subtraction via a two-dimensional transformation approximation. Clustering and tracking algorithms process detection data to track independent objects, and stereo-camera-based distance estimation is conducted to estimate the three-dimensional trajectory, which is then used during decision-making procedures. The examination of the system is conducted with a test quadrotor UAV, and appropriate algorithm parameters for various requirements are deduced.

AB Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) have gained a great attention due to the rapid development of mobile Internet and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. On the other hand, the competition in the automotive industry has turned into an unprecedented race to who will be the first to provide the fully autonomous cars. However, the fully autonomous driving is still a bit far from deployment, and for now, they are providing automation only at a certain level and, at the same time, are offering connected services through their mobility service platforms. With Fog and Edge computing integrated in VANETs, these mobility platforms will be standardized to provide services for every car on the road, which will help VANETs to accomplish one of its main goals, the road safety. In this paper, we propose an intelligent Fuzzy-based Driver Monitoring System (FDMS) for safe driving. We present and compare two fuzzy-based systems: FDMS1 and FDMS2. To make a decision, FDMS1 considers Vehicle's Environment Temperature (VET), Noise Level (NL) and Heart Rate (HR). While, for FDMS2, we consider Respiratory Rate (RR) as a new parameter to decide Driver's Situational Awareness (DSA). We evaluate the ability of the driver to safely operate the vehicle by monitoring his condition and subsequently, based on the system output, a smart box informs the driver and provides assistance. We show through simulations and experiments the effect of the considered parameters on the determination of the driver's situation and demonstrate the actions that can be performed accordingly.

AB Reinforcement learning brings flexibility and generality for machine learning, while most of them are mathematical optimization driven approaches, and lack of cognitive and neural evidence. In order to provide a more cognitive and neural mechanisms driven foundation and validate its applicability in complex task, we develop a basal ganglia (BG) network centric reinforcement learning model. Compared to existing work on modeling BG, this paper is unique from the following perspectives: 1) the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is taken into consideration. OFC is critical in decision making because of its responsibility for reward representation and is critical in controlling the learning process, while most of the BG centric models do not include OFC; 2) to compensate the inaccurate memory of numeric values, precise encoding is proposed to enable working memory system remember important values during the learning process. The method combines vector convolution and the idea of storage by digit bit and is efficient for accurate value storage; and 3) for information coding, the Hodgkin-Huxley model is used to obtain a more biological plausible description of action potential with plenty of ionic activities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we apply the model to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous learning process in a 3-D environment. Experimental results show that our model is able to give the UAV the ability of free exploration in the environment and has comparable learning speed as the Q learning algorithm, while the major advances for our model is that it is with solid cognitive and neural basis.

ID TRACKING
AB Unmanned air systems with video capturing systems for surveillance and visual tracking of ground targets have worked relatively well when employing gimbaled cameras controlled by two or more operators: one to fly the vehicle, and one to orient the camera and visually track ground targets. However, autonomous operation to reduce operator workload and crew levels is more challenging when the camera is strapdown, or fixed to the airframe without a pan-and-tilt capability, rather than gimbaled, so that the vehicle must be steered to orient the camera field of view. Visual tracking becomes even more difficult when the target follows an unpredictable path. This paper investigates a machine learning algorithm for visual tracking of stationary and moving ground targets by unmanned air systems with nongimbaling, fixed pan-and-tilt cameras. The algorithm is based on Q learning, and the learning agent initially determines an offline control policy for vehicle orientation and flight path such that a target can be tracked in the image frame of the camera without the need for operator input. Performance of the control policy is demonstrated with simulation test case scenarios for stationary, linear, and random moving targets with changes in target speeds and trajectories. Monte Carlo results presented in the paper demonstrate that the learned policies are capable of tracking stationary and moving targets with path perturbations, provided the perturbations are small. The learned policies are robust to small changes in target trajectory; therefore, learning separate policies for every type of trajectory is not required. The approach is judged to have merit for autonomous visual tracking of both fixed and randomly moving ground targets.

AB The firefighting robot system (FFRS) comprises several autonomous robots that can be deployed to fire disasters in petrochemical complexes. For autonomous navigation, the path planner should consider the robot constraints and characteristics. Specifically, three requirements should be satisfied for a path to be suitable for the FFRS. First, the path must satisfy the maximum curvature constraint. Second, it must be smooth for robots to easily execute the trajectory. Third, it must allow reaching the target location in a specific heading. We propose a path planner that provides smooth paths, satisfy the maximum curvature constraint, and allows a suitable robot heading. The path smoother is based on the conjugate gradient descent, and three approaches are proposed for this path planner to meet all the FFRS requirements. The effectiveness of these approaches is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated by examining the generated paths. Finally, the path planner is applied to an actual robot to verify the suitability of the generated paths for the FFRS, and planning is applied to another type of robot to demonstrate the wide applicability of the proposed planner.

AB There is a need for a large-scale, real world, diverse, and context rich vehicle acceleration catalog that can be used to design, analyze, and compare various intelligent transportation systems. This paper fulfills three primary objectives. First, it provides such a catalog through the Surface Accelerations Reference, which is openly available as an interactive analytics tool as well as an open and downloadable dataset. The Surface Accelerations Reference statistically describes the driving profiles of about 3,500 individuals contributing 34 million miles of continuous driving data collected in the Second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study (SHRP 2 NDS). These profiles were created by summarizing billions of longitudinal and lateral acceleration epochs experienced by the participants. Second, this paper introduces a standardized methodology for creating such a catalog so that similar acceleration profiles can be produced for other human cohorts or automated driving systems. Finally, the data are used to analyze the effect of roadway speed category on the rates of lateral and longitudinal acceleration epochs at various thresholds. It is observed that, for the median driver, the rates of epochs are up to three orders of magnitude higher on low-speed roads as compared to high-speed roads. This catalog will facilitate intelligent vehicle system designers to compare and tune their systems for safer driving experiences. It will also allow agencies with similar data to create comparable catalogs facilitating safety and behavioral comparisons between populations.

AB This paper reports the development and experimental evaluation of a state-of-the-art model-aided inertial navigation system (MA-INS) for underwater vehicles. Together with real-time sea current estimation, the output from an experimentally validated kinetic vehicle model is integrated in the navigation system to provide velocity aiding for the INS. Additional aiding sources include ultrashort base line (USBL) acoustic positioning, pressure readings, and measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL) with bottom track. The performance of the MA-INS is evaluated on data from a field-deployed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Several scenarios are examined, including removal or dropouts of USBL and DVL. The presented results verify that with merely an addition of software and no added instrumentation, it is possible to significantly improve the precision and robustness of an INS by utilizing the physical insight provided by a kinetic vehicle model. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports the first experimental evaluation and practical application of a MA-INS for underwater vehicle navigation. The proposed approach improves underwater navigation capabilities both for systems lacking conventional velocity measurements, and for systems where the need for redundancy and integrity is important, e. g., during sensor dropouts or failures, or in case of emergency navigation. The MA-INS also represents a feasible step toward the solution to several prospective challenges in underwater navigation, including improved navigation in the midwater zone and increased level of autonomy and robustness.

AB Damage detection via drones is fundamental in infrastructure health assessment. However, object scale variation due to drones' swift movement and sparse scenes make damage detection challenging. This paper describes a multi-task framework, EnsembleDetNet, for damage detection and multi-label scene classification by leveraging object detectors and classifiers based on ensemble learning which induces diversity and strength-correlation. Further, a novel attention module that significantly improves EnsembleDetNet by about 5% is proposed via explicit ensembling of parallel and sequential channel and spatial attention maps. Extensive experiments with a public dataset and an onsite verification utilizing a micro drone indicate that EsembleDetNet outperforms stateof-the-art detectors and classifiers under variant evaluation metrics. EnsembleDetNet has the potential to become a new paradigm in infrastructure health assessment.

AB Car transport is currently undergoing three simultaneous revolutions that are co-shaping the pathway to low-carbon mobility: fleet electrification, shared mobility, and autonomous cars (ACs). So far, studies of the climate impacts have mostly focused on the revolutions in isolation, neglecting potential synergies, and using methodologies that poorly represent the long-term transition of physical systems such as the car fleet. Here, we developed a stock dynamics model and a scenario analysis for direct energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by different combinations of the revolutions in Switzerland. The largest climate change mitigation potential is provided by combining ACs with ride-sharing with rapid fleet electrifi-cation, i.e. completely phasing out new gasoline and diesel cars by 2025 and new hybrid cars by 2030. By contrast, ACs without shared mobility generate the lowest mitigation potential. Electric ACs with ride-sharing are crucial for meeting the Swiss climate goals, e.g. carbon neutrality in 2050.

AB Introduction: Automobiles carrying an autonomous emergency braking system (AEBS) are currently prevailing. While the reduction of traffic accidents is expected because of the widespread use of the system, concerns as regards many drivers using the system without proper understanding of the trigger conditions (TCs) have arisen. This research aims to grasp the degree of recognition of the AEBS TCs by a driver with a vehicle equipped with the system. Method: Using a web research company, we sent a survey sheet for screening to 9999 monitors randomly selected by gender and age group and confirmed own vehicle with an autonomous braking system ownership status. The number of answer targets was 200 for each of the four groups divided by age and gender. In this research, we developed a multivariate analysis model with the degree of understanding the AEBS TCs as the objective variable. The explanatory variables of this model were "Driver characteristics" and "Contact opportunities of information on the AEBS." Results: Using PCA's main component scores as the objective variable, two types of multiple regression models were constructed according to the AEBS TCs (do not work properly and work accidentally). The model analysis showed that gender, age, confidence in driving skill, and experience of the AEBS before purchasing are significant variables in both models. The recognition of the conditions of the "AEBS does not work properly" was influenced by the information-gathering ability and the degree of reference to various information. In contrast, the recognition of the conditions of the "AEBS work accidentally" was influenced by the interest of automobiles, such as the importance of automobile for self-expression and explanation taken up in a car magazine. Conclusions: This study clarified the driver characteristics and contact opportunities of information that have problems in recognizing the AEBS TCs. Practical Applications: Considering measures, such as public relations, utilizing this result will be meaningful in terms of road safety in the current stage, which is the transitional period of the AEBS.

AB In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to accurately position wheeled vehicles in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) deprived environments. In the absence of GNSS signals, information on the speed of the wheels of a vehicle (or other robots alike), recorded from the wheel encoder, can be used to provide continuous positioning information for the vehicle, through the integration of the vehicle's linear velocity to displacement. However, the displacement estimation from the wheel speed measurements are characterised by uncertainties, which could be manifested as wheel slips or/and changes to the tyre size or pressure, from wet and muddy road drives or tyres wearing out. As such, we exploit recent advances in deep learning to propose the Wheel Odometry neural Network (WhONet) to learn the uncertainties in the wheel speed measurements needed for correction and accurate positioning. The performance of the proposed WhONet is first evaluated on several challenging driving scenarios, such as on roundabouts, sharp cornering, hard-brake and wet roads (drifts). WhONet's performance is then further and extensively evaluated on longer-term GNSS outage scenarios of 30 s, 60 s, 120 s and 180 s duration, respectively over a total distance of 493 km. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed method is able to accurately position the vehicle with up to 93% reduction in the positioning error of its original counterpart (physics model) after any 180 s of travel.

AB Vehicle localization plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of autonomous vehicles and the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, there is insufficient effort to compare the performance and challenges of different vehicle localization algorithms. This paper aims to address this gap by analyzing the comprehensive performance of existing advanced vehicle localization techniques and discussing their challenges. Firstly, we analyze the self-localization methods based on active and passive sensors. The results show that, the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and vision-based localization techniques can reach high accuracy. However, they have high computational complexity. Only using the inertial measurement unit (IMU), global positioning system (GPS), radar, and ultrasonic sensors may not realize localization result with high accuracy. Then, we discuss V2X-based cooperative localization methods, analyze the multi-sensor based localization techniques and compare the comprehensive performance among all methods. Although the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can effectively enhance the efficiency of vision-based localization algorithms, the high computational complexity still should be considered. In addition, since the IMU, GPS, radar, and ultrasonic sensors have good performance in terms of the availability, reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, they can be used as auxiliary sensors to achieve good comprehensive performance through data fusion techniques. Finally, we propose the challenges of different techniques and look forward to future work.

AB This study compares real-traffic deceleration and cut-in scenarios, which were established as critical to automated vehicles (AVs) safety, between Japanese and German highway trajectory datasets. Both scenarios were extracted from two different traffic data previously collected in Japan with both instrumented vehicles and fixed cameras over highways (SAKURA dataset) and in Germany with drones (highD dataset). Five vehicle kinematic variables (lateral and longitudinal distances, velocities, and accelerations) were used to parameterize both scenarios and compared them between datasets using correlation and intersection objective measures and safety metrics: Time-to-Collision and Time Headway. Despite the differences in the rule of the road (e.g. speed limits left- and right-hand traffic), road design, and data sources between the two countries, data comparison results revealed significant correlations and intersections of parameters distribution for both scenarios. The Time-to-Collision significantly overlapped between countries for both scenarios. However, differences in the Time Headway indicate that the safety distance varied across both countries, suggesting that safety assessment methodologies need to be tailored to different environments and regions to ensure safety. These results highlight the potential to develop safety indicators applicable at the international level and warrant further data collection and comparative studies that support the development of harmonized, widely applicable, and region-neutral AVs safety assessment methodologies.

AB Recently, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or airship platforms to improve the performance of cellular networks has received growing interests. It is expected that the next generation cellular networks will enable the low-latency and high-reliability communications with the support of aerial-terrestrial heterogeneous networks (HetNets) composed of flying and ground base stations (BS). In addition, with the emergence of various delay-sensitive applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles), the end-to-end delay becomes a crucial quality of service (QoS) metric. However, how to design an efficient and delay-guaranteed aerial-terrestrial HetNets remains an open research challenge. In this paper, we develop an analytical approach to characterize the end-to-end delay performance of aerial-terrestrial HetNets by using network calculus. A stochastic model that takes into account the successful transmission and resource utilization in the radio access network is proposed to evaluate the delay performance within a target delay-violation probability. In addition, the effect of background traffic in the core network are carefully examined to present a tight upper bound for the end-to-end delay. Simulation results validate the proposed analysis under different network settings such as available bandwidth, the number of UAVs, and the trajectory of UAVs. Also, it is revealed that the trajectory of UAVs plays a more significant role in the delay performance compared to the number of UAVs.

AB Objective The aim of this special issue is to bring together the latest research related to driver interaction with various types of vehicle automation.
   Background Vehicle technology has undergone significant progress over the past decade, bringing new support features that can assist the driver and take on more and more of the driving responsibilities.
   Method This issue is comprised of eight articles from international research teams, focusing on different types of automation and different user populations, including driver support features through to highly automated driving systems.
   Results The papers comprising this special issue are clustered into three categories: (a) experimental studies of driver interactions with advanced vehicle technologies; (b) analysis of existing data sources; and (c) emerging human factors issues. Studies of currently available and pending systems highlight some of the human factors challenges associated with the driver-system interaction that are likely to become more prominent in the near future. Moreover, studies of more nascent concepts (i.e., those that are still a long way from production vehicles) underscore many attitudes, perceptions, and concerns that will need to be considered as these technologies progress.
   Conclusions Collectively, the papers comprising this special issue help fill some gaps in our knowledge. More importantly, they continue to help us identify and articulate some of the important and potential human factors barriers, design considerations, and research needs as these technologies become more ubiquitous.

AB This work presents an algorithm for an Aerial Sensor Network (ASN) composed of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that performs surveillance and detects the early signs of a wildfire in a given territory. The main goal is to cover a given area while prioritizing areas of higher fire hazard risk. The proposed algorithm is scalable to any number of aircraft and can use any kind of fire hazard risk map as long as it contains bounded and nonnegative values. Two different dynamical models associated with the movement of fixed-wing UAVs are proposed, tested, and compared through simulations. Lastly, we propose a workflow to size the ASN in order to maximize the probability of detection of wildfires for a particular risk profile.

AB In this letter, we investigate the ground user (GU) access control and unmanned aerial vehicle base station (UAV-BS) deployment design in a multiple UAV-BSs assisted wireless network. The objective of each GU is to maximize its own throughput, and the objective of each UAV-BS is to maximize the minimum throughput of GUs served by it. Firstly, we optimize the GU access control by game theory. The access control game is proved to be an exact potential game, and we use the best response algorithm to solve the Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we optimize the UAV-BS deployment design through convex optimization theory. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other five baselines.

AB Gravity-aided inertial navigation is a hot issue in the applications of underwater autonomous vehicle (UAV). Since the matching process is conducted with a gravity anomaly database tabulated in the form of a digital model and the resolution is 2' x 2', a filter model based on vehicle position is derived and the particularity of inertial navigation system (INS) output is employed to estimate a parameter in the system model. Meanwhile, the matching algorithm based on point mass filter (PMF) is applied and several optimal selection strategies are discussed. It is obtained that the point mass filter algorithm based on the deterministic resampling method has better practicability. The reliability and the accuracy of the algorithm are verified via simulation tests.

ID PATH; ALGORITHM
AB This study proposes a new flight route-planning technique for autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the combination of evolutionary algorithms with virtual potential fields. By combining a radial force field with a swirling force field, three-dimensional virtual potential fields are constructed for repelling infeasible UAV flight routes from threatening zones. To ensure feasibility, major flight constraints are considered when searching for the optimal flight route. This study examines both single-and multiple-obstacle cases to determine the efficiency of the proposed flight route planner. The UAV navigation method uses an offline planner in known environments and an online planner for flight route replanning when popup threats emerge. Both planners were tested under various scenarios. The results show that the proposed planner can efficiently enable the safe navigation of UAVs.

AB This paper presents a method for detecting and controlling the autonomous hovering of a miniature flying ball (MFB) based on monocular vision. A camera is employed to estimate the three-dimensional position of the vehicle relative to the ground without auxiliary sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs). An image of the ground captured by the camera mounted directly under the miniature flying ball is set as a reference. The position variations between the subsequent frames and the reference image are calculated by comparing their correspondence points. The Kalman filter is used to predict the position of the miniature flying ball to handle situations, such as a lost or wrong frame. Finally, a PID controller is designed, and the performance of the entire system is tested experimentally. The results show that the proposed method can keep the aircraft in a stable hover.

AB On the way to autonomous driving more and more advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) are devel-oped to increase safety and comfort. These functions require additional quantified information about the environment, for example information about the current road condition, which a human driver would perceive intuitively. In this paper, a road condition estimation, described by a road friction coefficient, is developed using a second order divided differences filter in combination with estimates of the time varying parameters, namely the dynamic wheel radius and the tire stiffness. Using real measurement data of commercial vehicles, the estimation algorithm is compared to a static and less complex longitudinal friction coefficient estimator. The comparison shows good results for both estimators with differences at low excitation and during cornering maneuvers.

AB State of the art sensors within a single autonomous vehicle (AV) can produce video and LIDAR data at rates greater than 30 GB/hour. Unsurprisingly, even small AV research teams can accumulate tens of terabytes of sensor data from multiple trips and multiple vehicles. AV practitioners would like to extract information about specific locations or specific situations for further study, but are often unable to. Queries over AV sensor data are different from generic analytics or spatial queries because they demand reasoning about fields of view as well as heavy computation to extract features from scenes. In this article and demo we present Vroom, a system for ad-hoc queries over AV sensor databases. Vroom combines domain specific properties of AV datasets with selective indexing and multi-query optimization to address challenges posed by AV sensor data.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB Recent advances in deep learning technology have triggered radical progress in the autonomy of ground vehicles. Marine coastal Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) that are regularly used for surveillance, monitoring, and other routine tasks can benefit from this autonomy. Long haul deep sea transportation activities are additional opportunities. These two use cases present very different terrains-the first being coastal waters-with many obstacles, structures, and human presence while the latter is mostly devoid of such obstacles. Variations in environmental conditions are common to both terrains. Robust labeled datasets mapping such terrains are crucial in improving the situational awareness that can drive autonomy. However, there are only limited such maritime datasets available and these primarily consist of optical images. Although, long wave infrared (LWIR) is a strong complement to the optical spectrum that helps in extreme light conditions, a labeled public dataset with LWIR images does not currently exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a labeled dataset of over 2900 LWIR segmented images captured in coastal maritime environment over a period of 2 years. The images are labeled using instance segmentation and classified into seven categories-sky, water, obstacle, living obstacle, bridge, self, and background. We also evaluate this dataset across three deep learning architectures (UNet, PSPNet, DeepLabv3) and provide detailed analysis of its efficacy. While the dataset focuses on the coastal terrain, it can equally help deep sea use cases. Such terrain would have less traffic, and the classifier trained on cluttered environment would be able to handle sparse scenes effectively. We share this dataset with the research community with the hope that it spurs new scene understanding capabilities in the maritime environment.

AB It is important that indoor autonomous mobile platforms have the capability of localization in general indoor environments. In this study, using multi-threaded vehicle-mounted light detection and ranging (LiDAR), we conducted indoor autonomous mobile platform localization experiments based on a point cloud conversion 2D image method with an interpolated probability distribution, performed a scan matching analysis by converting 2D images based on an interpolated probability distribution while using occupied grid maps, and introduced a multi -resolution map method to avoid falling into a local optimum. We found that the method adopted in this study achieves a higher indoor positioning accuracy and a higher matching speed with reduced computational effort while avoiding local optima. Compared with other traditional indoor positioning methods, this method has the advantages of universal applicability and robustness against signal interference and other problems.

AB Artificial potential field (APF) is widely used for obstacles avoidance of autonomous surface vessel (ASV). However, its performance is poor for the case that the ASV encounters multiple ships. The collision may happen since the APF method is only taking distance and velocity into account. To solve this problem, a collision risk assessment based approach is proposed. A fuzzy logic system is applied to assess the collision risk with distance of close point of ppproaching (DCPA) and time of close point of approaching (TCPA). The collision risk is used to modify the APF for the ASV to avoid multiple ships. A critical encounter scenario is simulated to test the proposed approach. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method overcomes the problem to help an ASV successfully avoids the ship collision.

AB Any autonomous system embedded in a dynamic and changing environment must be able to create qualitative knowledge and object structures representing aspects of its environment on the fly from raw or preprocessed sensor data in order to reason qualitatively about the environment. These structures must be managed and made accessible to deliberative and reactive functionalities which are dependent on being situationally aware of the changes in both the robotic agent's embedding and internal environment. DyKnow is a software framework which provides a set of functionalities for contextually accessing, storing, creating and processing such structures. The system is implemented and has been deployed in a deliberative/reactive architecture for an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle. The architecture itself is distributed and uses real-time CORBA as a communications infrastructure. We describe the system and show how it can be used in execution monitoring and chronicle recognition scenarios for UAV applications.

New ways of UAV application have been explored recently such as UAV-based delivery. However, most UAV systems are being utilized in a passive form such as real-time video image monitoring, filmed image ground analysis and storage. For more proactive UAV utilization, there should be higher-performance UAV and large-capacity memory than those presently utilized. Against this backdrop, this study described the general matters on proactive software platform and high-performance UAV hardware for real-time target tracking; implemented research on its design and implementation, and described its implementation method. Moreover, in its established platform, this study measured and analyzed the core-specific CPU consumption.

AB Mobile robot vision-based navigation has been the source of countless research contributions, from the domains of both vision and control. Vision is becoming more and more common in applications such as localization, automatic map construction, autonomous navigation, path following, inspection, monitoring or risky situation detection. This survey presents those pieces of work, from the nineties until nowadays, which constitute a wide progress in visual navigation techniques for land, aerial and autonomous underwater vehicles. The paper deals with two major approaches: map-based navigation and mapless navigation. Map-based navigation has been in turn subdivided in metric map-based navigation and topological map-based navigation. Our outline to mapless navigation includes reactive techniques based on qualitative characteristics extraction, appearance-based localization, optical flow, features tracking, plane ground detection/tracking, etc... The recent concept of visual sonar has also been revised.

Such systems are attractive due to their potential to increase effectiveness with reduced cost, size, and risk exposure for personnel. Realizing this vision requires better methods of assuring the security of these software-intensive systems, to prevent use of these systems from creating new risks, such as that of adversaries taking control of our systems and using them against us.
   Navy acquisition has applied Open Systems Architecture principles to improve affordability of system development, test, evaluation, and upgrade.

We use the Valentine transformation to convert a constrained optimal control problem into an unconstrained one and show uniqueness of the value function to the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. From there, we show how to approximate the solution of the initial (in)finite-horizon problem with a family of solutions that is Gamma-convergent. Optimal solutions are efficiently obtained via a solver based on Pontryagin's Principle (PP). The proposed methodology is demonstrated on the path planning problem using the full nonlinear dynamics of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) involving state constraints in 3D environments with obstacles.

AB With the wide application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in production and life, more and more attention has been paid to the autonomous track planning of UAVs. When UAV path planning algorithm is dealing with flying in an unknown complex environment, there are some problems, such as inability to dynamically plan the track and slow speed to calculate the path. This paper proposes a dynamic path planning based on an improved evolutionary optimization algorithm. The experimental results show that the evolutionary optimization algorithm based on improved t-distribution can effectively deal with the problems of high computational complexity and low search efficiency encountered in UAV dynamic track planning. It has strong robustness and can dynamically plan the appropriate track. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work the present an analysis of rally-racing driving techniques using numerical optimization. We provide empirical guidelines for executing a Trial-Barking (TB) maneuver, one of the common cornering techniques used in rally-racing. These guidelines are verified via experimental data collected from TB maneuvers performed by an expert rally driver. We show that a TB maneuver can be generated as a special case of the minimum-time cornering problem subject to specific boundary conditions. We propose simple parameterizations of the driver's steering, throttle and braking commands that lead to an alternative formulation of the optimization problem with a reduced search space. We show that the proposed parametrization of the driver's commands can reproduce TB maneuvers along a variety: of corner geometries, requiring only a small number of parameters.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the great potential to improve traffic flow because of their particular characteristics of connectivity and automation. This study aims to develop CAV control strategies based on car-following speed balance, which are defined as dynamic speed limit (DSL) strategies, and examine their performances on reducing freeway collision risks via microscopic simulations. The core idea of DSL strategy is to command the CAVs to slow down actively before reaching the bottlenecks, and form moving barriers to guide the following human driven vehicles to passively decelerate. Three DSL strategies are first developed for CAVs based on vehicle dynamics principles, and the influences of various position distribution patterns of CAVs on three strategies are compared in the one-lane scenario. Then, the DSL strategy with the best performance is selected based on simulation experiments, and a conventional variable speed limit control is used to compare the performance of our proposed methods. Finally, the DSL strategy based on Min control is tested in the two-lane, three-lane and four-lane scenarios to verify the effectiveness. Simulation results indicate that: (1) three DSL strategies based on CAVs can significantly reduce collision risks when CAVs reach a certain proportion; (2) the uniform distribution of CAVs can maximize the effect of the moving barriers; (3) DSL strategy based on Min control is negatively affected by lane-changing behaviors, but still works well in the multi-lane scenario.

TI Vehicle trajectory prediction and generation using LSTM models and GANs
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOATING CAR DATA
AB Vehicles' trajectory prediction is a topic with growing interest in recent years, as there are applications in several domains ranging from autonomous driving to traffic congestion prediction and urban planning. Predicting trajectories starting from Floating Car Data (FCD) is a complex task that comes with different challenges, namely Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) interaction, Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) interaction, multimodality, and generalizability. These challenges, especially, have not been completely explored by state-of-the-art works. In particular, multimodality and generalizability have been neglected the most, and this work attempts to fill this gap by proposing and defining new datasets, metrics, and methods to help understand and predict vehicle trajectories. We propose and compare Deep Learning models based on Long Short-Term Memory and Generative Adversarial Network architectures; in particular, our GAN-3 model can be used to generate multiple predictions in multimodal scenarios. These approaches are evaluated with our newly proposed error metrics N-ADE and N-FDE, which normalize some biases in the standard Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE) metrics. Experiments have been conducted using newly collected datasets in four large Italian cities (Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin), considering different trajectory lengths to analyze error growth over a larger number of time-steps. The results prove that, although LSTM-based models are superior in unimodal scenarios, generative models perform best in those where the effects of multimodality are higher. Space-time and geographical analysis are performed, to prove the suitability of the proposed methodology for real cases and management services.

AB We present an approach for navigating in unknown environments while, simultaneously, gathering information for inspecting underwater structures using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). To accomplish this, we first use our pipeline for mapping and planning collision-free paths online, which endows an AUV with the capability to autonomously acquire optical data in close proximity. With that information, we then propose a reconstruction pipeline to create a photo-realistic textured 3D model of the inspected area. These 3D models are also of particular interest to other fields of study in marine sciences, since they can serve as base maps for environmental monitoring, thus allowing change detection of biological communities and their environment over time. Finally, we evaluate our approach using the Sparus II, a torpedo-shaped AUV, conducting inspection missions in a challenging, real-world and natural scenario.

AB An integrated approach is needed for combining path planning for obstacle avoidance with envelop protection to ensure that a UAV is operated within its safe operational limits while maneuvering in obstacle fields. This paper presents a minimum-time approach to this problem by treating obstacle avoidance and envelope protection as inequality constraints in a state space formulation. The approach is used to study the guidance of a rotary wing UAV for aggressive maneuvering in avoiding an obstacle while staying within its operational envelope. The Nonlinear Trajectory Generator (NTG) is used as a real-time optimization solver, and load factor and rotor flapping angle are considered as limit parameters. A nonlinear simulation model of a rotary wing test bed within the Georgia Tech Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Simulation Tool (GUST) is used to evaluate the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we present an approach to autonomous robot navigation in an unknown environment. We design and integrate algorithms to reconstruct the scene, locate obstacles and do short-term field-based path planning. The scene reconstruction is done using a region matching flow algorithm to recover image deformation and structure from motion to recover depth. Obstacles are located by comparing the surface normal of the known floor with the surface normal of the scene. Our path planning method is based on electric-like fields and uses current densities that can guarantee fields without local minima and maxima which can provide solutions without the need of heuristics that plague the more traditional potential fields approaches. We implemented a modular distributed software platform (FBN) to test this approach and we ran several experiments to verify the performance with very encouraging results.

ID TRACKING
AB Visual servoing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has achieved satisfactory performance in fixed and planar motion targets. Due to highly coupled system dynamics and the sensitivity of the target image to aircraft attitude, the problem for chasing free-flying targets remains challenging. In this paper, a vision-based algorithm is designed for controlling an UAV while tracking an intruder flying arbitrarily in 3D space. Image-based visual servoing is used to design controllers that depend directly on errors in image plane. Specifically, a virtual camera approach is adopted to decouple the UAV dynamics by compensating the pitch and yaw, and an improved image error term is proposed to reduce the impact of the UAV rotation on error signals in the process of tracking, thus a simplified control design is achieved, and the stability of the visual servo system is guaranteed. Comparison and ablation experiments in both simulated and real environments are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) aided wireless communications promise to provide high-speed cost-effective wireless connectivity without needing fixed infrastructure coverage. They are a key technology enabler for sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, where a three-dimensional coverage including space, aero and terrestrial networks are to be deployed to guarantee seamless service continuity and reliability. Owing to the aerodynamic requirements, it is highly desirable to employ conformal antennas that can follow the shapes of the UAVs to reduce the extra drag and fuel consumption. To enable hundred giga-bits-per-second (Gb/s) data rates and massive connectivity for 6G networks, conformal antenna arrays featured with high gains and beam scanning/multiple beams are demanded for millimeter-wave and higher-frequency-range communications. However, new challenges exist in designing and implementing high-gain conformal arrays for UAV platforms. In this article, we overview the recent advances in conformal transmitarrays for UAV-based wireless communications, introducing new design methodologies and high-lighting new opportunities to be exploited.

AB Faults in aircraft actuators can cause serious issues in safety. Due to the autonomous nature of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), faults can lead to more serious problems in these systems. In this paper, a new active fault tolerant control (FTC) system design for an UAV is presented. The proposed design uses a neural network adaptive structure for fault detection and isolation (FDI), then, the FDI signal combined with a nonlinear dynamic inversion technique is used to compensate for the faults in the actuators. The proposed scheme detects and isolates faults in the actuators of the system in real-time without the need of controller reconfiguration in presence of faults in the actuators. The simulation results of the designed FTC system when it is applied to WVU YF-22 UAV show that the proposed design can successfully detect and isolate the faults and compensate for their effect.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE VTOL Platform; Cascade Control System; Quadrotor
AB The aim of this research is to examine the different control strategies for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The control task is formulated as an angular stabilization of the four rotor platform, and also as a tracking problem of chosen state variables. The PID algorithm has been considered in three structures in respect of the optimal control signal applied to the actuators. For better performance of the quadrotor in hover mode the cascade control system has been proposed. The simulation results of attitude control with different PID controller architectures are presented, and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control structure and theoretical expectations. Moreover, the design and the practical realization of the control architecture on the experimental aerial vehicle are described. The fast prototyping method together with Matlab/Simulink software and DAQ hardware are used for both evolution and validation of control algorithms. The capacity of the attitude stabilization system is important in the development process of more advanced functionality of autonomous flying vehicles; therefore it needs to be highlighted and taken into careful consideration.

AB Although there have been efforts to integrate Semantic Web technologies and artificial agents related AI research approaches, they remain relatively isolated from each other. Herein, we introduce a new ontology framework designed to support the knowledge representation of artificial agents' actions within the context of the actions of other autonomous agents and inspired by standard cognitive architectures. The framework consists of four parts: 1) an event ontology for information pertaining to actions and events; 2) an epistemic ontology containing facts about knowledge, beliefs, perceptions and communication; 3) an ontology concerning future intentions, desires, and aversions; and, finally, 4) a deontic ontology for modeling obligations and prohibitions which limit agents' actions. The architecture of the ontology framework is inspired by deontic cognitive event calculus as well as epistemic and deontic logic. We also describe a case study in which the proposed DCEO ontology supports autonomous vehicle navigation.

TI Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Sizes Required to Serve Different Levels of
   Demand
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Automated vehicles (AVs) promise many benefits for future mobility. One of them is a reduction of the required total vehicle fleet size, especially if AVs are used predominantly as shared vehicles. This paper presents research on this potential reduction for the greater Zurich, Switzerland, region. Fleets of shared AVs serving a predefined demand were simulated with a simulation framework introduced in the paper. Scenarios combining levels of demand for AVs with levels of supply (i.e., AV fleet sizes) were created. An important contribution of this study is the use of travel demand at highly detailed spatial and temporal resolutions that goes beyond the simplifications used in previous studies on the topic. This detailed travel demand provides a more solid basis for the ongoing discussion about the future fleet size. It was found that for a given fleet performance target (here, the target was for 95% of all transport requests to be served within 5 min), the relationship between served demand and required fleet size was nonlinear and the ratio increased as demand increased. A scale effect was detected. This effect has the important implication that for different levels of demand the fleet is used more or less efficiently. This study also found that if waiting times of up to 10 min were accepted, a reduction of up to 90% of the total vehicle fleet could be possible even without active fleet management, like vehicle redistribution. Such effects require, however, that a large enough share of the car demand be served by AVs.

AB This paper presents the results obtained in an investigation of the role of heritage in current education regulations as a vehicle for the formation of citizens. The analysis was conducted on the Spanish state education regulations and their implementation in the Autonomous Region of Andalusia corresponding to the stages of pre-primary and primary education. A qualitative, descriptive-interpretative method was used. It was based on document analyses. To this end, a system of categories was prepared, organized into subcategories, variables and descriptors. From the results, there stands out the need to continue working on incorporating heritage into the formation of global citizens. For this, it is essential to build an integrated curriculum structured on the basis of "relevant socio-environmental problems".

AB Drones have achieved great success in research and development and in many industrial fields in the last five years, and there are enormous expectations for their further utilization. It was predicted that the market size of drone technologies will rapidly expand in the near future and is expected to reach $12 billion by 2021. In such circumstances, drones have become one of the main research topics in the robotics field, and the number of studies has increased. However, there is little research in the literature that has classified the many studies related to drones and introduced research trends. This paper aims to properly classify drone studies in the robotics field and to summarize the research trends for each classification.

AB With advances in computing power, stereo vision has become an essential part of navigation applications. However, there may be instances wherein insufficient image data precludes the estimation of navigation parameters. Earlier, a novel vision-based velocity estimation method was developed by the authors, which suffered from the aforementioned drawback. In this paper, the vision-based navigation method has been integrated with a unique low-cost reduced inertial sensor system to bridge the navigation gap using one gyroscope and two accelerometers along with the inputs from wheel speed sensors. The integrated system is based on the extended Kalman filter and was tested on three trajectories with the introduction of vision data gaps. The system showed promising results for autonomous land vehicle applications.

AB Inertial and vision sensors are considered essential nowadays in terms of navigation and guidance measurements for autonomous aerial and ground vehicles. In this paper, the concept of aiding Inertial Navigation with Vision-Based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping to compensate for Inertial Navigation divergence is introduced. We describe the changes to the augmented state vector that this sensor fusion algorithm requires and show that repeated measurements of map points during certain maneuvers around or nearby a map point is crucial for constraining the Inertial Navigation position divergence and reducing the covariance of the map point position estimates. In addition, it is shown that such an integrated navigation system requires coordination between the guidance and control measurements and the vehicle task itself to achieve better navigation accuracy.

AB The velocity obstacle (VO) representation, a mathematical representation that supports separation assurance for autonomous vehicle navigation, can provide improved performance when the intended trajectory (intent) of the involved vehicles is shared among each other. This paper proposes a fully analytical closed mathematical form for VOs as an intuitive and flexible calculation method, which is able to incorporate time-varying concepts such as trajectory prediction errors. Several study cases for specific traffic situations are explored, and possibilities to extend the method to the third dimension are discussed. Analysis showed that the calculation of the VOs with intent information could show self-curve intersections when maneuvers at close distance are required. Further elimination of these intersections might be necessary for certain specific applications.

AB The road network graph is a critical component for downstream tasks in autonomous driving, such as global route planning and navigation. In the past years, road network graphs are usually annotated by human experts manually, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To annotate road network graphs effectively and efficiently, automatic algorithms for road network graph detection are demanded. Most existing methods either adopt a post-processing step on semantic segmentation maps to produce road network graphs, or propose graph-based algorithms to directly predict the graphs. However, these works suffer from hard-coded algorithms and inferior performance. To enhance the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method RNGDet, we add an instance segmentation head to better supervise the training, and enable the network to leverage multi-scale features of the backbone. Since the new proposed approach is improved from RNGDet, we name it RNGDet++. Experimental results show that our RNGDet++ outperforms baseline methods in terms of almost all evaluation metrics on two large-scale public datasets.

AB Autonomous marine vessels are expected to avoid intervessel collisions and comply with the international regulations for safe voyages. This article presents a stepwise path planning method using stream functions. The dynamic flow of fluids is used as a guidance model, where the collision avoidance in static environments is achieved by applying the circular theorem in the sink flow. We extend this method to dynamic environments by adding vortex flows in the flow field. The stream function is recursively updated to enable ``on the fly'' waypoint decisions. The vessel avoids collisions and also complies with several rules of the convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. The method is conceptually and computationally simple and convenient to tune and yet versatile to handle complex and dense marine traffic with multiple dynamic obstacles. The ship dynamics are taken into account, by using Bezier curves to generate a sufficiently smooth path with feasible curvature. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the proposed method.

AB Emergency avoidance is an aggressive maneuver with high collision risk. This paper presents an integrated decision making and motion control framework to achieve emergency avoidance in complex driving scenarios. This is realized by combining reasonable decision making based on driving primitives transition and efficient motion control under critical driving conditions. For decision making, the driving primitives including braking, lane changing, and accelerating are generalized to perform a complete emergency avoidance maneuver through the Minimum Safety Spacing analysis, which is numerically executed as a mapping function of the host vehicle's speed and the road adhesion coefficient. For motion control, the quintic polynomial-based path planning is formulated as solving a minimum lane changing duration problem. Moreover, the Linear Time-Varying Model Predictive Control combined with the Direct Yaw-moment Control is put forward to realize accurate path tracking control for emergency avoidance. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is examined under various scenarios based on comprehensive Hardware-in-Loop tests. The results show that the proposed framework can realize timely emergency avoidance with guaranteed vehicle dynamics stability based on proper decision-making and accurate path tracking control.

AB Unmanned systems (USs) including unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, and unmanned ground vehicles have great application prospects in military and civil fields, among which the process of finding feasible and optimal paths for the agents in USs is a kernel problem. Traditional path finding algorithms are hard to adequately obtain optimal paths in real-time under fast time-varying and poor communication environments. We propose an online optimal control algorithm for USs based on a one-way broadcast communication mode under the assumption of a poor communication environment, mobile targets, radars (or sonar), and missiles (or torpedoes). With the principle of receding horizon control, optimal (or suboptimal) paths are then generated by the approximation theory of neural networks and gradient optimization techniques, with low computation requirements. Also, we give a convergence analysis for our algorithm, and show that each agent can reach its target in finite time under some conditions on agents, targets and radar-missiles. Moreover, simulations demonstrate that the agents in USs can generate optimal (or suboptimal) paths in real time using our algorithm while effectively avoiding collision with other agents or detection by enemy radars.

AB This paper investigates the lateral dynamics stabilization problem for autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) through the active front steering (AFS) system. A fault-estimation-observer-based robust fuzzy fault tolerant controller is proposed to tackle actuator faults, time delay, modeling nonlinearities, and external disturbances. First, to establish a more accurate dynamics model, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling strategy is utilized to handle velocity change and parameter uncertainties. Second, to further improve the lateral stability and driving active safety of the AEV, an integrated actuator fault model comprising efficiency loss fault and additional bias fault is proposed. Meanwhile, in order to diagnose actuator additional bias fault, a fuzzy fault estimation observer (FFEO) is designed to acquire fault information online. Third, to eliminate the influence caused by integrated fault and actuator time delay, a fuzzy fault tolerant controller is constructed to improve the handling performance and driving active safety of the AEV. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated via a full-car model based on the joint simulation of carsim and matlab/simulink.

AB Multimodality fusion based on deep neural networks (DNN) is a significant method for intelligent vehicles. The special characteristics of DNN lead to the issue of AI safety and safety test. In this paper, we firstly propose a multimodality fusion framework called Integrated Multimodality Fusion Deep Neural Network (IMF-DNN), which can flexibly accomplish both object detection and end-to-end driving policy for prediction of steering angle and speed. Then, we propose a DNN safety test strategy, which systematically analyzes DNN's robustness and generalization ability in large amounts of diverse driving environment conditions. The test in this paper is based on our IMF-DNN model and the strategy can be widely used for other DNNs. Finally, the experiment analysis is performed on KITTI for object detection and the dateset DBNet for end-to-end tasks. The results show the superior accuracy of the proposed IMF-DNN model and the test strategy's potential ability to improve the robustness and generalization of autonomous vehicle deep learning model.

AB The emergence of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) promises better traffic mobility for future transportation systems. Existing research mostly focused on fully-autonomous scenarios, while the potential of CAV control at a mixed traffic intersection where human-driven vehicles (HDVs) also exist has been less explored. This paper proposes a notion of "1 + n" mixed platoon, consisting of one leading CAV and n following HDVs, and formulates a platoon-based optimal control framework for CAV control at a signalized intersection. Based on the linearized dynamics model of the "1 + n" mixed platoon, fundamental properties including stability and controllability are under rigorous theoretical analysis. Then, a constrained optimal control framework is established, aiming at improving the global traffic efficiency and fuel consumption at the intersection via direct control of the CAV. A hierarchical event-triggered algorithm is also designed for practical implementation of the optimal control method between adjacent mixed platoons when approaching the intersection. Extensive numerical simulations at multiple traffic volumes and market penetration rates validate the greater benefits of the mixed platoon based method, compared with traditional trajectory optimization methods for one single CAV.

AB Reliable and precise vehicle positioning is essential for most intelligent transportation applications as well as autonomous driving. Due to satellite signal blocking, it can be challenging to achieve continuous lane-level positioning in GPS-denied environments such as urban canyons and crossroads. In this paper, a positioning strategy utilizing ultra-wide band (UWB) and low-cost onboard sensors is proposed, aimed at tracking vehicles in typical urban scenarios (such as intersections). UWB tech offers the potential of achieving high ranging accuracy through its ability to resolve multipath and penetrate obstacles. However, not line of sight (NLOS) propagation still has a high occurrence in intricate urban intersections and may significantly deteriorate positioning accuracy. Hence, we present an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to first address the NLOS problem. Then, we propose a tightly-coupled multi sensor fusion algorithm, in which the fuzzy calibration logic (FCL) is designed and introduced to adaptively adjust the dependence on each received UWB measurement to effectively mitigate NLOS and multipath interferences. At last, the proposed strategy is evaluated through experiments. Ground test results validate that this low-cost approach has the potential to achieve accurate, reliable and continuous localization, regardless of the GPS working statue.

AB The present paper offers the chance to experimentally measure, for the first time, the internal tire strain by optical fiber sensors during the tire rolling in real operating conditions. The phenomena that take place during the tire rolling are in fact far from being completely understood. Despite several models available in the technical literature, there is not a correspondently large set of experimental observations. The paper includes the detailed description of the new multi-sensing technology for an ongoing vehicle measurement, which the research group has developed in the context of the project OPTYRE. The experimental apparatus is mainly based on the use of optical fibers with embedded Fiber Bragg Gratings sensors for the acquisition of the circumferential tire strain. Other sensors are also installed on the tire, such as a phonic wheel, a uniaxial accelerometer, and a dynamic temperature sensor. The acquired information is used as input variables in dedicated algorithms that allow the identification of key parameters, such as the dynamic contact patch, instantaneous dissipation and instantaneous grip. The OPTYRE project brings a contribution into the field of experimental grip monitoring of wheeled vehicles, with implications both on passive and active safety characteristics of cars and motorbikes.

AB This article presents a disturbance observerbased control (DOBC) framework for an autonomous underwater biomimetic vehicle-manipulator system (UBVMS) to implement underwater manipulation under unknown external disturbances. First, a fast arctangent nonsingularity terminal sliding mode controller (FANTSMC) with the inverse trigonometric function approach law is proposed to achieve the control of the UBVMS. Then, an improved high-order observer is proposed to track unknown disturbances including external disturbances and the manipulator compensation errors in a finite time. Finally, the DOBC framework, which consists of the FANTSMC and the disturbance observer, is applied to the underwater manipulation. Comparative simulations and practical underwater manipulation are conducted to validate the performance of our proposed method in disturbance tracking and underwater manipulation realization.

AB Compared with a single platform, cooperative autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer efficiency and robustness in performing complex tasks. Focusing on ground mobile targets that intermittently emit radio frequency signals, this paper presents a decentralized control architecture for multiple UAVs, equipped only with rudimentary sensors, to search, detect, and locate targets over large areas. The proposed architecture has in its core a decision logic which governs the state of operation for each UAV based on sensor readings and communicated data. To support the findings, extensive simulation results are presented, focusing primarily on two success measures that the UAVs seek to minimize: overall time to search for a group of targets and the final target localization error achieved. The results of the simulations have provided support for hardware flight tests.

AB The automotive industry is undoubtedly taking giant strides toward a paradigm shift. In essence, wireless network communication and artificial intelligence technologies are stimulating the gradual evolution of the autonomy of intelligent vehicles. This shift causes a divergence in vehicle architecture to become assembled with software-driven rather than mechanical-driven components, producing an integrated connected central unit that perceives and processes the surrounding environment, makes autonomous decisions, and controls the entire vehicle. The emerging vehicular network technologies, including vehicle-to-everything and in-vehicle channels, facilitate wired and wireless bidirectional communication within the vehicle and to other vehicles, infrastructure actors, and the Cloud to integrate it with its surrounding environment in real-time. Despite the promised potential benefits of intelligent vehicles, including improved mobility, driving safety, and economic and environmental gains, such increased network connectivity and complexity expose them to a vast attack surface. Researchers have identified a wide range of internal and external security threats due to connectivity and automation vulnerabilities within the vehicle-to-everything wireless network channels and the lack of core security measures, such as authentication, authorization, and encryption within the in-vehicle network. The dynamic nature of these vehicular networks and their ever-changing threat landscape originate new pressing security challenges that can cause severe safety destruction. In this paper, we propose BoostSec, a novel online security analytics solution that leverages advanced incremental ensemble learning to provide robust, rapid, and adaptive protection of vehicular networks against known and unknown attacks. We further augment the proposed solution with an agnostic interpretability analysis of the results. We conducted extensive experiments on three publicly available benchmark datasets representing vehicular environments in various contexts. The experimental evaluation proves that the proposed framework outpaces current baseline approaches and meets the challenges with remarkable performance, demonstrated by its (1) generalization covering a wide range of attacks across various vehicular network contexts; (2) real-time analysis reflected in efficient computation footprint; (3) adaptability against unseen attacks; (4) robustness against adversarial attacks; and (5) augmented interpretability analysis.

ID ROAD DETECTION
AB Lane detection or road detection is one of the key features of autonomous driving. In computer vision area, it is still a very challenging target since there are various types of road scenarios which require a very high robustness of the algorithm. And considering the rather high speed of the vehicles, high efficiency is also a very important requirement for practicable application of autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a deep convolution neural network based lane detection method, which consider the lane detection task as a pixel level segmentation of the lane markings. We also propose an automatic training data generating method, which can significantly reduce the effort of the training phase. Experiment proves that our method can achieve high accuracy for various road scenes in real-time.

ID SYMBOLIC MODEL CHECKING
AB Autonomous space vehicles need adaptive control strategies that can accommodate unanticipated environmental conditions. Although it is not difficult to construct alternative control strategies, a proper evaluation frequently can only be done by actually trying them out in the real physical environment. It therefore becomes imperative that any candidate control strategy be deemed safe-i.e., it won't damage any systems-prior to being tested online. How to do this has been a challenging problem.
   We propose a solution to this problem. Our approach uses an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to intrinsically evolve new control strategies. All candidate strategies will be checked for safety using formal methods. More specifically, an EA will evolve a series of finite state machines (FSMs), each of which encodes a unique control strategy. Model checking will guarantee whether all safety properties are satisfied in the strategy. A numerical example is included to illustrate our approach.

AB The operation of underwater vehicles in deep waters is a very challenging task. The use of AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) is the preferred option for underwater exploration activities. They can be autonomously navigated and controlled in real time underwater, which is only possible with precise spatio-temporal information. Navigation and positioning systems based on LBL (Long-Baseline) or USBL (Ultra-Short-Baseline) systems have their own characteristics, so the choice of system is based on the specific application scenario. However, comparative experiments on AUV navigation and positioning under both systems are rarely conducted, especially in the deep sea. This study describes navigation and positioning experiments on AUVs in deep-sea scenarios and compares the accuracy of the USBL and LBL/SINS (Strap-Down Inertial Navigation System)/DVL (Doppler Velocity Log) modes. In practice, the accuracy of the USBL positioning mode is higher when the AUV is within a 60 degrees observation range below the ship; when the AUV is far away from the ship, the positioning accuracy decreases with increasing range and observation angle, i.e., the positioning error reaches 80 m at 4000 m depth. The navigational accuracy inside and outside the datum array is high when using the LBL/SINS/DVL mode; if the AUV is far from the datum array when climbing to the surface, the LBL cannot provide accurate position calibration while the DVL fails, resulting in large deviations in the SINS results. In summary, the use of multi-sensor combination navigation schemes is beneficial, and accurate position information acquisition should be based on the demand and cost, while other factors should also be comprehensively considered; this paper proposes the use of the LBL/SINS/DVL system scheme.

AB This letter describes a system for autonomous spray painting using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), suitable for industrial applications. The work is motivated by the potential for such a system to achieve accurate and fast painting results. The PaintCopter is a quadrotor that has been custom fitted with an arm plus a spray gun on a pan-tilt mechanism. To enable long deployment times for industrial painting tasks, power and paint are delivered by lines from an external unit. The ability to paint planar surfaces, such as walls in single color, is a basic requirement for a spray painting system. But this work addresses more sophisticated operation that subsumes the basic task, including painting on three-dimensional (3D) structure, and painting of a desired texture appearance. System operation consists of (a) an offline component to capture a 3D model of the target surface, (b) an offline component to design the painted surface appearance and generate the associated robotic painting commands, and (c) a live system that carries out the spray painting. Experimental results demonstrate autonomous spray painting by the UAV, doing area fill and versatile line painting on a 3D surface.

AB We study the problem of driving a mobile sensory agent to a target whose location is specified only in terms of the distances to a set of sensor stations or beacons. The beacon positions are unknown, but the agent can continuously measure its distances to them as well as its own position. This problem has two particular applications: (1) capturing a target signal source whose distances to the beacons are measured by these beacons and broadcasted to a surveillance agent, (2) merging a single agent to an autonomous multi-agent system so that the new agent is positioned at desired distances from the existing agents. The problem is solved using an adaptive control framework integrating a parameter estimator producing beacon location estimates, and an adaptive motion control law fed by these estimates to steer the agent toward the target. For location estimation, a least-squares adaptive law is used. The motion control law aims to minimize a convex cost function with unique minimizer at the target location, and is further augmented for persistence of excitation. Stability and convergence analysis is provided, as well as simulation results demonstrating performance and transient behavior.

AB Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) play a crucial role in transportation and service tasks at hospitals, contributing to enhanced efficiency and meeting medical demands. This paper investigates the optimization problem of scheduling strategies for AMRs at smart hospitals, where the service and travel times of AMRs are stochastic. A stochastic mixed-integer programming model is formulated to minimize the total cost of the hospital by reducing the number of AMRs and travel distance while satisfying constraints such as AMR battery state of charge, AMR capacity, and time windows for medical requests. To address this objective, some properties of the solutions with time window constraints are identified. The variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is adjusted by incorporating the properties of the AMR scheduling problem to solve the model. Experimental results demonstrate that VNS generates high-quality solutions. Both enhanced efficiency and the meeting of medical demands are achieved through intelligently arranging the driving routes of AMRs for both charging and service requests, resulting in substantial cost reductions for hospitals and enhanced utilization of medical resources.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) point cloud maps are widely used in autonomous driving scenarios. These maps are usually generated by accumulating sequential LiDAR scans. When generating a map, moving objects (such as vehicles or moving pedestrians) will leave long trails on the assembled map. This is undesirable and reduces the map quality. In this paper, we propose MapCleaner, an approach that can effectively remove the moving objects from the map. MapCleaner first estimates a dense and continuous terrain surface, based on which the map point cloud is then divided into a noisy part below the terrain, the terrain, and the object part above the terrain. Next, a specifically designed moving points identification algorithm is performed on the object part to find moving objects. Experiments are performed on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Results show that the proposed MapCleaner outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on all five tested SemanticKITTI sequences. MapCleaner is a learning-free method and has few parameters to tune. It is also successfully evaluated on our own dataset collected with a different type of LiDAR.

AB The emergence of smart technologies (STs) is inducing significant transformation in logistics and transport nowadays. STs refer to the applications of artificial intelligence and data science technologies, such as machine learning, big data, to create cognitive awareness (autonomous) of an object with the support of information and communication technologies such as IoT and Blockchain. Currently, many applications of STs have demonstrated potential promise in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness in various logistics operations and transportation systems. Further, these new advanced technologies create huge modelling challenges to traditional optimization approaches and thus create rich new research opportunities for developing new optimization methodologies in the field of logistics and transport studies. As such, our aim is to conduct a comprehensive review on noteworthy contributions made in the applications of STs in improving logistics operations and transportation network efficiency. More importantly, we explore and discuss the technical difficulties encountered by researchers in the development of optimization methodologies caused by the applications of STs. Finally, we conclude the studies with suggestions for future research.

AB This paper proposes a new navigation approach for mobile agents in AGV (Autonomous Guided Vehicles)-based flexible manufacturing system. The navigation scheme combines a scheduled motion planner and a priority-based negotiation. The scheduled motion planner ensures the product transportation while choosing the appropriate resource among several. The priority policy is designed using a negotiation process to solve conflicts when agents navigate close to each other or towards the same resource. Some simulations are provided in order to show the pertinence of the proposed scheme as well as its feasibility when the number of mobile agents increases. They highlight the cooperation scheme, the appropriate selection of the resource during the navigation as well as the flexibility of the proposed approach.

AB The detail design of AUTOSUB-1 began in March 1995 following a period of sub-system development; in the mechanical field, this proved the practicability of composite pressure vessels, direct drive propulsion and fin control systems, Complete assemblies were tested in the laboratory and in the Southampton Oceanography Centre's pressure vessel, simulating, as far as was practicable, the working conditions. The integration of these and other systems into a complete vehicle was advanced sufficiently over a 15-month period that sea trials could begin. The sea trials from June 1996 to April 1997 have been the ultimate proof of reliability and performance, and have demonstrated the overall performance of the vehicle. This paper describes the mechanical aspects of the main pressure vessel, propulsion system, fin actuation, emergency abort, scientific payloads, and the subsequent performance obtained at sea.

AB A multi-scale physical process management system is presented in this paper, taking the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle system as the physical interface connecting the macro traffic system to the micro energy conversion process, with the ultimate goal of global energy management in the full temporal-spatial domain for autonomous plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. This novel method adopts a macro traffic flow model at a large time scale, in which only the initial conditions and the traffic information of key road sections are required, and a car following model at the micro scale. Furthermore, local replanning of energy management is carried out by adjusting the power threshold and the efficiency weight through the type of reinforcement learning that is closest to human learning, once a short term speed disturbance is induced by unknown disturbances in the macro traffic flow. Due to the nonlinear relationship between speed fluctuation and power fluctuation, it is necessary to map the vehicle speed and acceleration characteristics to the power characteristics, instead of directly utilizing the traffic model characterized by the speed and acceleration characteristics. The results show that novel multi-scale physical management can achieve a smaller deviation from the global optimal solution and enhanced robustness of global energy management. Additionally, close coupling between the dynamic characteristics of vehicle components and speed fluctuation ensures correct tracking of the optimized target value.

AB Emerging trends that are shaping the future of the automotive industry include electrification, autonomous driving, sharing, and connectivity, and these trends keep changing annually. Thus, the automotive industry is shifting from mechanical devices to electronic control devices, and is not moving to Internet of Things devices connected to 5G networks. Owing to the convergence of automobile-information and communication technology (ICT), the safety and convenience features of automobiles have improved significantly. However, cyberattacks that occur in the existing ICT environment and can occur in the upcoming 5G network are being replicated in the automobile environment. In a hyper-connected society where 5G networks are commercially available, automotive security is extremely important, as vehicles become the center of vehicle to everything (V2X) communication connected to everything around them. Designing, developing, and deploying information security techniques for vehicles require a systematic security-risk-assessment and management process throughout the vehicle's lifecycle. To do this, a security risk analysis (SRA) must be performed, which requires an analysis of cyber threats on automotive vehicles. In this study, we introduce a cyber kill chain-based cyberattack analysis method to create a formal vulnerability-analysis system. We can also analyze car-hacking studies that were conducted on real cars to identify the characteristics of the attack stages of existing car-hacking techniques and propose the minimum but essential measures for defense. Finally, we propose an automotive common-vulnerabilities-and-exposure system to manage and share evolving vehicle-related cyberattacks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

AB Modular transit vehicles have the potential to transform public transport systems. Indeed, the possibility of dynamically adjusting capacity by assembling and disassembling multiple modular pods allows for improved transit service flexibility and efficiency, reducing operator and passenger costs. As such, modular buses are considered particularly advantageous for settings with large variations in passenger demand, permitting en-route capacity adjustment and seamless transfers. In this context, this study presents a model for the design of a feeder bus network operated by autonomous modular buses, accounting for en-route transfers, and a Genetic Algorithm to solve the non-linear mixed integer programming problem arising. Results for a case study in Athens, Greece for an area served by three metro lines are presented and discussed.

AB In this paper, a convergent, nearest-neighbor, control protocol is suggested for agents with nontrivial dynamics. The protocol guarantees convergence to a common point in space even if each agent is restricted to communicate with a single nearest neighbor. The neighbor, however, is required to lie outside an arbitrarily small priority zone surrounding the agent. The control protocol consists of two layers interconnected in a provably correct manner. The first layer provides the guidance signal to a rendezvous point assuming that the agents have first-order dynamics. The other layer converts in a decentralized manner the guidance signal to a control signal that suits realistic agents, such as unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and holonomic agents with second-order dynamics.

AB Automated driving systems (ADSs) conceive an efficient and safe way of driving. The safety of ADSs depends on a precise object detector that needs to be upgraded continuously facing various environments. Massive annotations are required to utilize collected images of surroundings through vehicles and accommodate new environments. Auto labelling is one approach to alleviate such dilemma. To this end, we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) method which can localize objects precisely without detection annotations. This paper proposed Soft Guidance Module (SGM), Channel Erasing Module (CEM) and incorporate them into a multi-flow framework allowing the two mutually beneficial.

AB The 5G Phase-2 and beyond wireless systems will focus more on vertical applications such as autonomous driving and the Industrial Internet of Things, many of which are categorized as uRLLC. In this article, an alternative view of uRLLC is presented, information latency, measuring the distortion of information resulting from time lag of its acquisition process, which is more relevant than conventional communication latency of uRLLC in wireless networked control systems. An AI-assisted SMART is presented to address the information latency optimization challenge. Case studies of typical applications (i.e., dense platooning and intersection management) in AD are demonstrated, which show that SMART can effectively optimize information latency, and more importantly, information latency-optimized systems outperform conventional uRLLC-oriented systems significantly in terms of AD performance such as traffic efficiency, thus pointing out a new research and system design paradigm.

AB A critical element of rotorcraft autonomy is a flight control system that can operate harmoniously with the various autonomy components that depend on it. This is particularly true for highly interactive components, such as obstacle field navigation (OFN), where the vehicle navigation course is constantly being altered as more terrain information is gathered. This paper describes the development, integration, and flight-testing of an autonomous flight control system (AFCS) on a JUH-60A research helicopter. Flight-test results include control law validation using frequency domain analysis and performance characteristics using both ADS-33E mission task elements and path-error measurements. These performance data are then used to configure a risk minimizing OFN algorithm with the AFCS. The integrated OFN algorithm and AFCS are demonstrated in flight by navigating autonomously through 23 mi of mountainous terrain.

DE motion control; reinforcement learning; robustness; stability
AB This paper addresses the issue of safety in reinforcement learning (RL) with disturbances and its application in the safety-constrained motion control of autonomous robots. To tackle this problem, a robust Lyapunov value function (rLVF) is proposed. The rLVF is obtained by introducing a data-based LVF under the worst-case disturbance of the observed state. Using the rLVF, a uniformly ultimate boundedness criterion is established. This criterion is desired to ensure that the cost function, which serves as a safety criterion, ultimately converges to a range via the policy to be designed. Moreover, to mitigate the drastic variation of the rLVF caused by differences in states, a smoothing regularization of the rLVF is introduced. To train policies with safety guarantees under the worst disturbances of the observed states, an off-policy robust RL algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm is applied to motion control tasks of an autonomous vehicle and a cartpole, which involve external disturbances and variations of the model parameters, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings and the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of robustness and safety.

ID GPS/INS
AB To provide and improved remote sensing a system based on an autonomous UAV was developed. The system was based on an easily transportable helicopter platform weighing less than 14 kg. Equipped with a multi-spectral camera and autonomous system, the UAV system was capable of acquiring multi-spectral images at the desired locations and times. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) based UAV navigation system was designed and implemented using sensor fusion techniques. A ground station was designed to be the interface between a human operator and the UAV to carry out mission planning, flight command activation, and real-time flight monitoring. Based on the navigation data, and the waypoints generated by the ground station, the UAV could be automatically navigated to the desired waypoints and hover around each waypoint to collect field image data. An experiment using the UAV system to monitor turf grass glyphosate application demonstrated the system, which indicated the UAV system provides a flexible and reliable method of sensing agricultural field with high spatial and temporal resolution of image data.

TI Autonomous system for navigation and surveying in underground mines
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID ROBOT
AB This paper describes an autonomous platform for navigation and surveying within networks of tunnels, as those typically found in underground mines and caves. In this context, we propose a system allowing two modes of operation: surveying and autonomous navigation mode. In the surveying mode, a remotely located supervisor instructs the platform to move through successive sections of the network, gathering range data that is then concatenated into two- and three-dimensional survey maps of the environment. In navigation mode, the supervisor specifies high-level missions using the previously acquired survey maps. A motion planner then translates each mission into a set of consecutive navigation actions separated by natural landmarks. Mission execution consists of autonomously detecting landmarks, self-localizing, and performing the planned navigation actions. Advanced and innovative features, mostly related to surveying capabilities, navigation mode switcher, and the integrated aspect of our system, distinguish it from navigation systems used in productive mining vehicles described in the literature. The proposed system starts sharing some functionality with robotics systems devoted to exploration of abandoned mines. The full functionality of the navigation/surveying system has been proven through a series of on-site experiments in underground mines. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB To compensate for severe blockages and achieve flexible and pervasive network access, UAV-mounted RISs have recently attracted research interest. In this work, a solar-powered UAV-mounted RIS (SUR) system is investigated, where solar cells are utilized to provide supplementary propulsion power. To maximize the energy efficiency of the SUR system, the optimal joint active and passive beamforming, as well as the energy-constrained UAV trajectory, i.e., its velocity and placement, are derived in closed form. Furthermore, subject to the size, weight, and power limitations of the UAV, the number of reflecting elements, the flying and hovering time of the SUR system are also optimized. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SUR system.

AB The field of structural inspection acquired a new boost with the development of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). However, the flight time of a UAV is still short compared to the time needed to perform a complete structural inspection, and therefore the reliability of a single UAV is under question. This paper presents an algorithm that allows an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to provide continuous uninterrupted structural inspection service. MAVLink protocol is extended with a set of messages and commands that allow the implementation of the proposed algorithm. The proof-of-concept simulation and implementation on UAVs show that the algorithm is suitable for the use in multi-UAV waypoint mission dedicated to structural inspection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The paper addresses the obstacle avoidance motion planning problem for ground vehicles operating in uncertain environments. By resorting to set-theoretic ideas, a receding horizon control algorithm is proposed for robots modelled by linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to input and state constraints and disturbance effects. Sequences of inner ellipsoidal approximations of the exact one-step controllable sets are pre-computed for all the possible obstacle scenarios and then on-line exploited to determine the more adequate control action to be applied to the robot in a receding horizon fashion. The resulting framework guarantees Uniformly Ultimate Boundedness and constraints fulfilment regardless of any obstacle scenario occurrence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The deployment of fully self-sufficient, self-driving vehicles (SDVs) to city roads in a diverse range of benefit-driven concepts is on the horizon where the higher levels of automation with automated driving systems (ADSs) are being installed on vehicles. The acceptance of SDVs as safety-critical systems to successfully substitute for human drivers requires a high level of trustworthiness in numerous socio-technical aspects. By the time SDVs are available to the general public with challenges and opportunities, the trustworthiness of SDVs in rapidly changing, partially observable, multiagent, stochastic, sequential, dynamic, continuous and unknown environments shall be ensured from the perspective of the stakeholders. This paper analyses the dynamics of trust in SDVs from the perspectives of all stakeholders to result in how the "trustworthiness" of SDVs can be ensured with mitigated risks and dangers (i.e., non-maleficence) and maximised benefits (i.e., beneficence) as a holistic view of all the dimensions and dynamics of SDVs. Besides, a framework, namely, TrustFSDV, that designates a transitional roadmap with delegated responsibilities and liabilities along with the desired performance indicators, is proposed for the stakeholders to pursue in ensuring a sufficient level of trust within the concepts of human-vehicle integration and society-vehicle harmonisation - inducing the advancement of SDVs and acceptance of them by the society - while the future is being revolutionised by SDVs. To conclude the key findings in this research, i) although instant trust can be gained through hard work, it can be lost readily without forward-thinking during the life-cycle of SDVs, ii) a high level of trustworthiness cannot only be achieved by manufacturers, it requires the strict collaboration of all the stakeholders with distributed responsibilities and liabilities while moulding the requirements of the stakeholders in a system under the supervision of related disciplines, iii) the manufacturers along with the press shall not ignore the real technical limitations of the SDV technology when communicating about benefits to the potential customers, and iv) drastic steps are needed to be taken concerning ethical and legal perspectives, which is perceived as the primary concern beyond technology to build and maintain a high level of trustworthiness.

AB Machine-learning (ML) requires human-labeled "truth" data to train and test. Acquiring and labeling this data can often be the most time-consuming and expensive part of developing trained models of convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this work, we show that an automated workflow using automatically labeled synthetic data can be used to drastically reduce the time and effort required to train a machine learning algorithm for detecting buildings in aerial imagery acquired with low-flying unmanned aerial vehicles. The MSU Autonomous Vehicle Simulator (MAVS) was used in this work, and the process for integrating MAVS into an automated workflow is presented in this work, along with results for building detection with real and simulated images.

AB The foundry industry has been in a state of transformation for over 2600 years. From simple shapes carved into stone, to topologically optimized and additive manufacture facilitated creations, the evolution of metalcasting is easily witnessed. Whether this change has principally come about by man, method, material or market can be debated ad infinitum. Many futurists build their foundations on active fault lines, but the foundry industry likely faces a significant downturn. With the gradual shift from internal combustion engine personal vehicles to semi- or fully autonomous electric vehicles, competing in these shrinking markets will likely require agile and novel foundry solutions. This talk and paper will examine how foundries have been transformed primarily by shifts in the workforce, market pressures brought by global flattening (competition), environmental, health and safety and even by disaster.

This paper highlights an autonomous navigation system based on microcontrollers that can track a target using images, take three-dimensional measurements of the target, and acquire high quality images. The hardware system and an algorithm for the EOS verify the performance of the image tracking system and 3-D measurement of the target's position. 3-D position estimations for the target are solved using the mathematical relationship between the UAV and target. Although an on-board EOS can make errors in 3-D measurement, the proposed approach shows improved accuracy and confidence for 3-D target tracking using a postprocessing method.

SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA

DT Article
AB An algorithm for on-board planning of sub-orbital entry trajectories is presented. For entry vehicles with low lift-to-drag ratios and entering entry flight at sub-orbital speeds, this algorithm fills a gap left in a recently developed methodology for on-board generation of three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) entry trajectories. The algorithm developed in this paper is able to reliably generate a 3DOF feasible sub-orbital entry trajectory in a time frame compatible with on-board environment. The combination of this algorithm and an algorithm recently developed for orbital entry missions provides the capability for full-envelope autonomous adaptive entry guidance. The current algorithm is validated by extensive high fidelity simulations using a sub-orbital reusable launch vehicle model and difficult mission scenarios including failures and aborts.

AB This article investigates the autonomous exploration problem of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a fully unknown three-dimensional (3D) space, subject to the constraints of collision avoidance, energy-saving, and computation consumption. To tackle this problem, a hybrid planning algorithm named FSHP is proposed. The algorithm consists of a novel local planner designed to explore unknown space within the onboard camera's field of view (FoV) faster and less computationally. The local planner is a combination of the frontier-based and sampling-based methods, overcoming the bottlenecks of high computational time for the former and non-heuristics for the latter. Furthermore, the algorithm incorporates a global planner based on historical information to enhance performance in larger and more complex scenarios. The global planner includes a historical road map (HRM) using the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) and a historical tree (HST) based on the k-dimension (k-d) tree, built simultaneously. When no informative viewpoints are nearby, the planner replans trajectories globally to unexplored space. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the FSHP.

AB The key to autonomous navigation in unmanned systems is the ability to recognize static and moving objects in the environment and to support the task of predicting the future state of the environment, avoiding collisions, and planning. However, because the existing 3D LiDAR point-cloud moving object segmentation (MOS) convolutional neural network (CNN) models are very complex and have large computation burden, it is difficult to perform real-time processing on embedded platforms. In this paper, we propose a lightweight MOS network structure based on LiDAR point-cloud sequence range images with only 2.3 M parameters, which is 66% less than the state-of-the-art network. When running on RTX 3090 GPU, the processing time is 35.82 ms per frame and it achieves an intersection-over-union(IoU) score of 51.3% on the SemanticKITTI dataset. In addition, the proposed CNN successfully runs the FPGA platform using an NVDLA-like hardware architecture, and the system achieves efficient and accurate moving-object segmentation of LiDAR point clouds at a speed of 32 fps, meeting the real-time requirements of autonomous vehicles.

AB Advanced systems for manned and/or agricultural vehicles-such as systems for auto-steering, navigation-adding, and autonomous route planning-require new capabilities in terms of the internal representation for the autonomous system of the working space; that is, the generation of a metric map that provides by numerical parameters any operation-related entity of the working space. In this paper, a real-time approach was developed for the generation of the field metric map, based on a row generation method (polygons-based geometry). The approach can deal with fields with or without in-field obstacles, where the generated field-work tracks can be either straight or curved. The functionality of the approach was demonstrated on 12 fields with different number of obstacles ranging from one to six. The test results showed that the computational times were in the range of 0.26-24.51 s. The presented tool brings a number of advancements on the process of generating a metric map for arable farming field operations, including the real-time generation feature, the potential to deal with multiple-obstacle areas, and the reduction in the overlapped area.

AB Ship collision avoidance is highly dependent upon seamanship and rules. When ship collision risk exists, proper collision avoidance actions must be taken according to the correct encounter situation and determined stage. All autonomous collision avoidance (ACA) operations in the future must comply with given rules and seamanship practices, which make the quantitative analysis of them prerequisites for ACA. This study presents a novel quantitative analysis system for the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG) Rules and Seamanship. The proposed system consists of three parts: an encounter situation discrimination model based on the mutually relative bearing of the "target ship" (TS) and "own ship" (OS); a stage discrimination model representing the extent of collision risk per different domain models for every potential situation and a model to determine collision avoidance action per COLREG, seamanship, and ship maneuverability information was established accordingly. The collision avoidance plans appropriate for different situations and stages are generated based on the rules, seamanship, and rudder steering direction judgments. A simulation scenario was utilized to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the system.

TI Novel Informative Autonomous Exploration Strategy With Uniform Sampling
   for Quadrotors
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous exploration; hierarchical information gain; quadrotor;
   uniform sampling
ID AERIAL VEHICLES; MAP
AB In this article, a novel informative autonomous exploration strategy with uniform sampling is proposed to efficiently reduce the unknown volume of 3-D environments and provide an accurate truncated-signed-distance-function-based reconstruction for quadrotors. Different from existing methods, the proposed method locally samples candidate viewpoints uniformly and achieves a global coverage efficiently by backtracking history nodes when there is no unmapped space near the quadrotor. Specifically, by sampling viewpoints with a fixed radius and assigning priority, the best one is selected to which a collision-free path will be planned. Then, a history list is designed to store the executed nodes, which is backtracked to find the unmapped space, resulting in a complete exploration of the environment. In addition, a hierarchical information gain is proposed to balance the space exploration efficiency and reconstruction accuracy by considering the uncertainty of the surface and volume of the unknown space. Comparative experiments in simulation show that the proposed method outperforms the sampling-based state-of-the-art method in terms of both the exploration time and reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is further evaluated in a real-world experiment.

AB This paper presents an autonomous methodology for a low-cost commercial AR.Drone 2.0 in partly unknown indoor flight using only on-board visual and internal sensing. Novelty lies in: (i) the development of a position estimation method using sensor fusion in a structured environment. This localization method presents how to get the UAV localization states (position and orientation), through a sensor fusion scheme, dealing with data provided by an optical sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Such a data fusion scheme takes also in to account the time delay present in the camera signal due to the communication protocols; (ii) improved potential field method which is capable of performing obstacle avoiding in an unknown environment and solving the non reachable goal problem; and (iii) the design and implementation of an optimal proportional - integral - derivative (PID) controller based on a novel multi-objective particle swarm optimization with an accelerated update methodology tracking such reference trajectories, thus characterizing a cascade controller. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB This paper presents a method for online trajectory planning in known environments. The proposed algorithm is a fusion of sampling-based techniques and model-based optimization via quadratic programming. The former is used to efficiently generate an obstacle-free path while the latter takes into account the robot dynamical constraints to generate a time-dependent trajectory. The main contribution of this work lies on the formulation of a convex optimization problem over the generated obstacle-free path that is guaranteed to be feasible. Thus, in contrast with previously proposed methods, iterative formulations are not required. The proposed method has been compared with state-of-the-art approaches showing a significant improvement in success rate and computation time. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach for online planning, the proposed method was applied to the fluid autonomous navigation of a quadcopter in multiple environments consisting of up to 200 obstacles. The scenarios hereinafter presented are some of the most densely cluttered experiments for online planning and navigation reported to date.

AB This article presents an industrial application of underwater robotics for visual inspection of the seabed. The system consists of an underwater robot to acquire visual images at a very short distance (1-2 meters) from the surface to be inspected and an underwater localization system installed in a boat or in a mooring buoy. This system estimates the robot absolute position during the inspection in Earth coordinates using a USBL acoustic locator, an inertial navigation system (INS) and a GPS. Moreover, the robot has its own navigation system onboard, based on EKF, which uses a velocity sensor based on Doppler effect and an INS with a fiber optic gyroscope (FOG). The control architecture of the robot allows the inspection to be in teleoperation, semi-autonomous or autonomous mode. The robot can perform the inspection in 2D vertical or horizontal surfaces. Once the images and all navigation data have been acquired, an offline process is executed for data fusion, and the processing of the images ends up with a 2D georeferenced image mosaic from the inspected area. The paper details the developed technologies and describes a campaign in the Mequinenza reservoir to detect zebra mussel populations.

AB This paper models and analyzes tier-captive autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems. While previous models assume sequential commissioning of the lift and vehicles, we propose a parallel processing policy for the system, under which an arrival transaction can request the lift and the vehicle simultaneously. To investigate the performance of this policy, we formulate a fork-join queueing network in which an arrival transaction will be split into a horizontal movement task served by the vehicle and a vertical movement task served by the lift. We develop an approximation method based on decomposition of the fork-join queueing network to estimate the system performance. We build simulation models to validate the effectiveness of analytical models. The results show that the fork-join queueing network is accurate in estimating the system performance under the parallel processing policy. Numerical experiments and a real case are carried out to compare the system response time of retrieval transactions under parallel and sequential processing policies. The results show that, in systems with less than 10 tiers, the parallel processing policy outperforms the sequential processing policy by at least 5.51 percent. The advantage of parallel processing policy is decreasing with the rack height and the aisle length. In systems with more than 10 tiers and a length to height ratio larger than 7, we can find a critical retrieval transaction arrival rate, below which the parallel processing policy outperforms the sequential processing policy.

TI A Function Area Division Approach for Autonomous Transportation System
   Based on Text Similarity
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ARCHITECTURE
AB Along with emerging technologies and increasing demands, autonomation has become a significant trend in current transportation systems. Within this context, the autonomous transportation system (ATS) framework hinges on functions that serve as fundamental units to support its operation. Recognizing the divisions among these function areas can enhance our understanding of their meanings and interrelationships. This study introduces a method for dividing function areas within the ATS framework, grounded in text similarity, to mitigate reliance on subjective experience. Precisely, this method quantifies the similarity between functions based on their textual descriptions, and implements hierarchical clustering to delineate them into distinct function areas. To validate the effectiveness of this proposed method, a case study analyzing a vehicle automatic driving scenario was conducted. The results demonstrate that our approach can efficiently divide function areas, producing clustering outcomes that possess superior accuracy and purity when juxtaposed with reference classifications. Consequently, this method has the potential to facilitate the formulation of function areas within ATS, thereby supporting the autonomous operation and construction of ATS. Moreover, its applicability extends beyond ATS, showing promise for other clustering problems that involve multiple texts, such as in text classification.

AB Connectivity between ground vehicles can be utilized and expanded to include aerial vehicles for coordinated missions. Using Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies, a communication link can be established between Connected and Autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs). Hardware implementation and testing of a ground-to-air communication link are crucial for real-life applications. In this paper, the V2X communication and coordinated mission of a CAV & UAV are presented. Four methods were utilized to establish communication between the hardware and software components, namely Dedicated Short Range communication (DSRC), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), 4G internet-based WebSocket and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). These communication links were used together for a real-life use case scenario called Quick Clear demonstration. In this scenario, the first aim was to send the accident location information from the CAV to the UAV through DSRC communication. On the UAV side, the wired connection between the DSRC modem and Raspberry Pi companion computer was established through UDP to get the accident location from CAV to the companion computer. Raspberry Pi first connected to a traffic contingency management system (CMP) through TCP to send CAV and UAV location, as well as the accident location, information to the CMP. Raspberry Pi also utilized WebSocket communication to connect to a web server to send photos that were taken by the camera that was mounted on the UAV. The Quick Clear demonstration scenario was tested for both a stationary test and dynamic flight cases. The latency results show satisfactory performance in the data transfer speed between test components with UDP having the least latency. The package drop percentage analysis shows that the DSRC communication showed the best performance among the four methods studied here. All in all, the outcome of this experimentation study shows that this communication structure can be utilized for real-life scenarios for successful implementation.

AB Swarm-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications require a large number of UAVs to be deployed across a region to work cooperatively. To operate a large number of unattended UAVs in hostile environments, it is critical to secure UAV-BS (base station) communications. UAV authentication based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) has recently emerged as a potential solution for overcoming adversarial attacks. The performance of PUF-based authentication protocols is strongly influenced by various factors, including the time required to generate the topology, the number of bottleneck connections, and the network's traffic load. This article investigates how the authentication time for a UAV swarm is affected by various factors such as the type of topology, number of UAVs in the swarm and the number of parallel connections.

AB Flying insects are being studied these days as if they were agile micro air vehicles fitted with smart sensors, requiring very few brain resources. The findings obtained on these natural fliers have proved to be extremely valuable when it comes to designing compact low-weight artificial optical sensors capable of performing visual processing tasks robustly under various environmental conditions (light, clouds, contrast). Here, we review some outstanding bio-inspired visual sensors, which can be used for either detecting motion in the visible spectrum or controlling celestial navigation in the ultraviolet spectrum and for attitude stabilisation purposes. Biologically inspired visual sensors do not have to comprise a very large number of pixels: they are able to perform both short and long range navigation tasks surprisingly well with just a few pixels and a weak resolution.

AB This paper presents a novel path planning heuristic for multi-UAV pipe inspection missions inspired by the booby bird's foraging behavior. The heuristic enables each UAV to find an optimal path that minimizes the detection time of defects in pipe networks while avoiding collisions with obstacles and other UAVs. The proposed method is compared with four existing path planning algorithms adapted for multi-UAV scenarios: ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), opportunistic coordination, and random schemes. The results show that the booby heuristic outperforms the other algorithms in terms of mean detection time and computational efficiency under different settings of defect complexity and number of UAVs.

AB The utilization of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased rapidly due to their ability to perform a variety of tasks, including industrial inspection. Conducting testing with actual flights within industrial facilities proves to be both expensive and hazardous, posing risks to the system, the facilities, and their personnel. This paper presents an innovative and reliable methodology for developing such applications, ensuring safety and efficiency throughout the process. It involves a staged transition from simulation to reality, wherein various components are validated at each stage. This iterative approach facilitates error identification and resolution, enabling subsequent real flights to be conducted with enhanced safety after validating the remainder of the system. Furthermore, this article showcases two use cases: wind turbine inspection and photovoltaic plant inspection. By implementing the suggested methodology, these applications were successfully developed in an efficient and secure manner.

A Chan-Vese model-based approach is proposed and developed for ground stereo vision detection. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is fused into state estimation to reduce the localization inaccuracy caused by measurement errors of object detection and Pan-Tilt unit (PTU) attitudes. Furthermore, the region-of-interest (ROI) setting up is conducted to improve the real-time capability. The present work contributes to real-time, accurate and robust features, compared with our previous works. Both offline and online experimental results validate the effectiveness and better performances of the proposed method against the traditional triangulation-based localization algorithm.

AB Many controllers have been designed for the longitudinal car-following mode of connected and automated vehicles. The existing body of research shows that these controllers more or less have some deficiencies in controlling connected and automated vehicles, which di-rectly hinder their development. To cope with these problems, we design a novel longi-tudinal car-following control strategy integrating predictive collision risk. Among the con-trollers for connected and automated vehicles, the intelligent driver model is one of the most widely adopted controller. There is evidence that the intelligent driver model con-troller will produce larger gap distance and slower response time. In the meantime, the string stability of CAVs platoon controlled by the intelligent driver model controller is poor. Therefore, to verify the effectiveness of this control strategy, we integrate proposed control strategy with intelligent driver model, and the predictive-intelligent drive model controller is formulated. Theoretical analysis is exerted by transfer function method, and some nu-merical simulation experiments are designed and carried out. Analytical results show that the proposed control strategy can improve the defects of intelligent driver model controller in poor string stability, larger gap distance and slower response. In the meantime, it can also moderate the stopping process of connected and automated vehicles and enhance the throughput of intersection. More importantly, it does not affect the structure of connected and automated vehicles, which suggests that it is possible to integrate it with other con-trollers to improve their performance in controlling connected and automated vehicles. All findings in this study provide a novel way to establish car-following control strategy im-proving traffic stability and efficiency and a set of theoretical frameworks for verifying the control effect of future proposed control strategy. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB This article proposes a method to diminish the horizontal position drift in the absence of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signals experienced by the VNS (Visual Navigation System) installed onboard a UAV (Unmanned Air Vehicle) by supplementing its pose estimation non-linear optimizations with priors based on the outputs of the INS (Inertial Navigation System). The method is inspired by a PI (Proportional Integral) control loop, in which the attitude and altitude inertial outputs act as targets to ensure that the visual estimations do not deviate past certain thresholds from their inertial counterparts. The resulting IA-VNS (Inertially Assisted Visual Navigation System) achieves major reductions in the horizontal position drift inherent to the GNSS-Denied navigation of autonomous UAVs. Stochastic high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations of two representative scenarios involving the loss of GNSS signals are employed to evaluate the results and to analyze their sensitivity to the terrain type overflown by the aircraft. The authors release the C++ implementation of both the navigation algorithms and the high-fidelity simulation as open-source software.

AB State-of-the-art autonomous micro-robotic turtles suffer from various limitations, such as power restrictions that minimize their deployment times. In this paper, an Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) actuator-based centimeter-level biomimetic underwater robot was designed and developed as a robotic turtle with self-charging capabilities to overcome such limitations. It could move forward and make turns driven by five IPMCs on the water. The underwater charging station was able to transmit wideband ultrasonic and electromagnetic fields for electromagnetic induction charging. An ultrasonic communication system with one ultrasonic transmitter and two ultrasonic receivers was first fabricated to implement communication between the underwater station and the biomimetic underwater robot for autonomous tracking and rechargeable capabilities. Experiments were carried out to confirm the operation of the biomimetic underwater robot, which verified the centimeter-level rechargeable capabilities and autonomous target tracking features. The micro-robot demonstrated a self-tracking radial displacement error of approximately 6 mm and a charging reliability rate of more than 73&.

AB Trajectory prediction has been a long-standing problem in intelligent systems like autonomous driving and robot navigation. Models trained on large-scale benchmarks have made significant progress in improving prediction accuracy. However, the importance on efficiency for real-time applications has been less emphasized. This paper proposes an attention-based graph model, named GATraj, which achieves a good balance of prediction accuracy and inference speed. We use attention mechanisms to model the spatial-temporal dynamics of agents, such as pedestrians or vehicles, and a graph convolutional network to model their interactions. Additionally, a Laplacian mixture decoder is implemented to mitigate mode collapse and generate diverse multimodal predictions for each agent. GATraj achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance at a much higher speed when tested on the ETH/UCY datasets for pedestrian trajectories, and good performance at about 100 Hz inference speed when tested on the nuScenes dataset for autonomous driving. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze the probability estimation of the Laplacian mixture decoder and compare it with a Gaussian mixture decoder for predicting different multimodalities. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module in GATraj.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are presenting an ever expanding range of applications that enhance human capabilities and mitigate human risk. Development of a successful subsurface autonomous launch and recovery system would expand the functional use of AUVs in many fields, e.g., year-round Canadian Arctic exploration and sovereignty missions. This paper provides an overview of the design and dynamic modelling of two concept mechanisms being developed to recover AUVs to a slowly moving submerged submarine. Both have a serial R perpendicular to R perpendicular to P architecture; one is mechanically actuated while the second uses an actively pitched wing to indirectly provide motive force for the passive revolute joint. Dynamic models of both manipulators are developed. Although similar in architecture, several extensions are required to accurately predict the non-linear dynamics provided by the wing. High speed actuation of the devices is required to compensate for relative trajectory errors between the submarine and AUV during significant sea states in littoral waters. Alterations to the recursive Newton-Euler method to include hydrodynamic and additional inertial forces present in water are explained. Results of some initial modelling are presented.

AB This article is concerned with the design of a three-dimensional path planning and secure event-triggered cooperative path following for multiple disk-type autonomous underwater gliders (AUGs) in the presence of underwater obstacles and denial-of service (DoS) attacks. A three-dimensional collision-free path planning method is firstly proposed by using a quantum-behaved adaptive particle swarm optimization method in the global path planning layer and an artificial potential field method in the local path planning layer. Secondly, a path variable update law is devised based on a three-dimensional line-of-sight guidance mechanism, which can achieve the cooperative control for networked AUGs, in addition, AUGs can stop at the target points automatically. Finally, an event-triggered mechanism is presented to achieve secure cooperative control for AUGs under the unreliable network environment in the presence of DoS attacks. The stability is validated based on the input-to-state stability theory. Simulation results and numerical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated three-dimensional collision-free path planning and secure event-triggered cooperative path following method.

AB The application of artificial intelligence in autonomous driving is becoming increasingly extensive. LiDAR-based 3D point cloud panoptic segmentation is one of the most promising and arduous tasks. Although recent methods have produced promising results, most of them ignore the prior distribution of objects in the 3D point clouds. In this paper, we first investigate the distribution of objects around the heading of vehicles and observe that several objects are severely biased. On the basis of this observation, we use the bird's eye view (BEV) representation to project the 3D point clouds into a 2D image and divide the BEV projection into eight areas. For each area, we apply input-dependent convolution kernels to extract the local feature. These local features are concatenated to the panoptic backbone for panoptic segmentation. We validate our method on the validation and test sets of the SemanticKITTI dataset. The proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods based on 2D projection in terms of higher panoptic quality scores.

DE Gaussian process; Dyna-PPO; Bidirectional interaction
AB Recent years have witnessed rapid development of autonomous driving. Model-based and model-free reinforcement learning are two popular learning methods for autonomous driving. However, these two kinds of methods have their own advantages in achieving excellent driving experience. In order to improve their efficiency and performance, Dyna framework is an promising way to combine their advantages. Unfortunately, the classical Dyna framework can not deal with the continuous actions in reinforcement learning. In addition, the interaction between the world model and the model-free reinforcement learning agent remains at the unidirectional data level. To further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of driving policy learning, we propose a novel Gaussian Process based Dyna-PPO approach in this paper. The Gaussian Process model, which is analytically tractable and fits for small-sample problems, is introduced to build the world model. In addition, we design a mechanism to realize bidirectional interaction between the world model and the policy model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach. According to our simulation result, the driving distance of the vehicle could be improved by approximately 0.2x times.

ID VISION SYSTEM
AB Autonomous landing in non-cooperative environments is a key step toward full autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Existing studies have addressed this problem by finding a flat area of the ground as the landing place. However, all these methods have poor generalization ability and ignore the semantic feature of the terrain. In this paper, we propose a well-designed binocular-LiDAR sensor system and a robust terrain understanding model to overcome these deficiencies. Our model infers both morphologic and semantic features of the ground by simultaneously performing depth completion and semantic segmentation. Moreover, during the inference phase, it self-evaluates the accuracy of the predicted depth map and dynamically selects the LiDAR accumulation time to ensure accurate depth prediction, which greatly improves the robustness of the UAV in completely unknown environments. Through extensive experiments on our collected low-altitude aerial image dataset and real UAVs, we verified that our model effectively learned two tasks simultaneously and achieved better performance than existing depth estimation-based landing methods. Furthermore, the UAV can robustly select a safe landing site in several complex environments with about 98% accuracy.

AB Lidar is an important sensor of the autonomous driving system to detect environmental obstacles, but the spatial distribution of its point cloud is non-uniform because of the scanning mechanism. For adaption to this spatial non-uniformity, a dynamic clustering algorithm is proposed based on the spatial distribution analysis of the point cloud along different directions. The proposed algorithm adopts an elliptical function to describe the neighbor, whose semi-minor and semi-major are adjusted dynamically according to the position of the core point. Base on the relationship analysis of different clustering parameters, they are further designed quantitatively by KITTI dataset considering comprehensive clustering performances. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, several comparative experiments with different clustering methods and projection planes have been conducted in the campus by an electric sedan equipped with three IBEO LUX 8 lidars. The experimental results show that the proposed elliptical neighbor can deal with the uneven point cloud more effectively, the performances of over-segmentation, under- segmentation and missed detection all are improved and accordingly a higher detection accuracy is achieved.

AB Research in the autonomous underwater detection system has become rapidly increasing in Ocean Technology. In a recent object detection research study, there a need to enhance the quality, which needs to handle submerged object image processing techniques and a lot of demand to develop an intelligent vision system to improve the Blurred Images and low-quality illumination. Manual research in undersea water leads to more significant pressures and complex environments in cost and workforce. It is necessary to develop a high acceptable autonomous image quality system to upgrade image quality. This paper proposed two approaches: (i) Gray shade and Max-RGB filter techniques to improve image quality. (ii) For optimization and low illumination problem modified Convolution Neural Technique (CNN) incorporated for classification and detection. Moreover, our proposed model has compared with Single-shot Detector (SDD), You Only Look Once (Yolo), Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN to uphold the quality detection found objects. This research article aids to found real-time underwater objects classification and detection. It helps to incorporate an Autonomous operation Vehicle (AOV) underwater research. Our experiment results show detection runs speed as 30 FPs (Frame per second).

AB Research in the field of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has significantly advanced in recent years, mainly due to their relevance in a large variety of commercial, industrial, and military applications. However, UAV navigation in GPS-denied environments continues to be a challenging problem that has been tackled in recent research through sensor-based approaches. This paper presents a novel offline, portable, real-time in-door UAV localization technique that relies on macro-feature detection and matching. The proposed system leverages the support of machine learning, traditional computer vision techniques, and pre-existing knowledge of the environment. The main contribution of this work is the real-time creation of a macro-feature description vector from the UAV captured images which are simultaneously matched with an offline pre-existing vector from a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model. This results in a quick UAV localization within the CAD model. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed system were evaluated through simulations and experimental prototype implementation. Final results reveal the algorithm's low computational burden as well as its ease of deployment in GPS-denied environments.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB Autonomous driving is the key technology to achieve "smart cars" and "intelligent traffic." The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based autonomous driving vehicular (ADV) network is recognized as a promising application scenario in next generation mobile networks. It is also an inevitable trend in the future development of automobiles due to the use of large amounts of fuel and lane occupancy. We propose an architecture of NOMA-based ADV networks to satisfy the communication requirements. In this article, we discuss the challenges and resource allocation problem for NOMA-based ADV networks. In order to improve ADV networks' performance, this architecture also considers cross-layer interference, vehicle quality of service, and algorithm complexity. Therefore, we have investigated the subchannel and power allocation in the NOMA system. The optimization problem is formulated as a non-convex problem for the convenience of calculation, and the problem is transformed into a convex form by introducing an alternative direction algorithm of multipliers method. Simulation results prove the proposed scheme has good feasibility and reliability, and also verify that the proposed algorithm has better energy efficiency compared to the existing schemes.

AB The vision of smart shop floor is based on the notion of Industry 4.0 that denotes technologies and concepts related to Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). In smart shop floors, CPPS monitors physical processes, creates a virtual copy of the physical world, and makes decentralized decisions. CPPS allows virtual world to store data, process data, communicate, and cooperate with each other in real time. This paper presents architecture of smart shop floor based on physical, logical, and communication layers that embed intelligent approaches within manufacturing processes. Every physical entity in the smart shop floor is regarded as an autonomous intelligent logical unit that performs operations guided by distributed control functions. Moreover, computing power and optimization approaches are embedded into each logical unit to make decisions to agilely respond to frequent occurrence of unexpected disturbances at the shop floor. A test platform has been set up to demonstrate how physical entities can be cooperative and autonomous logical units that can automatize the shop floor operations. The results verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB Debris flows threaten communities in mountain regions worldwide. Combining modern photogrammetric processing with autonomous unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) flights at sub-weekly intervals allows mapping of sediment dynamics in a debris flow catchment. This provides important information for sediment disposition that pre-conditions the catchment for debris flow occurrence. At the Illgraben debris flow catchment in Switzerland, our autonomous UAV launched nearly 50 times in the snow-free periods in 2019-2021 with typical flight intervals of 2-4 d, producing 350-400 images every flight. The observed terrain changes resulting from debris flows exhibit preferred locations of erosion and deposition, including memory effects as previously deposited material is preferentially removed during subsequent debris flows. Such data are critical for the validation of geomorphological process models. Given the remote terrain, the mapped short-term erosion and deposition structures are difficult to obtain with conventional measurements. The proposed method thus fills an observational gap, which ground-based monitoring and satellite-based remote sensing cannot fill as a result of limited access, reaction time, spatial resolution, or involved costs.

AB This paper proposes iTD3-CLN, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based low-level motion controller, to achieve map-less autonomous navigation in dynamic scene. We consider three enhancements to the Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) for the navigation task: N-step returns, Priority Experience Replay, and a channel-based Convolutional Laser Network (CLN) architecture. In contrast to the conventional methods such as the DWA, our approach is found superior in the following ways: no need for prior knowledge of the environment and metric map, lower reliance on an accurate sensor, learning emergent behavior in dynamic scene that is intuitive, and more remarkably, able to transfer to the real robot without further fine-tuning. Our extensive studies show that in comparison to the original TD3, the proposed approach can obtain approximately 50% reduction in training to get same performance, 50% higher accumulated reward, and 30-50% increase in generalization performance when tested in unseen environments.

AB Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology is widely recognized as a promising way to improve traffic safety, fuel efficiency and network throughput. However, at the early stage of CAV adoption, there will inevitably be a long period when both CAVs and regular vehicles coexist in the traffic system. To facilitate CAV functionalities in mixed traffic, providing dedicated rights of way for CAVs is necessary. In such scenarios, traffic control requires careful design in the weaving areas that allow CAVs to transfer between dedicated roads and ordinary roads for both safety and efficiency considerations. This paper proposes a dynamic programming approach for the coordinated trajectory planning of CAVs in mandatory lane-changing scenarios, in which CAVs have to switch from a dedicated CAV lane into parallel ordinary lanes with mixed traffic. For a group of CAVs that are poised to enter the ordinary road, the proposed method aims to provide each CAV with a suggested lane-changing gap and a reference trajectory in a coordinated manner. To solve the problem, we establish a dynamic programming formulation to determine the suggested gaps for all CAVs. We formulate a nonconvex quadratic-constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem to characterize the trajectory determination problem, and a relaxation-based approximate algorithm is developed to solve the QCQP. Simulation results show that, compared to the benchmark methods, the proposed method offers substantial benefits both in terms of traffic efficiency and in-vehicle passengers experiences.

AB The connected automated vehicle platoon is a critical organizational form of the intel-ligent transportation system in the future. Considering the platoon size and intensity of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper studies the fundamental diagram and stability of mixed traffic flow. Firstly, the spatial distribution of vehicles in the mixed traffic flow is analyzed. Based on the platoon intensity and Markov chain, the proportion of different types of vehicles in the mixed traffic flow is deduced. Then, the general model framework of the fundamental diagram of the mixed traffic flow is established. The influence factors of the fundamental diagram under the critical scenarios are discussed. Finally, the general condition of mixed traffic flow stability considering the platoon size and intensity of CAVs is developed. Numerical experiments are adopted to analyze the influence of the characteristics of the CAVs platoon on stability. The results show that: (1) a greater platoon size leads to the increase of traffic capacity while it is harmful to the maintenance of traffic flow stability; (2) the platoon size is recommended to be set at 4 to 6 to balance the relationship between traffic capacity and stability; (3) a more significant platoon intensity can help improve the traffic capacity and stability; (4) the penetration rate of CAVs has a positive effect on the traffic flow stability until it increases to a certain degree.

AB This paper addresses the problem of platooning control for a fleet of heterogeneous sailboats. The platooning maintains a constant time headway (CTH) between sailboats following a circular path, a complex problem for sailboats due to the influence of wind direction. First, the desired acceleration based on the CTH and the sailboat velocity needed to converge to the platooning is defined. Second, a control of sailboat orientation to manage the sailboat acceleration is proposed. The proposed platooning strategy adapts to the specific characteristics of sailboats, which are different from other motorized marine vehicles. Two tack strategies can be used for the method: the first is to regulate the sailboat velocity; the second is to go front of the wind while staying in a short corridor. The desired acceleration for fulfilling the platooning has been derived and validated. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with an optimal receding horizon control algorithm.

AB We propose a piezoelectric energy harvesting technology installed in a roadway speed bump. We have installed a module that can charge mobile phones utilizing a speed bump piezoelectric harvester (SBPH), which is easy to apply to roads. A highly integrated module with 40 piezo-generators was fixed and installed at the center of the speed bump. When a medium-sized vehicle passed the module at a speed of 30 km/h, an output voltage of 144 V-max, output current of 45.2 mA(max), and output power of 4086.08 mW(max) (6.81 W/m(2)) were measured at a load resistance of 2 k5-2. When the vehicle passed over the SBPH nine times, it charged a capacitor (10,000 mu F) to provide 6 V for about 200 s, and the charged electrical energy was enough to operate a cellphone. The self-controlled battery charging system via electricity generated by the piezoelectric module could be applied to a speed bump installed on an actual road.

AB It is essential to promote the intelligence and autonomy of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASSs). This study proposed an automatic collision-avoidance method based on an improved Artificial Potential Field (APF) with the formation of MASSs (F-MASSs). Firstly, the navigation environment model was constructed by the S-57 Electronic Navigation Chart (ENC) data in Tianjin Port. The Formation Ship State Parameter (FSSP) definition was proposed for the port environment under multiple constraints that considered the navigation conditions of the MASSs. The formation pattern transformation was settled by changing the formation ship state parameter. Considering the constraints of an 'unmanned-manned' encounter situation, the static obstacles, and the design of the channel area improved artificial potential method for the formation. Finally, the simulation experiment was carried out in the sea near Tianjin Port to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm under multiple constraints. The results indicate that the method can satisfy the integrated operation of collision avoidance and path following in a constrained environment, and it can support the application of merchant F-MASS autonomous navigation in the future.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are important in reconnaissance missions because of their flexibility and convenience. Vitally, UAVs are capable of autonomous navigation, which means they can be used to plan safe paths to target positions in dangerous surroundings. Traditional path-planning algorithms do not perform well when the environmental state is dynamic and partially observable. It is difficult for a UAV to make the correct decision with incomplete information. In this study, we proposed a multi-UAV path planning algorithm based on multi-agent reinforcement learning which entails the adoption of centralized training-decentralized execution architecture to coordinate all the UAVs. Additionally, we introduced a hidden state of the recurrent neural network to utilize the historical observation information. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem, We designed a joint reward function to guide UAVs to learn optimal policies under the multiple constraints. The results demonstrate that by using our method, we were able to solve the problem of incomplete information and low efficiency caused by partial observations and sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, and we realized kdiff multi-UAV cooperative autonomous path planning in unknown environment.

AB Supervised object detection models based on deep learning technologies cannot perform well in domain shift scenarios where annotated data for training is always insufficient. To this end, domain adaptation technologies for knowledge transfer have emerged to handle the domain shift problems. A stepwise domain adaptive YOLO (S-DAYOLO) framework is developed which constructs an auxiliary domain to bridge the domain gap and uses a new domain adaptive YOLO (DAYOLO) in cross-domain object detection tasks. Different from the previous solutions, the auxiliary domain is composed of original source images and synthetic images that are translated from source images to the similar ones in the target domain. DAYOLO based on YOLOv5s is designed with a category-consistent regularization module and adaptation modules for image-level and instance-level features to generate domain invariant representations. Our proposed method is trained and evaluated by using five public driving datasets including Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, BDD100K, KITTI, and KAIST. Experiment results demonstrate that object detection performance is significantly improved when using our proposed method in various domain shift scenarios for autonomous driving applications.

AB One of the most critical tasks in tractor operation is the accurate steering during field operations, e.g., accurate trajectory following during mechanical weeding or spraying, to avoid damaging the crop or planting when there is no crop yet. To automate the trajectory following problem of an autonomous tractor-trailer system and also increase its steering accuracy, a nonlinear model predictive control approach has been proposed in this paper. For the state and parameter estimation, moving horizon estimation has been chosen since it considers the state and the parameter estimation within the same problem and also constraints both on inputs and states can be incorporated. The experimental results show the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed control scheme in which the mean values of the Euclidean error for the tractor and the trailer, respectively, are 6.44 and 3.61 cm for a straight line trajectory and 49.78 and 41.52 cm for a curved line trajectory.

AB Advanced intersection control systems have been created to alleviate traffic congestion. CAVs may benefit from cooperative navigation in order to address the regular traffic issue. Due to whole uncertainty in transportation network, the conventional motion planning for local areas may lead to undesirable effects in long run. In prior works, a micro-macro flow control (MiMaFC) strategy is used to investigate CAVs' navigation at unsignalised intersections by taking flow velocity and vehicle passing priority into account. To get a better understanding of motion control and how it can be utilised to impact traffic flow behaviour, this study expands the intersection navigation protocol and develops a velocity planning methodology based on the proposed MiMaFC technology. Correspondingly, cooperative navigation protocol used in the addressed architecture is specifically developed for CAVs that continually cross intersections. Further, spatio-temporal velocity adaption mechanism is presented in this work. Depending on the vehicles' location and speed, CAVs might use either the MiMaFC-based or self-interested velocity strategy. Simulation results, which include a congested traffic network, are shown to demonstrate the proposed method's potential. The study found that the suggested motion planning framework may increase urban network mobility over a non-supervised CAVs system.

The novel structure uses multiple groups of series circular coils as the transmitting coil to construct a uniform near harness horizontal magnetic field. The solenoid structure covered with flexible magnetic material is used as the receiver, which is attached to the UAV landing gear. A 200-W prototype is produced to validate the proposed structure. The system can maintain smooth mutual inductance with a dc-dc efficiency of 90% under a +/- 20 mm offset and free-rotation.

ID VERIFICATION
AB Modelling and Analysing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a challenge for Formal Methods and therefore a field of active research. It is characteristic of CPSs that models comprise aspects of Newtonian Physics appearing in system environments, the difficulties of their discretization, the problems of communication and interaction between actors in this environment as well as calculations respecting time-bounds. We present a novel framework to address these problems developed with industrial partners involved in the Autonomous Car domain. Based on HOL-CSP, we model time, physical evolution, "scenes"(global states) and "scenarios"(traces) as well as the interaction of "actors"(vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights) inside this framework. In particular, discrete samplings are modelled by infinite internal choices.For several instances of the modelling framework, we give formal proofs of a particular safety property for Autonomous Cars: if each car follows the same driving strategy defined by the so-called Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS), no collision will occur. The proofs give rise to a number of variants of RSS and optimizations as well as a test-case partitioning of abstract test cases and a test-strategy for integration tests.

AB A robust and high-performance lateral control system is necessary for autonomous bus driving in complex downtown roads. In this paper, a Sliding Mode (SM) controller with an uncertainty observer is proposed to reduce the chattering phenomenon while ensuring robustness and maintaining the control performance. A stiffness gain is introduced in the cornering stiffness of rear wheels to compensate for the model uncertainty and external disturbance. For lane keeping and changing maneuvers, an optimal path planning algorithm is designed by considering dynamic constraints of the bus. The lane departure of bus is prevented with minimizing the lateral jerk through the sampling-based path regeneration process. The proposed lateral control system is compared to other conventional SM based controllers in the TRUCKSIM simulator. In an experiment with a real bus, lane keeping maneuver is conducted and compared with experienced human driver in the same driving course. Lane change maneuver is also tested with real bus to perform smooth lane transition while satisfying the lateral acceleration and yaw rate limitations.

AB Waterline detection from images taken by cameras mounted on low-cost autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) is a key process for obtaining a fast obstacle detection. Achieving an accurate waterline prediction is difficult due to the instability of the ASV on which the camera is mounted and the presence of reflections, illumination changes, and waves. In this work, we present a method for waterline and obstacle detection designed for low-cost ASVs employed in environmental monitoring. The proposed approach is made of two steps: (1) a pixel-wise segmentation of the current image is used to generate a binary mask separating water and non-water regions, (2) the mask is analyzed to infer the position of the waterline, which in turn is used for detecting obstacles. Experiments were carried out on two publicly available datasets containing floating obstacles such as buoys, sailing and motor boats, and swans moving near the ASV. Quantitative results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with 98.8% pixel-wise segmentation accuracy running at 10 frames per second on an embedded GPU board. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the proposed controller, it is not required to compute the complex functions and their derivatives appearing in the traditional backstepping methods. The motion control strategy of the UASV is first derived based on the backstepping method. Then, the complex functions, appearing in the controller, are estimated by the FAT and Lyapunov based adaptive laws. This causes the inherent complexity of the backstepping technique, numerical derivatives of virtual inputs, is to be overcome. Moreover, the input limitations are considered by an auxiliary system. Stability analysis of system is performed by Lyapunov's direct method. Several numerical simulations are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Many small boat operations can be considered in the categories of "dull, dirty, or dangerous" jobs that are appropriate for automation. Dull jobs include long-range missions or surveillance tasks that can cause physical or mental fatigue in the crew. In addition, operational considerations may limit a human operator's time, such as exposure to heat or cold or union rules on maximum hours per day or job. The marine environment can be a dirty one as well, with wind-driven salt spray damaging unprotected eyes. And military operations such as riverine patrol or interception of potentially hostile craft can be dangerous for a human crew. Robotic systems allowing autonomous small boat operations can be a good match by providing rugged systems that keep sailors out of harm's way and also display "digital acuity" in that their sensors will be as efficient in their first hour of patrolling as in their last. This paper describes work done to build and test an autonomy system allowing several different boats to perform significant missions both by themselves and in cooperative modes.

   Combatant Craft Division under the leadership of Eric Hansen, the
   government program manager. This work developed the system through the
   summer of 2009 Trident Warrior demonstrations. Subsequently, the Office
   of the Secretary of Defense funded the effort through part of the
   Griffin effort, with support from Commander Michael Junge and Captain
   Jim Hruska. This allowed us to expand to a second system and perform
   multiboat operations and experiments including the cooperative riverine
   mission. From Spatial Integrated Systems, Inc., Rick Simon led this
   project as the Lead System Integrator Program Manager. From Technology
   Solutions, Inc., Tim Bail worked with the hardware and software of AMN
   to make the behaviors happen. During this period at TSI, Drew Sellers
   developed behaviors and did extensive on-water testing. Brian Gresko of
   SIS did the mechanical work of CAN installation and sensor mounting.
   Jeremy Parsons and Brian Dunlavy also contributed significantly to
   software development. Phoenix Malizia of Daniel H. Wagner Associates
   spent a great deal of time customizing and helping us effectively use
   their data fusion package and participating in on-water testing. Mark
   Rothgeb and Tom Hi lands of Penn State University's Applied Research
   Laboratory developed the Ka-band radar tracking software. Personnel from
   NASA's JPL provided extensive support. Hrand Aghazarian has been
   invaluable in providing interfaces and mentoring allowing us to use the

   Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu, Andrew Howard, David Trotz, Yoshi Kuwata, and
   others to allow seamless use of the 360 and stereo cameras during
   missions. Sam Calabrese of Seaward Services acted as lead boat driver
   and safety person on Powervent and CMV for this project. He continually
   went above and beyond the call of duty in terms of boat driving, staying
   with the boat as we worked late time and again, and helping with the
   team's needs. Finally, Steve Crawford worked extensively on this project
   as a TSI employee. He passed away unexpectedly in November 2008. He was
   a critical member of this team and is missed. Many of his C functions
   are still being used by our behavior software on the boats without

AB This article studies the secure formation control problem for autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) with directed event-triggered communication subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. DoS attack is a type of cyber-attacks meant to cut down a network, thus causing legitimate neighbors to lose their expected communication in the control mechanism. A distributed secure formation control algorithm (DSFCA) is proposed to mitigate the negative impact of DoS attacks. Specifically, a model-based dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) with positive minimum inter-event times (MIET) is developed to save communication resources. Wherein, a clock-like dynamic is chosen to guarantee the non-Zeno behavior and provide a positive MIET guarantee. Simultaneously, a model-based state estimator (MBSE) is designed in DETM to reduce the effect of the error caused by DETM during the triggering interval. Furthermore, the effects of DoS attacks on the formation control systems are analyzed. Some sufficient conditions are derived, in which the upper bounds of attack duration rate and attack frequency are given. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

DE object detection; deep neural network; 3D point cloud; real-time

AB 3D object detection using point cloud is an essential task for autonomous driving. With the development of infrastructures, roadside perception can extend the view range of the autonomous vehicles through communication technology. Computation time and power consumption are two main concerns when deploying object detection tasks, and a light-weighted detection model applied in an embedded system is a convenient solution for both roadside and vehicleside. In this study, a 3D Point cLoud Object deTection (PLOT) network is proposed to reduce heavy computing and ensure real-time object detection performance in an embedded system. First, a bird's eye view representation of the point cloud is calculated using pillar-based encoding method. Then a cross-stage partial network-based backbone and a feature pyramid network-based neck are implemented to generate the high-dimensional feature map. Finally, a multioutput head using a shared convolutional layer is attached to predict classes, bounding boxes, and the orientations of the objects at the same time. Extensive experiments using the Waymo Open Dataset and our own dataset are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB It is critical that autonomous navigation systems can segment the objects captured by their sensors (cameras or LiDAR scanners) in real-time. A convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed for real-time semantic segmentation of road objects (pedestrians, cars, cyclists) in this paper. The proposed network structure is based on the light-weight network SqueezeNet, which is small enough to be stored directly in the embedded deployment of an autonomous vehicle. The input of the proposed CNN is the transformed 3D LiDAR point cloud, and the domain transform (DT) makes the segmentation object precisely align its boundary, which results in the preferable point-wise label map as the output. In addition to comparing our segmentation results with the pipelines based on deep learning, the visual comparison with the traditional 3D point cloud segmentation pipelines is also made. Experiments show that the proposed CNN can achieve faster running time (6.2 ms per frame) and realise real-time semantic segmentation for the objects in autonomous driving scenes while ensuring the comparable segmentation accuracy.

AB Given the continuous improvement in the capabilities of road vehicles to detect obstacles, the road friction coefficient is closely related to vehicular braking control, thus the detection of road surface conditions (RSC), and the level is crucial for driving safety. Non-contact technology for RSC sensing is becoming the main technological and research hotspot for RSC detection because of its fast, non-destructive, efficient, and portable characteristics and attributes. This study started with mapping the relationship between friction coefficients and RSC based on the requirement for autonomous driving. We then compared and analysed the main methods and research application status of non-contact detection schemes. In particular, the use of infrared spectroscopy is expected to be the most approachable technology path to practicality in the field of autonomous driving RSC detection owing to its high accuracy and environmental adaptability properties. We systematically analysed the technical challenges in the practical application of infrared spectroscopy road surface detection, studied the causes, and discussed feasible solutions. Finally, the application prospects and development trends of RSC detection in the fields of automatic driving and exploration robotics are presented and discussed.

AB Accurate scene depth is fundamental for robot scene understanding as it adds spatial reasoning. However, accurate scene depth often comes at the cost of expensive additional depth sensors. In this letter, we propose to use map-based depth data as an additional input instead of expensive depth sensors. Such an approach is especially appealing in autonomous driving since map-based depth is commonly available from high-definition maps. To validate this approach, we propose a mapping method that works with common autonomous driving datasets and allows for precise localization using a mix of GNSS-INS and image-based techniques. Furthermore, we propose an entirely learnable three-stage network that handles foreground-background mismatches between the map-based prior depth and the actual scene. Finally, we validate the performance of our method in comparison to several baseline methods and SOTA depth completion methods receiving map-based depth as an input. Our method significantly outperforms these methods both in quantitative and qualitative results. Moreover, our method achieves better metric-scale predictions compared to image-only approaches.

DE Unmanned aerial glider; Autonomous soaring; High-fidelity simulation
ID SOARING AIRCRAFT; MODEL
AB Unmanned Aerial Gliders form a subclass of fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles which promise to offer sustained flight for a wide range of applications. Autonomous soaring allows these aircraft to detect and exploit rising air masses (thermals) without user input, which greatly simplifies their operation. While previous research has focused on the detection and exploitation of thermal updraft, the initial turn at the entry point into the thermal has been ignored. This paper explores the initial turn decision at the instant of thermal detection in order to improve soaring performance by flying directly into the thermal. A high-fidelity simulation of an off-the-shelf RC glider is constructed, along with the Weather Research and Forecasting model to capture realistic thermal convection. The effects of turn decisions on thermalling performance are examined through a large batch simulation on a Matlab/Simulink environment. Thermalling algorithms are subsequently integrated into the PX4 flight stack for Software-in-the-Loop simulations and flight tests using a Pixhawk flight controller. Simulated and experimental results demonstrate the importance of turn decisions for improved overall soaring performance.

For these networks to be reliable and scalable, robust topology control algorithms must be developed to guide the deployment and geometric configuration of mobile nodes without a priori knowledge of the terrain. This article studies a disruption tolerant topology control mechanism based on differential evolution, called TCM-Y, that directs the movements of autonomous vehicles to efficiently and dynamically deploy themselves into a uniformly dispersed configuration. TCM-Y uses a Yao graph inspired fitness function to maintain a minimum desired number of connections for a node with its neighbors while uniformly dispersing autonomous vehicles over an unknown terrain.
   We present a formal analysis of TCM-Y to show that it provides a disruption tolerant node spreading mechanism since any node will have at least It neighbors at all times. The performance of our TCM-Y was tested in hostile environments where nodes systematically or randomly experience hostility and become disabled. The results from simulation experiments show that mobile nodes running TCM-Y perform well in the face of neighbor losses with respect to NAC, ADT, and average connectivity, while limiting the number of network partitions that may occur as a result of node failures. The effectiveness of TCM-Y was evaluated by comparing it with a popular non-deterministic node spreading mechanism that has similar objectives as TCM-Y. The assessment shows that TCM-Y performs significantly better with respect to average connectivity, pre-defined minimum number of neighbor connections, and average distance traveled at the expense of lower normalized area coverage. We also developed a testbed to perform real-time experiments with our TCM-Y implemented in laptops to guide the movements of human operators towards a uniform distribution of mobile nodes. Real-time experiments performed on the testbed verified the results from our simulation experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dynamic positioning (DP) system is of great significance for the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to achieve fully autonomous navigation. Traditional control schemes have problems such as model accuracy, parameter tuning, and complex design. In addition, although the deep rein-forcement learning (DRL) is widely used in the field of vessel motion control, the learning effi-ciency is not high, and insufficient robustness in the face of changing environmental. In order to improve the anti-disturbance ability, robustness and convergence speed of the controller during training, a deep reinforcement learning control method based on priority experience replay (PER) is proposed for dynamic positioning of the USV. The mathematical models are established based on the kinematic and dynamic of the USV. Markov decision process (MDP) models are constructed according to the DP tasks. The simulation results show that compared with other DRL algorithms, the proposed method has higher reward value, faster convergence speed, higher control precision and smoother control output.

AB Automation and connectivity based platforms have great potential for managing highway traffic congestion including bottlenecks. Speed harmonisation (SH), one of such platforms, is an Active Traffic Management (ATM) strategy that addresses flow breakdown in real-time by adjusting upstream traffic speeds. However, SH has limitations including the need for supporting roadway infrastructure that is immovable and has limited coverage; the inability to enact control beyond its range; and the dependence on human driver compliance. These issues could be addressed by leveraging connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), which can collect information and execute control along their trajectories, irrespective of drivers' awareness or compliance. In addressing this objective, this study utilises reinforcement learning to present a CAV control model to achieve efficient speed harmonisation. The results suggest that even at low market penetration, CAVs can significantly mitigate traffic congestion bottlenecks to a greater extent compared to traditional SH approaches.

DT Article
ID MODEL; PATH; COMMUNICATION; SYSTEMS; DESIGN
AB This paper aims at utilising the ideology of controlling a constrained dynamical system to address the longitudinal motion control problem during lane-changing process subject to time-varying uncertainties. To this end, a robust controller is designed based on Udwadia-Kalaba (UK) approach and Lyapunov stability theory. Most of the studies on lane-changing considered only the equality constraint, namely the desired inter-vehicle distance. In a bilateral inequality constraint, the upper bound avoids unpredictable cut-ins and the lower bound collisions. This research applies the constraint to guarantee a safe and efficient lane-changing process. The original UK approach cannot handle bilateral inequalities. Therefore, a diffeomorphism method is proposed to transform the bounded state to an unbounded one. The latter enables the UK approach to deal with both equality and bilateral inequality constraints. The proposed controller can render each vehicle to adjust its distance with the predecessor without violating the prescribed bounds. Numerical experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller under different traffic demands.

AB In this report, we describe the technical approach and algorithms that have been used by the University of Pennsylvania in the MAGIC 2010 competition. We have constructed and deployed a multi-vehicle robot team, consisting of intelligent sensor and disrupter unmanned ground vehicles that can survey, map, recognize, and respond to threats in a dynamic urban environment with minimal human guidance. The custom hardware systems consist of robust and complementary sensors, integrated electronics, computation, and highly capable propulsion and actuation. The mapping, navigation, and planning software is organized hierarchically, allowing autonomous decisions to be made by the robots while enabling human operators to interact with the robot team in an efficient and strategic manner. The ground control station integrates information coming from the robots as well as metadata feeds to focus the attention of the operators and respond rapidly to emerging threats. These systems were developed and tested by the UPenn team to complete two phases of the MAGIC 2010 challenge in a safe and timely manner. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The main challenge for maintenance of distributed photovoltaic (PV) system lies in data collection. This letter considers unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to relay the maintenance data by visible light communication (VLC) under the requirements of ultra-reliability and low-latency. With finite blocklength, total error probability is minimized to ensure the system reliability by jointly optimizing blocklength allocation and UAV deployment. To search optimal solution, this letter divides the formulated problem into two sub-problems and proposes a global iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and random perturbation. Simulation results show that the proposed method is comparable to existing literature with better convergence and lower complexity.

AB Path planning is one of the most important steps in the navigation and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It ensures an optimal and collision-free path between two locations from a starting point (source) to a destination one (target) for autonomous UAVs while meeting requirements related to UAV characteristics and the serving area. In this paper, we present an overview of UAV path planning approaches classified into five main categories including classical methods, heuristics, meta-heuristics, machine learning, and hybrid algorithms. For each category, a critical analysis is given based on targeted objectives, considered constraints, and environments. In the end, we suggest some highlights and future research directions for UAV path planning.

AB In this paper, event-triggered reinforcement learning-based adaptive tracking control is developed for the continuous-time nonlinear system with unknown dynamics and external disturbances. The critic and action neural networks are designed to approximate an unknown long-term performance index and controller, respectively. The dead-zone event-triggered condition is developed to reduce communication and computational costs. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided to show that the closed-loop system can be stabilized. The weight errors and the filtered tracking error are all uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, to demonstrate the developed controller, the simulation results are provided using an autonomous underwater vehicle model.

AB This article describes and compares autonomous threshold value-based processes for detecting force inputs onto vehicle skin panels. For this purpose, 13 piezoelectric foil sensors made from polyvinylidene fluoride are applied to the inside of the outer skin panels as sensors. Applied forces give rise to mechanical vibrations in the material, which, in the form of expansions in the sensor, result in a proportional output signal. On the basis of these signals, two static and two adaptive threshold value processes are presented and evaluated for differentiating between relevant events (including scratches, parking bumps) and irrelevant events (including wind, rain). At the same time, the central issue of optimum configuration of the threshold value is investigated, and solutions proposed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, deep learning and IoT collaboration is heavily invading automotive applications especially in autonomous driving throughout successful assistance functionalities. Crash avoidance, path planning, and automatic emergency braking are essential functionalities for autonomous driving. Trigger-action-based IoT platforms are widely used due to its simplicity and ability of doing receptive tasks accurately. In this work, we propose SDC-Net system: an end-to-end deep learning IoT hybrid system in which a multitask neural network is trained based on different input representations from a camera-cocoon setup installed in CARLA simulator. We build our benchmark dataset covering different scenarios and corner cases that the vehicle may expose in order to navigate safely and robustly while testing. The proposed system aims to output relevant control actions for crash avoidance, path planning and automatic emergency braking. Multitask learning with a bird's eye view input representation outperforms the nearest representation in precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy, and average MSE by more than 11.62%, 9.43%, 10.53%, 6%, and 25.84%, respectively.

TI Design of tyre force excitation for tyre-road friction estimation
SO VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Tyre-road friction estimation; vehicle dynamics; state estimation;
   active tyre force excitation; optimisation
AB Knowledge of the current tyre-road friction coefficient is essential for future autonomous vehicles. The environmental conditions, and the tyre-road friction in particular, determine both the braking distance and the maximum cornering velocity and thus set the boundaries for the vehicle. Tyre-road friction is difficult to estimate during normal driving due to low levels of tyre force excitation. This problem can be solved by using active tyre force excitation. A torque is added to one or several wheels in the purpose of estimating the tyre-road friction coefficient. Active tyre force excitation provides the opportunity to design the tyre force excitation freely. This study investigates how the tyre force should be applied to minimise the error of the tyre-road friction estimate. The performance of different excitation strategies was found to be dependent on both tyre model choice and noise level. Furthermore, the advantage with using tyre models with more parameters decreased when noise was added to the force and slip ratio.

AB In this paper, a hardware-based path planning architecture for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) adaptation is proposed. The architecture aims to provide UAVs with higher autonomy using an application-specific evolutionary algorithm (EA) implemented entirely on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. The physical attributes of an FPGA chip, being compact in size and low in power consumption, makes it an ideal platform for UAV applications. The design, which is implemented entirely in hardware, consists of EA modules, population storage resources, and 3-D terrain information necessary to the path planning process, subject to constraints accounted for separately via UAV, environment, and mission profiles. The architecture has been successfully synthesized for a target Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA platform with 32% logic slice utilization. Results obtained from case studies for a small UAV helicopter with environment derived from light-detection and ranging data verify the effectiveness of the proposed FPGA-based pathplanner, and demonstrate convergence at rates above the typical 10 Hz update frequency of an autopilot system.

AB In the autonomous driving field, fusion of human knowledge into Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is often based on the human demonstration recorded in a simulated environment. This limits the generalization and the feasibility of application in real-world traffic. We propose a two-stage DRL method to train a car-following agent, that modifies the policy by leveraging the real-world human driving experience and achieves performance superior to the pure DRL agent. Training a DRL agent is done within CARLA framework with Robot Operating System (ROS). For evaluation, we designed different driving scenarios to compare the proposed two-stage DRL car-following agent with other agents. After extracting the "good"behavior from the human driver, the agent becomes more efficient and reasonable, which makes this autonomous agent more suitable to Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) traffic.

AB Self-supervised monocular depth and ego-motion estimation is a promising approach to replace or supplement expensive depth sensors such as LiDAR for robotics applications like autonomous driving. However, most research in this area focuses on a single monocular camera or stereo pairs that cover only a fraction of the scene around the vehicle. In this work, we extend monocular self-supervised depth and ego-motion estimation to large-baseline multi-camera rigs. Using generalized spatio-temporal contexts, pose consistency constraints, and carefully designed photometric loss masking, we learn a single network generating dense, consistent, and scale-aware point clouds that cover the same full surround 360 degrees field of view as a typical LiDAR scanner. We also propose a new scale-consistent evaluation metric more suitable to multicamera settings. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks illustrate the benefits of our approach over strong baselines.

AB The performance of motion controller is worst affected by the ocean currents, waves and other marine environments. Therefore, a multi-strategy fusion method is proposed for AUV motion by considering the characteristics of high nonlinearity, strong coupling, the complex marine environment, and the long-term autonomy. A variety of different control methods are integrated, and the appropriate strategy can be chosen automatically according to AUV running state and the external environment. The hysteresis algorithm is introduced to avoid chattering on account of frequent switching. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the excellent performance has been attained, such as overshoot and steady-state error. Furthermore, the multi-strategy fusion method is more suitable for AUV's long-term autonomous task and the complex marine environments. It is easy to realize in engineering and has good robustness on a large scale.

AB Currently, the location recognition and positioning system are the essential parts of unmanned vehicles. Among them, location estimation under GPS-denied environments is currently being studied using IMU, Wi-Fi, and VLC, but there are problems such as cumulative errors, hardware complexity, and precision positioning. To address this problem with the current positioning system, the present study proposed a lane positioning technique by analyzing the chromaticity coordinates, judging from the color temperature of LED lights in tunnels. The tunnel environment was built using LEDs with three color temperatures, and to solve nonlinear problems such as lane positioning from chromaticity analysis, a single input single output fuzzy algorithm was developed to estimate the position of an object on lanes using chromaticity values of signals measured by RGB sensors. The RGB value measured by the sensor removes the disturbance through the pre-processing filter, accepts only the tunnel LED information, and estimates where it is located on the x-distance indicating the lane position through a fuzzy algorithm. Finally, the performance of the fuzzy algorithm was evaluated through experiments, and the accuracy was shown with an average error of less than 4.86%.

AB Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) are currently not intelligent enough to deal with complex traffic conditions. CAVs traveling in platoons can reduce external interference and further improve road capacity. Therefore, a mixed traffic capacity gain formula was constructed, considering both communication interaction and size limitations of CAV platoons. CAVs are divided into three types in a mixed traffic environment in terms of different states and positions. A model was constructed to examine how several parameters affect capacity, and these capacity-improving parameters were used to indicate coefficients of headway gains. Additionally, an empirical formula for pollutant emissions with different headway gains is applied in the mixed traffic. A series of microsimulations are tested based on the improved Full Velocity Difference (FVD) model and CAV models which are established as discrete steps based on the above analyses. The simulation results are highly consistent with the theoretical analyses, demonstrating the universality of this model. Finally, it indicated that the overall optimal size of CAV platoons is between 5 and 10 when taking both the road capacity and pollutant emissions into consideration. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Numerous applications require aerial surveillance. Civilian applications include Monitoring forest fires, oil fields, and pipelines and tracking wildlife. Applications to homeland security include border. patrol and monitoring the perimeter of nuclear power plants. Military applications are numerous. The current approach to these applications is to use a single manned vehicle for surveillance. However, manned vehicles are typically large and expensive. in addition, hazardous environments and operator fatigue can potentially threaten the life of the pilot. Therefore, there is a critical need for automating aerial surveillance using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This paper gives an overview of a cooperative control strategy for aerial surveillance that has been successfully flight tested on small (48-in wingspan) UAVs. Our approach to cooperative control problems can be summarized in four steps: 1) the definition of a cooperation constraint and cooperation objective; 2) the definition of a coordination variable as the minimal amount of information needed to effect cooperation; 3) the design of a centralized cooperation strategy; and 4) the use of consensus schemes to transform the centralized strategy into a decentralized algorithm. The effectiveness of the solution will be shown using both high-fidelity simulation and actual flight tests.

AB Nowadays, multirotors are versatile systems that can be employed in several scenarios, where their increasing autonomy allows them to achieve complex missions without human intervention. This paper presents a framework for autonomous missions with low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Global Navigation Satellite System-denied (GNSS-denied) environments. This paper presents hardware choices and software modules for localization, perception, global planning, local re-planning for obstacle avoidance, and a state machine to dictate the overall mission sequence. The entire software stack has been designed exploiting the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware and has been extensively validated in both simulation and real environment tests. The proposed solution can run both in simulation and in real-world scenarios without modification thanks to a small sim-to-real gap with PX4 software-in-the-loop functionality. The overall system has competed successfully in the Leonardo Drone Contest, an annual competition between Italian Universities with a focus on low-level, resilient, and fully autonomous tasks for vision-based UAVs, proving the robustness of the entire system design.

AB Construction accounts for up to 25% of all occupational fatalities. About half are being struck by and caught-in/ between objects or vehicles, resulting from insufficient or delayed detection of pedestrian workers. Research has proposed detecting visibility-related close calls in order to alarm the involved personnel and prevent negative consequences at the earliest possible time. This work has three objectives: First, a comprehensive synthesis on close call reporting processes and individual technologies. Second, a system focusing on (a) autonomous close call data generation from real-time proactive proximity detection and alerting technology and (b) cloud-based data processing and visualization in building information models at run time. Test results demonstrate that the developed system reaches purposes for decision making in safety management beyond the scope of existing detection and alarming devices. Third, guiding future research by outlining the role of proximity detection and alarming technology in developing autonomous safety systems for construction.

DT Article
AB First in NASA's New Frontiers series of missions, the New Horizons spacecraft was successfully launched on January 19, 2006. New Horizons is scheduled to perform a gravity assist at Jupiter on February 28, 2007, arrive at Pluto on July 14, 2015; completing an extended mission to at least one Kuiper Belt Object in subsequent years. The concept of operations requires a star tracker that operates autonomously both in a standard three-axis "staring" mode during operations involving instrument observations and in a spin stabilized mode during cruise operations with nominal rotational rates up to 5 rpm. With the support of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Galileo Avionica redesigned their Autonomous Star Trackers (ASTR) to use time-delayed integration techniques to provide autonomous spacecraft attitude estimates at 10fHz at spin rates up to 10rpm. This paper will present the performance of the upgraded ASTR in both inertial stare and spin stabilized modes for the first six months of the mission. In addition, effects of the vehicle motion on performance, effects of stray light and direct Sun blinding on tracking and performance, and unanticipated "features" or characteristics of the ASTRs will be discussed.

AB The expansion of autonomous driving operations requires the research and development of accurate and reliable self-localization approaches. These include visual odometry methods, in which accuracy is potentially superior to GNSS-based techniques while also working in signal-denied areas. This paper presents an in-depth review of state-of-the-art visual and point cloud odometry methods, along with a direct performance comparison of some of these techniques in the autonomous driving context. The evaluated methods include camera, LiDAR, and multi-modal approaches, featuring knowledge and learning-based algorithms, which are compared from a common perspective. This set is subject to a series of tests on road driving public datasets, from which the performance of these techniques is benchmarked and quantitatively measured. Furthermore, we closely discuss their effectiveness against challenging conditions such as pronounced lighting variations, open spaces, and the presence of dynamic objects in the scene. The research demonstrates increased accuracy in point cloud-based methods by surpassing visual techniques by roughly 33.14% in trajectory error. This survey also identifies a performance stagnation in state-of-the-art methodologies, especially in complex conditions. We also examine how multi-modal architectures can circumvent individual sensor limitations. This aligns with the benchmarking results, where the multi-modal algorithms exhibit greater consistency across all scenarios, outperforming the best LiDAR method (CT-ICP) by 5.68% in translational drift. Additionally, we address how current AI advances constitute a way to overcome the current development plateau.

AB The inspection and maintenance tasks of electrical installations are very demanding. Nowadays, insulator cleaning is carried out manually by operators using scaffolds, ropes, or even helicopters. However, these operations involve potential risks for humans and the electrical structure. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to reduce the risk of these tasks is rising. This paper presents an UAV to autonomously clean insulators on power lines. First, an insulator detection and tracking algorithm has been implemented to control the UAV in operation. Second, a cleaning tool has been designed consisting of a pump, a tank, and an arm to direct the flow of cleaning liquid. Third, a vision system has been developed that is capable of detecting soiled areas using a semantic segmentation neuronal network, calculating the trajectory for cleaning in the image plane, and generating arm trajectories to efficiently clean the insulator. Fourth, an autonomous system has been developed to land on a charging pad to charge the batteries and potentially fill the tank with cleaning liquid. Finally, the autonomous system has been validated in a controlled outdoor environment.

AB In this paper, the output feedback formation control of autonomous marine surface vessels with limited torque input is addressed. In order to successfully design a formation control system, a second order formation dynamic model is developed based on the leader-following strategy. The controller is designed by employing generalized saturation functions in order to reduce the risk of actuator saturation. A nonlinear saturated observer is also introduced to estimate velocities of the followers. Multi-layer neural network and adaptive robust techniques are also incorporated in the design of the control system to preserve its robustness against uncertain nonlinearities and environmental disturbances which are induced by waves and ocean currents. Lyapunov's direct method is used to show that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, computer simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed formation controller for a number of surface vessels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned aerial system (UAS) traffic management of airspace is a domain that demands strategic management of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for smooth and conflict-free movement in the uncharted low-altitude G airspace. In the context of the previously proposed CORRIDRONE structure, UAV traffic has to be organized in a shared volume of airspace connecting two or more corridors for a network of multilane corridors, resulting in the formation of aerial intersections. In this work, an intersection planning algorithm is proposed that aims to provide no-conflict paths to the UAVs inside the intersection volume. Paths are modeled as a function of the lanes involved in the transition, and conflict resolution is achieved by changing lanes. Optimized solutions are found among the conflicted UAV paths, such that only a few paths need modifying, optimizing the number of lane changes and time spent in the intersection. Simulation results, including random starting time intervals, various UAV sizes, corridor sizes, and differing numbers of lanes in intersecting corridors, are presented to demonstrate the concepts discussed in the paper.

AB This paper addresses the problem of finding a non-holonomic path subject to a curvature restriction, to be tracked by a wheeled autonomous navigation vehicle. This robot is able to navigate in a structured environment, with obstacles modeled as polygons, thus constituting a model based system. The path planning methodology begins with the conditioning of the polygonal environment by offsetting each polygon in order to avoid the possibility of collision with the mobile. Next, the modified polygonal environment is used to compute a preliminary shortest path (PA) between the two extreme positions of the trajectory in the plane (x, y). This preliminary path (PA) does not yet consider the restrictions on the curvature and is formed only by straight line segments. A smoothing process follows in order to obtain a path (PS) that satisfies curvature restrictions which consist basically of joining the straight line segments by circular arcs of minimum radius R (filleting). Finally, the initial and final orientation of the vehicle are accounted for. This is done using a technique we have called the Star Algorithm, because of the geometric shape of the resulting maneuvers. A final complete path (PC) is thus obtained.

AB Exploring the future mobility of older people is imperative for maintaining wellbeing and quality of life in an ageing society. The forthcoming level 3 automated vehicle may potentially benefit older people. In a level 3 automated vehicle, the driver can be completely disengaged from driving while, under some circumstances, being expected to take over the control occasionally. Existing research into older people and level 3 automated vehicles considers older people to be a homogeneous group, but it is not clear if different subgroups of old people have different performance and perceptions when interacting with automated vehicles. To fill this research gap, a driving simulator investigation was conducted. We adopted a between-subjects experimental design with subgroup of old age as the independent variable. The differences in performance, behaviour, and perception towards level 3 automated vehicles between the younger old group (60-69 years old) and older old group (70 years old and over) was investigated. 15 subjects from the younger old group (mean age = 64.87 years, SD = 3.46 years) and 24 from the older old group (mean age = 75.13 years, SD = 3.35 years) participated in the study. The findings indicate that older people should not be regarded as a homogeneous group when interacting with automated vehicle. Compared to the younger old people, the older old people took over the control of the vehicle more slowly, and their takeover was less stable and more critical. However, both groups exhibited positive perceptions towards level 3 automation, and the of older old people's perceptions were significantly more positive. This study demonstrated the importance of recognising older people as a heterogeneous group in terms of their performance, capabilities, needs and requirements when interacting with automated vehicles. This may have implications in the design of such systems and also understanding the market for autonomous mobility.

AB In this article, we present a novel method to achieve optimization based obstacle avoidance and distributed regular polygon time-varying formation control for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle systems (UAVs) in clutter environment. Under a leader-following structure, directed communication graph is considered. The formation size is time-varying and the trajectory of the leader UAV is planned in real time. Different from most of the existing trajectory planning algorithms for single UAV, an optimization-based safe trajectory and formation size online planning algorithm are proposed. To deal with information loss caused by directed communication topology, distributed smooth adaptive filters are designed for each UAV to asymptotically estimate the safe trajectory and formation size. Besides, a geometric tracking controller is adopted to track the desired trajectory for each UAV. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper proposes an innovative approach to coverage path planning and obstacle avoidance for multiple Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in a changing environment, taking into account constraints on the time, path length, number of UGVs and obstacles. Our approach leverages deformable virtual leader-follower formations to enable UGVs to adapt their formation based on both planned and real-time sensor data. A hierarchical block algorithm is employed to identify areas in the environment where UGV formations can spread out to meet time and budget constraints. Additionally, we introduce a novel control scheme that allows each UGV to generate a local steering force to dodge any static and mobile obstacles based on the closest safe angle. Results from simulations and real UGV experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a higher coverage percentage than rule-based and reactive swarming approaches without planning. Our approach offers a promising solution for efficient coverage path planning and obstacle avoidance in complex environments with multiple UGVs.

AB We consider the problem of having a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) pursue a second team of evaders while concurrently building a map in an unknown environment. We cast the problem in a probabilistic game theoretical framework, and consider two computationally feasible greedy pursuit policies: local-max and global-max. To implement this scenario on real UAVs and UGVs, we propose a distributed hierarchical hybrid system architecture which emphasizes the autonomy of. each agent, yet allows for coordinated team efforts. We describe the implementation of the architecture on a fleet of UAVs and UGVs, detailing components such as high-level pursuit policy computation, map building and interagent communication, and low-level navigation, sensing, and control. We present both simulation and experimental results of real pursuit-evasion games involving our fleet of UAVs and UGVs, and evaluate the pursuit policies relating expected capture times to the speed and intelligence of the evaders and the sensing capabilities of the pursuers.

ID NETWORKS
AB End-to-end deep learning has gained considerable interests in autonomous driving vehicles. End-to-end autonomous driving uses the deep convolutional neural network to establish input-to-output mapping. However, existing end-to-end driving models only predict steering angle with front-facing camera data and poorly extract spatial-temporal information. Based on deep learning and attention mechanism, we propose an end-to-end driving model which combines the multi-stream attention module with the multi-stream network. As a multimodal multitask model, the proposed end-to-end driving model not only fully extracts spatial-temporal information from multimodality, but also adopts the multitask learning method with hard parameter sharing to predict the steering angle and speed. Furthermore, the proposed multi-stream attention module predicts the attention weights of streams based on the multimodal feature fusion, which encourages the proposed end-to-end driving model to pay attention to streams that positively impact the prediction result. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed driving model on the public Udacity dataset compared to existing models. Experimental results show that the proposed driving model has better performances than other existing methods.

AB To investigate the impact of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) on the characteristics of mixed traffic flow this paper proposed a fundamental diagram to consider time lags, platooning intensity, and the degradation of CAVs. First, the cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), adaptive cruise control (ACC), and intelligent driver model (IDM) are used to describe the car-following behavior characteristics of CAVs, and degraded CAVs (DCAVs), and HDVs, respectively. Second, a fundamental diagram model of mixed traffic flow under different penetration rates of CAVs is derived. The model is related to CAVs degradation, time lags, and platooning intensity. Then, a sensitivity analysis is investigated, including platooning intensity, free-flow speed, and minimum safety distance. Finally, the proposed model is verified by a simulation experiment designed by SUMO. The results show that the free-flow speed, penetration rate, and platooning intensity of CAVs positively affect the traffic capacity and optimal traffic density of mixed traffic flow. On the contrary, the time lags and minimum safety distance harm the traffic capacity and optimal traffic density of mixed traffic flow.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION
AB With the increasing adoption of intelligent transportation systems and the upcoming era of autonomous vehicles, vehicular services (such as remote driving, cooperative awareness, and hazard warning) will have to operate in an ever-changing and dynamic environment. Anticipating the dynamics of traffic flows on the roads is critical for these services and, therefore, it is of paramount importance to forecast how they will evolve over time. By predicting future events (such as traffic jams) and demands, vehicular services can take proactive actions to minimize Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations and reduce the risk of accidents. In this paper, we compare several techniques, including both traditional time-series and recent Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches, to forecast the traffic flow at different road segments in the city of Torino (Italy). Using the most accurate forecasting technique, we propose n-max algorithm as a forecast-based scaling algorithm for vertical scaling of edge resources, comparing its benefits against state-of-the-art solutions for three distinct Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) services. Results show that the proposed scaling algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art, reducing Service Level Objective (SLO) violations for remote driving and hazard warning services.

AB As an application of the Internet of Things, the connected vehicle system (CVS) plays an important role in smart city. While the vehicles in a CVS inevitably suffer with environmental noise interference, which affect the stability of the whole system. So in this paper, the consensus of autonomous CVS is researched in the presence of stochastic multiplicative noise. The parameter restriction method is first proposed which achieves the control requirements by restricting the parameters of the designed control protocol. Then we optimize this method so that it can resist the noise with slightly larger intensity. However, this method has limited ability to resist noise of large intensity. Next we propose another method that is called the interaction network-based method, which can ensure the convergence of the system through introducing a virtual system that interacts with the original CVS. By selecting parameters of the interaction network properly, such method has a good performance in resisting larger intensity noise. In the mentioned two methods, the convergent results are derived to ensure the stability of the platoon by using the stochastic differential equation(SDE). Finally, the validity of the proposed methods is verified in the designed simulations.

TI Optimal Beacon Placement for Self-Localization Using Three Beacon

DT Article
DE angle-of-arrival; optimal geometry; self-localization
AB Autonomous vehicles need to localize themselves within the environment in order to effectively perform most tasks. In situations where a Global Navigation Satellite System such as the Global Positioning System cannot be used for localization, other methods are required. One self-localization method is to use signals transmitted by beacons at known locations to determine the relative distance and bearing of the vehicle from the beacons. Estimation performance is influenced by the beacon-vehicle geometry and the investigation into the optimal placement of beacons is of interest to maximize the estimation performance. In this article, a new solution to the optimal beacon placement problem for self-localization of a vehicle on a two-dimensional plane using angle-of-arrival measurements is proposed. The inclusion of heading angle in the estimation problem differentiates this work from angle-of-arrival target localization, making the optimization problem more difficult to solve. First, an expression of the determinant of the Fisher information matrix for an arbitrary number of beacons is provided. Then, a procedure for analytically determining the optimal angular separations for the case of three beacons is presented. The use of three beacons is motivated by practical considerations. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the optimality of the proposed method.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB In recent years, with the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoTs) and artificial intelligence, vehicular networks have transformed from simple interactive systems to smart integrated networks. The accompanying intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) can communicate with each other and connect to the urban traffic information network, to support intelligent applications, i.e., autonomous driving, intelligent navigation, and in-vehicle entertainment services. These applications are usually delay-sensitive and compute-intensive, with the result that the computation resources of vehicles cannot meet the quality requirements of service for vehicles. To solve this problem, vehicular edge computing networks (VECNs) that utilize mobile edge computing offloading technology are seen as a promising paradigm. However, existing task offloading schemes lack consideration of the highly dynamic feature of vehicular networks, which makes them unable to give time-varying offloading decisions for dynamic changes in vehicular networks. Meanwhile, the current mobility model cannot truly reflect the actual road traffic situation. Toward this end, we study the task offloading problem in VECNs with the synchronized random walk model. Then, we propose a reinforcement learning-based scheme as our solution, and verify its superior performance in processing delay reduction and dynamic scene adaptability.

AB The calculation of the motion observed between two images of the same scene is required for many applications such as video compression, panoramic stitching and optic flow algorithms for vehicle navigation. The particular application that we focus on in this paper is the need for small light-weight vehicles, such as unmanned ground or air vehicles, to sense their own motion for use in autonomous navigation algorithms. As the processing is ideally performed on-board these vehicles, there are severe restrictions on the processing environment available to perform the optic flow calculations. This has led to the development of FPGA solutions to calculate optic flow. However the most recent approaches still have extensive on-board memory requirements and make use of complex processing operations such as multiplication and matrix inversion. We present an FPGA implementation of a low complexity version of the Lucas-Kanade registration algorithm. This algorithm operates on one-bit images instead of the standard eight-bit approach and consequently can utilize simple logic operations such as exclusive-or rather than multiplications and also makes very efficient use of the available internal memory and resources.

AB We address the problem of trajectory tracking control of a quadrotor-slung-load system. A novel control framework is proposed that relaxes the differentiability class order of the reference. In lieu of traditional approaches that primarily regard the position of either the quadrotor or the load in the design of tracking controllers, in this work, we consider a virtual point located along the cable between the vehicle and the payload. The resulting control framework, which draws parallels with a typical single quadrotor dynamic system, is characterized by an utmost simplicity since it relies only on three error variables, and requires only up to the third time derivative of the reference trajectory. The overall control scheme ensures almost global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of constant external disturbances. Extensive experimental results featuring time-varying exogenous perturbations are presented to validate and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ID TRAJECTORY-TRACKING
AB This paper presents a control solution for the problem of slung load transportation, with simultaneous damping of oscillations, using an underactuated autonomous quadrotor vehicle in the presence of external disturbances. The strategy put forward is divided into two parts: (i) resorting to an error definition that encompasses the pendular motion of the suspended load, a controller inspired in sliding-mode theory is developed to compute a vectored thrust actuation that actively damps out the system's oscillations; (ii) two different approaches are illustrated for the stage of attitude tracking: one stemming from the conventional backstepping technique, which controls the vehicle in angular velocity commands; and another, also based on sliding-mode theory, and built intrinsically in SO(3)$$ \mathsf{SO}(3) $$, that produces torque commands. The overall control scheme is proved to be robust and stable, with the load oscillations shown to be damped out in the process. Simulation and experimental results are presented in a trajectory tracking scenario to validate and assess the robustness and efficiency of the proposed technique.

AB Communication technology has achieved unprecedented development in recent years, and its applications in transportation systems and automobiles are also increasing. During driving, the driver obtains not only traffic information through observation but also more traffic information beyond the visual range through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Therefore, to better describe the evolution law of traffic flow in the IoV environment and to provide some theoretical and strategic support for the coming of the autonomous driving era in the future, an extended car-following model accounting for average optimal velocity difference and backward-looking effect based on IoV environment is proposed. The linear analysis and nonlinear analysis of the model are calculated separately, and the neutral stability curve and the coexistence curve together prove the validity of the model. Subsequently, the numerical simulation verified the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and also proved that the extended model can enhance the stability of traffic flow.

AB This paper describes a system for detecting and estimating the properties of multiple travel lanes in an urban road network from calibrated video imagery and laser range data acquired by a moving vehicle. The system operates in real-time in several stages on multiple processors, fusing detected road markings, obstacles, and curbs into a stable non-parametric estimate of nearby travel lanes. The system incorporates elements of a provided piecewise-linear road network as a weak prior.
   Our method is notable in several respects: it detects and estimates multiple travel lanes; it fuses asynchronous, heterogeneous sensor streams; it handles high-curvature roads; and it makes no assumption about the position or orientation of the vehicle with respect to the road.
   We analyze the system's performance in the context of the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. With five cameras and thirteen lidars, our method was incorporated into a closed-loop controller to successfully guide an autonomous vehicle through a 90 km urban course at speeds up to 40 km/h amidst moving traffic.

AB Scalable routing for wireless communication systems is a compelling and challenging task. To this aim, routing algorithms exploiting geographic information have been proposed. These algorithms refer to nodes by their location, rather than their address, and use those coordinates to route greedily towards a destination. With the advent of unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) technology, a lot of research effort has been devoted to extend position-based packet routing proposals to three dimensional environments. In this context, Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs), comprised of autonomous flying vehicles, pose several issues. This work focuses on the state-of-the-art, stateless geographic packet routing protocols conceived or adapted for three-dimensional network scenarios. Proposals are evaluated over a common scenario through a comprehensive comparative analysis.

AB In this paper we analyze the early evolution of robot perception toward robot autonomy: respective impacts of the bare technology and of advanced control are put in perspective. At first, the UmBuM's vehicle, operational in the 1990s, is taken as a study example. The strong points of such systems suggest a discussion of the software technology in image processing and of the hardware technological concept of silicon retina regarding their respective contribution to real machine vision. This second part elicits limitations, which lead again to concepts and realizations in control, through the need for sensor fusion and active vision. The ultimate step to robot autonomy would be learning, and this is considered in the conclusion.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB This article considers a time-constrained data collection problem from a network of ground sensors mounted on a nonflat terrain by several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). On an uneven terrain, the line-of-sight (LoS) from the sensors to the UAVs is often occluded. Ground-based reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are used to make data collection more effective. Data are transmitted to the UAVs either directly or through the RISs. A model-predictive-control-based algorithm for UAVs navigation and data transmission is developed. The algorithm fully addresses the issue of an uneven terrain. It maximizes the amount of data sent to the UAVs within relatively short times and minimizes the energy expenditure of all the UAVs by establishing LoS connection directly or via RISs as often as possible. We present a mathematically rigorous proof of the optimality of the proposed method.

AB Mines are one of the important energy sources in the world. Due to mining areas are often affected by adverse weather and environmental conditions (sand, dust, extreme cold, heavy snow, etc.), the efficiency and security of mining are low. As a new, efficient, prospective mode, Metaverse has been studied and successfully applied in various industries. However, there is still no research about its usage in mines. In this article, we apply Metaverse to mining and propose MetaMining. We present its definition and analyze the functions it could perform. Furthermore, we propose its development phases and architecture. Specifically, MetaMining is a mode, which aims to achieve high-efficiency, high-security mining in the physical world through the interaction between the physical world and the virtual world. Its development phases involve three steps: 1) digital twins; 2) digital natives; and 3) surreality. Its architecture consists of three components: 1) human world; 2) virtual mining system; and 3) physical mining system. In addition, we analyze key technologies and possible challenges in the construction of MetaMining.

AB High-definition (HD) map is crucial for intelligent vehicles to perform high-level localization and navigation. To improve the availability and usability of HD map, it is meaningful to investigate crowd-sourced mapping solutions and low-cost map-aided localization schemes which don't rely on high-end sensors. In this letter, we propose a novel vision-based mapping and localization system, which could generate compact instance-level road maps automatically and provide high-availability map-aided localization. The spatial uncertainties of the map elements are taken into consideration by analyzing the inverse perspective mapping (IPM) model, which enables more flexible map usages in both mapping and localization phases of the system. Besides, a pose graph optimization framework is developed for accurate pose estimation by fusing global positioning (GNSS), local navigation (odometry) and map matching information together. Real-world experiments in urban environment were conducted to validate different phases of the system, including on-vehicle mapping, multi-source map merging and map-aided localization.

AB This paper presents a cooperative flow field estimation algorithm based on the sensor measurements from a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The algorithm uses: (1) the deviation between actual and predicted relative positions between each vehicle and its neighbors (relative motion-integration error), which is available using local measurement, and (2) the deviation between the actual and predicted positions (absolute motion-integration error) of each vehicle, which is available from GPS when the AUVs are on the sea surface, to reconstruct the flow field. Firstly, we establish the relation between the motion-integration errors and the flow field, which is given in the form of a set of nonlinear equations. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to estimate the unknown flow field by solving an inverse problem for these nonlinear equations. Moreover, it is rigorously proven that under this algorithm, the estimation result converges to the real flow field. Finally, simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.(C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vehicle taillight detection is essential to analyze and predict driver intention in collision avoidance systems. In this article, we propose an end-to-end framework that locates the rear brake and turn signals from video stream in real-time. The system adopts the fast YOLOv3-tiny as the backbone model and three improvements have been made to increase the detection accuracy on taillight semantics, i.e., additional output layer for multi-scale detection, spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) module for richer deep features, and focal loss for alleviation of class imbalance and hard sample classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multi-scale features as well as hard examples mining greatly contributes to the turn light detection. The detection accuracy is significantly increased by 7.36%, 32.04% and 21.65% (absolute gain) for brake, left-turn and right-turn signals, respectively. In addition, we construct the taillight detection dataset, with brake and turn signals are specified with bounding boxes, which may help nourishing the development of this realm.

AB This technical communication describes a method to size the drop weights used by submersibles for diving and surfacing taking into account varying seawater density profiles. The method allows consistent diving and surfacing performance to be achieved for differently sized submersible and target dive depths. The conditions that need to be met for safe operation of a submersible are described in this paper. The equations needed to appropriately ballast a platform and size its diving and surfacing drop weights are derived, highlighting some inherent limitations of using a two drop weight method for certain types of mission. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations for different sized submersibles and target depths. The results show the effects of using different design parameters to illustrate some useful patterns and trends that can assist submersible developers and operators predict the effects of environmental and design uncertainties on important operational parameters such as the time taken for diving and surfacing.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied in civil applications, such as disaster relief, agriculture and cargo transportation, and so on. With the massive number of UAV flight activities, the anti-collision technologies aiming to avoid the collisions between UAVs and other objects have attracted much attention. The anti-collision technologies are of vital importance to guarantee the survivability and safety of UAVs. In this article, a comprehensive survey on UAV anti-collision technologies is presented. We firstly introduce laws and regulations on UAV safety which prevent a collision at the policy level. Then, the process of anti-collision technologies is reviewed from three aspects, i.e., obstacle sensing, collision prediction, and collision avoidance. We provide a detailed survey and comparison of the methods of each aspect and analyze their pros and cons. Besides, the future trends on UAV anti-collision technologies are presented from the perspective of fast obstacle sensing and fast wireless networking. Finally, we summarize this article.

TI Unsteady Airflows and Their Impact on Small Unmanned Air Systems in
   Urban Environments
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Existing unmanned air system platforms currently do not lend themselves well to autonomous operation within complex, highly variable aerodynamic environments. As such, there is a need for accurate high-fidelity urban airflow models to help reduce the risk of failure of urban unmanned air system surveillance and engagement missions. Although urban aerodynamics are exceptionally complicated because of complex interactions between geometry, physical conditions, and varying meteorology, high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics models exist that capture these interactions effectively. Using sufficient resolution, these large-eddy simulation models provide a viable means to characterize urban airflow environments when wind-tunnel testing and field trials are too expensive or impossible. This paper presents a simulation tool that captures unsteady aerodynamics of aircraft flight in an urban environment for the study of vehicle-environment interactions. By combining a high-resolution model of the terrain/buildings with a precomputed large-eddy simulation wind field throughout the urban environment and the closed-loop dynamics of a vehicle flying a desired trajectory, the simulation computes in real time the response of the vehicle linear and angular velocity to the unsteady wind field. The paper describes the mathematical development and implementation of several new environment-vehicle interaction models that could, through the unmanned air system simulation tool, revolutionize the understanding of these interactions in urban environments.

AB Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are anticipated as talented technologies to extend the range of millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. In this letter, a UAV equipped with RIS (UAV-RIS) is used to assist mmWave base station (BS) in covering users in hotspot areas. In this context, UAV should cover several high-capacity hotspots while minimizing its flying/hovering energy consumptions. Energy-aware multi-armed bandit (EA-MAB) algorithm is proposed as an effective online learning tool to handle this problem efficiently. By which, the UAV acts as the player trying to maximize its achievable rate, i.e., the reward, over selecting different hotspots in its trajectory, i.e., the arms of the bandit game. This is done while minimizing the energy/cost of the UAV flight from one hotspot to another over the time span of its battery life. Numerical analysis confirms the superior performance of the proposed EA-MAB algorithm over benchmarks.

AB The essential of developing an advanced driving assistance system is to learn human-like decisions to enhance driving safety. When controlling a vehicle, joining roundabouts smoothly and timely is a challenging task even for human drivers. In this paper, we propose a novel imitation learning based decision making framework to provide recommendations to join roundabouts. Our proposed approach takes observations from a monocular camera mounted on vehicle as input and use deep policy networks to provide decisions when is the best timing to enter a roundabout. The domain expert guided learning framework can not only improve the decision-making but also speed up the convergence of the deep policy networks. We evaluate the proposed framework by comparing with state-of-the-art supervised learning methods, including conventional supervised learning methods, such as SVM and kNN, and deep learning based methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the imitation learning-based decision making framework, which ourperforms supervised learning methods, can be applied in driving assistance system to facilitate better decision-making when approaching roundabouts.

AB In this study, a finite-time consensus tracking problem is investigated for a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with heterogeneous uncertain dynamics. We firstly propose a two-layer distributed control strategy, which consists of an upper-layer distributed observer and a lower-layer controller, without using any global information. Based on Holder's inequality and the theory of finite time stability, a distributed finite-time observer is developed for each follower to estimate the position information of a leader (i.e., an exosystem). Based on the sliding mode control method, a consensus tracking control scheme is designed for each AUV, by which all follower AUVs can track the leader in finite time. Secondly, when the parameters in the AUV dynamics are uncertain, a parameter-adaptive sliding mode control algorithm is introduced to improve the control performance. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the modeling approach and the control framework developed for the ROBUST EU Horizon 2020 project. The goal of this project is to showcase technologies and methodologies for future autonomous mineral exploration missions in deep-sea sites with an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System. Within the aim to make the system reliable in performing autonomously the entire mission, specific modeling, navigation, and control solutions are proposed. In particular, the multihull vehicle hydrodynamic model is derived and experimentally validated, and then used in the implementation of the navigation filter which provides the necessary feedback for the control framework. The latter computes, using a task priority approach, the reference system velocity and control forces for enabling the system desired behaviors. The overall navigation-control architecture has been validated through several sea trials, leading to the final experimental campaign held in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, in October 2019, where the overall ROBUST mission was demonstrated. The obtained results are reported to show the effectiveness of the developed framework.

ID SECURITY; SCHEME
AB Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) plays an extremely important role in intelligent transportation systems. It enables vehicles equipped with smart devices to communicate with vehicles or available road side units or infrastructure. It has been observed that the security of data and privacy of user are two key challenges for vehicular communication to enable sharing of resources among unfamiliar vehicles. The existing classical cryptography-based schemes are not secure in the quantum computing world due to Shor's algorithm. To address the challenges in post-quantum era, we have presented a framework based on short integer solution problem in some lattice that attains all effective identification and authenticity of the user to get authorized access, along with revocation to services. The integrity of proposed framework ensures that information is accurate and can be trusted. This paper ensures conditional autonomous driving and efficient vehicular traffic flow in a VANET. As a result, the presented protocol is suitable for practical applications even in the post-quantum environment, which can be utilized for reliable vehicular communication.

AB Recent advances in practical fields like robotics and the miniaturisation of many sensors and actuators have turned autonomous vehicles into a reality. These systems come in many shapes and forms depending on the medium and their design but can be classified in one of two categories according to their mechanical configuration and number of actuators: fully-actuated and under-actuated vehicles; the second group still poses many challenges for the automatic control and robotics communities. This work introduces an easy methodology, based on quaternions, for designing controllers for a class of under-actuated systems, such as multicopter vehicles. The methodology starts from a fully-actuated representation of the system and adapts it to be implemented in under-actuated systems. In addition, it allows the easy development of controllers without taking care the coupled dynamics of the system. The proposed approach is based on Lyapunov's stability theory and is proven for certain criteria of the system's dynamics. The quadcopter configuration is used to validate the proposed methodology in simulations and in experimental tests.

AB The object detection algorithm is a key component for the autonomous operation of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). However, owing to complex marine conditions, it is difficult to obtain large-scale, fully labeled surface object datasets. Shipborne sensors are often susceptible to external interference and have unsatisfying performance, compromising the results of traditional object detection tasks. In this paper, a few-shot surface object detection method is proposed based on multimodal sensor systems for USVs. The multi-modal sensors were used for three-dimensional object detection, and the ability of USVs to detect moving objects was enhanced, realizing metric learning-based few-shot object detection for USVs. Compared with conventional methods, the proposed method enhanced the classification results of few-shot tasks. The proposed approach achieves relatively better performance in three sampled sets of well-known datasets, i.e., 2%, 10%, 5% on average precision (AP) and 28%, 24%, 24% on average orientation similarity (AOS). Therefore, this study can be potentially used for various applications where the number of labeled data is not enough to acquire a compromising result.

AB The modeling and design of multi-agent systems is imperative for applications in the evolving intelligence of unmanned systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system design that is used to build a system for training a team of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) where no historical data concerning the behavior is available. In this approach, agents are built as the physical controller of each USV and their cooperative decisions used for the USVs' group coordination. To make our multi-agent system intelligently coordinate USVs, we built a multi-agent-based learning system. First, an agent-based data collection platform is deployed to gather competition data from agents' observation for on-line learning tasks. Second, we design a genetic-based fuzzy rule training algorithm that is capable of optimizing agents' coordination decisions in an accumulated manner. The simulation results of this study demonstrate that our proposed training approach is feasible and able to converge to a stable action selection policy towards efficient multi-USVs' cooperative decision making.

AB In this study, an optimally distributed formation control approach is proposed for mixed-order multi-agent systems to achieve formation consistency with obstacle avoidance. The systems consist of unmanned aerial vehicles and ground robots. The authors present a formation consistency control for a mixed-order system under switching topologies. An optimally distributed method is developed by matrix transformation method and linear quadratic regulator theory, which leads to an optimisation on both horizontal and vertical control. For obstacle avoidance, a non-quadratic cost function is introduced based on optimal control. The resulting closed-loop mixed-order system is validated to be stable with an optimal performance. The formation consensus and obstacle avoidance are verified by simulations to show the effectiveness and potentials.

ID EXTRACTION
AB A new dynamic control architecture based on reinforcement learning (RL) has been developed and applied to the problem of high-speed road following of high-curvature roads. Through RL, the control system indirectly learns the vehicle-road interaction dynamics, knowledge which is essential to stay on the road in high speed road tracking. First, computer simulation has been carried out in order to test stability and performance of the proposed RL controller before actual use. The proposed controller exhibited a good road tracking performance, especially on high-curvature roads, Then, the actual autonomous driving experiments successfully verified the control performance on campus roads in which there were shadows from the trees, noisy and/or broken lane markings, different road curvatures, and also different times of the day reflecting a range of lighting conditions. The proposed three-stage image processing algorithm and the use of all six strips of edges have been capable of handling most of the uncertainties arising from the nonideal road conditions.

   OBSERVABILITY
AB Range-based target localization is an important class of problems that arise in an increasing number of scientific and commercial missions at sea. Underwater target localization refers to the task of estimating the positions of fixed or moving underwater targets by using range measurements between the targets and one or more autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), called trackers, undergoing trajectories that are known in real time. In this context, the trackers must execute sufficiently exciting maneuvers so as to maximize the range-based information available for multiple target localization. In this paper, adopting an estimation theoretical setting, we first propose a general methodology for tracker motion planning that results from maximizing the determinant of an appropriately defined Fisher information matrix (FIM) subject to inter-vehicle collision avoidance and vehicle maneuvering constraints. Then, for the single-target single-tracker problem (which is the dual problem of the classical single-beacon navigation problem), we provide a family of analytical solutions for the optimal tracker trajectories and complement the results with a practical experiment using a tracker when the target undergoes trajectories that are straight lines, pieces of arcs, or a combination thereof. In the methodology adopted for system implementation the tracker runs three key algorithms simultaneously, over a sliding time window: (i) tracker motion planning, (ii) tracker motion control, and (iii) target motion estimation based on range data acquired on-line.
   In order to simplify the types of trajectories that the tracker must undergo in the single target localization problem, we extend the above set-up to the case where the tracker works in cooperation with another vehicle, called companion, that can also measure ranges to the target and share this info with the tracker. The latter may have access to the position of the companion or, in some cases, only to the range between the two vehicles. We consider three different operating scenarios where the motion of the tracker is chosen so as to increase the accuracy with which the position of the target can be estimated. The scenarios reflect the situations where the motion of the companion vehicle satisfies one of three conditions: (i) the motion is not defined a priori and can also be optimized, (ii) the motion is fixed a priori and is known to the tracker (scenario in which the tracker benefits from the extra information acquired by the companion vehicle, which tracks a desired trajectory in the context of a separate, independent mission), and (iii) the motion is not known a priori and must be learned in the course of the mission. Simulation results illustrate the methodology adopted for cooperative target localization. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To realize underwater accurate vision-based operations, this article proposes a hybrid visual servoing control scheme for underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMSs) toward a moving target. First, the position-based visual servoing (PBVS) scheme is purposed based on the binocular camera. Second, to reduce the influence of hand-eye system uncertainties, an uncalibrated visual servoing (UVS) control scheme based on the monocular camera is presented. The partitioned Broyden's method is utilized to estimate the Jacobian matrix, and a modified adaptive Broyden's class method is proposed to obtain the approximation of the residual matrix. Afterward, in order to realize long range accurate operations, a novel hybrid visual servoing scheme with Jacobian matrix fusion algorithm is presented not only to combine the PBVS scheme and the UVS scheme but also to avoid the trial movements' influence. Simulations and an experiment are conducted to testify the robustness and effectiveness of the presented scheme.

AB Millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) offers a promising technique to fulfil the high data demand and connectivity of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and 5G communications because it owns valuable and unknown spectrum resources. Using massive antennas with recently introduced drone-enabled aerial computing platforms, named unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), can cast high energy consumption if fully-digital precoding is employed at the UAVs. Using hybrid precoding at a UAV can reduce hardware complexity and energy consumption but is challenging with a need for joint optimization of three precoding matrices at the UAV (sixth-order polynomial objective function). In this paper, we propose to decompose the original UAV hybrid precoding challenge into three subproblems and develop a coordinated descent optimization (CDO) algorithm to solve the three problems recursively. In addition, the convergence and complexity of this new technique are analyzed. Numerical studies indicate the improved effectiveness of the proposed solution over existing solutions.

AB Recent development and commercialization of relatively portable and inexpensive autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have led to new methods for making hydrodynamic, chemical, and biological measurements in near-coastal, lake, and estuarine systems. Equipped with Doppler velocity log (DVL) technology to allow for dead-reckoning navigation, this new class of AUVs has the potential to log not only vehicle motions, but water velocities as well. In this article, we assess the performance of the DVL acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) equipped on the REMUS AUV (Hydroid) in three different environments: a tidally forced lake; a wave-forced, near-shore fringing coral reef; and a gently sloping continental shelf. In all three data sets, the water velocities measured by the AUV DVL compare favorably with measurements from nearby stationary acoustic Doppler current profilers. Nevertheless, the water velocity component measured parallel to the vehicle's tracks exhibited a bias in the direction of AUV motion, consistent with a previously reported bias found for the ship-mounted ADCP application in low-scattering environments. The fringing reef data suggest that DVLs are capable of partially resolving wave motions.

AB The advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided generous opportunities for various applications, yet the data security concerns need to be specially addressed due to the limited capability of IoT devices. Toward this issue, we propose to deploy a blockchain system with practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus for IoT data security provisioning. In particular, we conduct profound analyses regarding the PBFT procedure and elaborate on the computation burden therein. Then, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is leveraged to offload the computation and assist the blockchain operations. The system energy efficiency is introduced as the ratio of the blockchained IoT data amount and energy consumption for the computation and communication in the network. Further, we maximize the system energy efficiency by the joint design of offloading and transmission strategies, as well as the UAV deployment, within a reinforcement learning framework. Finally, simulation results are provided to corroborate the effectiveness of our proposal.

AB The following paper presents the design and fabrication of an ostraciiform swimming robot and its navigation control and guidance system. Compared to other biomimetic vehicles, the chosen architecture has a lower propulsive efficiency but is easier to waterproof and capable to withstand greater pressures. To generate the alternating motion of the robot bio-inspired thruster, namely a plane fin, a transmission system was designed to replace the direct drive widely adopted in underwater biomimetic vehicles. The mechanical efficiency of two alternative mechanisms capable to actuate the fin were computed according to a preliminary sizing of the robot and its targeted swimming performances. Therefore, the more suitable solution was manufactured and installed aboard. At the same time, a proper navigation, guidance and control architecture (NGC) was designed and then integrated in the robot main controller. The proposed solution allows the vehicle to perform different missions autonomously once their profiles are received from the base station. Preliminary tests results and future works are discussed in the final conclusions.

By using specific construction techniques this solution is competitive to other solutions implemented in many places of the world. The paper also contains a short review of existing solutions and shows the additional value provided from the proposed garage concept Queuing theory was used to describe the service process (transport of vehicles) from the points of input into to output from the garage. In this case, the automatic garage was treated as a complex system of mass service (queuing system). The general advantage of the proposed solution is the possibility of parallel service of 10 vehicles by using only one lift (resulting in savings of place and time).

AB One of the most significant research field in mobile robotics, deals with robots operating in off-road conditions (planetary rovers, agriculture robots, search and rescue operations, military robots, etc.). However, obtaining a successful result is not an easy task. One primary point is the locomotion system. In this case, tracks constitute a well-known approach and since the beginning of the 20th century this locomotion system has demonstrated remarkable results in manned vehicles. This article motivates and shows through physical experiments the goodness of tracked mobile robots in off-road conditions. Firstly, a historical perspective of tracked vehicles and tracked robots is addressed. Then, the main modelling aspects are introduced, in particular, the slip phenomenon. After that, several localization techniques are discussed with especial mention to visual odometry. The motion control aspect is also of primal importance. In this regard, several slip-compensation control strategies are analysed. Finally, the authors background obtained in this field is expounded.

AB Over the past 5 years, the use of 1-3 piezoelectric polymer composite has been studied under various U. S. Navy-funded transducer research programs. As a transduction material, the 1-3 piezoelectric composite offers many advantages for autonomous undersea vehicles/unmanned undersea vehicle (AUV/UUV) imaging array construction. Broad bandwidth, high transmit/receive response, low cost of fabrication, mechanical ruggedness, and the ability to form conformal shapes make this material both a unique and intriguing medium for the sonar transducer designer. The 1-3 piezocomposite panels are comprised of several piezoceramic rods aligned vertically through the panel's thickness with each rod surrounded with a specific polymer epoxy. Volume fractions of ceramic to polymer can vary up to 50% with panel thickness ranging between fractions of a millimeter (2 to 4 MHz) to 25 millimeters (50 to 70 kHz). This article will elucidate the application of this unique material to a variety of practical transducer designs and describe some of the recent device demonstrations along with measured performance data.

AB This paper describes a localisation framework that combines the accuracy of feature maps with the scalability of topological maps. The map is structured as a graph of nodes where each node defines a local region feature map. This breaks the localisation process into a combination of regional feature tracking and node-to-node context switching. As part of the practical implementation of the localisation system, we introduce a batch data association method that uses the simultaneous observation of multiple features to determine data associations in a manner decoupled from the vehicle pose estimate. We also present an observation-based dead reckoning procedure that estimates vehicle motion in place of odometry and does not require a kinematic vehicle model. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach is capable of localising in large-scale outdoor environments. We perform tests in an inner city park and a suburban street using a scanning range laser as the sole information source. The diverse nature of these two environments indicates that these techniques have broad application. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The unprecedented proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and Swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs) have garnered considerable attention from industry and academia owing to their extensive landscape of applications from disaster relief towards smart agriculture. However, flying several UAVs at once poses many challenges to safely and efficiently localizing and monitoring them. Further, they need to maintain their formation distance to avoid collision between team members and any environmental obstacles. Besides, SUAVs are mainly equipped with an on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to obtain their positions, but they are not accurate enough and suffer from several vulnerabilities that restrict their applications. Thus, in GPS-denied situations, the acquisition of the positions of UAVs can be assisted by alternative technologies and solutions. This paper is one of the foremost in-depth works that present the topic of localization of SUAVs from various perspectives including current research challenges on positioning systems, telecommunication, and path planning, along with future opportunities on automated delivery services such as medicine, remote inspection of industrial sites, and precision agriculture.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple complementary sensors have tremendous potential for fast autonomous or remote-controlled semantic scene analysis, e.g., for disaster exami-nation. Here, we propose a UAV system for real-time semantic inference and fusion of multiple sensor modalities. Semantic segmentation of LiDAR scans and RGB images, as well as object detection on RGB and thermal images, run online onboard the UAV computer using lightweight CNN architectures and embedded inference accelerators. We follow a late fusion approach where semantic information from multiple sensor modalities augments 3D point clouds and image segmentation masks while also generating an allocentric semantic map. Label propagation on the semantic map allows for sensor-specific adaptation with cross-modality and cross-domain supervision. Our system provides augmented semantic images and point clouds with approximate to 9 Hz. We evaluate the integrated system in real-world experiments in an urban environment and at a disaster test site.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this brief, a novel coordinated disturbance observer (CDO) is proposed to tackle the disturbance which affects the stable flight of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The above CDO is composed of multiple disturbance observers which have a basic form and depend on the designed coordinated variables. Due to the above special structure of the CDO, for one thing, the requirement of positive definiteness of the observer gain posed on a single disturbance observer is removed in the CDO. For another, the performance of the CDO can be enhanced by weighting multiple small disturbance observer gains. Via the Lyapunov function method, not only the decay rate and stable region of disturbance estimation error (DEE) of the CDO for the fixed-wing UAV are analyzed, but also the stability criteria of DEE and tracking error are given. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CDO is verified through the simulation of flight control of a fixed-wing UAV.

AB We propose a multi-crossover and adaptive island based population algorithm (MAIPA). This technique divides the entire population into subpopulations, or demes, each with a different crossover function, which can be switched according to the efficiency. In addition, MAIPA reverses the philosophy of conventional genetic algorithms. It gives priority to the autonomous improvement of the individuals (at the mutation phase), and introduces dynamism in the crossover probability. Each subpopulation begins with a very low value of crossover probability, and then varies with the change of the current generation number and the search performance on recent generations. This mechanism helps prevent premature convergence. In this research, the effectiveness of this technique is tested using three well-known routing problems, i.e., the traveling salesman problem (TSP), capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), and vehicle routing problem with backhauls (VRPB). MAIPA proves to be better than a traditional island based genetic algorithm for all these three problems.

AB Transportation is currently advancing towards Electric Vehicle (EV) technology. This paper presents a brief and systematic analysis of the real-time issues obtained in Electric Vehicles (EVs) due to the various ranges of energy storage devices. In general, EV energy management system is integrated with power electronic circuits for effective power conversion and reliable operation. Some issues are addressed while using the batteries in EV systems such as charging time, efficiency of battery, and raw materials. Not only battery issues but also real-time non-technical issues and operational issues are also discussed in this paper. During energy conversion with power electronic circuits, the system attains extreme temperature levels which in turn reduces the performance of the system. To maintain an optimum temperature level, it is important to study the temperature effect of the system at the most prior levels. Due to the adaption of power electronic components, some extent of noise is generated, technically treated as Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), as system capacity increases the EMI content also improved proportionately. Therefore, to mitigate the EMI effect, the low pass filter-based EMI filter is introduced in the system such that the noise level is suppressed. Bidirectional Charging System (BCS) is one of the emerging technologies in EV to obtain autonomous power supply systems in the form of Vehicle to Grid (V2G), Grid to Vehicle (G2V), and Vehicle to Load (V2L). To know the behaviour of BCS the proposed RNN controller is employed and is compared with ANN bidirectional charging model. BCS charging system with RNN controller has better dynamic response to exchange the power via DC/DC converter and AC/DC converter as compared to ANN controller.

AB With its superior performance, the unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) will gradually become an important combat force in the future beyond-visual-range (BVR) air combat. For the problem of UCAV using the BVR air-to-air missile (AAM) to intercept the highly maneuvering aerial target, an autonomous attack guidance method with high aiming precision is proposed. In BVR air combat, the best launching conditions can be formed through the attack guidance and aiming of fighters, which can give full play to the combat effectiveness of BVR AAMs to the greatest extent. The mode of manned fighters aiming by manual control of pilots is inefficient and obviously not suitable for the autonomous UCAV. Existing attack guidance control methods have some defects such as low precision, poor timeliness, and too much reliance on manual experience when intercepting highly maneuvering targets. To address this problem, aiming error angle is calculated based on the motion model of UCAV and the aiming model of BVR attack fire control in this study, then target motion prediction information is introduced based on the designed model predictive control (MPC) framework, and the adaptive fuzzy guidance controller is designed to generate control variable. To reduce the predicted aiming error angle, the algorithm iteratively optimizes and updates the actual guidance control variable online. The simulation results show that the proposed method is very effective for solving the autonomous attack guidance problem, which has the characteristics of adaptivity, high timeliness, and high aiming precision.

AB Urged by a close future perspective of a traffic flow made of a mix of human-driven vehicles and automated vehicles (AVs), research has recently focused on studying the traffic flow characteristics of Adaptive Cruise Controls (ACCs), the most typical AV. However, in most works, the ACC system is studied under a simplifying and unrealistic assumption, or the ACC system modeled is inaccurate. This paper proposes a general hierarchical control system to model ACC systems with several assumptions based on the deficiencies above. Moreover, a field experiment was conducted, and the corresponding experimental data was used to verify the proposed hierarchical control system and assumptions. In addition, string stability is explored along with sensitivity analyses of control parameters based on an example under the constant time gap policy. The results show that different upper-level controller parameters have different delays, where the delay of the speed is negligible; the introduction of actuator delay and lag in the lower-level controller can significantly improve the model goodness of fit. Furthermore, optimizing the delay and lag in the lower-level controller can significantly enhance the string stability of ACCs than optimizing the control parameters.

AB Safely passing through unsignalized intersections (USI) in urban area is challenging for autonomous vehicles due to high uncertainties of surrounding engaged human-driven vehicles. In order to achieve this, various variables have been selected to estimate and predict the surrounding human driver's behavior. However, it is still not fully clear what variables mostly contribute to driving behavior prediction at USI. This paper investigates the contribution levels of 13 features of human driver's decision-making at USI using a random forest approach. Thirty skilled driver participants are tested in a real-time driving simulator where the traffic scenarios with merging vehicles were designed in different motion styles to mimic real traffic. The experiment results indicate that the relative distance and velocity between merging vehicles have a wider contribution range (i.e., -0.4 -0.4) than the absolute velocity and distance features (i.e., -0.2 -0.2) to predict driver behavior. The contribution also varies over the selected feature values and driving conditions. This contribution research gains insight in the influence of different variables on driver behavior prediction at USI, thereby assisting researchers in selecting representative features in self-driving applications.

TI Explicit model predictive control for linear time-variant systems with
   application to double-lane-change maneuver
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID POWER MANAGEMENT; VEHICLES; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN
AB Explicit model predictive control (eMPC) has been proposed to reduce the huge computational complexity of MPC while maintaining the performance of MPC. Therefore, this control method has been more widely employed in the automotive industry than MPC. In this paper, an eMPC is designed to perform a double-lane-change (DLC) maneuver. This task has been employed to demonstrate the efficacy of controllers in an autonomous driving situation. In this sense, the proposed controller shows better performance than a driver model designed in CarSim at a high vehicle longitudinal velocity. The main contribution of this paper is to present an eMPC for discrete-time linear time-variant (LTV) systems so that the proposed controller can be robust against parameter variation. In a state-space representation of the vehicle, the longitudinal velocity of the vehicle is assumed to be a constant so that the whole system is linear time-invariant (LTI). However, it is inevitable that this velocity varies in an actual driving situation. Therefore, an eMPC controller is designed using an add-on unit to consider the varying parameter without modification of the eMPC solution. The CarSim simulation results of eMPC show enhanced performance compared to that of eMPC for the LTI system.

AB Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to disrupt air traffic and can also function as weapons, since they can either be equipped with improvised explosive devices or can be used for collision purposes. Hence, defensive measures against such threats are important from both a civilian as well as a military perspective. This article argues that high-power radio frequency (HPRF) directed energy weapons (DEWs) can provide a suitable defence against swarms of UAVs. Hence, it would be useful to be able to undertake a performance prediction assessment of the proposed HPRF DEW systems. Consequently, two models are introduced for this purpose and a single measure of performance is derived for each. To illustrate the way in which these models can be used for performance prediction, a particular example of an HPRF DEW is investigated, and its utility in terms of UAV swarm defeat is quantified.

AB Next generation networks will involve huge number of industrial internet of things (IIoT) sensors which require reliable connectivity with low latency to manage the data transmission and processing. The design of these networks entails a lot of challenges. This article describes the 3D placement of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an IIoT network that supports non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). UAVs act as decode and forward (DF) relays. The 3D UAV placement problem is formulated which is highly non-convex in the coordinates. Therefore, we employ an improved adaptive whale optimization algorithm (IAWOA) to handle the problem. Even with its improved performance, IAWOA is not suitable for real-time application. Hence, we propose path aggregation network (PANet) to handle the 3D UAV placement. The simulation results show that PANet is more suitable for the online-learning.

ID DESIGN; COMMUNICATION
AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication has emerged as an irreplaceable technology in military, disaster relief and emergency scenarios. This correspondence investigates the average throughput in a UAV-enabled cognitive radio network, where the UAV is regarded as a dedicated secondary user to enhance the network coverage and spectral efficiency. Based on the probabilistic line-of-sight channel, we exploit the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation to maximize the average throughput under the constraints of co-channel interference and completion time. The original problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem which is generally NP-hard. We first decompose the primal problem into a bilevel programming problem, and then propose an efficient high-quality algorithm based on the particle swarm optimization approach. The optimized trajectory reveals the trade-off between throughput and co-channel interference. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm as compared to other benchmark schemes.

AB In recent years, the application scope of artificial lateral line sensor (ALLS) systems is mainly limited to the perception of water flow environment and dipole source. In order to expand the application scope, an ALLS based on a pressure sensor array is proposed in this work to recognize the shape and size parameters of moving vibration sources. First of all, the pressure sensor array is appropriately installed in the underwater vehicle with the help of sensor topology optimization. Then, a numerical simulation model of the ALLS is established and its validation is verified by experimental tests. Subsequently, the information of the moving vibration sources with different parameters is collected by the simulations and experiments to generate training data sets. Lastly, two typical data-driven methods (i.e., the random forest algorithm and support vector machine) are trained to identify the shape and size parameters of the moving vibration sources. The analysis results demonstrate that the developed ALLS is effective in vibration source perception, which enhances the function of underwater vehicles.

AB An ultra-short baseline (USBL) system and a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) system, both commonly applied for navigation and guidance of underwater vehicles, were tested with respect to their capabilities to support aquaculture net pen inspection by remote-operated-vehicles (ROVs). The data from these systems were investigated with respect to this new application and its operational demands. A series of full scale experiments indicate that the DVL system is able to detect sea pen nets equally well as the seabed, and the USBL system is able to transmit through a net pen containing industrial-scale biomass. A navigation system that uses a combination of these instruments will report the position of the ROV relatively to the net pen, and enable proper documentation of the traveled path. By equipping a suitable underwater vehicle with a combination of USBL and DVL technology, autonomous net inspections with reliable coverage can be achieved. Such a system would have considerable potential for remote and offshore aquaculture farming systems. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper is concerned with optimal trajectory control for two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a multisource localization environment. The received signal strength (RSS) at the UAVs in specified time intervals permits passive differential RSS (DRSS)-based localization of multiple radio frequency (RF) sources with unknown transmit powers. A steering algorithm is proposed to update the UAV waypoints in order to minimize the summation of the uncertainty of the source locations. The UAV paths are optimized by maximizing the determinant of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The FIM is approximated at successive waypoints using the estimated locations of the sources. In addition to maximizing the localization accuracy, the objectives of the proposed trajectory control are to minimize the number of UAVs, the mission time and the path length. As the DRSS is a non-linear measurement, an extended Kalman filter (EKF), which is a non-linear filtering technique, is considered in this paper. The efficiency of the approach is depicted through simulations.

AB The growth of civil and military use has recently promoted the development of unmanned miniature aerial vehicles dedicated to surveillance tasks. These flying vehicles are often capable of carrying only a few dozen grammes of payload. To achieve autonomy for this kind of aircraft novel sensors are required, which need to cope with strictly limited onboard processing power. One of the key aspects in autonomous behaviour is target tracking. Our visual tracking approach differs from other methods by not using expensive cameras but a Wii remote camera, i.e. commodity consumer hardware. The system works without stationary sensors and all processing is done with an onboard microcontroller. The only assumptions are a good roll and pitch attitude estimation, provided by an inertial measurement unit and a stationary pattern of four infrared spots on the target or the landing spot. This paper details experiments for hovering above a landing place, but tracking a slowly moving target is also possible.

TI Numerical comparison of steering geometries for robotic vehicles by

ID MOBILE; SYSTEMS; NAVIGATION
AB This paper describes an analytical method for modeling the positioning error of a robotic vehicle and examines how the metric of this error can be used to compare the geometries of various steering configuration. Positioning error can be caused by many factors stemming from the robot's hardware and software configurations and the interaction between the robot and its environment. A slip motion model that captures the effects of key factors that contribute to positioning error is presented. Robot kinematic models with and without slippage are reformulated and used to perform an in-depth assessment and characterization of positioning error. The method is applied to three characteristic advance and steering configurations: Ackermann, articulated, and explicitly steered. This analysis serves as a quantitative evaluation of the properties of the steering geometries for path tracking under identical slippage conditions. The method can also be used as a tool for comparing robot configurations to make trade-off decisions early in the design process, as it allows for derivation of predicted performance values of alternative steering geometries.

TI Autonomous underwater vehicles: The latest tool for archaeological

SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL

DT Article
AB In 2001, C & C Technologies, Inc. of Lafayette, Louisiana began using the HUGIN 3000 AUV in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore oil and gas surveys. This new survey vehicle is faster, more accurate, and more maneuverable than conventional deep-tow systems and has raised the bar for deepwater geophysical and hydro-graphic surveys. Although archaeology was not the primary purpose for developing the vehicle, archaeologists are and will continue to benefit from its use. Archaeological investigation with a conventional deep-tow system is seldom conducted during industry surveys because of the cost and time involved in operating such a system. However, during the first year of operation with the HUGIN 3000, four shipwrecks were investigated as a result of the HUGIN's cost effectiveness. The use of the HUGIN 3000 directly led to the discovery of the long sought after German submarine, U-166, which was located near its last victim, the passenger freighter SS Robert E. Lee. This AUV also helped document two additional newly discovered shipwrecks: The cargo freighter SS Alcoa Puritan and a small wooden sailing vessel known as the Mica wreck.

AB Fog computing is a key component of future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) that can support the high computation and large storage requirements needed for autonomous driving applications. A major challenge in such fog-enabled ITS networks is the design of algorithms that can reduce the computation times of different tasks by efficiently utilizing available computational resources. In this paper, we propose a data-enabled cooperative technique that offloads some parts of a task to the nearest fog roadside unit (RSU), depending on the current channel quality indicator (CQI). The rest of the task is offloaded to a nearby cooperative computing vehicle with available computing resources. We developed a cooperative computing vehicle selection technique using an artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction model that predicts both the computing availability once the task is offloaded to the potential computing vehicle and the link connectivity when the task result is to be transmitted back to the source vehicle. Using detailed simulation results in MATLAB 2020a software, we show the accuracy of our proposed prediction model. Furthermore, we also show that the proposed technique reduces total task delay by 37% compared to other techniques reported in the literature.

AB The mission of hypersonic vehicles faces the problem of highly nonlinear dynamics and complex environments, which presents challenges to the intelligent level and real-time performance of onboard guidance algorithms. In this paper, inverse reinforcement learning is used to address the hypersonic entry guidance problem. The state-control sample pairs and state-rewards sample pairs obtained by interacting with hypersonic entry dynamics are used to train the neural network by applying the distributed proximal policy optimization method. To overcome the sparse reward problem in the hypersonic entry problem, a novel reward function combined with a sophisticated discriminator network is designed to generate dense optimal rewards continuously, which is the main contribution of this paper. The optimized guidance methodology can achieve good terminal accuracy and high success rates with a small number of trajectories as datasets while satisfying heating rate, overload, and dynamic pressure constraints. The proposed guidance method is employed for two typical hypersonic entry vehicles (Common Aero Vehicle-Hypersonic and Reusable Launch Vehicle) to demonstrate the feasibility and potential. Numerical simulation results validate the real-time performance and optimality of the proposed method and indicate its suitability for onboard applications in the hypersonic entry flight.

AB mmWave radars play a vital role in autonomous systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), ground station control and monitoring systems. The challenging task when using mmWave radars is to estimate the accurate angle of arrival (AoA) of the targets, due to the limited number of receivers. In this paper, we present a novel AoA estimation technique, using mmWave FMCW radars operating in the frequency range 77-81 GHz by utilizing the mechanical rotation. Rotating the radar also increases the field of view in both azimuth and elevation. The proposed method estimates the AoA of the targets, using only a single transmitter and receiver. The measurements are carried out in a variety of practical scenarios including pedestrians, a car, and an UAV, also known as a drone. With measured data, range-angle maps are created, and morphological operators are used to estimate the AoA of the targets. We also process radar range-angle images for improved visual representation. The proposed method will be extremely beneficial for practical ground stations, traffic control and monitoring frameworks for both on-ground and airborne vehicles.

AB Agent-based models are a class of simulation in which many autonomous agents interact such that the mix of stochastic and deterministic actions each agent undertakes results in some emergent behaviour across the entire population. Such models have been used to explore the impacts of electric vehicles (EVs) on electricity grids. However, there has been little data available against which to validate this approach. In this study, we evaluate an agent based EV model against real data observed during the "My Electric Avenue" project; an Ofgem funded 3 year trial aiming to identify the impacts of EVs on local grids. We find that, within the constraints of the available trial data, the agent model is able to replicate dominant charging pattern features. The behaviour of owners will inevitably play a role in the actual charging patterns observed and we further explore how consumer adoption of time-of-use tariffs and vehicle range (battery capacity) preference would impact on demands at the local substation. We show that simplistic adoption of time-of-use tariffs would have undesirable consequences for network peak demands and that the expected increase in EV range and thus battery size, will both increase peaks and total energy supply to domestic properties.

DE Hydrodynamic; Numerical simulation; Winged submarine; Lift; Drag
AB In the current study it has been analyzed the submarine take-off and subsequent submarine flight of a novel unmanned vehicle, has two operational modes: on sea surface as USV1 vehicle and submarine mode as UUV2.
   In the submarine mode the vehicle operates with the wings in a horizontal position and a specific speed that is needed for the immersion. The vehicle does not function as an underwater glider; it functions closer to an underwater aircraft. For that reason, the performance must be evaluated as a function of the generated "Drag" and "Lift". Due to the nature of its double purpose, it is required to know the performances in two conditions: fully submerged and on surface. These two cases will be analyzed with different numerical models for both scenarios, with free surface for USV mode and for the UUV mode. These scenarios are set out with four different numerical models which are: central body with central wing, central wing, central wing with flaps at 20 degrees and wing on surface. To measure the correlation between generated lift and speed a 1:2 scale model was used and tested in open waters. The data gathered in those tests was used to validate the mentioned CFD simulations.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle needs to possess a certain degree of autonomy for any particular underwater mission to fulfil the mission objectives successfully and ensure its safety in all stages of the mission in a large-scale operating field. In this article, a novel combinatorial conflict-free task assignment strategy, consisting of an interactive engagement of a local path planner and an adaptive global route planner, is introduced. The method takes advantage of the heuristic search potency of the particle swarm optimization algorithm to address the discrete nature of routing-task assignment approach and the complexity of nondeterministic polynomial-time-hard path planning problem. The proposed hybrid method is highly efficient as a consequence of its reactive guidance framework that guarantees successful completion of missions particularly in cluttered environments. To examine the performance of the method in a context of mission productivity, mission time management, and vehicle safety, a series of simulation studies are undertaken. The results of simulations declare that the proposed method is reliable and robust, particularly in dealing with uncertainties, and it can significantly enhance the level of a vehicle's autonomy by relying on its reactive nature and capability of providing fast feasible solutions.

AB The problem of navigating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an unknown environment is addressed with a novel model predictive control (MPC) formulation, named multitrajectory MPC (mt-MPC). The objective is to safely drive the vehicle to the desired target location by relying only on the partial description of the surroundings provided by an exteroceptive sensor. This information results in time-varying constraints during the navigation among obstacles. The proposed mt-MPC generates a sequence of position set points that are fed to control loops at lower hierarchical levels. To do so, the mt-MPC predicts two different state trajectories, a safe one and an exploiting one, in the same finite horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP). This formulation, particularly suitable for problems with uncertain time-varying constraints, allows one to partially decouple constraint satisfaction (safety) from cost function minimization (exploitation). Uncertainty due to modeling errors and sensors noise is taken into account as well, in a set membership (SM) framework. Theoretical guarantees of persistent obstacle avoidance are derived under suitable assumptions, and the approach is demonstrated experimentally out-of-the-laboratory on a prototype built with off-the-shelf components.

AB This paper is concerned with the trajectory tracking control of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) subject to input quantization, actuator faults and dead zones. In scenarios with dense marine facilities, there are constraints on the tracking performance and convergence time of USVs. First, the designed control signal is quantized by a hysteresis quantizer to reduce the transmission rate. Second, to guarantee the transient and steady-state tracking performance of the USV, a prescribed performance control technology with a predefined settling time is employed. Third, a predefined-time adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) method is designed by integrating the auxiliary function and the barrier function. Moreover, the lumped uncertainties caused by quantization, actuator faults, and dead zones are simultaneously processed using control gain based on barrier function. The proposed control method guarantees that the tracking error and sliding variable converge to the corresponding predefined bounds within a predefined time. The predefined bounds are independent of the upper bound on the lumped uncertainty. The stability of the controlled system is proven via the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed controller is verified by numerical simulations.

ID EVENT DETECTION
AB Anomaly detection has been an active research area for decades, with high application potential. Recent work has explored deep learning approaches to the detection of abnormal behaviour and abandoned objects in outdoor video surveillance scenarios. The extension of this recent work to in-vehicle monitoring using solely visual data represents a relevant research opportunity that has been overlooked in the accessible literature. With the increasing importance of public and shared transportation for urban mobility, it becomes imperative to provide autonomous intelligent systems capable of detecting abnormal behaviour that threatens passenger safety. To investigate the applicability of current works to this scenario, a recapitulation of relevant state-of-the-art techniques and resources is presented, including available datasets for their training and benchmarking. The lack of public datasets dedicated to in-vehicle monitoring is addressed alongside other issues not considered in previous works, such as moving backgrounds and frequent illumination changes. Despite its relevance, similar surveys and reviews have disregarded this scenario and its specificities. This work initiates an important discussion on application-oriented issues, proposing solutions to be followed in future works, particularly synthetic data augmentation to achieve representative instances with the low amount of available sequences.

AB The development and the experimental validation of a workbench capable of supporting outdoor flights using basically the affordable commercial quadrotor AR.Drone 2.0 and a personal computer is considered in this article. The text discusses some technical details of the developed system, focusing on how to achieve real-time navigation adopting a simplified dynamic model as a high-level representation of the vehicle in flight, a general-purpose nonlinear controller, suitable for different types of control applications, and a sensor fusion algorithm, designed to compensate for delayed measurements in the available sensory data. To check the effectiveness of such testbed, results associated to some experimental flights are presented, with the vehicle accomplishing positioning tasks, considering a fixed target point and a sequence of waypoints, and trajectory tracking tasks. Such results, associated to the theoretical analysis provided, allow claiming that the proposed system is an efficient way to guide the vehicle to accomplish different tasks. Additionally, the source code used is available for free download and modification, resulting in a valuable open-source workbench for researchers just starting working with aerial robotics.

AB Due to the complicated and changing urban traffic conditions and the dynamic mobility of vehicles, the network topology can rapidly change which causes the communication links between vehicles disconnected frequently, and further affects the performance of vehicular networking. To overcome this problem, we propose a intelligent multi-attribute routing scheme (MARS) for two-layered software-defined vehicle networks (SDVNs). The proposed scheme is divided into two phases, the routing path calculation and the multi-attribute vehicle autonomous routing decision-making. In this paper, we construct the topology diagram in SDVNs for finding the efficient routing paths. To increase the packet arrival rate and reduce the end-to-end delay, an intelligent multi-attribute routing scheme is proposed by employing fuzzy logic and design a technique of order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) algorithm to find the next-hop forwarder. To solve the uncertainty problem of multiple attributes, we apply the fuzzy logic to identify the weight of each attribute in TOPSIS algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that MARS can effectively improve packet delivery ratio and reduce average end-to-end delay in urban environments compared with its counterparts.

AB Inspired by the background adaptive mechanism of eagle vision in different hunting environment, a biological eagle-eye vision adaptation mechanism algorithm is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to detect the long-distance maritime small target in complex and changeable sea environment. First, the various environment adjustment abilities are summarized according to the physiological structures and characteristics of eagle vision. Second, the mathematical models of glaring adaptation, dim adaptation, color adaptation, and the background adaptation are established based on the background adaptation mechanisms of eagle vision. Last but not least, our proposed biological eagle-eye vision adaptation method and other five comparative experiments are implemented in different scenes, such as dazzling, cloudy, dusk, etc. The results of various evaluation indices show that the information of maritime small target is retained satisfactorily and the background of sea or sky is restrained effectively by the proposed algorithm. The maritime small target detection algorithm can be used for the vision system of UAV operating on the sea. It provides a feasible solution for UAV's remote vision autonomous navigation in changeable sea environment.

AB A vehicular ad hoc network possesses highly advanced functioning in the intelligent transportation system. This system helps moving nodes equipped with advanced smart devices, to establish reliable communication with vehicles or usable roadside units (RSUs). It has been ascertained that the privacy of the user is essential in vehicular communication to share resources among both unknown vehicles and unknown RSUs. There are some privacy-preserving authentication schemes based on number-theoretic assumptions, but they do not support security against quantum computers due to Shor's algorithm. Moreover, these schemes have disfavor with repeated authentication of the earlier transmitted message and being unsuccessful to search messages no longer valid during batch verification. To resolve most of the existing issues, this article brings something new to an environment, that is, edge-computing construction into the message-verification procedure of the system. In the proposed design, a RSU can expeditiously verify messages from nearby legitimate vehicles and broadcast to all vehicles within its communication range, which leads to a reduction in redundant verification of messages. To ensure security against quantum attacks, we have introduced an advanced design based on the hardness of a short integer solution in some random lattice. This framework guarantees autonomous driving, regular vehicular traffic flow, and a process of revocation in the advanced quantum era.

AB With the development of Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV), there will be a long-term heterogeneous traffic flow composed of Manual Vehicles (MVs) and CAVs on the road. Firstly, this study explores the traffic composition and distribution characteristics of heterogeneous traffic flow considering the limitation of communication range and CAV degradation. Secondly, we conduct a corresponding linear stability analysis for the heterogeneous traffic flow and introduce different types of time delays into the stability analysis framework. Thirdly, we verify theoretical derivation results through nonlinear numerical simulation. Finally, the influence of platoon management and time delays on the linear stability of heterogeneous traffic flow is explored. The results show that, at first, the stability of heterogeneous traffic flow deteriorates due to the involvement of CAV, and does not grow until the CAV market penetration rate reaches a certain threshold. In the speed range greater than 23.08 m/s, the heterogeneous traffic flow is constantly stable. Platoon management can significantly improve the linear stability of heterogeneous traffic flow with a high CAV market penetration rate, while time delays have a negative effect on the linear stability of heterogeneous traffic flow.

AB The successful deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) will largely depend on public opinion. Expectations and concerns are essential components driving the speed of market uptake and final adoption of these technologies. We have studied user expectations and concerns, as well as their provenance, by conducting a series of Focus Group (FG) discussions with transport area experts and non-expert participants, in Italy, Germany, and Spain. Together with user acceptance, potential advantages and disadvantages that CAVs may bring at a societal level were explored. Results show that benefits like increased safety and accessibility and improved travel experience for both driver and passengers could support CAVs' deployment. Nevertheless, a variety of concerns were raised during the discussions, related to privacy, responsibility in case of an accident, and increase in maintenance and repair costs. These aspects could significantly hamper or delay CAVs acceptability and need to be carefully considered by stakeholders. The reported insights from the FG discussions and the fact that some participants noted positive changes of their initial idea of CAVs due to their participation in the discussion, exemplify the importance of citizen engagement activities to address mobility challenges.

AB In a dynamic lateral motion model with a look-ahead distance, curved and winding roads appear as an unmatched disturbance to a lane-tracking control system. In this article, an innovative vehicular robust lane-tracking control scheme is proposed to compensate for the problematic winding road disturbance (WRD) that always appears unless the road has zero curvature. We propose a design for a WRD compensator (WRDC) to substantially improve the lane-tracking control performance on a winding road in the presence of the WRD. The WRDC redesigns the state-space reference, rather than calculating the additional control input. We show that the proposed WRDC ensures that the projected tracking error decreases to zero. To validate the usefulness of the robust lane-tracking control, the WRDC is compared to other conventional methods. We observe that the proposed WRDC is not only robust against road curvature variation, but also outperforms the lane-tracking control performance of other popular methods.

AB The development of launch and recovery technology is key for the application to the unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Also, a launch and recovery system (L&RS) based on a pneumatic ejection mechanism has been developed in our previous study. To improve the launch accuracy and reduce the influence of the sea waves, we propose a stacking model of one-dimensional convolutional neural network and long short-term memory neural network predicting the attitude of the USV. The data from experiments by "Jinghai VII" USV developed by Shanghai University, China, under levels 1-4 sea conditions are used to train and test the network. The results show that the stabilized platform with the proposed prediction method can keep the launching angle of the launching mechanism constant by regulating the pitching joint and rotation joint under the random influence from the wave. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of the L&RS are demonstrated by the successful application in actual environments.

TI Real-Time Density Detection in Connected Vehicles: Design and

SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE

DT Article
ID NETWORKS
AB Density information plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems for not only traffic control but also information sharing. Existing products have been able to provide coarse-grained density services. For example, Google Maps can illustrate the traffic conditions by different colors via Internet connection. Vehicle-to-vehicle wireless communications can locally acquire the density by information exchange and neighbor counting. However, either the Internet access or one-by-one counting leads to a sub-second-level delay, which cannot satisfy real-time vehicular applications such as autonomous navigation and data dissemination. To speed up density acquisition, we propose an RDD system. Leveraging the frequency resource, RDD divides the wireless channel into fine-grained subchannels and detects the neighbors in a parallel manner. We establish a testbed using software defined radios and experimentally validate RDD. Moreover, to evaluate RDD in high-density scenarios, extensive simulations are conducted based on real collected data. Both the experiment and simulation results demonstrate that RDD achieves 100 ms level density detection, while the state-of-the-art time-domain acceleration method is at the 10 ms level.

AB This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) powered multi-user intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) backscatter communication (BackCom). In such a system, an IRS as a passive transmitter sends multiple data streams towards multiple users in a manner of BackCom, while a UAV serves as a mobile power beacon for flexibly supplying radio frequency signals. To maximize the sum rate of all the users, the trajectory of the UAV and its transmit beamforming, as well as the passive beamforming at the IRS, are optimized jointly. Specifically, a block coordinate descent method is firstly leveraged to decompose the original non-convex optimization problem into three tractable subproblems. By developing an alternate iterative algorithm, the transmit beamforming at the UAV, the passive beamforming at the IRS, and the trajectory of the UAV are circularly optimized by employing fractional programming, semidefinite programming, reinforcement learning, etc. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization scheme is feasible in the proposed IRS backscatter communication network.

AB In developing countries, motorcycle riders typically perform lane filtering at signalized urban intersections. This study aims to determine the factors that affect the lateral clearance of motorcycle riders as they travel between two lanes of mixed traffic at signalized urban intersections in developing countries. In this study, an onboard measurement device was developed to measure the lane-filtering behavior of motorcycle riders. It was installed on a test motorcycle to continuously record the lateral clearance, riding behavior, and surrounding traffic conditions. Thirty participants rode the test motorcycle through a signalized urban intersection. Multilevel linear regression was applied to analyze the relationship between lateral clearance and relevant variables at a significance level of 0.05. The instant speed and side of the filtering motorcycle, condition of the lateral vehicle, type of lateral vehicle, and riding frequency of the motorcycle rider significantly influenced the lateral clearance. The findings of this study can contribute to filtering lane management, connected autonomous vehicles, and microscopic traffic simulations for motorcycles traveling in mixed traffic at signalized urban intersections.

AB Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) have been playing an increasingly important role in military and civilian operations and been widely used in various applications. The main issue associated with the development and design of UUV's is the control system design. These vehicles have nonlinear dynamics and coupling, and tend to exhibit time varying characteristics. In addition they are subject to different environmental disturbances. Successful completion of the UUV missions depends on the control provided by the autopilot unit mounted on board. These controllers need to be tuned and analysed before implementing them in real environment. In the present work, the first objective is to demonstrate the capability of adaptive network fuzzy inference system, namely ANFIS for modelling of UUVs and the second objective is to design a fuzzy controller using the ANFIS model. The input output data from the UUV are used for the ANFIS modelling. This model is used in the design and validation of the fuzzy controller and the results are compared with a conventional PID controller.

We show that that by using a calibrated camera, conic sections, and the assumption that yaw is controlled independently, it is possible to determine the six degrees-of-freedom pose of the MAV. First we show how to detect the landmark in the image frame. Then we present a geometric approach for camera pose estimation from the elliptic appearance of a circle in perspective projection. Using this information we are able to determine the pose of the vehicle. Finally, given a set point in the image frame we are able to control the quadrotor such that the feature appears in the respective target position. The performance of the proposed method is presented through experimental results.

ID SPEED
AB In this article, we demonstrate the use of interferometric radar for high-accuracy measurement of the ground speed of a moving vehicle. Recent work has shown the capability of radar systems using interferometric antenna apertures to directly measure the angular velocity of objects. In this work, we apply this new measurement to the automotive application of velocity estimation. We start by formulating the interferometric response from a ground surface, which is modeled as a summation of independent point scatterers. Next, we present two velocity estimation methods: a Bayesian method that uses a signal model and a neural network-based approach. We then describe a 40-GHz interferometric radar system that we have developed and present on-vehicle measurements. Finally, we present the results of the two estimators and compare these results with the theoretical accuracy of the system. We show that the Bayesian and neural net estimators achieved a root-mean-square velocity error of 0.403 and 0.183 m/s, respectively.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) arc expected to play an important role in the future of farming. Because UAVs can provide precise, real-time information on biotic and abiotic stressors in agricultural production while they can also carry out autonomous operations to counter them, they can enhance farm profitability while reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Yet little is known about the current adoption of UAVs in agriculture or about the profile of the adopters. In this study we report actual and expected adoption of UAVs for a rich cross section of crop farmers and examine the factors that shape such adoption. In our empirical analysis we describe the inherent farmer heterogeneity - as shaped by differential awareness of UAV applications, perceptions of technical complexities, expectations of economic and environmental benefits and various socioeconomic factors - and analyze which of all these factors shape individual farmer adoption of UAVs. We also estimate and describe a small number of farmer segments that might adequately describe general population tendencies in the adoption of UAVs.

ID AWARENESS
AB This paper aims at evaluating the capabilities to detect road traversability in urban and extra-urban scenarios of support vector machine-based classifiers that use local descriptors extracted from point cloud data. The evaluation of the proposed classifiers is carried out by using four different kernels and comparing five point descriptors obtained from geometric and appearance-based features. A comparison among the performance of descriptors individually has demonstrated that the normal vector-based descriptor achieves an accuracy of 88%, outperforming by about 6%-15% all the other considered ones. To further improve the interpretation capabilities, the space of features is augmented by merging the components of each point descriptor, reaching 92% classification accuracy. A set of test scenarios have been acquired during an extensive experimental campaign using an all-terrain vehicle. Tests on real data show high classification performance for road scenarios and rural environments; the generality of the method makes it applicable for different types of mobile robots including, but not limited to, autonomous vehicles.

AB Collaborative driving is a growing domain of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that makes use of communications to autonomously guide cooperative vehicles on an. automated highway system (AHS). In this paper, we address this issue by using a platoon of cars considered as more or less autonomous software agents. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical driving agent architecture based on three layers (guidance layer, management layer and traffic control layer). This architecture has been used to develop centralized platoons, where the driving agent of the head vehicle coordinates other driving agents by applying strict rules, and decentralized platoons, where the platoon is considered as a group of driving agents with a similar degree of autonomy, trying to maintain a stable platoon. The latter decentralized model mainly considers an agent teamwork model based on a multiagent architecture, known as STEAM. The centralized and decentralized coordination models are finally compared using results from simulation scenarios that highlight safety, time efficiency and communication efficiency aspects for each model.

AB Software-defined vehicular networks (SDVN) can help analyze and reconfigure networks. Massive data generation in autonomous vehicles can lead to issues in network configuration, routing, network characteristics, and system load factors. Load balancing in vehicle sensors helps reduce delays and improve resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a load balancing algorithm to map sensor data, vehicles and data centers performing tasks. A dynamic convergence method is proposed to help identify vehicle system load factors and compare their termination criteria. We also propose a packet-level intrusion detection model. After all load balancing, the model can track the attack on the network. The proposed model further combines the entropy-based active learning and the attention-based model to efficiently identify the attacks. Experiments are then conducted on the standard KDD data to validate the developed models with and without an attention-based active learning mechanism. Our experimental results show that the load balancing mechanism is able to achieve more performance gains than previous techniques. Moreover, the results show that the developed model can improve the decision boundary by using a pooling strategy and an entropy uncertainty measure.

AB Strapdown inertial navigation system/celestial navigation system (SINS/CNS) integrated navigation is a fully autonomous and high precision method, which has been widely used to improve the hitting accuracy and quick reaction capability of near-Earth flight vehicles. The installation errors between SINS and star sensors have been one of the main factors that restrict the actual accuracy of SINS/CNS. In this paper, an integration algorithm based on the star vector observations is derived considering the star sensor installation error. Then, the star sensor installation error is accurately estimated based on Kalman Filtering (KF). Meanwhile, a local observability analysis is performed on the rank of observability matrix obtained via linearization observation equation, and the observable conditions are presented and validated. The number of star vectors should be greater than or equal to 2, and the times of posture adjustment also should be greater than or equal to 2. Simulations indicate that the star sensor installation error could be readily observable based on the maneuvering condition; moreover, the attitude errors of SINS are less than 7 arc-seconds. This analysis method and conclusion are useful in the ballistic trajectory design of near-Earth flight vehicles.

AB We present the development and experimental validation of an autonomous surface/underwater vehicle control strategy that leverages the environmental dynamics and uncertainty to navigate in a stochastic fluidic environment. We assume that the workspace is composed of the union of a collection of disjoint regions, each bounded by Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs). LCSs are dynamical features in the flow field that behave like invariant manifolds in general time-invariant dynamical systems and delineate the boundaries of attraction basins. We analyze a passive particle's noise-induced transition between adjacent LCS-bounded regions and show how most probable escape trajectories with respect to the transition probability between adjacent LCS-bounded regions can be determined. Additionally, we show how the likelihood of transition can be controlled through minimal actuation. The result is an energy efficient navigation strategy that leverages the inherent dynamics of the surrounding flow field for mobile sensors operating in a noisy fluidic environment. We experimentally validate the proposed vehicle control strategy and analyze its theoretical properties. Our results show that the single vehicle control parameter exhibits a predictable exponential scaling with respect to the escape times and is effective even in situations where the structure of the flow is not fully known and control effort is costly.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present in a wide range of scales, airframe types and possible systems configurations. Assessing how these different systems perform, therefore, should be an essential part of their design. This task, however, is particularly difficult due to the complex, dynamic interactions these vehicles are capable of, and the often complex operational conditions. In this paper we describe and apply an evaluation framework based on spatial cost-to-go (SCTG) maps. These maps describe the spatial distributions of optimal state and cost-to-go for a given geographical environment, and are computed using a finite-state approximation of the vehicle dynamics. The SCTG maps embed the interaction effects between vehicle dynamics and environment, and thus provide a rigorous basis for the evaluation of the airframe, various system and environment factors. The paper describes the results obtained applying this framework to a basic goal-directed guidance task taking place in an urban environment. Three small-scale UAV types are compared: a fixed-wing aircraft, a standard helicopter, and a quad-rotorcraft. Both minimum-time and minimum-energy performance criteria are analyzed to determine overall performance characteristics and highlight the basic features of the proposed framework.

TI Fast vehicle detection based on colored point cloud with bird's eye view

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB RGB cameras and LiDAR are crucial sensors for autonomous vehicles that provide complementary information for accurate detection. Recent early-level fusion-based approaches, flourishing LiDAR data with camera features, may not accomplish promising performance ascribable to the immense difference between two modalities. This paper presents a simple and effective vehicle detection method based on an early-fusion strategy, unified 2D BEV grids, and feature fusion. The proposed method first eliminates many null point clouds through cor-calibration. It augments point cloud data by color information to generate 7D colored point cloud, and unifies augmented data into 2D BEV grids. The colored BEV maps can then be fed to any 2D convolution network. A peculiar Feature Fusion (2F) detection module is utilized to extract multiple scale features from BEV images. Experiments on the KITTI public benchmark and Nuscenes dataset show that fusing RGB image with point cloud rather than raw point cloud can lead to better detection accuracy. Besides, the inference time of the proposed method reaches 0.05 s/frame thanks to its simple and compact architecture.

AB As the paradigm of future vehicles changes, the interest in automotive semiconductor, which plays a key role in realizing this, is increasing. Automotive semiconductors are the technology with very high entry barriers that require a lot of effort and time because it must secure technology readiness level and also consider safety and reliability. In this technology field, it is very important to develop new businesses and create opportunities through technology trend analysis. However, systematic analysis and application of automotive semiconductor technology trends are currently lacking. In this paper, U.S. registered patent documents related to automotive semiconductor were collected and investigated based on the patent's IPC. The main technology of automotive semiconductor was analyzed through topic modeling, and the technology path such as emerging technology was investigated through cosine similarity. We identified that those emerging technologies such as driving control for vehicle and AI service appeared. We observed that as time passed, both convergence and independence of automotive semiconductor technology proceeded simultaneously

AB The Office of Naval Research sponsored the omnidirectional vehicle (ODV) development program of the Coastal Systems Station (CSS). CSS has investigated the application of ODV technology to Navy shipboard materials and ordnance handling. Under the Navy program, ODV technology was developed and a series of vehicles were built and tested. ODT technology was demonstrated to be applicable to the shipboard environment and shown to be able to overcome conditions of confined spaces, reduced traction, ship motion, decks heeled at high angles, and on-deck obstacles. This paper focuses on the Navy's demonstration of the capability of the ODV to operate under demanding environmental conditions, ODV mechanical simplicity, and adaptability of the technology for a wide range of applications. Potential commercial applications were identified in manufacturing and warehousing, and remotely controlled or autonomous platforms employed in nuclear facilities, hazardous waste cleanup, and other operations that require the movement and precise positioning of large, heavy objects. The Navy has implemented two cooperative research and development agreements (CRADA) and others are pending for further development and transfer of ODV technology to the private sector.

AB The challenges of point cloud registration in intelligent vehicle driving lie in the large scale, complex distribution, high noise, and strong sparsity of lidar point cloud data. This paper proposes an efficient registration algorithm for large-scale outdoor road scenes by selecting the continuous distribution of key area laser point clouds as the registration point cloud. The algorithm extracts feature descriptions of the key point cloud and introduces local geometric features of the point cloud to complete rough and fine registration under constraints of key point clouds and point cloud features. The algorithm is verified through extensive experiments under multiple scenarios, with an average registration time of 0.5831 s and an average accuracy of 0.06996 m, showing significant improvement compared to other algorithms. The algorithm is also validated through real-vehicle experiments, demonstrating strong versatility, reliability, and efficiency. This research has the potential to improve environment perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles by solving the point cloud registration problem in large outdoor scenes.

AB Motorized Two Wheelers (MTWs) possess specific driving patterns which increase their crash risk, especially in heterogeneous traffic, typically found in developing countries. Understanding the driving behavior of MTWs in such conditions is crucial for transportation researchers and vehicle manufacturers to improve driving behavior modeling, vehicle design, and risk evaluation. This study aims to model single-leader following behavior of MTWs in mixed traffic, by using Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) technique to develop a safe-distance following model considering various factors specific to mixed traffic. Time to Collision (TTC) and Potential Index for Collision with Urgent Deceleration (PICUD) were employed for the safety assessment. Results of the study present a typical MTW following behavior and associated crash risk for heterogeneous traffic. Apart from theoretical applications such as microsimulation modeling, this study is useful for smart systems such as collision avoidance systems, in-vehicle warning and autonomous driving systems.

AB We propose a comprehensive numerical procedure to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients of a moving body with NACA0012 hydrofoil by means of Computational fluid dynamics (CFD). To accomplish maneuverability study and dynamic analysis of an Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), these hydrodynamic coefficients were obtained by finding the body hydrodynamic responses to some specified time variant motions. Here, on the basis of linearized equations of motion in which the hydrodynamic coefficients appear explicitly, three distinct oscillating maneuvers are proposed. To obtain the hydrodynamic responses of the moving body, a CFD method based on Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations was used with dynamic mesh technique to simulate the specified maneuvers. To verify the numerical scheme, the computational results were then validated by comparison with experimental data. Hydrodynamic coefficients were calculated from resulting hydrodynamic loads. Finally, the effects of oscillating motions frequency and amplitude variations on the hydrodynamic coefficients were investigated.

AB This paper considers the question of stabilizing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using a minimal and an inexpensive sensor suite. The sensor suite considered consists of rate gyros and a single embedded video camera system. The approach taken is based on the principles of dynamic image-based visual servo control and extends the authors' earlier work by removing dependence on additional sensors, such as accelerometers and magnetometers. The technique presented has potential for mini-UAVs evolving in urban areas where global positioning system signals may not be available. The control algorithms and coupled state observers are presented in details. The main result of the paper is synthesized in a theorem along with a rigorous stability analysis of the closed-loop system. An estimate of the basin of attraction for the closed-loop system is provided. Simulation results are performed to illustrate the performance of the proposed control.

AB Backstepping is a control technique based on Lyapunov's theory that has been successfully implemented in the control of motors and robots by several nonlinear methods. However, there are no standardized methods for tuning control gains (unlike the PIDs). This paper shows the tuning gains of the backstepping controller, using Genetic Algorithms (GA), for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), quadrotor type, designed for autonomous trajectory tracking. First, a dynamic model of the vehicle is obtained through the Newton-Euler methodology. Then, the control law is obtained, and self-tuning is performed, through which we can obtain suitable values of the gains in order to achieve the design requirements. In this work, the establishment time and maximum impulse are considered as such. The tuning and simulations of the system response were performed using the MATLAB-Simulink environment, obtaining as a result the compliance of the design parameters and the correct tracking of different trajectories. The results show that self-tuning by means of genetic algorithms satisfactorily adjusts for the gains of a backstepping controller applied to a quadrotor and allows for the implementation of a control system that responds appropriately to errors of different magnitude.

DE UAV swarm; Energy management; Recharge; Decision making; Communication
AB Automated maintenance has become a necessity for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems to function in remote environments for an extended period of time with a higher number of vehicles. Once removed from the energy management loop, the human operator is free to concentrate on higher level task management and data analysis. This paper firstly describes the design, test and construction of an autonomous Ground Recharge Stations (GRS) for battery-powered quadrotor helicopter. In order to incorporate the charging of the quadrotors in the overall swarm behaviour, the focus of the research presented here has been to reduce the charging phase of a single vehicle by developing safer electrical contacts and using a balancer in the charging process. The amount of extra current available from the new design easily pushed the flying-time/charging-time ratio of the quadrotors over 1. The paper then describes a novel approach for the integration of this technology into an energy efficient multi-agent system. The development of a prioritisation function and queuing protocols between the UAVs and GRSs demonstrate an optimised solution to the assignment problem dependent on the mission profile. Numerical experiments show that the system's energy management remains efficient regardless of number and position of the platforms, or nature of the environment.

AB This paper describes a controlled self-motion study recently carried out using a small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in a controlled environment in which regular and random waves can be generated accurately for various frequencies and heights. In this study, the AUV was one of the Florida Atlantic University's Ocean Explorer series vehicles, and the controlled environment was chosen to be the Maneuvering And Sea-Keeping (MASK) facilities located at the David Taylor Model Basin. During the entire study, 29 sets of experimental motion and wave data were collected under various wave frequencies and heights, vehicle alignment, and operating depths. Due to the wave tank constraint, the vehicle speed was restricted to be less than 1.5 m/s and the wave frequency higher than 0.3 Hz without significantly affecting the self-motion analysis. Time history and power spectral density results suggest that the roll-induced pitching response was considerably larger for the wave frequencies tested, as compared to the pitch-induced rolling response. Standard deviation results reveal that the existing OEX is capable of producing approximately 3 degrees (peak-to-peak) pitch, 0.7 degrees (peak-to-peak) roll, and 0.6 degrees (peak-to-peak) yaw at 2-m depth in the head-sea condition when the encountering wave frequency is close to 0.4 Hz. However, at 1.5-m vehicle depth, significant surges were observed in pitching and rolling motion, suggesting that the OEX is currently unsuitable to maintain accurate depth-following within this range at sea-state 2 or higher. It is hoped that the results presented can provide better insights into how a small AUV with a nonideal body shape reacts to waves of different sea states, and how vehicle self-motion can be streamlined by choosing proper vehicle speed, heading, and depth, given that the wave characteristics are available.

TI Object Detection for Agricultural Vehicles: Ensemble Method Based on
   Hierarchy of Classes
SO SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
DE object detection; ensemble methods; agricultural vehicles
AB Vision-based object detection is essential for safe and efficient field operation for autonomous agricultural vehicles. However, one of the challenges in transferring state-of-the-art object detectors to the agricultural domain is the limited availability of labeled datasets. This paper seeks to address this challenge by utilizing two object detection models based on YOLOv5, one pre-trained on a large-scale dataset for detecting general classes of objects and one trained to detect a smaller number of agriculture-specific classes. To combine the detections of the models at inference, we propose an ensemble module based on a hierarchical structure of classes. Results show that applying the proposed ensemble module increases mAP@.5 from 0.575 to 0.65 on the test dataset and reduces the misclassification of similar classes detected by different models. Furthermore, by translating detections from base classes to a higher level in the class hierarchy, we can increase the overall mAP@.5 to 0.701 at the cost of reducing class granularity.

AB The automation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been greatly promoted by visual object tracking methods with onboard cameras. However, the random and complicated real noise produced by the cameras seriously hinders the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) UAV trackers, especially in low-illumination environments. To address this issue, this work proposes an efficient plug-and-play cascaded denoising Transformer (CDT) to suppress cluttered and complex real noise, thereby boosting UAV tracking performance. Specifically, the novel U-shaped cascaded denoising network is designed with a streamlined structure for efficient computation. Additionally, shallow feature deepening (SFD) encoder and multi-feature collaboration (MFC) decoder are constructed based on multi-head transposed self-attention (MTSA) and multi-head transposed cross-attention (MTCA), respectively. A nested residual feed-forward network (NRFN) is developed to focus more on high-frequency information represented by noise. Extensive evaluation and test experiments demonstrate that the proposed CDT has a remarkable denoising effect and improves UAV nighttime tracking performance.

TI Deep Visual Waterline Detection for Inland Marine Unmanned Surface

AB Waterline usually plays as an important visual cue for the autonomous navigation of marine unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in specific waters. However, the visual complexity of the inland waterline presents a significant challenge for the development of highly efficient computer vision algorithms tailored for waterline detection in a complicated inland water environment that marine USVs face. This paper attempts to find a solution to guarantee the effectiveness of waterline detection for the USVs with a general digital camera patrolling variable inland waters. To this end, a general deep-learning-based paradigm for inland marine USVs, named DeepWL, is proposed, which consists of two cooperative deep models (termed WLdetectNet and WLgenerateNet, respectively). They afford a continuous waterline image-map estimation from a single video stream captured on board. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach via qualitative and quantitative assessment on the concerned performances. Moreover, due to its own generality, the proposed approach has the potential to be applied to the waterline detection tasks of other water areas such as coastal waters.
