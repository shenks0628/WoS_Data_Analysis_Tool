AB Considering the user mobility and unpredictable mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, this paper studies the intelligent task offloading problem in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled MEC with the assistance of digital twin (DT). We aim at minimizing the energy consumption of the entire MEC system by jointly optimizing mobile terminal users (MTUs) association, UAV trajectory, transmission power distribution and computation capacity allocation while respecting the constraints of mission maximum processing delays. Specifically, double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm stemming from deep reinforcement learning is first proposed to effectively solve the problem of MTUs association and UAV trajectory. Then, the closed-form expression is employed to handle the problem of transmission power distribution and the computation capacity allocation problem is further addressed via an iterative algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme is able to converge and significantly reduce the total energy consumption of the MEC system compared to the benchmark schemes.

AB The objective of the study was to identify the number and national fraction of crashes that could be affected by universal adoption of conditionally automated vehicles (SAE3) based on the expected number of injury crashes, fatalities, and serious injuries in Finland. The study considered passenger cars with automated driving systems (ADS) for motorways and urban areas. The results show that of the national annual average, the motorway ADS has the potential to affect at maximum 3.3% of injury crashes, 3.1% of fatalities, and 3.2% of serious injuries. The corresponding fractions for urban ADS in the four largest Finnish cities were: 2.2%, 1.1% and 2.5%. Of the cities' annual average, urban ADS has the potential to affect at the most 17.4% of injury crashes, 17.1% of fatalities, and 26.8% of serious injuries. Although the market introduction of these ADS is on the horizon, deployment can be expected to be slow, indicating a need for additional measures to reach the traffic safety goals.

AB This letter considers an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) system in the presence of an aerial eavesdropper (ARE), which is able to launch the attacks by allocating the false signaling transfer channels to the ground devices (GDs). To defend against such attacks, we design an asymmetric Colonel Blotto (CB) game framework to formulate the competitive channel allocation problem for the UAV as a defender and the ARE as an attacker. The competitive interaction between the defender and the attacker in their channel allocations to the GDs is modeled as the competition of two players in the CB game for limited resources over a finite set of battlefields. In addition, we derive the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium solution to the game for the asymmetric resources between two players. As results, we show that the proposed game framework achieves considerable performance gains for the expected total payoff that the defender receives across the battlefield set compared to the baseline schemes.

AB This paper provides a hierarchical dynamic mission planning framework for an AUV to accomplish task-assign process in a restricted time operating in uncertain undersea environment. A high-level reactive mission planner is developed for task priority assignment, guiding the vehicle toward a target of interest, and managing on-time mission completion. A low-level motion planner is also developed to handle unexpected changes of the dynamic terrain by re-generating optimal trajectories. The mission planner reactively rearranges the tasks based on mission/terrain updates. As a result, the vehicle is able to undertake the maximum number of tasks with certain degree of maneuverability having situational awareness of the operating field. The Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm is used as the computational engine of the framework in both mission and motion planners. The simulations results indicate the significant potential of the proposed hierarchical framework in providing efficient solutions for mission success and its applicability for real-time implementation.

AB This paper proposes a feedback control strategy to let the dynamics of a class of under-actuated vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aerial vehicle tracking a desired position and attitude trajectory globally with respect to the initial conditions. The proposed feedback controller is derived following an inner-outer loop control paradigm, namely by considering the attitude, which is governed by means of a hybrid controller so as to overcome the well-known topological constraints, serving as a virtual input to stabilize the aircraft position. Two different approaches, the first one obtained by assuming perfect knowledge of the vehicle dynamics and the second one obtained by considering uncertainties and exogenous disturbances, are proposed and compared by analyzing the interconnection between the hybrid attitude and the continuous-time position closed-loop subsystems. The effectiveness of the obtained results is demonstrated by means of simulations and experiments using a miniature quadrotor prototype.

AB State-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicles are typically able to autonomously execute a preplanned mission. However, unmanned aerial vehicles usually fly in a very dynamic environment that requires dynamic changes to the flight plan; this mission management activity is usually tasked to human supervision. Through the use of a set of theoretical concepts that allow the description of a flight plan, a software system that autonomously accomplishes the mission management task for an unmanned aerial vehicle was developed. The system was implemented using a combination of Soar intelligent agents and traditional control techniques, and it is thoroughly described in the first part of the paper. An extensive testing campaign, based on the use of a realistic simulation environment, was performed on the system; the second part of this paper presents results obtained during this campaign. The system was demonstrated to be capable of automatically generating and executing an entire flight plan after being assigned a set of objectives. In conclusion, possible future developments are discussed, focusing in particular on prospective hardware implementation for the system.

AB The discrete control problem of vertical take-off and landing unmanned aerial vehicle (VTOL UAV) in the presence of time-varying uncertain disturbances is developed in this paper. The complexity of control problem is managed by dividing the dynamical model into two subsystems i.e. translational dynamics and rotational dynamics, where each subsystem is composed of three states. A discrete-time quasi-sliding mode control (DTQSMC) is extended to maintain the trajectory tracking control by proposing a new-reaching law for VTOL UAV. A robust controller is designed to handle unknown time-varying disturbances acting upon the translational and rotational dynamics. Moreover, the proposed controller is designed to reduce the chattering issue that commonly appears in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). Rigorous mathematical proof is presented to analyze the stability of the entire closed-loop system. The performance of this design is demonstrated with numerous numerical analyses and simulations.

AB This study analysed consumers' preferences regarding the technological attributes of automated vehicles (AV) and the driving environment. We conducted a conjoint survey among 1008 respondents in Korea. Based on the collected data, a utility function was estimated using a mixed logit model, considering the heterogeneity of the respondents' preferences. In the conjoint survey design, we considered six core technological and economic attributes of automated driving: road conditions, weather conditions, ambient lighting conditions, fuel efficiency, automated driving level, and price. The empirical results show high heterogeneity in consumers' attitudes towards AV technologies. By comparing the relative importance of these six attributes, we found that the price of the automated driving option is the most important attribute, followed by road conditions. Furthermore, the predicted market share of AVs, considering their technological evolution, shows that affordable price is an important factor for their diffusion.

In particular, the proposed solution cleverly shifts battery charging to off-peak periods and adjusts the charging duration in order to reduce costs. First, the problem is carefully carved in a mixed integer linear programming model. Second, a constraint programming model is built. Third, a combined model is constructed to exploit the strengths of both models. The computational study based on the well-known benchmarking test instances demonstrates we can reduce the electricity cost by 3.1% on average while not compromising other objectives. We provides benchmarking instances and CPLEX source codes, in order to promote related-research, thus expediting the adoption of energy-efficient scheduling by autonomous taxi company.

AB Stable and accurate attitude estimation is the key to the autonomous control of unmanned aerial vehicle. The Attitude Heading Reference System using micro-electro-mechanical system inertial measurement unit and magnetic sensor as measurement sensors is an indispensable system for attitude estimation of the unmanned aerial vehicle. Aiming at the problem of low precision of the Attitude Heading Reference System caused by the nonlinear attitude model of the micro unmanned aerial vehicle, an attitude heading reference algorithm based on cubature Kalman filter is proposed. Aiming at the nonlocal sampling problem of cubature Kalman filter, the transformed cubature Kalman filter using orthogonal transformation of the sampling point is presented. Meanwhile, an adaptive estimation algorithm of motion acceleration using Kalman filter is proposed, which realizes the online estimation of motion acceleration. The car-based tests show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can accurately estimate the carrier's motion attitude and motion acceleration without global positioning system. The accuracy of acceleration reaches 0.2 m/s(2), and the accuracy of attitude reaches 1 degrees.

AB This paper proposes a simplified algorithm for reducing the computational load of the conventional underwater integrated navigation system. The system usually comprises a three-dimensional accelerometer, a three-dimensional gyroscope, a three-dimensional Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and a data fusion algorithm, such as a Kalman Filter (KF). Since the expected variations of roll, pitch and depth are small, these quantities are assumed to be constant, and the proposed system is designed in a two-dimensional form. Due to the low speed of the vehicle, the nonlinear dynamic equation of the velocity can be simplified in a linear form. We also simplify the conventional KF in order to avoid matrix multiplications and matrix inversions. The performance of the designed system is evaluated in a sea trial by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The results show that the proposed system can significantly reduce the computational load of the conventional integrated navigation system without a significant reduction in position and velocity accuracy.

AB Autonomous control of a low-cost micro air vehicle (MAV) is considered, using a single camera and inertial measurement unit. Integration of loom is used to determine the approximate height during takeoff and landing, and to provide an initial height for hover. Contrary to most optic-flow-based approaches that lack positional feedback, a snapshot paradigm is utilized in this paper that takes and stores an image of the ground under the MAV as a reference image, and the position of the vehicle can then be estimated from the transformation of the following images with respect to the reference image so that long-term drift can be contained. In this new work, the implementation of the snapshot algorithm is considered with a focus on real-time performance on a slow processor and the difficulties posed by illumination change and external disturbance. We also extend earlier work with extensive flight experiments conducted in various situations to evaluate the closed-loop performance of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The YARF system extracts road features from color images in order to drive a vehicle along the road. Central to the system is a model of the road which includes both geometric information about the relative placement of the features defining the lane structure of the road and information about the appearance of those features. This model is used to selectively apply specialized image segmentation methods to perform the feature detection; to provide the system of constraints which relate the feature positions to the vehicle position on the road; and to provide a context of expectations about the appearance of the road which can be used to analyze situations where expected features are not seen. Experimental results are presented showing the benefit of using multiple specialized image segmentation techniques, the advantages of using Least Median Squares estimation in situations where there are outliers in the data, and the ability of YARF to detect intersections and changes in lane structure based on the failure to see expected features in the image.

AB Merging sections on freeways are typical bottlenecks for traffic efficiency and safety. The connected and automated vehicles (CAV) technology has great capability in improving traffic performance of merging bottlenecks. Current approaches of system optimal cooperative merging control assume single fixed merging point (CMC-SMP) for on-ramp vehicles to reduce the complexity of their models. Non-fixed merging positions have the potential to further improve merging operations but may lead to the computational explosion. To solve this core contradiction, this study proposes a novel hierarchical system optimal cooperative merging control model considering flexible merging positions (CMC-FMP) to realize safe and efficient merging processes. The upper-level - the tactical planning model is formulated as a non-convex mixed integer quadratically constrained programming, aiming at minimal total travel time in the control zone. It optimizes not only the merging sequence but also vehicles' critical states in merging processes, such as the state of on-ramp vehicles when they merge. The lower-level -the motion planning model generates feasible trajectories and the next step actions for every vehicle. A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based decomposition algorithm (MCTS-DA) is further designed to improve the computational efficiency of the tactical planning model. Meanwhile, solutions of MCTS-DA are proved to have good optimality compared to the direct solving method. A batch-based scheme is developed to realize real-time control. The results reveal that the average delays of CMC-FMP are remarkably lower than those of CMC-SMP. Especially in low on-ramp ratio scenarios, the difference in improvement can reach 64%. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis indicates that large safe merging margins and short merging sections are disadvantageous for traffic efficiency for the merging flow controlled by CMC-FMP.

AB Presently, autonomous vehicles are on the rise and are expected to be on the roads in the coming years. In this sense, it becomes necessary to have adequate knowledge about its states to design controllers capable of providing adequate performance in all driving scenarios. Sideslip and roll angles are critical parameters in vehicular lateral stability. The later has a high impact on vehicles with an elevated center of gravity, such as trucks, buses, and industrial vehicles, among others, as they are prone to rollover. Due to the high cost of the current sensors used to measure these angles directly, much of the research is focused on estimating them. One of the drawbacks is that vehicles are strong non-linear systems that require specific methods able to tackle this feature. The evolution in Artificial Intelligence models, such as the complex Artificial Neural Network architectures that compose the Deep Learning paradigm, has shown to provide excellent performance for complex and non-linear control problems. In this paper, the authors propose an inexpensive but powerful model based on Deep Learning to estimate the roll and sideslip angles simultaneously in mass production vehicles. The model uses input signals which can be obtained directly from onboard vehicle sensors such as the longitudinal and lateral accelerations, steering angle and roll and yaw rates. The model was trained using hundreds of thousands of data provided by Trucksim(R)and validated using data captured from real driving maneuvers using a calibrated ground truth device such as VBOX3i dual-antenna GPS from Racelogic(R). The use of both Trucksim(R)software and the VBOX measuring equipment is recognized and widely used in the automotive sector, providing robust data for the research shown in this article.

AB Road safety, optimized traffic management, and passenger comfort have always been the primary goals of the vehicle networking research community. Advances in computer and communication technologies have made the dream of modern intelligent vehicles a reality through the use of smart sensors, cameras, networking devices, and storage capabilities. Autonomous operation of modern intelligent vehicles requires massive computations where tasks are outsourced. In recent years, various computing paradigms, e.g., mobile cloud computing (MCC), vehicular cloud computing (VCC), multi-access or mobile edge computing (MEC), vehicular edge computing (VEC), vehicular fog computing (VFC), and volunteer computing based VANET (VCBV), have been developed to move computational resources close to the user and handle the delay-sensitive applications of modern intelligent vehicles. Therefore, in this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of all computing paradigms related to vehicular networks. We also present the architectural details, similarities, differences, and key features of each computing paradigm. Finally, we conclude the study with open research challenges in vehicular networks along with future research directions.

AB Navigating robotic systems autonomously through unknown, dynamic and GPS-denied environments is a challenging task. One requirement of this is a path planner which provides safe trajectories in real-world conditions such as nonlinear vehicle dynamics, real-time computation requirements, complex 3D environments, and moving obstacles. This paper presents a methodological motion planning approach which integrates a novel local path planning approach with a graph-based planner to enable an autonomous vehicle (here a drone) to navigate through GPS-denied subterranean environments. The local path planning approach is based on a recently proposed method by the authors called Nonlinear Model Predictive Horizon (NMPH). The NMPH formulation employs a copy of the plant dynamics model (here a nonlinear system model of the drone) plus a feedback linearization control law to generate feasible, optimal, smooth and collision-free paths while respecting the dynamics of the vehicle, supporting dynamic obstacles and operating in real time. This design is augmented with computationally efficient algorithms for global path planning and dynamic obstacle mapping and avoidance. The overall design is tested in several simulations and a preliminary real flight test in unexplored GPS-denied environments to demonstrate its capabilities and evaluate its performance.

AB With the growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in China, the mass production of EV batteries will not only drive down the costs of energy storage, but also increase the uptake of EVs. Together, this provides the means by which energy storage can be implemented in a cost-efficient way. Here we identify and compare four basic pathways - Smart Charging, Vehicle to Grid, Battery Swap and Repurposing Retired Batteries - that can realize the storage potential from EVs. A potential capacity and cost comparison is conducted for each pathway, and it is concluded that EVs can achieve large scale energy storage effectively addressing the issue of intra-day power imbalance caused by the high penetration of variable renewable energy. It also indicates that the cost of Vehicle to Grid pathway is likely to be accepted by EV customers after 2025, and Repurposing Retired Batteries pathway shows diminishing cost competitiveness compared with the other pathways. The potential pathway combinations and corresponding scale of initial capital investments are further analyzed. Finally, we realize the EV storage capacity would not be significantly reduced by the introduction of the sharing economy and autonomous driving, particularly under the Battery Swap and Repurposing Retired Batteries pathways.

AB As ocean resources received considerable attention, the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been more widely applied due to its excellent flexibility and adaptability, and the optimization design of AUV has becoming a more important issue. The heavier-than-water underwater vehicle (HUV) is a new conceptual AUV, and its design is a typical multidisciplinary problem, but heavily dependent on the experience with naval architects at the present engineering design. To realize the optimization design of HUV, the multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) method is applied to the multiple objective MDO design of an HUV. In this paper, a system synthesis model of the HUV has been set up. To predict the hydrodynamic characteristics accurately, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used. In the MDO process, the all-in-one (AIO) method has been adopted with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms (NSGA)-II and a Kriging model for constructing global approximations to reduce the cost of the CFD numerical simulation. According to the multiple objective MDO design, the Pareto-optimal solutions are analyzed and verified by the numerical simulation, and it is found that the optimal design of HUV has better performance than that of prototype.

AB The development of a novel type of hybrid underwater glider (HUG) that combines the advantages of buoyancy-driven underwater glider and propeller-driven autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has recently received considerable interest. HUG is designed with a rotatable thruster to ensure the enough maneuverability of the vehicle for underwater docking. Unlike the fixed funnel-type dock, the dock proposed here can rotate actively to allow the vehicle to approach the docking station from most range of directions providing better accessibility for the vehicle. Considering that the ocean current may have a significant impact on the HUG, a pursuit guidance algorithm with current compensation is presented. The performance of the guidance algorithm is compared with other existing guidance algorithms, such as pure pursuit guidance and proportional navigation guidance by simulation based on the dynamic model of HUG. Moreover, underwater docking experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility of the docking system and the effectiveness of the proposed guidance algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm compensates well for the current disturbances on HUG docking mission and the HUG can dock with the rotatable dock entrance successfully.

AB Recently, ocean exploration has increased considerably through the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). A key enabling technology is the precision of the AUV navigation capability. In this paper, we focus on understanding the limitation of the AUV navigation system. That is, what are the observable error-states for different maneuvering types of the AUV? Since analyzing the performance of an underwater navigation system is highly complex, to answer the above question, current approaches use simulations. This, of course, limits the conclusions to the emulated type of vehicle used and to the simulation setup. For this reason, we take a different approach and analyze the system observability for different types of vehicle dynamics by finding the set of observable and unobservable states. To that end, we apply the observability Gramian approach, previously used only for terrestrial applications. We demonstrate our analysis for an underwater inertial navigation system aided by a Doppler velocity logger or by a pressure sensor. The result is a first prediction of the performance of an AUV standing, rotating at a position and turning at a constant speed. Our conclusions of the observable and unobservable navigation error states for different dynamics are supported by extensive numerical simulation.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) research and development is on the verge of reaching maturity yet applications are very few. The cost associated with an AUV development particularly of the onboard sensors, power requirements and underwater testing have imposed a significant constraint on its development. Numerous ideas regarding underwater vehicle control have been proposed in the literature however the lack of test equipment confines one to simulations only. The aim of this paper is to introduce fresh results on the application of a genetic algorithm based model predictive controller (GA-MPC) to an actual AUV. These results are significant since to the authors' knowledge, this is the first known application of an online GA operating in an underwater vehicle in real time. The current hardware and software configuration of the vehicle is also elucidated. The broader aim of the research is to produce a low cost AUV facility to be exploited by other underwater research groups within the UK. The results mainly consists of line of sight (LOS) tracking missions using the GA-MPC autopilot with and without an umbilical. It is demonstrated that the controller performs remarkably well in a real time environment despite the existence of disturbances and ever present modelling uncertainty.

AB We report the derivation and experimental evaluation of a stable adaptive identifier to estimate rigid body rotations using rotors in Geometric Algebra (GA). This work is motivated by the need for in situ estimation of the alignment between sensors commonly used in underwater vehicle navigation. Here we derive an adaptive identifier using a geometric interpretation of the error to drive first-order rotor kinematics. We prove that it is Lyapunov stable, and we show that it is asymptotically stable in the presence of persistent excitation. We use the identifier to estimate the alignment between the Doppler velocity log sonar and the fiber optic gyrocompass used by underwater vehicles for dead reckoning (DR). We evaluate this method in the laboratory with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and then with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operating in the field at 1,200m depth. Our results show that this technique reduces dead reckoning navigation errors on these platforms and provides comparable performance to previously reported SO(3) constrained Linear Algebra (LA) approaches. The rotor identifier has a number of advantages over these previously reported methods, including a more straightforward derivation, simpler gain tuning, increased computational efficiency, and reduced data manipulation.

AB The mobility sector is experiencing a global transition towards cleaner and more sustainable technologies. Many mobility projects are developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to improve the operational efficiency of mobility, such as charging system optimization for electric vehicles (EVs), autonomous driving, and traffic controls. This study presents such projects' global distribution by showing a geographic information system (GIS)-generated map and analyzes the readiness level of those technologies by employing the Japanese Technology Readiness Assessment (J-TRA) methodology. The results show that most projects are located in Europe. Among the analyzed AI uses, the smart parking system and lane tracing assistance technologies have the highest level of readiness. Further training of AI to be fully compatible with the real operating environments and updates of traffic policies are necessary to allow advancement of the technology readiness of the rest of AI mobility technologies types.

AB This study explored whether British and Malaysian drivers differ in their use of explicit (turn signals) and implicit (e.g., vehicle position, speed) communicative cues when judging the intention of other road users. Participants viewed videoclips of car drivers and motorcyclists who either continued straight or turned into a junction. The clips terminated immediately prior to any manoeuvre being made and participants were asked to judge whether or not the vehicle would turn. Explicit signals (turn indicators) were manipulated such that valid signals were made 50% of the time. Although both groups of drivers were more accurate on validly signalled trials, British drivers were more affected by signal validity, performing particularly poorly on invalid trials. British drivers were better at judging intentions of cars than motorcycles, whereas Malaysians performed better for motorcycles than cars on invalid trials. We conclude that British drivers heavily rely on explicit signals when judging intention whereas Malaysian drivers are more attuned to implicit signals. Familiarity with vehicle type may also impact performance, especially where cues are ambiguous. Implications for driving abroad and autonomous vehicles are discussed.

TI Obstacle Detection for Unmanned Surface Vehicles by Fusion Refinement

DT Article
DE obstacle detection; semantic segmentation; unmanned surface vehicles
AB As a kind of marine vehicles, Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) are widely used in military and civilian fields because of their low cost, good concealment, strong mobility and high speed. High-precision detection of obstacles plays an important role in USV autonomous navigation, which ensures its subsequent path planning. In order to further improve obstacle detection performance, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture named Fusion Refinement Network (FRN). The encoder part with a deeper network structure enables it to extract more rich visual features. In particular, a dilated convolution layer is used in the encoder for obtaining a large range of obstacle features in complex marine environment. The decoder part achieves the multiple path feature fusion. Attention Refinement Modules (ARM) are added to optimize features, and a learnable fusion algorithm called Feature Fusion Module (FFM) is used to fuse visual information. Experimental validation results on three different datasets with real marine images show that FRN is superior to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks in performance evaluation. And the MIoU and MPA of the FRN can peak at 97.01% and 98.37% respectively. Moreover, FRN could maintain a high accuracy with only 27.67M parameters, which is much smaller than the latest obstacle detection network (WaSR) for USV.

AB The precondition for electric vehicles (EVs) to be involved in the system frequency regulation (FR) is that the owner's driving demand can be satisfied, which is the key factor in promoting vehicle owners to participate in system FR service. At present, many studies have proposed FR control strategy, but most of them are confined to the fleet level of EVs and ignore the individual level. And the individual demand of EV in FR process includes both satisfying the energy demand and reducing the harm to storage battery caused by the conversion between charge and discharge state. Accordingly, this paper firstly expounds the demand declaration strategy of EVs. Based on the declared information, the grouping strategy of EVs connected to the grid is proposed. Then the FR control strategy at the level of individual EV is elaborated. At last, the load frequency control (LFC) model considering the driving demand of EV is established. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can effectively satisfy the energy demand of individual EVs participating in FR, control the number of conversions between charging and discharging state, and achieve the aim of stabilizing system frequency fluctuation.

AB Mobility is a vast and comprehensive system where many new multimodal technology revolutions occur. To make strategies of sustainable development, policy makers particularly focus on the residents' trip scenarios in the long-term future affected by policies but not the extreme accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we construct a strategic and integrated model of residents' travel demand and trip pattern based on system dynamics methods. Changes from and relationships between policies, markets and consumers under electrification, automation and sharing revolution in mobility have been considered in this model. This model follows the utility methods in travel cost calculation from MARS and retains the original framework of travel pattern. Moreover, it includes new modes and models under technology revolutions such as (1) new sharing patterns: paratransit; (2) new travel modes: customized shuttle bus and sharing cars and (3) new vehicle models: EVs and Avs. As using the three-level classification system of ownership-mode-model, this strategic analysis model demonstrated a comprehensive structure of future mobility. The validity of model was verified through a case study of Shanghai 2035 with three scenarios developed under possible policy directions.

AB Encouraged by next-generation networks and autonomous vehicle systems, vehicular networks must employ advanced technologies to guarantee personal safety, reduce traffic accidents and ease traffic jams. By leveraging the computing ability at the network edge, multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a promising technique to tackle such challenges. Compared to traditional full offloading, partial offloading offers more flexibility in the perspective of application as well as deployment of such systems. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the application of partial computing offloading in-vehicle networks. In particular, by analyzing the structure of many emerging applications, e.g., AR and online games, we convert the application structure into a sequential multi-component model. Focusing on shortening the application execution delay, we extend the optimization problem from the single-vehicle computing offloading (SVCOP) scenario to the multi-vehicle computing offloading (MVCOP) by taking multiple constraints into account. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm is proposed as a solution to this problem. Various performance evaluation results have shown that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance as compared to existing offloading mechanisms in deducing application execution delay.

DE Explicit integrator; Real-time simulation; Slip ratio; Stability region;
   Tire model; Wheel dynamics
AB Real-time interpretation of a vehicle is mainly used for the speed estimation of autonomous vehicles and hardware-in-the-loop simulation. For real-time analysis of vehicles, an explicit integrator is more suitable than an implicit integrator. The implicit integrator guarantees the stability of the numerical analysis, whereas the explicit integrator requires a smaller amount of computation, which enables quick analysis. However, the lagged slip ratio, which is the most typical slip ratio in the tire model for vehicle dynamics simulation, shows that the numerical results of the explicit integrator are unstable in low-speed and high-speed driving situations. This is because the pole of the wheel dynamics system applying the lagged slip ratio deviates from the stability region of the explicit integrator depending on the driving speed. Generally, the instability of the lagged slip ratio is eliminated by applying an arbitrary damper system. In this study, an advanced lagged slip ratio is proposed to maintain the pole of the wheel dynamics in the stability region using an explicit integrator. The validity and stability of the proposed method is confirmed by comparing the driving simulation results with the conventional slip ratio.

DE long-distance. apperception; synthetic aperture processing; array gain;

AB The limited physical size for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) or unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) makes it difficult to acquire enough space gain for localizing long-distance targets. A new technique about long-distance target apperception with passive synthetic aperture array for underwater vehicles is presented. First, a synthetic aperture-processing algorithm based on the FFT transform in the beam space (BSSAP) is introduced. Then, the study on the flank array passive long-distance apperception techniques in the frequency scope of 11-18 kHz is implemented from the view of improving array gains, detection probability and augmenting detected range under a certain sea environment. The results show that the BSSAP algorithm can extend the aperture effectively and improve detection probability. Because of the augment of the transmission loss, the detected range has the trend of decline with the increase of frequency under the same target source level. The synthesized array could improve the space gain by nearly 7 dB and SNR is increased by about 5 dB. The detected range is enhanced to nearly 2 km under the condition of 108-118 dB of the target source level for AUV system in measurement interval of nearly 1 s.

AB Agricultural soils provide a variety of ecological services, including nutrient cycling, water purification and storage, carbon sequestration, and flood protection. Soil Surface Roughness (SSR) represents a key parameter for evaluating the terrain quality structure, especially in the layers beneath the usual primary tillage depth, and therefore its estimation has been widely investigated over the years in many fields of science and engineering. This paper proposes the adoption of an innovative sensing approach that relies on contactless measurements provided by a depth camera in contrast to traditional contact measurements such as pin meter and roller chain. In addition, novel features are investigated to achieve a complete statistical description of the SSR with the least number of parameters. The proposed methods are validated in an experimental campaign performed on a vineyard plot. This research could be useful for many applications, including soil erosion prediction models, autonomous vehicle navigation in rural and agricultural settings, and controlled traffic farming.

AB Brake-by-wire (BBW) system is a basic and significant component for intelligent vehicles and electric vehicles. During autonomous emergency braking process, the dynamic response requirement of the BBW actuator motor is very high. Hence, a dynamic decoupling control method is proposed for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) of BBW system to improve the dynamic response performance. First, a PMSM dynamic model and a thermodynamic model of stator winding are built. Then, the inductance and flux linkage parameters are identified based on recursive least squares and the back electromotive force formula, and an accurate relationship between inductance and flux linkage parameters and motor temperature is obtained. Finally, a dynamic decoupling control method based on the intensive binary dichotomy table method is designed. The results both of simulations and experiments show that the proposed method shorten the boost time by 18.30%, thereby reducing the braking time by 9.63%.

ID MODEL
AB Vehicular ad-hoc networks as a subset of mobile ad-hoc networks have recently received considerable attention. In such networks, demands which are based on disseminating information from a source to vehicles in the road are increased. In these networks, the relatively high speed of vehicles leads to rapid change topology and routing and media access to practices presented in traditional network aren't responsible for this project. In this regard, one intelligent routing protocol for ad-hoc networks is proposed that is able to select Stability routes based on fuzzy logic for routing and increase network utilization rate, an important measure to evaluate the performance routing protocol. In the proposed method, each node acts as an autonomous agent and Routes based on selection of important criteria such as the rate of vehicle mobility and the available bandwidth. The proposed protocol performance was compared with AODV known protocol that the result of the simulator OPNET version 10.5 is indicative of better performance of the proposed protocol.

AB This paper describes a vehicle to perform a simple task using a decision control composed of a behavior hierarchy. First the model is presented. It is based on two fundamental components: the behavior module defining how each behavior element is implemented; and the blocker which is the basic component of the arbitration system, responsible for behavior selection. Behavior modules are composed of two submodules, one to produce actuator actions and other to produce priorities associated to actions. They also have three parameters whose values can be changed prior to execution, as a means of configuring a particular control architecture. Competition among behaviors is resolved by arbitration structures, each one consisting of a series of blockers working in a completely distributed way. The arbitration system can be automatically generated from the mere enumeration of the constituting behaviors. The development of the model in order to support behavior hierarchies is also presented as well as the possibility of using global variables. Then the prototype - a vehicle to clear away film boxes is described in detail namely all the behaviors constituting its control. Finally some conclusions based on the obtained results are presented.

AB Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can function as aerial base stations to provide flexible and reliable communication services for massive ground devices (GDs). It is quite a challenging task to analyze such multi-UAV networks when considering practical mutually exclusive relationships among UAVs. Based on the tools of stochastic geometry, we in this paper develop a theoretical framework for modeling and analyzing aerial networks with UAVs following Matern hard-core point process (MHCPP). As the tractable probability generating functional (PGFL) of repulsive point processes is unavailable, we employ an approximate approach based on the Poisson point process to analyze the cumulative interference and the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of a typical GD. By considering both line-of-sight (LOS) and none-line-of-sight (NLOS) communications, we obtain the approximation expressions of the network coverage probability and average rate. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to validate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed framework.

AB To realize the robust control of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, adaptive multilayer neural dynamics (AMND) controllers are proposed and analyzed. The proposed AMND controllers with the strong anti-perturbation property can drive multirotor UAVs to track time-varying tasks and deal with parameter uncertainty problems. First, the design method of the general multilayer neural dynamics (MLND) controllers is introduced and analyzed. Second, based on the design method, the attitude angles, height, and position controllers of a UAV system are designed. Third, according to the adaptive control theory, a novel AMND controller is designed, which can self-tune the parameters of the UAV. Finally, the proposed AMND method applies to a real-world hexrotor UAV system to illustrate its reliability. Mathematical analysis, computer simulations, and experiments verify the reliability, stability, and effectiveness of the proposed controllers which are used to track time-varying tasks.

ID ADAPTATION
AB We present a new terrain classification technique both for effective, autonomous locomotion over rough, unknown terrains and for the qualitative analysis of terrains for exploration and mapping. Our approach requires a single camera with little processing of visual information. Specifically, we derived a gait bounce measure from visual servoing errors that results from vehicle-terrain interactions during normal locomotion. Characteristics of the terrain, such as roughness and compliance, manifest themselves in the spatial patterns of this signal and can be extracted using pattern classification techniques. This vision-based approach is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained robots with limited sensor capability. In this paper, we present the gait bounce derivation. We demonstrate the viability of terrain classification for legged vehicles using gait bounce with a rigorous study of more than 700 trials, obtaining an 83% accuracy on a set of laboratory terrains. We describe how terrain classification may be used for gait adaptation, particularly in relation to an efficiency metric. We also demonstrate that our technique may be generally applicable to other locomotion mechanisms such as wheels and treads.

DE Vehicular FMCW; Radar spoofing; ADAS; PBAD
AB The safety and security of the passengers in vehicles in the face of cyber attacks is a key concern in the automotive industry, especially with the emergence of the Advanced driver assistance systems and the vast improvement in autonomous vehicles. Such platforms use various sensors, including cameras, LiDAR and mmWave radar. These sensors themselves may present a potential security hazard if exploited by an attacker. In this paper we propose a system to attack an automotive FMCW mmWave radar, that uses fast chirp modulation. Using a single rogue radar, our attack system is capable of spoofing the distance and velocity measured by the victim vehicle simultaneously, presenting phantom measurements coherent with the laws of physics governing vehicle motion. The attacking radar controls the delay in order to spoof its distance, and uses phase compensation and control in order to spoof its velocity. After developing the attack theory, we demonstrate the spoofing attack by building a proof-of-concept hardware-based system, using a Software Defined Radio. We successfully demonstrate two real-world scenarios in which the victim radar is spoofed to detect either a phantom emergency stop or a phantom acceleration, while measuring coherent range and velocity. We also discuss several countermeasures that can mitigate the described attack.

AB Motivated by estimation problems arising in autonomous vehicles and decentralized control of unmanned aerial vehicles, we consider multi-agent estimation and filtering problems in which multiple agents generate state estimates based on decentralized information and the objective is to minimize a coupled mean-squared error which we call team mean-square error. We call the resulting estimates as minimum team mean-squared error (MTMSE) estimates. We show that MTMSE estimates are different from minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimates. We derive closed-form expressions for MTMSE estimates, which are linear function of the observations where the corresponding gain depends on the weight matrix that couples the estimation error. We then consider a filtering problem where a linear stochastic process is monitored by multiple agents which can share their observations (with delay) over a communication graph. We derive expressions to recursively compute the MTMSE estimates. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme we consider an example of estimating the distances between vehicles in a platoon and show that MTMSE estimates significantly outperform MMSE estimates and consensus Kalman filtering estimates.

AB Vehicle-to-vehicle (for short, V2V) communication technology is regarded as a promising technology to improve traffic efficiency and safety. In this paper, an extended car-following model is proposed to simulate traffic flow by considering multi-anticipative average velocity effect (including the average velocity and the mean expected velocity field effect of preceding vehicles group) under V2V environment. The stability condition of this model is obtained by applying the linear stability theory. The phase diagram comparison and analysis shows that the multi-anticipative average velocity effect can effectively enhance the stabilization of traffic system. In particular, the average velocity effect plays a more important role than that of the mean expected velocity field effect in improving the stability of traffic flow. The mKdV equation is derived to describe the evolution characteristics of traffic density waves by using the reductive perturbation method. Furthermore, the numerical simulation is carried out to validate the theoretical results, and indicates that the traffic jam can be suppressed efficiently via taking into account multi-anticipative average velocity effect.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting users' acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs, Level 3). A theoretical acceptance model was proposed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with new constructs: initial trust and two types of perceived risk (i.e., perceived safety risk [PSR] and perceived privacy risk [PPR)). It was hypothesized that initial trust was built upon perception factors (i.e., perceived usefulness [PU], perceived ease of use [PEOU], PSR, and PPR) and was a key determinant of AV acceptance. The validity of the model was confirmed with a structure equation modeling analysis based on data collected from 216 survey samples. Results revealed that initial trust was the most critical factor in promoting a positive attitude towards AVs, which, together with PU, determined users' intention to use AVs. Initial trust could be enhanced by improving PU and reducing PSR associated with AVs. Theoretically, these findings suggest that initial trust offers another and probably more important pathway for other factors to impact consumers' adoption of systems with uncertainty. Practically, the findings provide guidance for designing interventions aimed at improving public's acceptance towards AVs.

AB In recent years, with the continuous advancement of the construction of the Yangtze River's intelligent waterway system, unmanned surface vehicles have been increasingly used in the river's inland waterways. This article proposes a hybrid path planning method that combines an improved A* algorithm with an improved model predictive control algorithm for the autonomous navigation of the "Jinghai-I" unmanned surface vehicle in inland rivers. To ensure global optimization, the heuristic function was refined in the A* algorithm. Additionally, constraints such as channel boundaries and courses were added to the cost function of A* and the planned path was smoothed to meet the collision avoidance regulations for inland rivers. The model predictive control algorithm incorporated a new path-deviation cost while imposing a cost constraint on the yaw angle, significantly minimizing the path-tracking error. Furthermore, the improved model predictive control algorithm took into account the requirements of rules in the cost function and adopted different collision avoidance parameters for different encounter scenarios, improving the rationality of local path planning. Finally, the proposed algorithm's effectiveness was verified through simulation experiments that closely approximated real-world navigation conditions.

AB The automated vehicle (AV) industry is a new growing industry of great interest. The environmental friendliness of AVs represents a core characteristic of their leap-forward development. The environmental effect of AVs, including its evaluation framework and algorithm, is a leading research area for continued technological innovation and market development in this field. This study focuses on three environmental aspects: the energy effect of AVs, the traffic effect of AVs on ground space, and the air effect of AVs on three-dimensional atmospheric space. First, an environmental effect evaluation indicator system that includes nine indices for AVs is constructed to be the basis for management decision making. Second, the interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain fuzzy (IVIUF) evaluation variable is used to solve the problem of data features that incorporate "crisp numbers" and "fuzzy numbers". Moreover, geometric weights are added based on the generalized correlation aggregation operator. Then, the IVIUL-weighted geometric (IVIULWG) operator is developed, which includes the objective and subjective information of "crisp numbers" and "fuzzy numbers" and makes the mathematical characteristics more scientific and accurate. Finally, an evaluation example is used to validate the effectiveness and practicability of the algorithm.

AB Eco-driving for connected Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FCHEVs) is a coupled problem of speed planning and energy management. To reduce the computational burden, bi-level optimization decouples and hierarchically solves the upper-level and lower-level subproblems. This paper proposes a bi-level convex approach for eco-driving of a connected FCHEV proceeding through multiple signalized in-tersections. On the upper level, the non-linear traffic light constraints are transformed into time-varying linear state constraints and the cost function becomes quadratic after using the average speed. On the lower level, model convexification is carried out for the fuel cell system and battery. Then the upper-level speed planning and lower-level energy management are sequentially solved by the MOSEK solver and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The results show that the proposed bi-level convex approach greatly reduces the computational cost while maintaining high energy effi-ciency, with only 6.59% computational time and almost the same fuel economy compared to the bi-level Dynamic Programming (DP) method.

AB A key technical challenge for high-altitude, or near-space, concepts is autonomous stationkeeping: the ability to remain fixed over a geolocation in the presence of winds. Although operational altitudes of 65,000 It and above are above weather (i.e., storms, rain), winds are still present. To stationkeep in the presence of these winds requires propulsive power, and these vehicles tend to be quite power-limited. This paper focuses on the analysis of the stationkeeping performance of a large notional airship operating at an altitude of 65,000 ft, with a focus on the maneuvering power required. The vehicle has a lifting-gas volume of 6.1 x 10(6) ft(3) and is solar electric powered, with the entire upper surface covered by solar cells. Electric motors and propellers provide propulsion, and batteries are used for power storage. In this paper, the vehicle's surge and directional dynamics are characterized, the wind environment is modeled, and simple control and guidance algorithms are developed and evaluated. In particular, the maneuvering power required is statistically determined, using a covariance analysis. It is shown that the vehicle is dynamically stable and sluggish, and that significant thrust and control power may be required to stationkeep in turbulence. This additional maneuvering power required may be a significant design driver.

AB A new 2000 in depth rated subsea sensor that can effectively, rapidly and remotely detect leaks of fluorescein dye, leak detection chemicals and hydraulic fluids from underwater structures is reported. The system utilizes ultra-bright LED technology to project a structured beam of light, at a wavelength suitable to excite the fluorescence of the target material, into the water column. The resultant fluorescence is collected and digital signal processing used to extract the intensity. The system is capable of detecting ppm concentrations of fluorescein at a range of 2.5 m in water in real time. The ability to stand-off from subsea structures, while rapidly detecting the chemicals makes the system highly suited to subsea leak inspections with remotely operated vehicles or autonomous underwater vehicles, as it allows the vehicles to be flown quickly and safely over the structure to be inspected. This increases both the speed and effectiveness of the inspection. The remote detection capability is also highly effective for probing complex underwater structures. The system has been successfully used in real subsea survey applications and has been found to be effective, user friendly and to dramatically reduce inspection times and hence costs.

AB The delivery of electricity employing an electromagnetic field that extends across an intervening region is called a wireless power transfer (WPT). This approach paves the way for electric vehicles (EVs) to use newly available options to reduce their environmental impact. This article is a review that examines the WPT technology for use in electric vehicle applications from both the technical aspect and the environmental impact. This review will attempt to accomplish the following objectives: (1) describe the present state of the technology behind the development and application of a WPT across the transportation industry; (2) substantiate the actual implementation of WPT EV systems; and (3) estimate the functioning of the autonomous system, as well as detect the potential stumbling blocks and openings for enhancement. The most recent advancements and implementation in compensating topologies, power electronics converters, and control techniques are dissected and debated scientifically to improve the system's performance. To evaluate the performance from a sustainable perspective, energy, environmental, and economic factors are utilized, and at the same time, policy drivers and health and safety problems are researched.

AB We present an error tolerant path planning algorithm for Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) swarms. We assume navigation without GPS-like techniques. The MAVs find their path using sensors and cameras, identifying and following a series of visual landmarks. The visual landmarks lead the MAVs towards their destination. MAVs are assumed to be unaware of the terrain and locations of the landmarks. They hold a priori information about landmarks, whose interpretation is prone to errors. Errors are of two types, recognition or advice. Recognition errors follow from misinterpretation of sensed data or a priori information, or confusion of objects, e.g., due to faulty sensors. Advice errors are consequences of outdated or wrong information about landmarks, e.g., due to weather conditions. Our path planning algorithm is cooperative. MAVs communicate and exchange information wirelessly, to minimize the number of recognition and advice errors. Hence, the quality of the navigation decision process is amplified. Our solution successfully achieves an adaptive error tolerant navigation system. Quality amplification is parameterized with respect to the number of MAVs. We validate our approach with theoretical proofs and numeric simulations.

TI Vehicle lane markings segmentation and keypoint determination using deep
   convolutional neural networks
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Lane detection is used to detect the lane markings in a road scene between which the vehicle is driving and provide the accurate location and shape of each lane marking. It serves as one of the key techniques to enable modern, assisted, and autonomous driving systems. However, lane detection poses several challenges. The lane markings vary in their shapes, colors, and patterns. The lack of distinct features and the presence of several occlusions on the roads makes the use of conventional methods using handcrafted features less robust and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a compact and efficient multi-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which can learn both the lane markings segmentation and also the localization and shape of each lane in the form of key-points. The proposed model combines a lane mask proposal network with a lane key-point determination network to accurately predict the key-points that describe the left and right lane-markings of the vehicle lanes. The high running speed and low computational cost of the proposed method make it suitable for being deployed in the real world vehicle systems. Through simulation results, we also show that the proposed method is robust to a variety of weather conditions and highway driving scenarios.

AB With large-scale integration of electric vehicles, this paper investigates the load frequency control problem in an islanded microgrid with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), which can be regarded as mobile battery energy storages to provide a valuable contribution to frequency regulation. A novel fully-distributed control strategy is proposed to achieve fast frequency regulation of islanded microgrids and effective coordination control of distributed energy sources. Firstly, distributed control based on an improved linear active disturbance rejection algorithm is realized through a multi-agent system, and it greatly enhances the anti-disturbance capability of the microgrid. Then, in order to guarantee the effectiveness of PEVs in frequency regulation, PEVs are controlled following the controllable power rate (CPR) calculated from the consensus-based multi-agent system. Furthermore, the system control construction in this paper is well designed to avoid the negative effects caused by system communication time delay. Finally, numerical simulations under different disturbances are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in comparison with other previous control strategies.

AB Full drive-by-wire electric vehicles (FDWEV) equipped with X-by-wire technology can enable independent driving, braking, and steering of each wheel, making them an ideal platform for developing autonomous driving technology. However, designing a robust control algorithm that comprehensively integrates vehicle path planning in a complex and unstructured scenario is a challenging task for FDWEV. To address this issue, this paper (1) proposes the artificial potential field (APF) method for path planning in the prescribed park with different static obstacles to generate the reference path information, where speed planning is incorporated considering kinematics and dynamic constraints; (2) designs curvature calculation (CC-based) and model predictive control (MPC-based) tracking methods with the lateral dynamics model to track the desired path under different driving conditions, in which a forward-looking behavior model of the driver with variable preview distance is designed based on the fuzzy control theory; (3) conducts CarSim-AMESim-Simulink co-simulation with the existence of obstacles. The simulation results show that the proposed two control approaches are practical for classical driving scenarios. Especially the MPC-based path-tracking controller enhances dynamic tracking performance and ensures good maneuverability under high-dynamic driving conditions.

AB A comprehensive review of technologies and approaches for active safety systems designed to reduce ground vehicle crashes, as well as the associated severity of injuries and fatalities, is provided. Active safety systems are commonly referred to as systems that can forewarn a driver of a potential safety hazard, or automatically intervene to reduce the likelihood of an accident without requiring driver intervention. The data from naturalistic drivers has shown that such systems are instrumental in improving vehicle safety in various conditions, particularly at higher speeds and under adverse road conditions. The increased integration of sensors, electronics, and real-time processing capabilities has served as one of the critical enabling elements in the widespread integration of active safety systems in modern vehicles. The emphasis is placed on control approaches for active safety systems and their progression over the years from antilock brakes to more advanced technologies that have nearly enabled semiautonomous driving. A review of key active safety control approaches for antilock braking, yaw stability, traction control, roll stability, and various collision avoidance systems is provided.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging research framework, with network and graph theories as two of the major fields. Researchers in these topics use a variety of tools and approaches to simulate and perform experimentation on their proposed methodologies. A comprehensive study to facilitate the selection of such simulation tools is lacking from the literature. In this work, we provide a systematic review of the different simulation platforms. More precisely, the contributions of this paper are fourfold: firstly, we propose a two-tier hierarchical taxonomy based on the trends in the literature; secondly, we investigate the strengths and limitations of different simulation platforms; and thirdly, we take a network theoretic approach to identify the patterns in IoV research. To this end, we create a network of the publications and populate the edges among them. Community detection is performed using Louvian and Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel approach to reviewing the literature which provides a more in-depth analysis of the trends in the literature. Finally, we review the common datasets for IoV experimentation.

AB Developing radio access technologies that enable reliable and low-latency vehicular communications have become of the utmost importance with the rise of interest in autonomous vehicles. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has developed Vehicle to Everything (V2X) specifications based on the 5G New Radio Air Interface (NR-V2X) to support connected and automated driving use cases, with strict requirements to fulfill the constantly evolving vehicular applications, communication, and service demands of connected vehicles, such as ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability. This paper presents an analytical model for evaluating the performance of NR-V2X communications, with particular reference to the sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling operation defined in the NR-V2X Mode 2, in comparison with legacy sidelink V2X over LTE, specified as LTE-V2X Mode 4. We consider a vehicle platooning scenario and evaluate the impact of multiple access interference on the packet success probability, by varying the available resources, the number of interfering vehicles, and their relative positions. The average packet success probability is determined analytically for LTE-V2X and NR-V2X, taking into account the different physical layer specifications, and the Moment Matching Approximation (MMA) is used to approximate the statistics of the signal-to-interferenceplus-noise ratio (SINR) under the assumption of a Nakagami-lognormal composite channel model. The analytical approximation is validated against extensive Matlab simulations that a show good accuracy. The results confirm a boost in performance with NR-V2X against LTE-V2X, particularly for high inter-vehicle distance and a large number of vehicles, providing a concise yet accurate modeling rationale for planning and adaptation of the configuration and parameter setup of vehicle platoons, without having to resort to extensive computer simulation or experimental measurements.

AB In this work, we introduce a microscopic traffic flow model called Scalar Capacity Model (SCM) which can be used to study the formation of traffic on an airway link for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as well as for the ground vehicles on the road. Given the 3D trajectory of UAV flights (as opposed to the 2D trajectory of ground vehicles), the main novelty in our model is to eliminate the commonly used notion of lanes and replace it with a notion of density and capacity of flow, but in such a way that individual vehicle motions can still be modeled. We name this a Density/Capacity View (DCV) of the link capacity and how vehicles utilize it versus the traditional One/Multi-Lane View (OMV). An interesting feature of this model is exhibiting both passing and blocking regimes (analogous to multi-lane or single-lane) depending on the set scalar parameter for capacity. We show the model has linear local (platoon) and asymptotic linear stability. Additionally, we perform numerical simulations and show evidence for non-linear stability. Our traffic flow model is represented by a nonlinear differential equation which we transform into a linear form. This makes our model analytically solvable in the blocking regime and piece-wise analytically solvable in the passing regime. Finally, a key advantage of using our model over an OMV model for representing UAV's flights is the removal of the artificial restriction on passing via only adjacent lanes. This will result in an improved and more realistic traffic flow for UAVs.

AB Cellular vehicular-to-everything (C-V2X), as a key technology of Internet of Vehicles (IoV), is promised to be enhanced and strengthened to improve road traffic safety and achieve intelligent transportation in 6G era. However, computation-intensive and latency-sensitive computation tasks of autonomous driving create a great challenge for the computation and storage limited vehicles. Fortunately, mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture offers a possible solution for the challenge. In this paper, a joint computation offloading and resource allocation algorithm is proposed to solve the computation tasks offloading problem in the scenario of vehicular edge computing network. First, the computation offloading and resource allocation are jointly modeled as a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem. Aiming at minimizing the total system cost (weighted sum of delay and energy consumption), a particle encoding method and a particle refinement algorithm are proposed based on the compression factor particle swarm optimization, and multilevel penalty function is adopted to deal with the constraints of the objective. Finally, experimental performances validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

AB As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication has been widely used in all walks of life, its secrecy issue has also received more and more attention. This article studies the physical-layer security of UAV relaying communication system in multiterminal Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Specifically, while receiving the information from the ground base station, the UAV safely forwards the information to one of a group of IoT terminals in the presence of an eavesdropper. Under the constraints of information causality and UAV mobility, our goal is to maximize the minimum average secrecy rate among all IoT terminals. Based on the nonconvex problem, this article proposes a high-efficiency algorithm for joint optimization of UAV trajectory and resource allocation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only effectively improves information secrecy of IoT terminals, but also enhances the fairness of communication between the IoT terminals.

AB A three dimensional (3-D) geometry-based channel model is proposed for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication scenarios where the users are located on the edge of IRS service area. In order to reduce the interference between different IRS reflection units, we first construct an optimization problem about the statistical propagation phases of different IRS reflection units, and then derive the optimal statistical propagation phase by solving the designed optimization problem. Finally, we align the proposed statistical propagation phases of IRS with the stronger components to derive suboptimal IRS reflection phases. Using derived IRS reflection phases, the statistical properties are investigated. The numerical results show that the proposed IRS reflection phases can enhance the received signal strength and reduce the multipath fading effect. Also, it can be observed that when the number of IRS reflection units increases, the spatial correlation significantly decreases.

AB In this paper, an angles of arrival(AOA) localization algorithm based on A-optimality criterion is proposed to solve the problem of unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) Swarm locating various motion states targets. Firstly, a multi-sites AOA positioning model and a model of error variance changing with the received signal-to-noise ratio are established. Then, A-optimality criterion under this model is derived theoretically, and the optimal spatial configuration of UAV Swarm is analyzed by FIM. Secondly, the target is located by ML algorithm, and the change of flight angle and flight distance of UAV Swarm is analyzed with the minimum value of CRLB matrix trace as the objective function. At last, real-time path optimization is carried out on the flight path of UAV Swarm at the next moment. Simulation results show that path optimization is able to effectively improve the positioning accuracy of UAVs in various motion states.

AB Artificial intelligence in vision based approaches have proven to be effective in various phases of intelligent vehicle system (IVS). An IVS has to intelligently take many critical decisions in heterogeneous environment. Speed bump detection is one such issue in real world due to its varying appearance in dynamic scene. The major issue is the scaling appearance of such objects from far distance and often viewed as small entity. In the proposed article, deep learning and computer vision based speed bump detection model is proposed, which assist and control the driving behavior of an IVS before it reaches to speed bump. The behavior of IVS has been explored and tested by incorporating the proposed method with a real time embedded prototype and found to be more efficient and comparable with state-of-art techniques. The overall performance of the proposed model has been achieved in terms of accuracy, precision and F-Measure as 98.54%, 99.05% and 97.89% respectively in the prepared real time environment.

AB The movement of cooperative robots in a densely cluttered environment may be impossible if the formation type is invariant. Hence, we investigate a novel method of switching time-invariant formation control for a group of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles, which may include Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). We have extended a Negative Imaginary (NI) consensus control approach to switch the formation shape of the robots whilst only using the relative distances between agents, in combination with those between agents and obstacles. All agents can automatically create a new safe formation to overcome obstacles, then restore the prototype formation once the obstacles are cleared. We address the oscillation and local minima problems, generated by existing algorithms, using a newly developed circle fitting approach. We also highlight the advantages of our proposed algorithms over the kinematic controller and the conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) controller from both theoretical and experimental standpoints. Simulation and experimental results are then analyzed to validate the feasibility of our proposed approach.

AB Over the last few decades, automotive embedded Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems have been used to enhance vehicle performance and enrich peoplea's driving experience, increasing the panel of software features within them. However, even though until now automakers have kept up with the innovation pace in terms of the functionalities that have been offered to passengers, the majority of automakers' efforts have concentrated on bringing in these new functionalities by adding an unceasingly larger set of ECUs. All of this has been done without evolving any of the embedded software architecture consequently, due to budgetary constraints, legislative limitations, retro-compatibility problems, and a lack of awareness of the trending IT innovation. This unbalanced progress has then led to a substantial increase in in-vehicle architectural complexity, which has become a major concern for automakers nowadays as it makes the vehicle repairing process more complex, decreases software traceability and clashes with the objective of having higher business flexibility, modularity, and dynamicity within the vehicles. In this paper, we are going to go through literature, both academic and industrial, and propose a comprehensive study into automotive system transformation. We begin by giving a detailed analysis of the causes of evolution under five axes - i.e., society, business, industry, application, and technical. Then, we discuss the convergence of cars and software life cycles and propose a three-layered analysis of automotive ICT systems consisting of architecture design, software pipelines, and run-time management. Finally, we are going to propose certain detailed guidelines on the evolution perspectives for automotive systems through deriving from the convergence of advances in IT, as well as current and future automotive environmental constraints.

AB Being one of the most promising applications enabled by connected and automated vehicles (CAV) technology, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is expected to be deployed in the near term on public roads. Thus far, the majority of the CACC studies have been focusing on the overall network performance with limited insights on the potential impacts of CAVs on human-driven vehicles (HVs). This paper aims to quantify such impacts by studying the high-resolution vehicle trajectory data that are obtained from microscopic simulation. Two platoon clustering strategies for CACC- an ad hoc coordination strategy and a local coordination strategy-are implemented. Results show that the local coordination outperforms the ad hoc coordination across all tested market penetration rates (MPRs) in terms of network throughput and productivity. According to the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, however, the distributions of the hard braking events (as a potential safety impact) for HVs change significantly under local coordination strategy. For both of the clustering strategy, CAVs increase the average lane change frequency for HVs. The break-even point for average lane change frequency between the two strategies is observed at 30% MPR, which decreases from 5.42 to 5.38 per vehicle. The average lane change frequency following a monotonically increasing pattern in response to MPR, and it reaches the highest 5.48 per vehicle at 40% MPR. Lastly, the interaction state of the car-following model for HVs is analyzed. It is revealed that the composition of the interaction state could be influenced by CAVs as well. One of the apparent trends is that the time spent on approaching state declines with the increasing presence of CAVs.

AB In recent years, automated vehicles have attracted much attention all over the world. This paper focuses on the freeway-exiting position decision problem of automated vehicles (AVs). Specifically, the paper addresses the determination of the lane-changing initiation location in the process of exiting the freeway. The location of the freeway-exiting decision point has a significant impact on the safety and efficiency of automated vehicles. If the lane-changing location is too close to the off-ramp, the AV may not succeed in exiting and may even collide with other vehicles. If the decision point is too far from the off-ramp, the AV will enter into the slower lane too early, increasing the travel time. However, the freeway-exiting lane-changing position problem of AVs has not been investigated thoroughly in the existing literature. This paper proposes a freewayexiting position decision model to find the optimal freeway-exiting decision position to balance the efficiency and safety in the freeway-existing process. Field data is collected to validate the proposed model, and simulations are also conducted to analyze the variations of the exiting success probability (ESP) and the optimal exiting decision (OED) position under various traffic conditions. The results show that the proposed model can predict the value of ESP with high performance (MAPE is less than 13%) and help an automated vehicle to generate an appropriate freeway-exiting decision point to ensure a high ESP without sacrificing efficiency. An AV can increase its ESP by decreasing or increasing its speed to meet more safe lane-changing gaps on the target lane, and the speed-decreasing method has a more significant effect than the speedincreasing method. The speed difference between the two adjacent lanes greatly influences ESP and the OED point, and maintaining the speed difference in an appropriate range can increase ESP.

AB In this fast world, the researchers are trying to develop strong artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars, improved closed circuit television (CCTV) systems, etc. in the transportation field to ensure safety and a sophisticated life. In this scenario, the object detection is performed by the You Look Only Once (YOLO) Version 2 (Yolov2) and YOLO Version 3 (Yolov3) algorithms for detecting the objects. However, no method is available to fulfil the current requirements in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an improved YOLO Version 4 (Yolov4) algorithm to improve the accuracy and detection speed of vehicles. Moreover, a new Mosiac data augmentation technique that incorporates a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is implemented in the existing Yolov4 algorithm for identifying the faster vehicles, and it is also used to reduce the false detection rate with rapid detection speed. In addition, a refined DeepSort technique for multiobject tracking (MOT) is also used to avoid common errors like occlusion, similar objects, etc. in this work. The proposed system was evaluated by using live videos and images and obtained 88.75% accuracy, 87.37% precision, and 89.21% recall that are superior to other systems.

AB In this paper, the formation control of the underactuated surface vehicles (USVs) is studied in the presence of the condition of actuator fault and limited communication resources. Considering the performance charac-teristics of the underactuated surface vehicle (USV), a robust adaptive synchronized event-triggered formation control method is proposed under the usage of the event-triggered control (ETC) and robust neural damping technique. In consideration of the constant energy expenditure of the law of adaptation, the formulated control method is set in the mechanism of triggering by both the controller and the gain related adaptive law, which could cause the communication to reduce more much power consumption. The robust adaptive rule is fault compensated in the way of combining robust neural damping and dynamic surface control (DSC) techniques. Since the fault amendment strategy compresses inconclusive bias fault parameters and model uncertainty parameters, system stability can be enhanced under the premise of reducing the influence of adaptive parameters. A huge volume of work has taken place to ensure semi-global uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability. To conclude, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by two arithmetic examples.

AB The rapid development of electric vehicles (EV) has placed greater demands on the planning and construction of public electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS). As EV users are highly autonomous in their charging behavior, the interests of investors and EV users are mutually affected and challenging to balance. Therefore, this paper proposes a bi-level planning model to balance the interests of investors and EV users and optimize global economic costs while improving the service satisfaction of users. The upper-level model aims to optimize the economic cost. In contrast, the lower-level model aims to optimize the service satisfaction of EV users and characterizes the charging satisfaction of EV users through the costs of charging queuing time, distance traveled, desired to charge volume, and actual charging volume, to more accurately reflect the autonomy of EV users. A combination of fast and slow charging piles is also used for planning to meet the needs of different users and improve charging stations' operational efficiency. Finally, a case study is conducted in an area of Beijing to verify that the optimization model has the advantages of low global economic cost, short charging queuing time for users, and high service satisfaction.

AB The ease of use and advancements in drone technology is resulting in the widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to diverse fields, making it a booming technology. Among UAVs' several applications, livestock agriculture is one of the most promising, where UAVs facilitate various operations for efficient animal management. But the field is characterized by multiple environmental, technical, economic, and strategic challenges. However, the use of advanced technological techniques like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), advanced sensors, etc., along with the assurance of animal welfare while operating the UAVs, can lead to widespread adoption of drone technology amongst livestock farmers. This paper discusses livestock management research where UAVs monitor farm animals via detection, counting, tracking animals, etc. In this article, an attempt has been made to elucidate different aspects and broader issues around livestock management while highlighting the associated challenges, opportunities, and prospects. This work is the first review paper on the subject matter with all the necessary information and analysis, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, the article promises to provide interested researchers with detailed information about the field, guiding future research.

AB Underwater docking technology makes the long-term, on-station vehicle deployment possible, which can effectively save the recovery cost and ease the operational burden. To perform docking mission, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) should have the capability to guide, navigate, and control itself into the docking station in a strategic manner. The navigation and guidance issues of AUV docking are addressed in the paper. Ultrashort baseline-based (USBL-based) navigation method is applied to home the vehicle to the dock station in relative long range. An integrated navigation algorithm based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) is studied, which takes acoustic outlier rejection into consideration. The software of navigation algorithm is implemented using Mission Oriented Operating Suite-Interval Programming (MOOS-IvP). Both the pool and lake tests are conducted to validate the proposed navigation system. Since the USBL sonar system can hardly navigate the vehicle entering the dock entrance with its error-bounded positioning accuracy, the more accurate vision guidance method is adopted instead of USBL navigation for terminal guidance. The combined performance of EKF navigation and vision guidance is validated by docking experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the vision system for terminal guidance in spite of the bounded USBL positioning error.

DE Lane detection and tracking; road surface marking detection and

AB We propose a novel real-time integrated unsupervised learning framework for lane detection, tracking, and road surface marking detection and recognition using live feed from a camera mounted on the dashboard of a moving vehicle. Accurate and automated lane and road surface marking detection and recognition from cameras play an important role in intelligent vehicles. It helps increase driving safety in advanced driver assistant systems and enhance global localization and path planning in autonomous driving vehicles. Map building and updation can also benefit from automated detection of lanes and road surface markings. In our framework, we propose a spatio-temporal incremental clustering algorithm coupled with curve-fitting for simultaneously detecting lanes and road surface markings. The clusters that do not represent the lanes are further processed using Grassmann manifold learning to accurately recognize the road surface markings. Our framework is independent of the number and type of lanes, be it continuous, non-continuous, straight, or curved. Moreover, the framework works for all types, sizes, and orientations of road surface markings. It is only limited by the type of road surface markings present in the training data. We have measured the performance of our framework on state-of-the-art datasets.

AB In this paper, we examine vehicle owners' adoption of five different types of partially automated features (PAFs); lane keeping system, backup camera (BUC), adaptive cruise control (ACC), automatic braking system (ABS), and blind spot monitoring; as well as PAF effects on vehicle miles of travel (VMT). The joint modeling of PAF adoption and VMT is achieved using both individual demographic characteristics as well as psycho-social characteristics. A Generalized Heterogeneous Data Model (GHDM) is estimated, which controls for possible self-selection effects in PAF adoption based on VMT, and thus is able to provide "true " PAF effects on VMT. Our analysis specifically indicates that ignoring this self-selection can lead to a significant underestimation of the VMT increase due to PAF adoption. The results also indicate that women and older individuals (65 years or older) appear to be more inclined to invest in assistive PAFs, because of a perception that these assistive features still leave the human driver in control. However, women are less likely than men to invest in the more active ABS PAF because of heightened safety concerns with technology. In terms of PAF effects on VMT, PAFs focusing on lateral movement assistance appear to have a smaller VMT effect than those that serve longitudinal movement assistance. The highest estimated VMT change of 2,462 miles (13.8% change) is for the case when the package of BUC, ACC, and ABS is installed for middle-aged men. The highest percentage VMT change (40%), though, is for the same package of BUC, ACC, and ABS for older women. Overall, there are considerable variations in VMT impact across demographic groupings, suggesting that a single aggregate percentage improvement in safety benefits may suffer from the well-known ecological fallacy.

TI Multimodal vehicle detection: fusing 3D-LIDAR and color camera data
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS

AB Most of the current successful object detection approaches are based on a class of deep learning models called Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). While most existing object detection researches are focused on using ConvNets with color image data, emerging fields of application such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) which integrates a diverse set of sensors, require the processing for multisensor and multimodal information to provide a more comprehensive understanding of real-world environment. This paper proposes a multimodal vehicle detection system integrating data from a 3D-LIDAR and a color camera. Data from LIDAR and camera, in the form of three modalities, are the inputs of ConvNet-based detectors which are later combined to improve vehicle detection. The modalities are: (i) up-sampled representation of the sparse LIDAR's range data called dense-Depth Map (DM), (ii) high-resolution map from LIDAR's reflectance data hereinafter called Reflectance Map (RM), and (iii) RGB image from a monocular color camera calibrated wrt the LIDAR. Bounding Box (BB) detections in each one of these modalities are jointly learned and fused by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) late-fusion strategy to improve the detection performance of each modality. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) probing and evaluating 3D-LIDAR modalities for vehicle detection (specifically the depth and reflectance map modalities), and (2) joint learning and fusion of the independent ConvNet-based vehicle detectors (in each modality) using an ANN to obtain more accurate vehicle detection. The obtained results demonstrate that (1) DM and RM are very promising modalities for vehicle detection, and (2) experiments show that the proposed fusion strategy achieves higher accuracy compared to each modality alone in all the levels of increasing difficulty (easy, moderate, hard) in KITTI object detection dataset.

AB In this work, we propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted dual-hop power line communication and radio frequency (PLC-RF) system, in which a UAV-based RIS (URIS) located in the sky forwards signals from the relay to the terrestrial user. More specifically, we assume that the PLC channel suffers from a log-normal distribution, and the URIS-assisted RF link follows the Rician distribution. With the amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying models, the closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average bit-error-rate are derived. In addition, by taking into account the hardware impairments, the outage probability of the non-ideal hardware system is derived. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation verifies the analytical results, which demonstrates the effect of impulsive noise and the number of the reflecting surface units on the system performance.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Mobile relaying is envisioned as a promising technology to alleviate the masking effect in satellite links. Nevertheless, due to the mobility and limited communication range, the network topology in mobile relay networks becomes highly dynamic and time-varying, resulting in increased difficulty of network optimization. This letter investigates unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) aided hybrid satellite-terrestrial network, where UAVs are served as mobile relay base stations to assist the communication between the satellite and ground users. We aim to maximize the number of served users by optimizing UAV trajectory and user link selection. To solve the formulated mixed-integer and non-convex optimization problem, we first find the optimal link selection via a designed graph neural network (GNN), and then adjust the UAV locations by using model-free reinforcement learning (RL), alternately. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is superior to the state-of-the-art RL algorithms.

AB In this letter, inspired by the needs of the European H2020 Project PANTHEON,(1) we propose a full navigation stack purposely designed for the autonomous navigation of Ackermann steering vehicles in precision farming settings. The proposed stack is composed of a local planner and a pose regulation controller, both implemented in ROS. The local planner generates, in real-time, optimal trajectories described by a sequence of successive poses. The planning problem is formulated as a real-time cost-function minimization problem over a finite time horizon where the Ackermann kinematics and the presence of obstacles are encoded as constraints. The control law ensures the convergence toward each of these poses. To do so, in this letter we propose a novel non-smooth control law designed to ensure the solvability of the pose regulation problem for the Ackermann vehicle. Theoretical characterization of the convergence property of the proposed pose regulation controller is provided. Numerical simulations along with real-world experiments are provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed navigation strategy.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) cover a broad range of methods and technologies that provide answers to many problems of transportation. Unmanned control of the steering wheel is one of the most important challenges facing researchers in this area. This paper presents a method to adjust automatically a fuzzy controller to manage the steering wheel of a mass-produced vehicle to reproduce the steering of a human driver. To this end, information is recorded about the car's state while being driven by human drivers and used to obtain, via genetic algorithms, appropriate fuzzy controllers that can drive the car in the way that humans do. These controllers have satisfy two main objectives: to reproduce the human behavior, and to provide smooth actions to ensure comfortable driving. Finally, the results of automated driving on a test circuit are presented, showing both good route tracking (similar to the performance obtained by persons in the same task) and smooth driving.

AB Substantial progress has been made recently towards designing, building and test-flying remotely piloted micro air vehicles (MAVs) and small unmanned air vehicles. We seek to complement this progress in overcoming the aerodynamic obstacles to flight at very small scales with a vision-guided flight stability and autonomy system, based on a robust horizon detection algorithm. In this paper, we first motivate the use of computer vision for MAV autonomy, arguing that given current sensor technology, vision may be the only practical approach to the problem. We then describe our statistical vision-based horizon detection algorithm, which has been demonstrated at 30 Hz with over 99.9% correct horizon identification. Next, we develop robust schemes for the detection of extreme MAV attitudes, where no horizon is visible, and for the detection of horizon estimation errors, due to external factors such as video transmission noise. Finally, we discuss our feedback controller for self-stabilized flight and report results on vision-based autonomous flights of duration exceeding 10 min. We conclude with an overview of our on-going and future MAV-related research.

AB Am airborne vehicle such as a rotorcraft must avoid obstacles like antennas, towers, poles, fences, tree branches, and wires strung across the flight path Automatic detection of the obstacles and generation of appropriate guidance and control actions for the vehicle to avoid these obstacles would facilitate autonomous navigation. The requirements of an obstacle detection system for rotorcraft in low-altitude Nap-of-the-Earth (NOE) flight based on various rotorcraft motion constraints is analyzed here in detail. It argues that an automated obstacle detection system for the rotorcraft scenario should include both passive and active sensors to be effective. Consequently, it introduces a maximally passive system which involves the use of passive sensors (TV, FLIR) as well as the selective use of an active (laser) sensor. The passive component is concerned with estimating range using optical flow-based motion analysis and binocular stereo. The optical flow-based motion analysis that is combined with on-board inertial navigation system (INS) to compute ranges to visible scene points is described. Experimental results obtained using land vehicle data illustrate the particular approach to motion analysis.

ID LATTICE HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; CHANGING BEHAVIOR
AB Intelligent and connected driving (ICD) is an effective method of the vehicle's active safety and traffic efficiency. Lane-changing is the critical part of ICD behavior and the basic content of traffic flow theory. Lane selection is the most important during lane-changing, which has a critical influence on traffic safety and efficiency. Focusing on the development of ICD technology, a lane selection model based on phase-field coupling and set pair logic is proposed. In this model, the method of phased-field coupling is used to comprehensively analyze the full information of lanes with the interaction between cluster vehicles considering driving propensity. The certain and uncertain humanvehicle-environment information is fully explored using the method of set pair logic. In the lane selection model, the lane utility and utility gains of lane-changing are calculated to select the candidate target lane. And the overall satisfaction is analyzed to determine the target lane as the final strategy. The proposed lane selection model constructed in this research fully considers the development of ICD technology and adapts to the requirement of an Intelligent and Connected Vehicle. This research could provide a theoretical basis for vehicle autonomous behavior decision-making and ICD. (C) 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI Closed-Loop Linear Covariance Framework for Path Planning in Static

SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS

DT Article
ID MOBILE ROBOTS; NAVIGATION; RRT; ALGORITHMS
AB Path planning in an uncertain environment is a key enabler of true vehicle autonomy. Over the past two decades, numerous approaches have been developed to account for errors in the vehicle path while navigating complex and often uncertain environments. An important capability of such planning is the prediction of vehicle dispersion covariances about a candidate path. This work develops a new closed-loop linear covariance (CL-LinCov) framework applicable to a wide range of autonomous system architectures. Important features of the developed framework include 1) separation of high-level guidance from low-level control; 2) support for output-feedback controllers with internal states, dynamics, and output; and 3) multi-use continuous sensors for navigation state propagation, guidance, and feedback control. The closed-loop nature of the framework preserves the important coupling between the system dynamics; exogenous disturbances; and the guidance, navigation, and control algorithms. The developed framework is applied to a simplified model of an unmanned aerial vehicle and validated by comparison via Monte Carlo analysis. The utility of the CL-LinCov information is illustrated by its application to path planning in a static, uncertain obstacle field via a modified version of the rapidly exploring random tree algorithm.

ID CONTROL DESIGN; ALGORITHMS
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a multiobjective differential evolution (MODE)-based extended H-infinity controller for autonomous helicopter control.
   Design/methodology/approach - Development of a MATLAB-based MODE suitable for controller synthesis. Formulate the H-infinity control scheme as an extended H-infinity loop shaping design procedure (H-infinity-LSDP) with incorporation of v-gap metric for robustness to parametric variation. Then apply the MODE-based algorithm to optimize the weighting function of the control problem formulation for optimal performance.
   Findings - The proposed optimized H-infinity control was able to yield set of Pareto-controller candidates with optimal compromise between conflicting stability and time-domain performances required in autonomous helicopter deployment. The result of performance evaluation shows robustness to parameter variation of up to 20 per cent variation in nominal values, and in addition provides satisfactory disturbance rejection to wind disturbance in all the three axes.
   Research limitations/implications - The formulated H-infinity controller is limited to hovering and low speed flight envelope. The optimization is focused on weighting function parameters for a given fixed weighting function structure. This thus requires a priori selection of weighting structures.
   Practical implications - The proposed MODE-infinity controller algorithm is expected to ease the design and deployment of the robust controller in autonomous helicopter application especially for practicing engineer with little experience in advance control parameters tuning. Also, it is expected to reduce the design cycle involved in autonomous helicopter development. In addition, the synthesized robust controller will provide effective hovering/low speed autonomous helicopter flight control required in many civilian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications.
   Social implications - The research will facilitate the deployment of low-cost, small-scale autonomous helicopter in various civilian applications.
   Originality/value - The research addresses the challenges involved in selection of weighting function parameters for H-infinity control synthesis to satisfy conflicting stability and time-domain objectives. The problem of population initialization and objectives function computation in the conventional MODE algorithm are addressed to ensure suitability of the optimization algorithm in the formulated H-infinity controller synthesis.

ID AQUACULTURE
AB The process of fish cage inspections, which is a necessary maintenance task at any fish farm, be it small-scale or industrial, is a task that has the potential to be fully automated. Replacing trained divers who perform regular inspections with autonomous marine vehicles would lower the costs of manpower and remove the risks associated with humans performing underwater inspections. Achieving such a level of autonomy implies developing an image processing algorithm that is capable of estimating the state of biofouling buildup. The aim of this work is to propose a complete solution for automating the said inspection process; from developing an autonomous control algorithm for an ROV, to automatically segmenting images of fish cages, and accurately estimating the state of biofouling. The first part is achieved by modifying a commercially available ROV with an acoustic SBL positioning system and developing a closed-loop control system. The second part is realized by implementing a proposed biofouling estimation framework, which relies on AI to perform image segmentation, and by processing images using established computer vision methods to obtain a rough estimate of the distance of the ROV from the fish cage. This also involved developing a labeling tool in order to create a dataset of images for the neural network performing the semantic segmentation to be trained on. The experimental results show the viability of using an ROV fitted with an acoustic transponder for autonomous missions, and demonstrate the biofouling estimation framework's ability to provide accurate assessments, alongside satisfactory distance estimation capabilities. In conclusion, the achieved biofouling estimation accuracy showcases clear potential for use in the aquaculture industry.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Numerous object detection algorithms, such as Faster RCNN, YOLO and SSD, have been extensively applied to various fields. Both accuracy and speed of the algorithms have been significantly improved. However, as 6G technology develops, the detection effect for the small object detection task in intelligent autonomous transportation is not ideal. To strengthen the detection ability and performance of multiple scales, especially for small objects, this study proposed an object detection model based on multi-attention residual network (MA-ResNet). At first, residual network with spatial attention, channel attention, and self-attention were designed as MA-ResNet. Meanwhile, the dataset labels were smoothed. On this basis, the proposed MA-ResNet replaced the original feature extractor VGG-16 of Faster-RCNN. Different layers of MA-ResNet were extracted for feature pyramid construction. Moreover, the improved Faster-RCNN model for object detection based on MA-ResNet was formed. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the model was confirmed. The results demonstrate that MA-ResNet outperforms other feature extraction models with faster convergence speed, higher accuracy, and stronger small object classification accuracy. The improved Faster-RCNN model for object detection can effectively improve the network retrieval accuracy, performance and robustness, can exhibit satisfying adaptability for the targets of different scales in different scenarios such as vehicle identification, autonomous driving in intelligent autonomous transport system with 6G. Moreover, the study provides a certain reference for improving the effect of multiple scales, especially small object detection in intelligent transportation with 6G.

   planning; Parallel potential field computation; Sigmoid limiting and

AB In this paper autonomous air-refueling (AAR) path planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been discussed and an enhanced approach has been put forward. AAR path planning for UAVs was designed and the basic model of the pattern was put forward in our previous work (Cetin and Yilmaz 2013). Additionally to our previous works, the deficiencies of the previous approach, like smooth maneuvers in the tanker approach and the boundary functions of the potential zones has been handled, furthermore special pattern parameters are added to the approach which makes it suitable for different kind of UAVs that has variable flight speed and turn radius parameters. An important originality of the approach is using of sigmoid limiting functions while modeling dynamic behaviors of the potential fields that are based on path planning algorithms. In order to use the AAR path planning approach in a real time application, the computation is performed in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) based parallel architecture by benefiting from many cores in General Purpose Graphical Processing Units (GPGPU) as described in previous research (Cetin and Yilmaz 2013). With the addition of the sigmoid limiting functions instead of logical binary boundary functions computation needs of the autonomous approach become higher point and the only way to use the approach in the real time applications is benefiting of the parallel computing approach. The comparison of the boundary functions as computational performance and path outputs are discussed with the simulation results in this paper. Simulation results are proved that this novel autonomous parallel path planning approach is successful and it would be used in real time applications like AAR mission.

AB The adoption of self-driving technologies requires addressing public concerns about their reliability and trustworthiness. To understand how user experience in self-driving vehicles is influenced by the level of risk and head-up display (HUD) information, using virtual reality (VR) and a motion simulator, we simulated risky situations including accidents with HUD information provided under different conditions. The findings revealed how HUD information related to the immediate environment and the accident's severity influenced the user experience (UX). Further, we investigated galvanic skin response (GSR) and self-reported emotion (Valence and Arousal) annotation data and analyzed correlations between them. The results indicate significant differences and correlations between GSR data and self-reported annotation data depending on the level of risk and whether or not information was provisioned through HUD. Hence, VR simulations combined with motion platforms can be used to observe the UX (trust, perceived safety, situation awareness, immersion and presence, and reaction to events) of self-driving vehicles while controlling the road conditions such as risky situations. Our results indicate that HUD information provision significantly increases trust and situation awareness of the users, thus improving the user experience in self-driving vehicles.

AB Nestled at the confluence of nature grandeur and human civilization, beaches command an influential presence that resonates throughout the environment, society, and culture. However, climate change and pollution overhang the beach health and need to be properly dealt with. Proactive measures involve education, responsible waste management, sustainable infrastructure, and environmental regulations, while reactive ones focus on immediate response and cleanup efforts. Nevertheless, continuous monitoring and cleaning are challenging due to various factors such as beach characteristics, hidden waste, weather conditions and, consequently, high costs. To overcome such challenges, this paper proposes an autonomous system for beach cleaning adopting an Intelligent Hierarchical Cyber-Physical System (IHCPS) approach and Information and Communication Technologies. The proposed beach waste management (BeWastMan) solution integrates an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for the beach aerial surveillance and monitoring, a ground station for data processing, and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle to collect and sort waste autonomously. The research findings contribute to the development of innovative and fully automated approaches in beach waste management, and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the BeWastMan IHCPS by a real case study, developed in the frame of the BIOBLU project.

ID STEERING CONTROL
AB This paper introduces a vehicle guidance control architecture capable of autonomously resolving emergency situations due to a steering system failure. This situation requires a safe stop in the emergency lane by means of differential braking. The proposed approach is based on a three-level hierarchical architecture composed, from the highest to the lowest, by a reference generation, a guidance control, and a control allocation level. The reference generation function computes the trajectory and the speed profile to be tracked by the vehicle according to the active mode of operation: normal or emergency. Switching mode information are received by the fault detection and isolation (FDI) supervisor. The guidance control function generates the steering angle and the braking/accelerating wheels' torques commands based on longitudinal and lateral tracking errors. At the lowest level of hierarchy, the control allocation function dynamically redistributes the control commands to the available set of actuators, according to FDI information. For instance, in the proposed study, promoting differential braking in case of a steering system failure, guaranteeing acceptable tracking performance both in longitudinal and lateral directions. Simulation results prove the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB Autonomous flight of an aerial vehicle requires a sufficiently accurate mathematical model, which can capture system dynamics in the presence of external disturbances. Artificial neural network is known for ideal in capturing systems behaviour, where little knowledge about vehicle dynamics is available. In this paper, we explored this potential of artificial neural network for characterizing nonlinear dynamics of an unmanned airship. The flight experimentation data for an outdoor experimental airship are acquired through a series of pre-determined flight tests. The experimental data are subjected to a class of dynamic recurrent neural network model dubbed as nonlinear auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs for training. Sufficiently trained neural network model captured and demonstrated the longitudinal dynamics of the airship satisfactorily. We also demonstrated the usefulness of proposed technique for Lotte airship, wherein the performance of proposed model is validated and analysed for the Lotte airship flight test data.

AB A meta-analysis was conducted to systematically evaluate the current state of research on human-system interfaces for users controlling semi-autonomous swarms composed of groups of drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAV swarms pose several human factors challenges, such as high cognitive demands, non-intuitive behavior, and serious consequences for errors. This article presents findings from a meta-analysis of 27 UAV swarm management papers focused on the human-system interface and human factors concerns, providing an overview of the advantages, challenges, and limitations of current UAV management interfaces, as well as information on how these interfaces are currently evaluated. In general allowing user and mission-specific customization to user interfaces and raising the swarm's level of autonomy to reduce operator cognitive workload are beneficial and improve situation awareness (SA). It is clear more research is needed in this rapidly evolving field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the exploitation of the combined potential of the directly-actuated and the underactuated control authorities of unmanned aerial vehicles with thrust-vectoring actuation. For the modeling, control synthesis and experimental evaluation a custom developed unmanned tri-tiltrotor is employed, equipped with rotor-tilting mechanisms which enable the direct actuation of its longitudinal dynamics, while retaining the standard body-pitching underactuated authority. An explicit model predictive control scheme relying on constrained multiparametric optimization is proposed for the dual-authority optimal control. The backbone of this scheme is a modeling representation that incorporates the separate internal dynamics of the two actuation principles and their interferences as they concurrently act on the free-flying vehicle body, while tractably representing their differentiated effects on the evolution of the longitudinal dynamics. This paper additionally presents the key implemented features that enable the autonomous operation of the employed tilt-rotor platform, in order to provide a reliable testbed for experimental evaluation. Finally, extensive experimental studies which conclusively validate this strategy's increased efficiency are demonstrated.

AB Autonomous navigation plays an increasingly crucial role in rover-based planetary missions. End-to-end navigation approaches developed upon deep reinforcement learning have enabled great adaptability in complex environments. However, most existing works focus on geometric obstacle avoidance thus have limited capability to cope with ubiquitous non-geometric hazards, such as sinkage and slippage. Autonomous navigation in unstructured harsh environments remains a great challenge requiring further in-depth study. In this letter, a DRL-based navigation method is proposed to autonomously guide a planetary rover towards goals via hazard-free paths with low wheel slip ratios. We introduce an end-to-end network architecture, in which the visual perception and the wheel-terrain interaction are fused to learn the representation of terrain mechanical properties implicitly and further facilitate policy learning for non-geometric hazard avoidance. Our approach outperforms baseline methods in simulation evaluation with superior avoidance capabilities against geometric obstacles and non-geometric hazards. Experiments conducted at a Mars emulation site suggest the successful deployment of our approach on a planetary rover prototype and the capacity of dealing with locomotion risks in real-world navigation tasks.

AB Safe handling of hazardous driving situations is a task of high practical relevance for building reliable and trustworthy cyber-physical systems such as autonomous driving systems. This task necessitates an accurate prediction system of the vehicle's confidence to prevent potentially harmful system failures on the occurrence of unpredictable conditions that make it less safe to drive. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of adapting a misbehavior predictor with knowledge mined during the execution of the main system. Then, we present a framework for the continual learning of misbehavior predictors, which records in-field behavioral data to determine what data are appropriate for adaptation. Our framework guides adaptive retraining using a novel combination of in-field confidence metric selection and reconstruction error-based weighing. We evaluate our framework to improve a misbehavior predictor from the literature on the Udacity simulator for self-driving cars. Our results show that our framework can reduce the false positive rate by a large margin and can adapt to nominal behavior drifts while maintaining the original capability to predict failures up to several seconds in advance.

AB Task allocation is a grand challenge facing researches and practitioners in multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) missions. This paper proposes a new autonomous bio-inspired approach for efficiently allocating tasks among multiple UAVs during a mission. Task assignments are dynamically adjusted by each UAV on the basis of criteria related to the individual UAV operational status and mission parameters, without direct communication between the UAVs actively taking part in the mission. The proposed approach was inspired by the nature of locust species and their autonomous and elastic behavior in response to inside and outside impetus. Four long-standing multi-UAVs task allocation paradigms, including the auction-based, max-sum, ant colony optimization and opportunistic coordination schemes were used to benchmark the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrated that the new approach substantially improves the net throughput and the mean task completion time while maintaining a linear running time when compared to all benchmarks under different scales of fleet size and number of tasks, demonstrating better scalability and sustainability.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can improve traffic safety and transportation network efficiency while also reducing environmental impacts. However, congestion and accidents can easily occur at merging roadways. Therefore, coordinating cooperative merging of CAVs is one of the most common traffic management problems. This paper addresses the problem of integrated longitudinal and lateral cooperative merging control with practical implications for CAVs approaching on-ramps. A hierarchical and decentralized cooperative coordination framework was developed to systematically control the merging of CAVs. The control system of each vehicle can be divided into an upper-level and lower-level. For upper-level control, an optimal control-based algorithm considering input constraints was presented to optimize fuel consumption and passenger comfort. A decision strategy was developed to optimize the start time of lateral trajectory planning. To achieve lower-level control, a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller was used for tracking the optimized longitudinal speed of the upper-level and a decentralized unified algorithm based on nonlinear model predictive control was proposed for tracking the upper-level optimal trajectory. To avoid lateral collision, the driving safety field based on vehicle size and motion state was selected as one of tracking the optimization objectives. Efficiency of the proposed framework and the algorithm was validated by CarSim/Simulink co-simulations of near-real-world vehicle scenarios. The proposed integrated merging control system can improve traffic efficiency and reduce fuel consumption compared to baseline with the potential for real-world application. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the potential applicability of cooperative control methods based on upper-level vehicle control.

AB The huge advantages of intelligent vehicles (IVs) in improving road safety and operating efficiency have become a research focus in the industry. IVs have made significant progress in recent years, but it is still face great challenges in order to be accepted by users on a large scale. In this regard, the authors propose that the research of IVs can be developed along the lines of safety, comfort and economy, gradually overcoming existing dilemmas. First of all, security is the most basic requirement of IVs. The authors sort out the key technologies and challenges of the basic architecture of IVs, and propose existing attack and defences strategies for IVs information security technology. Secondly, comfort is more about people's subjective feelings. From two aspects of physiological comfort and psychological comfort, the paper studies the anthropomorphic decision-making to overcome the mechanized speed control, human computer interaction design, personalized driving style and ethical decision-making methods. Then, aiming at the micro- and macro-levels of economy, it outlines technologies such as economic driving behavioural, collaborative control of people, vehicles and roads and IVs sharing. Finally, the authors summarized the challenges and future development directions in the three stages of IVs development.

AB Interaction between drivers and pedestrians enables pedestrians to cross the street without conflicts. When highly automated vehicles (HAVs) become prevalent, interaction will change. Although HAVs manage to identify pedestrians, they may not be able to assess pedestrians' intentions. This study discusses two different ambitions: Prioritizing pedestrian safety and prioritizing efficient traffic flow; and how these two affect the possibilities to avoid fatal crashes between pedestrians and passenger cars. HAVs' hypothetical possibilities to avoid different crash scenarios are evaluated based on 40 in-depth investigated fatal pedestrian crashes, which occurred with manually-driven cars in Finland in 2014-2016. When HAVs prioritize pedestrian safety, they decrease speed near pedestrians as a precaution which affects traffic flow due to frequent decelerations. When HAVs prioritize efficient traffic flow, they only decelerate, when pedestrians are in a collision course. The study shows that neither of these approaches can be applied in all traffic environments, and all of the studied crashes would not likely be avoidable with HAVs even when prioritizing pedestrian safety. The high expectations of HAVs' safety benefits may not be realized, and in addition to safety and traffic flow, there are many other objectives in traffic which need to be considered.

AB Vehicle dashboard cameras or dashcams, among other smart vehicle technologies, are increasingly attracting interest across the globe. Furthermore, dashcam videos as objective witnesses are often shared to resolve various traffic incidents. In this work, we aim to understand cross-national differences in motives and privacy concerns of dashcam video-sharing, which are closely related to the factors that vary across countries, such as cultural values, traffic regulation, driving environments, and privacy perception. Toward this goal, we conduct a cross-national survey study with three countries with high dashcam adoption rates, i.e., China, Korea, and Russia. The survey results from these countries consistently revealed two major motives for sharing dashcam data: (1) reciprocal altruism and social justice, and (2) monetary reward. Respondents from all three countries felt more strongly towards reciprocal altruism and social justice and less towards monetary rewards. Regarding privacy concerns, however, the surveys presented discrepancies among these countries, indicating stronger cross-national influences on sharing concerns than on sharing motives. Cross-national differences in privacy concerns and their relationship with motives were nuanced and context-dependent.

ID SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; NETWORKS
AB Eco-approach and departure (EAD) systems in connected vehicles are capable of providing the speed recommendations to drivers so that vehicles can pass through successive intersections at the appropriate instants to save time and energy. However, most of existing control strategies and global optimization algorithms for EAD systems have extremely high requirements for computational resources, which make EAD systems not easy to popularize and apply to real vehicles. To overcome this problem, this paper designs a traffic flow prediction model based on deep learning regression machine, and establishes a dynamic effective red-light duration model based on traffic flow queuing effect. To facilitate real-time update of the optimal speed, a constrained optimization model is proposed as an approximation approach, which can obtain similar optimal results to that of the pseudo-spectral method while greatly reducing calculating time. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm for EAD system on passing intersections and energy saving has been validated on the real vehicle under real-world traffic environment. Compared with the uninformed driver, the proposed EAD system saves 2 & x0025; time and 4.6 & x0025; energy on average in case that driver is informed and 8 & x0025; time and 12.1 & x0025; energy in case of autonomous driving.

AB A new application for accelerometers is presented and evaluated instead of using it to measure the linear acceleration of the vehicle, which is usually performed with traditional odometry. In the present case, a dual orthogonal axis accelerometer is vertically aligned in the center of a wheel. Then the rotational position of the wheel can be detected and RPM can be counted based on the accelerometer angular position. A microcontroller is used to measure the value of each accelerometer axis, and with a proper algorithm 12 wheel positions are detected combining the x-axis and y-axis values The wheel position is transmitted by means of a wireless link to another microcontroller or computer located on board of the vehicle to estimate the traveled distance. This embedded wireless device IS now named accelodometer Field results on a pick-up tested at up to 40 km/h and with an autonomous robotic vehicle showed that this accelodometer presented advantages with respect to both usual accelerometer and incremental encoder, avoiding the accumulative error due to the sensor drift. The repeatability of the device was established within the 0 01% in 4 km path. A resolution of 1/12 of the wheel perimeter was determined 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB There are several human factor concerns with highly autonomous or semiautonomous driving, such as transition of control, loss of skill, and dealing with automated system errors. Four CityMobil experiments studied the eLane concept for dual-mode cars, and the results of one are described. The open eLane concept brings together road infrastructure and technical developments in vehicle automation to allow automated driving. The goal for the driving simulator experiment was to design and test the difference between a vocal and an acoustic user interface for a dual-mode vehicle driven both manually and automatically. In the experiment (n = 24), driver behavior was observed with a focus on the transition of control and the occurrence of system errors. Performance of transition of control was adequate for both interfaces at the beginning and end of an eLane. In the case of system failure, 15% of drivers failed to take control of the car in time for both interfaces. However, of those who did regain control, drivers with the vocal interface were faster. Moreover, a subjective questionnaire showed that the vocal interface was perceived as more positive than the acoustic interface. The study suggests that the vocal interface was preferred by participants and can be recommended for the human-machine interface of dual-mode vehicles, especially for providing warnings about system malfunctioning.

AB Disaster relief requires many resources. Depending on the circumstances of each event, it is important to rapidly choose the suitable means to respond to the emergency intervention. A brief review of the conditions and means demonstrated the usefulness of an autonomous stand-alone machine for these missions. If many techniques and technologies exist, their relevant combination to achieve such a system presents several challenges. This communication tries to outline the possible achievement of an autonomous vehicle under these particular circumstances. This paper focuses on the specific working conditions and welcomes future contributions from robotics and artificial intelligence.
   In the necessarily limited scope of this article, the authors focus on a particularly critical aspect: location. Indeed, this machine is intended to evolve in heterogeneous and dangerous environment and without any outside contacts that could last up to several days. This blackout, due to the propagation difficulties of electromagnetic waves in the ground, induces an independence of the localisation process and makes the use of any radio navigation support system (GNSS), most of the time, impossible. The knowledge of the position of the system, both for navigation of the autonomous system (Rover) and location of targets (victims buried under debris) must be able to be estimated without contributions from external systems. Inertial classical techniques, odometer, etc., have to be adapted to these conditions during a long period without external support. These techniques also have to take into account that energy optimisation requests the use of low-power processors. Consequently, only poor computing capacity is available on-board.
   The article starts with a presentation of the context of a post-disaster situation as well as the main missions of Search and Rescue (SaR). It is followed by the analysis of autonomous navigation located in a post-earthquake situation. We will then discuss means to determine the attitude of the autonomous system and its position. The interest of hybridisation with external systems - whenever possible -, will be evaluated with a view to correcting deviations suffered by the system during its mission. Finally, prospects and future work are presented. (C) 2019 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB This article presents a team of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to perform cooperative missions for autonomous construction. In particular, the UAVs have to build a wall made of bricks that need to be picked and transported from different locations. First, we propose a novel architecture for multi-robot systems operating in outdoor and unstructured environments, where robustness and reliability play a key role. Then, we describe the design of our aerial platforms and grasping mechanisms to pick, transport and place bricks. The system was particularly developed for the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC), where Challenge 2 consisted of building a wall cooperatively with multiple UAVs. However, our approach is more general and extensible to other multi-UAV applications involving physical interaction, like package delivery. We present not only our results in the final stage of MBZIRC, but also our simulations and field experiments throughout the previous months to the competition, where we tuned our system and assessed its performance.

AB Wireless power transfer (WPT) and mobile edge computing (MEC) are two prospective technologies to enhance the computing power and endurance of mobile devices. Integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) into wireless powered MEC system, the energy collection efficiency can be effectively improved with the short-distance line-of-sight path power transfer. However, WPT is susceptible to the 'double near-far' effect. Therefore, in this study, the authors study power optimisation in UAV-assisted wireless powered cooperative MEC system, which utilises the user cooperation to make the mobile device which is closer to the UAV acting as a relay for offloading. They aim to minimise the total transmission energy of the UAV through the joint power optimisation while satisfying the delay and size of the computational task. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.

ID EXPECTATIONS; SOCIOLOGY
AB Personal Aerial Transportation Systems (PATS) are an emerging form of transportation that promise to combine the best of ground-based and air-based transportation and to overcome the problems associated with either of these forms of transportation. PATS are discussed as a means to reduce urban congestion by making use of free space in the air. Based on research carried out in the European project myCopter, this paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the potential of personal aerial vehicles (PAVs) in a future transport system. The paper concentrates on a) expectations regarding the potential benefits of PAVs for individuals and for society as a whole, and b) public concerns that are raised in relation to PAVs, as an early indicator for potential societal conflict. The paper applies the concept of constructive technology assessment (CTA) and draws on a combination of system analysis approaches, scenario techniques and focus group discussions. The results are presented and avenues for further research are discussed.

AB With the advancement of deep learning to solve autonomous driving problems, the computation and memory requirements have been growing rapidly. Near-pixel compute-based CMOS image sensors (CIS) have been investigated as a potential candidate to perform the initial computations of workloads close to the pixel and reduce data movement. In this work, we design a near-pixel compute CIS capable of implement-ing a temporal frame filtering network, which rejects redun-dant image frames targeting autonomous driving applications. To improve performance and avoid image distortion, 3D-stacked global shutter CIS is proposed. This architecture integrates photodiodes with memory and compute units using Cu-Cu hybrid bonding. We propose to use back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible Tungsten-doped Indium Oxide Transistors (IWO FETs) based embedded DRAM as buffer memory to achieve refresh-free storage and high bandwidth connections between various com-ponents. Near-pixel compute circuit is optimized by including sparsity-aware adder tree and using NOR gates as data buffers. The two-tier system comprises photodiodes on tier-1 in 40 nm node, and near-pixel compute and buffer memory on tier-2 in 22 nm node. We perform simulations in Cadence, obtaining an energy efficiency of 65 TOPS/W and a compute density of 1.04 TOPS/mm(2) for 8 x 8b MAC, with a total latency of 1.15 ms/frame.

AB Employing unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct close proximity inspection of transmission tower is becoming increasingly common. This article aims to solve the two key problems of close proximity navigation-localizing tower and simultaneously estimating the unmanned aerial vehicle positions. To this end, we propose a novel monocular vision-based environmental perception approach and implement it in a hierarchical embedded unmanned aerial vehicle system. The proposed framework comprises tower localization and an improved point-line-based simultaneous localization and mapping framework consisting of feature matching, frame tracking, local mapping, loop closure, and nonlinear optimization. To enhance frame association, the prominent line feature of tower is heuristically extracted and matched followed by the intersections of lines are processed as the point feature. Then, the bundle adjustment optimization leverages the intersections of lines and the point-to-line distance to improve the accuracy of unmanned aerial vehicle localization. For tower localization, a transmission tower data set is created and a concise deep learning-based neural network is designed to perform real-time and accurate tower detection. Then, it is in combination with a keyframe-based semi-dense mapping to locate the tower with a clear line-shaped structure in 3-D space. Additionally, two reasonable paths are planned for the refined inspection. In experiments, the whole unmanned aerial vehicle system developed on Robot Operating System framework is evaluated along the paths both in a synthetic scene and in a real-world inspection environment. The final results show that the accuracy of unmanned aerial vehicle localization is improved, and the tower reconstruction is fast and clear. Based on our approach, the safe and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle close proximity inspection of transmission tower can be realized.

AB Robust control systems are a necessity for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems due to the challenges they face during operation. Many AUV control-design methods have been developed for different actuator configurations, with robustness against model parameter uncertainties, environmental disturbances, and system faults. Actuator faults can reduce the physical capabilities of a system, which can be compensated for through control re-allocation. However, the increased control allocation to the remaining actuators may cause actuator saturation and reduce controller performance. In this work, we present a depth-pitch model-based nonlinear control law that directly considers actuator saturation, and a fault-tolerant control allocation method for a hybrid AUV actuator configuration. Two types of actuator faults are considered for an underwater vehicle with a hybrid actuator configuration. The proposed controller is implemented in a simulated system, and its trajectory tracking performance is compared with a baseline system without fault or saturation tolerance. To determine the utility of the proposed saturation and fault tolerance control methods, the tracking performance in these simulations is quantified in terms of the settling time, post-fault peak values, and root mean square of the depth and pitch errors.

AB In this paper, we propose novel three-dimensional (3-D) trajectory designs for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communications, where a single UAV needs to adaptively determine its locations in a timely manner in order to provide radio coverage to terrestrial mobile users. Taking the kinematic constraints on the speed and the turning angle of the UAV into account, we formulate a UAV trajectory optimization problem to maximize the average throughput of the considered system, while satisfying the coverage requirements of the mobile users simultaneously. To solve this NP-hard problem, we first propose an offline trajectory design algorithm that can determine the whole trajectory of the UAV, assuming that the global information (e.g., channel state information and the users' location information at all time slots) is known a priori. Then, we propose two low-complexity online algorithms that utilize the past and current information of the system only. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Moreover, we show that our proposed online algorithms can achieve almost the same system performance as the proposed offline algorithm, while inducing significant lower computational complexity.

AB Interior and exterior wind turbine blade inspections are necessary to extend the lifetime of wind turbine generators. The use of unmanned vehicles is an alternative to exterior wind turbine blade inspections performed by technicians that require the use of cranes and ropes. Interior wind turbine blade inspections are even more challenging due to the confined spaces, lack of illumination, and the presence of potentially harmful internal structural components. Additionally, the cost of manned interior wind turbine blade inspections is a major limiting factor. This paper analyses all aspects of the viability of using manually controlled or autonomous aerial vehicles for interior wind turbine blade inspections. We discuss why the size, weight, and flight time of a vehicle, in addition to the structure of the wind turbine blade, are the main limiting factors in performing internal blade inspections. We also describe the design issues that must be considered to provide autonomy to unmanned vehicles and the control system, the sensors that can be used, and introduce some of the algorithms for localization, obstacle avoidance and path planning that are best suited for the task. Lastly, we briefly describe which non-destructive test instrumentation can be used for the purpose.

AB This paper presents the design and analysis of the 'Variable Buoyancy System (VBS)' for depth control which is an essential operation for all underwater vehicles. We use the 'Water Hydraulic Variable Buoyancy System (WHVBS)' method to control the buoyancy and discuss details of the system design architecture of various components of VBS. The buoyancy capacity of the developed VBS is five kilograms and the performance of the VBS in standalone mode is analysed using numerical simulation. Presented VBS is operable to control the buoyancy up to sixty meters of depth and it can be directly installed to medium size UVs. Simulation results show that the developed VBS can reduce the energy consumption significantly and higher in each cycle (i.e. descending and ascending) of the same VBS in standalone mode being operated with either propeller or thruster for sixty meters depth of operation. Our results conclude and demonstrate that the designed VBS is effective in changing the buoyancy and controlling the heave velocity efficiently and this serves the purpose of higher endurance and better performances desired in rescue/attack operations related to the UVs both in civilian and defense domains.

AB This article presents a comprehensive approach to integrate formation tracking control and optimal control for a fleet of multiple surface vehicles (SVs), accounting for both kinematic and dynamic models of each SV agent. The proposed control framework comprises two core components: a high-level displacement-based formation controller and a low-level reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimal control strategy for individual SV agents. The high-level formation control law, employing a modified gradient method, is introduced to guide the SVs in achieving desired formations. Meanwhile, the low-level control structure, featuring time-varying references, incorporates the RL algorithm by transforming the time-varying closed agent system into an equivalent autonomous system. The application of Lyapunov's direct approach, along with the existence of the Bellman function, guarantees the stability and optimality of the proposed design. Through extensive numerical simulations, encompassing various comparisons and scenarios, this study demonstrates the efficacy of the novel formation control strategy for multiple SV agent systems, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.

AB In this letter, we investigate a blocked wireless network in which multiple aerial intelligent reconfigurable surfaces (IRSs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed to assist devices in communication with one base station (BS). To improve the freshness of information received at the BS, we formulate a sum of age-of-information (AoI) minimization problem by optimizing the device scheduling, IRS phase shift, and deployment positions of aerial IRSs. The formulated problem is mixed-integer non-convex due to the existence of binary variables and the coupling among variables. To solve it, we commence by applying the clustering algorithm to reduce the complexity of global scheduling. Then, we decouple the optimization variables and propose an iterative algorithm based on binary variable relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA) approach to deal with the non-linear relations among variables. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks in improving the information freshness.

ID MULTIPLE AGVS; COORDINATION; VEHICLE
AB A combined minimum time - minimum jerk traffic management system for the vehicle coordination in an automated warehouse is presented. The algorithm is organised in two steps: in the first, a simple minimum time optimisation problem is solved, in the second step, this time-optimal solution is refined into a smooth minimum jerk plan for the autonomous forklifts in order to avoid impulsive forces that may unbalance the vehicle. For the first step, we propose a novel approach based on Linear Programming, which guarantees convergence to the optimal solution starting from a feasible point, and a low computational overhead, which makes it suitable for real-time applications. The output of this step is a piecewise constant velocity profile for all the moving robots that ensures collision avoidance. The second step takes such speed profile and generates its smoothed version, which minimises the jerk while respecting the same levels of safety of the solution generated by the first step. We discuss the different solutions with simulation and experimental data.

AB The ocean covers about two-thirds of the earth and has a great effect on the future existence of all human beings. About 37% of the world's population lives within 100 km of the ocean. The ocean is generally overlooked as we focus our attention on land and atmospheric issues; we have not been able to explore the full depths of the ocean and its abundant living and non-living resources. For example, it is estimated that there are about 2,000 billion tons of manganese nodules on the floor of the Pacific Ocean near the Hawaiian Islands. We discovered, by using manned sub-mersibles, that a large amount of carbon dioxide comes from the seafloor and extraordinary groups of organisms live in hydrothermal vent areas. Marine robots including unmanned surface vehicles and unmanned underwater vehicles can help us better understand marine and other environmental issues, protect the ocean resources of the earth from pollution, and efficiently utilize them for human welfare. This paper briefly presents some exemplary models of recent developments in marine robots in different application areas.

AB Autonomous driving and advanced active safety features require accurate high-resolution sensing capabilities. Automotive radars are the key component of the vehicle sensing suit. However, when these radars operate in proximity to flat surfaces, such as roads and guardrails, they experience a multipath phenomenon that can degrade the accuracy of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. Presence of multipath leads to misspecification in the radar data model, resulting in estimation performance degradation, which cannot be reliably predicted by conventional performance bounds. In this article, the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB), which accounts for model misspecification, is derived for the problem of DOA estimation in the presence of multipath which is ignored by the estimator. Analytical relations between the MCRB and the Cramer-Rao bound are established, and the DOA estimation performance degradation due to multipath is investigated. The results show that the MCRB reliably predicts the asymptotic performance of the misspecified maximum-likelihood estimator and therefore, can serve as an efficient tool for automotive radar performance evaluation and system design.

AB The increasingly widespread application of drones and the emergence of urban air mobility leads to a challenging question in airspace modernisation: how to create a safe and scalable air traffic management system that can handle the expected density of operations. Increasing the number of vehicles in a given airspace volume and enabling routine operations are essential for these services to be economically viable. However, a higher density of operations increases risks, poses a great challenge for coordination and necessitates the development of a novel solution for traffic management. This paper contributes to the research towards such a strategy and the field of airspace management by calculating and analysing the conflict probability in an en-route, free-flight scenario for autonomous vehicles. Analytical methods are used to determine the directional dependence of conflict probabilities for exponential and normal prescribed speed probability distributions. The notions of geometric and speed conflict are introduced and distinguished throughout the calculations of the paper. The effect of truncating the set of available flight speeds is also investigated. The sensitivity of the calculated results to speed and heading perturbations is studied within the analytical framework and verified by numerical simulations. Results enable a fresh approach to conflict detection and resolution through distribution shaping and are intended to be used in an integrated, stochastic coordination framework.

ID UNDERWATER; DESIGN
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are used for underwater surveying both in coastal areas and deep sea without human intervention during their operations. AUV's performance, including range and endurance, is adversely affected by their high energy consumption by their thrusters. Herein, we have presented a novel design and development of a standalone variable buoyancy system for an autonomous underwater vehicle. We have studied the numerical and experimental analysis of Variable Buoyancy System (VBS) in standalone mode. Design idea is based upon the 'Pump Driven Variable Buoyancy System (PDVBS)' using 'Water Hydraulic Variable Buoyancy System (WHVBS)' method to control buoyancy using a diaphragm type positive displacement pump (PDP) with maximum buoyancy change capacity at a rate of 4.5 kg/ min. An in-depth investigation of the performance of the developed VBS has been conducted both experimentally and in simulation. Linear regression analysis has been investigated and the performance of the Linear Regression Model (LRM) is evaluated based on the computation of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the LRM. The developed VBS is tested at maximum depth of 5 m and compared to experimental and simulation results. Presented results demonstrate that the designed VBS is effective at changing buoyancy and controlling heave velocities. This will result in achieving higher range and endurance and better performance in rescue/attack operations.

AB Identifying critical habitats is challenging for a relatively rare species like green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), which spends most of its life at sea. We used a fixed array and an autonomous underwater vehicle (Slocum glider) as monitoring platforms to detect acoustically tagged green sturgeon in the coastal ocean. For 1 month in 2018 during spring (May) and again in fall (September-October), both methods were used simultaneously to detect sturgeon bearing uniquely coded transmitters. For the fixed array, nine acoustic receivers were interspersed with three sentinel transmitters along a single line of latitude off Winchester Bay, OR. For the glider, two 3-week deployments were completed along the coast of Oregon from nearshore to the 200-m depth contour. For both deployments, the glider flew a zig-zag course southward as it profiled the water column and collected water quality information. Tagged green sturgeon and sentinel transmitters were successfully detected by both the fixed array and the glider. The fixed array provided indications of onshore and offshore movement, while the glider indicated along-shore movement. Although more green sturgeon were detected by the fixed array, the glider provided information on potential sturgeon aggregation areas. In addition, this application of the underwater glider may provide a unique opportunity for public engagement, teaching, and outreach.

DE autonomous surface vehicle; multiple object detection; transfer learning
AB Recently, research concerning the navigation of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) has been increasing. However, a large-scale implementation of these vessels is still held back by several challenges such as multi-object tracking. Attaining accurate object detection plays a big role in achieving successful tracking. This article presents the development of a detection model with an image-based Con-volutional Neural Network trained through transfer learning, a deep learning tech-nique. To train, test, and validate the detector module, data were collected with the SENSE ASV by sailing through two nearby ports, Leixoes and Viana do Castelo, and recording video frames through its on-board cameras, along with a Light De-tection And Ranging, GPS, and Inertial Measurement Unit data. Images were ex-tracted from the collected data, composing a manually annotated dataset with nine classes of different vessels, along with data from other open-source maritime datasets. The developed model achieved a class mAP@[.5 .95] (mean average precision) of 89.5% and a clear improvement in boat detection compared to a multi-purposed state-of-the-art detector, YOLO-v4, with a 22.9% and 44.3% increase in the mAP with an Intersection over Union threshold of 50% and the mAP@[.5 .95], respectively. It was integrated in a detection and tracking system, being able to continuously detect nearby vessels and provide sufficient informa-tion for simple navigation tasks.

AB This paper presents a new quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm for the trajectory planning task of mobile robotic vehicles in static and dynamic environments-it is called enhanced diversity particle swarm optimization (EDPSO). The main characteristic of this algorithm is that it has peaks of diversity in its population, making it possible to escape from local minima effectively, avoiding stagnation. Through the proposed PSO, it is possible to obtain safe and efficient routes, avoiding energy waste and maintaining system integrity in several possible applications. The parameters of the proposed algorithm were tuned using the benchmarking functions. The same functions were used to compare the algorithm with those already established in the literature. Once the proposed algorithm showed promising results, it was simulated in four environments, each with different complexities, presenting dangerous regions and terrains unsuitable for robot navigation, and a large number of obstacles or even moving objects. Further, the algorithms used for comparison were also simulated and the EDPSO presented satisfactory results. Through simulations it was possible to notice that the proposed approach resulted in collision-free and planned routes, and the algorithm presented increased exploration features owing to the diversity peaks that occur during the optimization.

DT Article
AB In the following technical paper, the author examines how driver assistance systems and automated driving influence road safety. For this purpose, he provides an overview of corresponding projects and field investigations on road safety. Therefore, this paper is to be understood as a review paper. The development of electronic systems and innovative safety in vehicles is now at a high level. This is mainly shown by the overview of the historical development and the expansion of road safety by driver assistance systems. In addition, results from studies and scientific research projects prove that assistance systems have a positive impact on road safety and provide significant support for the driver. For example active safety systems shorten reaction times in the event of imminent collisions and reduce the consequences of accidents. The frequently discussed topic of autonomous driving is now more than pure fiction from science fiction classics such as "I, Robot" or "Total Recall". More and more electronic helpers capable of independently performing driving tasks are finding their way into our vehicles and making our everyday mobile lives easier. Automated driving has long since ceased to be a theoretical concept. We can remain excited about what the mobility of the future will look like. After all, there are still a number of milestones to be reached on the road to autonomous driving.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent an assistance solution for home care of dependent persons. These aircraft can cover the home, accompany the person, and position themselves to take photographs that can be analyzed to determine the person's mood and the assistance needed. In this context, this work principally aims to design a tool to aid in the development and validation of the navigation algorithms of an autonomous vision-based UAV for monitoring dependent people. For that, a distributed architecture has been proposed based on the real-time communication of two modules, one of them in charge of the dynamics of the UAV, the trajectory planning and the control algorithms, and the other devoted to visualizing the simulation in an immersive virtual environment. Thus, a system has been developed that allows the evaluation of the behavior of the assistant UAV from a technological point of view, as well as to carry out studies from the assisted person's viewpoint. An initial validation of a quadrotor model monitoring a virtual character demonstrates the advantages of the proposed system, which is an effective, safe and adaptable tool for the development of vision-based UAVs to help dependents at home.

ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; DECISIONS; MODEL
AB A scheduling algorithm is developed for optimal planning of large-scale, complex evacuations to minimize total delay plus travel time across residents. The algorithm is applied to the eight-county Houston-Galveston region and land use setting under the 2017 Hurricane Harvey scenario with multiple destinations. Autonomous vehicle (AV) use under central guidance is also tested, to demonstrate the evacuation time benefits of AVs. Higher share of AVs delivers more efficient evacuation performance, thanks to greater reliability on evacuation order compliance, lower headways, and higher road capacity. Furthermore, 100% AV use delivers lower overall evacuation costs and network clearance times and less uncertainty in travel times (via lower standard deviation in). Based on evaluations of different evacuation schedules, a 50% compressed evacuation time span resulted in longer travel times and network congestion. A 50% longer evacuation time span reduced residents' total travel time and network congestion, but increased the evacuation cost. As expected, evacuation efficiency falls when evacuees do not comply with evaucation schedules. Large shares of AVs will not be possible in the near future, so methods to enhance evacuees' compliance behavior (e.g., enforced and prioritized evacuation orders) should be considered until a meaningful level of AV technical maturity and penetration rate is available. This paper demonstrates the benefits of scheduled departure times, AV use, and evacuation order compliance, which help balance conflicting objectives during emergencies.

ID IMAGE; MODEL
AB Learning an intelligent lane detection system is significant to autonomous vehicles, which is a crucial module to smart cars. Although conventional approaches have achieved impressive performance, they suffer from the following limitations: (1) lane perception are confronted with different weather conditions and varied illumination. Existing methods lack a unified framework for characterizing different sceneries and (2) the inefficiency of utilizing images due to the potential label noise. To solve these limitations, we propose a lane detection framework towards autonomous vehicles by learning a full-reference quality-aware discriminative gradient deep model, where two types of deep networks are proposed. More specifically, we first design a gradient-guided deep convolutional network to detect the presence of lane, since the gradient value of lane edge is larger than that of other regions. We leverage full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) method to discover more discriminative gradient cues, and geometric attributes are exploited simultaneously. Subsequently, a recurrent neural layer is designed to represent the spatial distribution of detected lanes whose visual cues are difficult to explicitly define. Noticeably, we only utilize a small proportion of the labeled images, whereas the noisy features are abandoned using sparsity penalty. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, kriging with covariates is used to model and map the spatial distribution of salinity measurements gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle in a sea outfall monitoring campaign aiming to distinguish the effluent plume from the receiving waters and characterize its spatial variability in the vicinity of the discharge. Four different geostatistical linear models for salinity were assumed, where the distance to diffuser, the west-east positioning, and the south-north positioning were used as covariates. Sample variograms were fitted by the MatSrn models using weighted least squares and maximum likelihood estimation methods as a way to detect eventual discrepancies. Typically, the maximum likelihood method estimated very low ranges which have limited the kriging process. So, at least for these data sets, weighted least squares showed to be the most appropriate estimation method for variogram fitting. The kriged maps show clearly the spatial variation of salinity, and it is possible to identify the effluent plume in the area studied. The results obtained show some guidelines for sewage monitoring if a geostatistical analysis of the data is in mind. It is important to treat properly the existence of anomalous values and to adopt a sampling strategy that includes transects parallel and perpendicular to the effluent dispersion.

AB Autonomous ships are expected to change water-based transport of both cargo and people, and large investments are being made internationally. There are many reasons for such transformation and interest, including shifting transport of goods from road to sea, reducing ship manning costs, reduced dangerous exposure for crew, and reduced environmental impact.
   Situational awareness (SA) systems and Autonomous navigation systems (ANS) are key elements of autonomous ships. Safe deployment of ANS will not be feasible based on real-life testing only, but will require large-scale, systematic simulation-based testing in addition to assurance of the development process.
   DNV GL proposes to use a digital twin, meaning a digital representation of key elements of the autonomous ship as a key tool for simulation-based testing. The digital twin contains comprehensive mathematical models of the ship and its equipment, including all sensors and actuators. The complete simulation-based test system complementing the digital twin should consist of a virtual world to simulate environmental conditions, geographical information and interaction with other maritime traffic. Finally, the test system must include a test management system that controls simulation of the digital twin and the virtual world, generates test scenarios as well as evaluates the test scenario results. An automatic scenario generation tool should search for low ANS performance, and ultimately establish sufficient coverage of the possible scenario space. The test scenario evaluation should automatically consider safety, conformance to collision regulations at sea (COLREG), and possibly also the efficiency of the ship navigation.
   This paper presents a comprehensive prototype of a test system for ANS. Key topics are simulation-based testing, interfacing the simulator and ANS, cooperation with ANS manufacturers, dynamic test scenario generation, automatic assessment towards COLREG and experiences from the cooperation with The Norwegian Defense Establishment (FFI).

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems as a data acquisition platform and as a measurement instrument are becoming attractive for many surveying applications in civil engineering. Their performance, however, is not well understood for these particular tasks. The scope of the presented work is the performance evaluation of a UAV system that was built to rapidly and autonomously acquire mobile three-dimensional (3D) mapping data. Details to the components of the UAV system (hardware and control software) are explained. A novel program for photogrammetric flight planning and its execution for the generation of 3D point clouds from digital mobile images is explained. A performance model for estimating the position error was developed and tested in several realistic construction environments. Test results are presented as they relate to large excavation and earth moving construction sites. The experiences with the developed UAV system are useful to researchers or practitioners in need for successfully adapting UAV technology for their application(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Autonomous ships are expected to improve the level of safety and efficiency in future maritime navigation. Such vessels need perception for two purposes: to perform autonomous situational awareness and to monitor the integrity of the sensor system itself. In order to meet these needs, the perception system must fuse data from novel and traditional perception sensors using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. This article overviews the recognized operational requirements that are imposed on regular and autonomous seafaring vessels, and then proceeds to consider suitable sensors and relevant AI techniques for an operational sensor system. The integration of four sensors families is considered: sensors for precise absolute positioning (Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)), visual sensors (monocular and stereo cameras), audio sensors (microphones), and sensors for remote-sensing (RADAR and LiDAR). Additionally, sources of auxiliary data, such as Automatic Identification System (AIS) and external data archives are discussed. The perception tasks are related to well-defined problems, such as situational abnormality detection, vessel classification, and localization, that are solvable using AI techniques. Machine learning methods, such as deep learning and Gaussian processes, are identified to be especially relevant for these problems. The different sensors and AI techniques are characterized keeping in view the operational requirements, and some example state-of-the-art options are compared based on accuracy, complexity, required resources, compatibility and adaptability to maritime environment, and especially towards practical realization of autonomous systems.

AB Developing new mobility services such as electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles services requires not only the interaction and interoperation of independent systems such as electric vehicles, electric infrastructure, or off-board servers, but also the collaboration of independent business partners, namely, car manufacturers, energy providers, and service providers, developing, managing and operating these systems. Such services show both Product Service Systems and Systems of Systems characteristics and, as such, can be defined as Product-Service Systems of Systems. While extensive literature exists on developing and managing PSS product and service elements and SoS constituent systems, little research explicitly focuses on PSSoS stakeholders. In particular, the analysis of PSSoS stakeholder business partnerships and involvement in PSSoS development. PSSoS development is seen as the development, operation, and management of constituent systems. This paper contributes to addressing this gap and proposes an approach to manage stakeholder participation in the PSSoS business partnership and PSSoS development.

TI The Robust Semantic SLAM System for Texture-Less Underground Parking Lot
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

DT Article
ID VERSATILE; VISION
AB Automatic valet parking (AVP) is the autonomous driving function that may take the lead in mass production. AVP is usually needed in an underground parking lot, where the light is dim, the parking space is narrow, and the GPS signal is denied. The traditional visual-based simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) algorithm suffers from localization loss because of inaccurate mapping results. A new robust semantic SLAM system is designed mainly for the dynamic low-texture underground parking lot to solve the problem mentioned. In this system, a 16-channel Lidar is used to help the visual system build an accurate semantic map. Four fisheye cameras mounted at the front, back, left, and right of the vehicle are also used to produce the bird's eye view picture of the vehicle by joint calibration. The vehicle can localize itself and navigate to the target parking lot with the semantic segmented picture and the preobtained semantic map. Based on the experiment result, the proposed AVP-SLAM solution is robust in the underground parking lot.

AB The solar-powered marine unmanned surface vehicle (USV) developed by the USV team of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics is a rugged, long-duration, and autonomous navigation vessel designed for the collection of long-range, continuous, real-time, meteorological and oceanographic measurements, especially under extreme sea conditions (sea state 6-7). These solar-powered USVs completed a long-term continuous navigation observation test over 26 days. During this time, they coordinated double-USV observations and actively navigated into the path of Typhoon Sinlaku (2020) before collecting data very close to its center during the 2020 USV South China Sea Typhoon Observation Experiment. Detailed high temporal resolution (1 min) real-time observations collected by the USV on the typhoon were used for operational typhoon forecasting and warning for the first time. As a mobile meteorological and oceanographic observation station capable of reliable, automated deployment, data collection, and transmission, such solar-powered USVs can replace traditional observation platforms to provide valuable real-time data for research, forecasting, and early warnings for potential marine meteorological disasters.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; SCHEME
AB Over the last years, the development and control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with attached robotic manipulators, also called Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System (UVMS), has gained significant research attention. In such applications, feedback controllers which guarantee that the end-effector of the UVMS is fulfilling desired complex tasks should be designed in a way that state and input constraints are taken into consideration. Furthermore, due to their complicated structure, unmodeled dynamics as well as external disturbances may arise. Complex tasks can be conveniently given in the so-called Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Motivated by this, the authors develop a combined abstraction and control synthesis framework in which, given the uncertain kinematics/dynamics of the UVMS, a workspace divided into Regions of Interest and a desired LTL task, a sequence of feedback control laws that probably guarantee the LTL formula is provided. The proposed controller falls within the tube-based non-linear model predictive control methodology and can handle the rich expressivity of LTL in both safety and reachability specifications. Numerical simulations verify the validity of the proposed framework.

AB The existing car-following models of connected vehicles commonly lack experimental data as evidence. In this paper, a Gray correlation analysis is conducted to explore the change in driving behavior with safety messages. The data mining analysis shows that the dominant factor of car-following behavior is headway with no safety message, whereas the velocity difference between the leading and following vehicle becomes the dominant factor when warning messages are received. According to this result, an extended car-following model considering the impact of safety messages (IOSM) is proposed based on the full velocity difference (FVD) model. The stability criterion of this new model is then obtained through a linear stability analysis. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical analysis results. Both analytical and simulation results show that traffic congestion can be suppressed by safety messages. However, the IOSM model is slightly less stable than the FVD model if the average headway in traffic flow is approximately 14-20 m.

AB In order to meet the versatile power requirements of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), we propose a rechargeable lithium-bromine/seawater fuel cell with a protected lithium metal anode to provide high specific energy at either low-power mode with seawater (oxygen) or high-power mode with bromine catholytes. The proof-of-concept fuel cell with a flat catalyst-free graphite electrode can discharge at 3 mW cm(-2) with seawater, and 9 mW cm(-2) with dilute bromine catholytes. The fuel cell can also be recharged with LiBr catholytes efficiently to recover the lithium metal anode. Scanning electron microscopy images reveal that both the organic electrolyte and the bromine electrolyte corrode the solid electrolyte plate quickly, leading to nanoporous pathways that can percolate through the plate, thus limiting the cell performance and lifetime. With improved solid electrolytes or membraneless flow designs, the dual-mode lithium-bromine/oxygen system could enable not only AUV but also land-based electric vehicles, by providing a critical high-power mode to high-energy-density (but otherwise low-power) lithium-air batteries.

AB This paper presents a systematic scheme for fusing millimeter wave (MMW) radar and a monocular vision sensor for on-road obstacle detection. As a whole, a three-level fusion strategy based on visual attention mechanism and driver's visual consciousness is provided for MMW radar and monocular vision fusion so as to obtain better comprehensive performance. Then an experimental method for radar-vision point alignment for easy operation with no reflection intensity of radar and special tool requirements is put forward. Furthermore, a region searching approach for potential target detection is derived in order to decrease the image processing time. An adaptive thresholding algorithm based on a new understanding of shadows in the image is adopted for obstacle detection, and edge detection is used to assist in determining the boundary of obstacles. The proposed fusion approach is verified through real experimental examples of on-road vehicle/pedestrian detection. In the end, the experimental results show that the proposed method is simple and feasible.

AB Autonomous vehicle is a kind of typical complex artificial intelligence system. In current research of autonomous driving, the most widely adopted technique is to use a basic framework of serial information processing and computations, which consists of four modules: perception, planning, decision-making, and control. However, this framework based on data-driven computing performs low computational efficiency, poor environmental understanding and self-learning ability. A neglected problem has long been how to understand and process environmental perception data from the sensors referring to the cognitive psychology level of the human driving process. The key to solving this problem is to construct a computing model with selective attention and self-learning ability for autonomous driving, which is supposed to possess the mechanism of memorizing, inferring and experiential updating, enabling it to cope with traffic scenarios with high noise, dynamic, and randomness. In addition, for the process of understanding traffic scenes, the efficiency of event-related mechanism is more significant than single-attribute scenario perception data. Therefore, an effective self-driving method should not be confined to the traditional computing framework of 'perception, planning, decision-making, and control'. It is necessary to explore a basic computing framework that conforms to human driver's attention, reasoning, learning, and decision-making mechanism with regard to traffic scenarios and build an autonomous system inspired by biological intelligence. In this article, we review the basic methods and main progress in current data-driven autonomous driving technologies, deeply analyze the limitations and major problems faced by related algorithms. Then, combined with authors' research, this study discusses how to implement a basic cognitive computing framework of self-driving with selective attention and an event-driven mechanism from the basic viewpoint of cognitive science. It further describes how to use multi-sensor and graph data with semantic information ( such as traffic maps and a spatial correlation of events) to realize the associative representations of objects and drivable areas, as well as the intuitive reasoning method applied to understanding the situations in different traffic scenarios. The computing framework of autonomous driving based on a selective attention mechanism and intuitive reasoning discussed in this study can adapt to a more complex, open, and dynamic traffic environment.

AB Determining the likelihood of consumers purchasing automated vehicles (AVs) is extremely important for policymakers, researchers, and automobile manufacturers. Successful penetration of AVs into the market depends on the end-user's perception and their affinity towards these vehicles. In this study, a comprehensive state-wide data has been used to determine the factors affecting the purchase likelihood of AVs. A wide range of potential factors are evaluated, including attributes related to safety and consumer's perception, socio-economic and demographic factors, carsharing and ridesharing habits, types of housing and parking, types of owned and future vehicles, consumers' preferences for buying or leasing a vehicle, and their residential region. A random parameters logit model with three outcomes of consumer's affinity (i.e., agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree) towards purchasing either partially (Levels 3 and 4) or fully (Level 5) AVs is considered. Moreover, to account for different layers of unobserved heterogeneity and to obtain a better statistical fit, the means and variances of random parameters are allowed to vary across the observations. The estimations results reveal significant differences between the determinants of consumer's affinity towards partially and fully AVs. For partially AVs, the effect of certain variables related to the status of owing hybrid vehicles, education level, parking type, gender, and consumer's opinion about the future of carsharing and ridesharing programs represented significant degrees of heterogeneity. For fully AVs, however, variables related to education level, parking type, housing type, and ethnicity were found to produce random parameters. The findings from this study can be used to estimate AV penetration and promote AV adoption.

AB Real-time, accurate prediction of human steering behaviors has wide applications, from developing intelligent traffic systems to deploying autonomous driving systems in both real and simulated worlds. In this letter, we present ContextVAE, a context-aware approach for multi-modal vehicle trajectory prediction. Built upon the backbone architecture of a timewise variational autoencoder, ContextVAE observation encoding employs a dual attention mechanism that accounts for the environmental context and the dynamic agents' states, in a unified way. By utilizing features extracted fromsemanticmaps during agent state encoding, our approach takes into account both the social features exhibited by agents on the scene and the physical environment constraints to generate map-compliant and socially-aware trajectories. We performextensive testing on the nuScenes prediction challenge (Caesar et al., 2023), Lyft Level 5 dataset (Houston et al., 2023) andWaymo Open Motion Dataset (Ettinger et al., 2023) to show the effectiveness of our approach and its state-of-the-art performance. In all tested datasets, ContextVAE models are fast to train and provide high-quality multi-modal predictions in real-time.

AB This letter studies the spectrum transaction strategy for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted communications: the mobile device (MD) with much more spectrum resource can temporally lend its spectrum to the UAV to boost the transmissions from the UAV to the base station (BS); in return, the UAV with better channel condition allocates a proportion of its power to forward the MD's signal to the BS. We study how the MD and the UAV establish effective spectrum transactions to increase their transmission rates. When the MD has perfect channel state information (CSI), the spectrum transaction between the MD and the UAV is modeled as a two-stage game, and the corresponding subsequent perfect equilibrium is derived; when the MD only knows statistical CSI for the UAV-BS link, we model it as a Bayesian game, whose Bayesian Nash equilibrium is computed by the Monte Carlo searching method.

AB An operational planning procedure for a time-critical maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) search mission is introduced and evaluated. The mission is the fast identification of a target vessel. The triggering report only contains information regarding the category and displacement of a vessel carrying out a prohibited activity, resembling operational situations. A neural network trained to classify vessels is combined with vessel clustering to reduce waypoints in the flight plan. The UAV's onboard sensors provide input for the neural network regarding each vessel in the search area, resulting in a prioritization of vessels to be visited. As the accuracy of the classification and the possibilities for clustering depend on several operational factors as well as on the UAV's sensor degradation, we investigate three methodologies to identify which planning procedure to use in various operational situations. The results show that our robust and agile approach can help a UAV find the unknown target vessel as soon as possible.

AB This paper is dedicated to solving the time-varying formation control problem of multiple marine surface vehicles experiencing uncertainties, actuator faults and saturation constraints. At first, the transformed Euler-Lagrange dynamics of MSVs are presented for problem formulation. Based on such dynamics, a novel integral manifold possessing finite-time reachability is designed, and it follows that a time-varying formation tracking control scheme is proposed. Owing to the favorable properties of the Euler-Lagrange systems and the hyperbolic tangent function, amplitude constraints on the command control signals could be satisfied by just tuning the design parameters instead of complicated anti-saturation design. Then, the adverse effect arisen from uncertainties and actuator faults is suppressed by designed adaptive laws. Through Lyapunov stability analysis and homogenous theory, the globally finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is theoretically confirmed. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

AB Highly publicised crashes involving self-driving or autonomous vehicles (AVs) have raised questions about safety and eroded public trust in the technology. In this State of the Art Review, we draw on previous successes in injury prevention and public health to focus attention on three strategies to reduce risk and build public confidence as AVs are being tested on public roads. Data pooling, a graduated approach to risk exposure, and harm reduction principles each offer practical lessons for AV testing. The review points out how the eventual deployment of AV technology could have a substantial impact on public health. In this regard, inclusive testing, public education and smart policy could extend the social value of AVs by improving access to mobility and by directing deployments towards scenarios with the greatest population health impact. The application of these strategies does not imply slowing down progress; rather, their implementation could accelerate adoption and result in realising the benefits of AVs more quickly and comprehensively while minimising risks.

AB We recently proposed a concept, called Combined Alternate-Direction Lane Assignment and Reservation-based Intersection Control (CADLARIC), for organizing directionally unrestricted traffic flows in automated vehicle environment. The conflicts between through movements are handled by a reservation-based algorithm while the turning conflicts at the intersections are avoided altogether. This paper extends this research by analyzing the impacts that CADLARIC's parameters, used to control the conflict-resolution processes, have on the efficiency and surrogate safety indicators. The investigated parameters include: (i) buffer time in cell's reservation schedule; (ii) allowed speed to cross the reserved cell; (iii) distance from intersection from which a vehicle can make reservation, and (iv) duration of the lane-change process. For most of the investigated parameters, the numerical results show that less efficient operations lead not just to an increase in delay time and number of stops but also increase number of conflicting situations, because of vehicular queues formed within the intersection zone.

AB Overtaking maneuver is one of the most dangerous scenarios for road vehicles especially in two-way roads. In this article, we propose a new formulation for the problem of overtaking in two-way roads using the tools from the Mixed Observable Markov Decision Process (MOMDP). This new formulation helps us to find the optimum strategy considering the uncertainties in the problem. Due to its computational complexity, solutions of Markov-based decision processes are very complicated, especially for the problems with measurement uncertainties. With the help of the efficient solvers and development and evolutions in computational technology, we show the applicability of Markov-based decision processes for the overtaking problem. The proposed method is tested in simulations and compared with other stochastic-variant Markov Decision Process (MDP) and classical time to collision (TTC) approaches. The proposed MOMDP solution improves the performance in comparison to both MDP and classical TTC approaches by lowering collision probability and overtaking duration.

DT Article
DE Autonomous Driving; Pedestrian Attributes; Multi-Task Learning
AB Safe interaction with pedestrians is important for autonomous vehicles in urban environments. Comprehensive understanding of pedestrian behavior is a challenge for autonomous driving, as different pedestrian attributes have different characteristics and there is not yet a dataset providing all attribute labels. In this paper, we design an efficient multi-task model for pedestrian detection, tracking and attribute recognition to fully mine information in multiple tasks and multiple datasets to reduce redundant image processing computation. Multiple training datasets are utilized to take full advantage of the available partially-labeled data. The model consists of two stages. The first stage is to detect and track pedestrians, using only low-resolution images to save compu-tational resources. Accurate pedestrian detection is achieved in the bird's-eye-view (BEV), while pedestrian tracking is implemented on the basis of 3D bounding boxes. The second stage is image-based multi-attribute detection. This stage uses the detection and tracking results and some pre-processed information from the first stage along with high-resolution images. Multi-attributes of the pedestrian are identified, such as pedestrian's pose, age, gender, and motion direction. With a carefully-designed multi-task system that shares necessary feature maps among multiple tasks and reuses computation results, we can solve pedestrian detection, tracking, and multi-attribute recognition problems in an efficient framework. This leads to more accurate decisions and more efficient computations. The innovation of the model is to accomplish a simultaneous detection of multiple pedestrian attributes for autonomous driving, while fully sharing the features in the model to avoid repeated computation, as well as utilizing multiple partially-labeled datasets for the pedestrian detection, tracking and attribute recognition model training.

DE Autonomous UAV; CNNs; end-to-end learning; nano-UAV; ultralow-power
AB Fully autonomous miniaturized robots (e.g., drones), with artificial intelligence (AI)-based visual navigation capabilities, are extremely challenging drivers of Internet-of-Things edge intelligence capabilities. Visual navigation based on AI approaches, such as deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming pervasive for standard-size drones, but are considered out of reach for nano-drones with a size of a few cm(2). In this paper, we present the first (to the best of our knowledge) demonstration of a navigation engine for autonomous nano-drones capable of closed-loop end-to-end DNN-based visual navigation. To achieve this goal we developed a complete methodology for parallel execution of complex DNNs directly on board resource-constrained milliwatt-scale nodes. Our system is based on GAP8, a novel parallel ultralow-power computing platform, and a 27-g commercial, open-source Crazyflie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. As part of our general methodology, we discuss the software mapping techniques that enable the DroNet state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network to be fully executed aboard within a strict 6 frame-per-second real-time constraint with no compromise in terms of flight results, while all processing is done with only 64 mW on average. Our navigation engine is flexible and can be used to span a wide performance range: at its peak performance corner, it achieves 18 frames/s while still consuming on average just 3.5% of the power envelope of the deployed nano-aircraft. To share our key findings with the embedded and robotics communities and foster further developments in autonomous nano-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we publicly release all our code, datasets, and trained networks.

AB Two models of underwater gliders were tested in a wind tunnel: one corresponding to a legacy shape commonly used in contemporary vehicles and the other a scaled down version of a new design. Performance of the two vehicles was characterized over a range of speeds and angles of attack. Particular attention was paid to the effect of sharp features along the hulls of the two vehicles and how they affect the observed flow regime. It has been shown that the new design, which uses a bow shape designed to encourage natural laminar flow, benefits from a 10% reduction of parasitic drag and 13% increase in lift-to-drag when the hull surface is smooth. The legacy glider, made up of a faired bow and a cylindrical hull, suffers from laminar separation and up to 100% increase in induced drag if the flow over its bow is prevented from transitioning to a turbulent state before encountering adverse pressure gradient at lower Reynolds numbers. This results in lowering of attainable speed at shallow glide path angles, whereas the associated parasitic drag reduction is demonstrated to increase the maximum velocity of the glider when moving at glide slopes greater than approximately 30 degrees.

ID TRAVELING-SALESMAN PROBLEM
AB Recently, several prominent logistic companies in Europe and the USA are seriously considering the idea of using drones launched from trucks and working in parallel to deliver packages. In the relevant literature, a novel problem formulation called travelling salesman problem with drone has been introduced, and some modelling and solution approaches have been presented. Existing approaches are based on the main assumption that the truck can dispatch and pick up a drone only at a node, i.e. the depot or a customer location. Here, the authors present a novel approach aimed to maximise the drone usage in parcel delivering. The authors consider that a truck can deliver and pick a drone up not only at a node but also along a route arc (en route). In this way, the operations of a drone are not strictly related to the customers' position, but it can serve a wider area along the route. The authors tested the proposed heuristic on benchmark instances and analysed the benefits introduced with the en route approach.

AB The significant growth in the size of cities has led to an increase in distances travelled that emphasises the systemic shortcomings of metros. Metro systems are hindered by a paradox between the time to access stations and the average speed on the line, which prevents them from offering competitive door-to-door speeds within the natural time budgets of users. The authors present a novel methodology that combines the back-casting method with a systems engineering approach to develop a robust problem-solving process that can cope with the uncertainty of future scenarios. The approach has been used to develop a solution to the paradox, that is based on an operational strategy where autonomous vehicles stop in different patterns at stations along a line. It is proposed that vehicles will travel in platoons and be controlled by vehicle-to-vehicle communication algorithms similarly to those in automated highways. Simulations show that this strategy can increase the average speed on a line by 129%, reducing door-to-door journey times by up to 45%, compared to conventional operations. Moreover, capacity is increased by 30% within conventional platform lengths. In conclusion, this process can lead to solutions that accommodate future demands and change current trends into more desirable futures.

AB One of the challenges for manned-unmanned air vehicles flying in joint airspace is the need to develop customized but scalable algorithms and hardware that will allow safe and efficient operations. In this work, we present the design of a bus-backboned UAV microavionics system and the hardware-in-the-loop integration of this unit within a joint flight network simulator. The microavionics system is structured around the Controller Area Network and Ethernet bus data backbone. The system is designed to be cross-compatible across our experimental mini-helicopters, aircrafts and ground vehicles, and it is tailored to allow autonomous navigation and control for a variety of different research test cases. The expandable architecture allows not only scalability, but also flexibility to test manned-unmanned fleet cooperative algorithm designs at both hardware and software layer deployed on bus integrated flight management computers. The flight simulator is used for joint simulation of virtual manned and unmanned vehicles within a common airspace. This allows extensive hardware-in-the-loop testing capability of customized devices and algorithms in realistic test cases that require manned and unmanned vehicle coordinated flight trajectory planning.

AB Assessment of animal status, housing conditions and manually collecting floor eggs are the major daily tasks for poultry farmers. To assist the farmer in these tasks, PoultryBot, an autonomous mobile robot for use in poultry houses has been developed. In earlier research, several components of PoultryBot were discussed in detail. Here, performance of the robot is evaluated under practical conditions. For navigation, different paths were used to assess its navigation performance for various tasks, such as area sweeping and surveying close to walls. PoultryBot proved capable of navigating autonomously more than 3000 m, while avoiding obstacles and dealing with the hens present. The robustness of its navigation performance was tested by confronting PoultryBot with obstacles in different positions with respect to its path and using different settings of the navigation parameters. Both factors clearly influenced the driving behaviour of PoultryBot. For floor egg collection, detection and collection of eggs was assessed at 5 predefined egg positions lateral to the path of the robot. Over 300 eggs were tested; 46% were collected successfully, 37% was not collected successfully, and 16% were missed. The most observed failures occurred when the collection device was just next to the egg. It is thought that this problem can be solved by improving the control algorithm. The results demonstrate the validity of the PoultryBot concept and the possibility of autonomous floor egg collection in commercial poultry houses. Furthermore, they indicate that application of smart autonomous vehicles in dense animal environments is feasible. (C) 2018 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Motion planning is one of the mast significant part in autonomous driving. Learning-based motion planning methods attract many researchers' attention due to the abilities of learning from the environment and directly making decisions from the perception. The deep Q-network, as a popular reinforcement learning method, has achieved great progress in autonomous driving, but these methods seldom use the global path information to handle the issue of directional planning such as making a turning at an intersection since the agent usually learns driving strategies only by the designed reward function, which is difficult to adapt to the driving scenarios of urban roads. Moreover, different motion commands such as the steering wheel and accelerator are associated with each other from classic Q-networks, which easily leads to an unstable prediction of the motion commands since they are independently controlled in a practical driving system. In this paper, a conditional deep Q-network for directional planning is proposed and applied in end-to-end autonomous driving, where the global path is used to guide the vehicle to drive from the origination to the destination. To handle the dependency of different motion commands in Q-networks, we take use of the idea of fuzzy control and develop a defuzzification method to improve the stability of predicting the values of different motion commands. We conduct comprehensive experiments in the CARLA simulator and compare our method with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves better learning performance and driving stability performance than other methods.

AB Globally, 1.3 billion on-road vehicles consume 79 quadrillion BTU of energy, mostly gasoline and diesel fuels, emit 5.7 gigatonnes of CO2, and emit other pollutants to which approximately 200,000 annual premature deaths are attributed. Improved vehicle energy efficiency and emission controls have helped offset growth in vehicle activity. New technologies are diffusing into the vehicle fleet in response to fuel efficiency and emission standards. Empirical assessment of vehicle emissions is challenging because of myriad fuels and technologies, intervehicle variability, multiple emission processes, variability in operating conditions, and varying capabilities of measurement methods. Fuel economy and emissions regulations have been effective in reducing total emissions of key pollutants. Real-world fuel use and emissions are consistent with official values in the United States but not in Europe or countries that adopt European standards. Portable emission measurements systems, which uncovered a recent emissions cheating scandal, have a key role in regulatory programs to ensure conformity between real driving emissions and emission standards. The global vehicle fleet will experience tremendous growth, especially in Asia. Although existing data and modeling tools are useful, they are often based on convenience samples, small sample sizes, large variability, and unquantified uncertainty. Vehicles emit precursors to several important secondary pollutants, including ozone and secondary organic aerosols, which requires a multipollutant emissions and air quality management strategy. Gasoline and diesel are likely to persist as key energy sources to mid-century. Adoption of electric vehicles is not a panacea with regard to greenhouse gas emissions unless coupled with policies to change the power generation mix. Depending on how they are actually implemented and used, autonomous vehicles could lead to very large reductions or increases in energy consumption. Numerous other trends are addressed with regard to technology, emissions controls, vehicle operations, emission measurements, impacts on exposure, and impacts on public health.Implications: Without specific policies to the contrary, fossil fuels are likely to continue to be the major source of on-road vehicle energy consumption. Fuel economy and emission standards are generally effective in achieving reductions per unit of vehicle activity. However, the number of vehicles and miles traveled will increase. Total energy use and emissions depend on factors such as fuels, technologies, land use, demographics, economics, road design, vehicle operation, societal values, and others that affect demand for transportation, mode choice, energy use, and emissions. Thus, there are many opportunities to influence future trends in vehicle energy use and emissions.

AB Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) are broadly recognized as next-generation transformative transportation technologies having great potential to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and stability. Efficiently controlling CAVs on two-dimensional curvilinear roadways to follow preceding vehicles is denoted as the two-dimensional car-following process, which is highly critical; this process is challenging to implement owing to the complexity and varied nature of driving environments. This study proposes an innovative integrated two-dimensional control strategy for CAVs based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which efficiently regulates the two-dimensional car-following process of CAVs in terms of both stability-wise longitudinal control performance and accurate lateral path-tracking performance. Within the control framework, each CAV can receive the surrounding information from downstream vehicles and roadway geometry based on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. To better utilize this information, we designed a physics-informed DRL state fusion approach and reward function, which efficiently embeds prior physics knowledge and borrows the merits of the equilibrium and consensus concepts from the control theory. Given the physics-informed information, the DRL-based controller outputs the integrated control instructions for both longitudinal and lateral control. For training, we constructed a roadway with a set of varying curvatures and em-bedded the ground-truth vehicle trajectory datasets to more effectively capture the realistic variations in the roadway geometry and driving environment. To facilitate value function approximation and enhance the policy iteration process in training, the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) algorithm was applied, owing to its balanced performance. A series of simulated experiments were conducted to validate the controller's lateral control accuracy and stability-wise oscillation dampening performance in diverse traffic scenarios, including extreme ones.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB How to drive safely in complex real-world traffic settings has long been a question and challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Decision-making systems (DecSs) are the core of AVs, and their safety and rationality are crucial. Several decision-making techniques and algorithms have been applied to AVs; however, they are still subject to limitations and deficiencies, making it impossible to fully guarantee safety. Thus, it is necessary to conduct a safety assessment of the state performance of the DecSs of AVs to reduce driving risks and implement immediate safety measures. This article reviews relevant research on safety assessment methods of AVs' DecSs. The insufficiency of the current DecSs in terms of safety is analyzed, and the importance and definition of decision-making safety assessment (DMSA) are established. On this basis, assessment indexes related to DMSA are analyzed. From the perspectives of methodology and industrialization development, the existing safety assessment methods are summarized categorically, their applicability and limitations are discussed, and corresponding constructive strategies for improvement are proposed. Additionally, the deficiencies of the existing DMSA methods and the areas that need improvement are analyzed. In this regard, the future challenges and development opportunities of DMSA are proposed. This article provides a useful reference for the perfect DMSA method.

While autonomous vehicles drive on the road under occlusion (e.g., car, bus, truck) and changing environment appearance (e.g., illumination changes, seasonal variation), existing approaches rely heavily on dense point descriptors at the feature level to solve the registration problem, entangling features with appearance and occlusion. As a result, they often fail to estimate the correct poses. To address these issues, we propose a sparse semantic map-based monocular localization method, which solves 2D-3D registration via a well-designed deep neural network. Given a sparse semantic map that consists of simplified elements (e.g., pole lines, traffic sign midpoints) with multiple semantic labels, the camera pose is then estimated by learning the corresponding features between the 2D semantic elements from the image and the 3D elements from the sparse semantic map. The proposed sparse semantic map-based localization approach is robust against occlusion and long-term appearance changes in the environments. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Perception in terms of object detection, classification, and dynamic estimation (position and velocity) are fundamental functionalities that autonomous agents (unmanned ground vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, or robots) have to navigate safely and autonomously. To date, various sensors have been used individually or in combination to achieve this goal. In this paper, we present a novel method for leveraging millimeter wave radar's (mmW radar's) ability to accurately measure position and velocity in order to improve and optimize velocity estimation using a monocular camera (using optical flow) and machine learning techniques. The proposed method eliminates ambiguity in optical flow velocity estimation when the object of interest is at the edge of the frame or far away from the camera without requiring camera-radar calibration. Moreover, algorithms of various complexity were implemented using custom dataset, and each of them successfully detected the object and estimated its velocity accurately and independently of the object's distance and location in frame. Here, we present a complete implementation of camera-mmW radar late feature fusion to improve the camera's velocity estimation performance. It includes setup design, data acquisition, dataset development, and finally, implementing a lightweight ML model that successfully maps the mmW radar features to the camera, allowing it to perceive and estimate the dynamics of a target object without any calibration.

AB As marine plastic pollution threatens the marine ecosystem seriously, the government needs to find an effective way to clean marine plastics. Due to the advantages of easy operation and high efficiency, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been applied to clean marine plastics. As for the large-scale marine environment, the marine plastic cleaning task needs to be accomplished through the collaborative work of multiple AUVs. Assigning the cleaning task to each AUV reasonably and effectively has an essential impact on improving cleaning efficiency. The coordination of AUVs is subjected to harsh communication conditions. Therefore, to release the dependence on the underwater communications among AUVs, proposing a reliable multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) model is necessary. Inspired by the evolutionary game theory, this paper proposes a novel multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) model based on replicator dynamics for marine plastic cleaning. This novel model not only satisfies the minimization of the cost function, but also reaches a relatively stable state of the task allocation. A novel optimization algorithm, equilibrium optimizer (EO), is adopted as the optimizer. The simulation results validate the correctness of the results achieved by EO and the applicability of the proposed model. At last, several valuable conclusions are obtained from the simulations on the three different assumed AUVs.

AB Governments, industry and academia are paying high attention to autonomous vehicles and platooning, due to their high potential to transform public and private transport and reduce carbon emissions generated by road transport. The road freight sector is expected to be an early adopter of the autonomous technology due to the potential cost reduction for logistics companies. However, despite the expected fuel savings and polluting emission reductions due to truck platooning, actual benefits would strongly depend on the adopted technology and the operational conditions of the system. This paper investigates the potential for truck platooning to reduce carbon emissions from road freight, presenting a series of scenarios that vary by adoption rates, operational models and platoon size. Scenarios were co-designed with freight stakeholders to build a Truck Platooning Roadmap (2025-2050), considering a specific case study: the UK. Polluting emissions and related external costs are calculated across the different scenarios. Results show that there is high uncertainty for the adoption of truck platooning, with a potential first phase involving a small pool of low-automated trucks, and a second phase with a larger pool of high-automated trucks, reflecting higher economic and environmental benefits. A series of other technological and policy considerations are presented to support policymakers to draw a zero-carbon road freight strategy.

AB The mobility manager in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) plays a major role in data acquisition. In this paper, one novel obstacle avoidance method based on fluid mechanics is discussed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in 3D IoUT. The proposed method utilizes ocean current characteristics simplified as stream-function to design an optimal 3D trajectory with an obstacle avoidance function. 3D stream-function is constructed for spherical and cylindrical obstructions in details. Theoretical analysis of 3D stream-function proves that traditional 2D stream-function can be extended to 3D IoUT space under specific conditions. One path deformation method based on virtual obstacle methodology is proposed to overcome the inherent hysteresis problem of the traditional stream-function based obstacle avoidance design. Moreover, we introduce an energy consumption model for AUV to prove that our obstacle avoidance algorithm can improve energy efficiency if actual ocean currents exist. Extensive simulation results verify that the proposed obstacle avoidance method has the characteristics of curve continuity and smoothness, enhanced obstacle avoidance effects, and high energy efficiency. Therefore, the proposed method meets the actual requirements of multi-obstacle avoidance path planning for AUV in IoUT.

AB Purpose Autonomous technologies represent an increasingly important, but at the same time controversial technological field with enormous potential. From a consumer perspective, however, the growing autonomy of technologies might result in a perceived loss of control, which can lead to consumer resistance. Given the practical and theoretical relevance, this research examines antecedents to consumer adoption of autonomous technologies in the context of self-driving cars. Design/methodology/approach This article looks through the lens of the technology acceptance model and conducts structural equation modeling. Findings The study validates the positive effect of perceived usefulness on behavioral intention to adopt self-driving cars. The results further suggest that individuals with a generally negative attitude toward technologies are afraid that they might not be capable of handling the new technology. Moreover, further mediation analyses reveal that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness help us to explain the indirect effects of novelty seeking and technology anxiety on adoption intention. Practical implications The results imply that users' perceptions of an autonomous technology's usefulness are an important determinant of technology adoption. Adoption barriers could be overcome by emphasizing the usability of the new technology. On the other hand, individuals who enjoy using the old technology may be persuaded by arguments that focus on the usefulness of the new technology rather than its ease of use. Originality/value Self-driving automobiles will change our perception of mobility. It is important to understand the mechanisms that drive the adoption of such innovations.

AB Autonomous driving is designed to enhance the overall performance of vehicular traffic. The primary objective of this study is to develop an improved car-following model for adaptive cruise control (ACC) by integrating conventional automated logic with human factors. Specifically, a modeling framework is proposed with a generalization of a classical action point paradigm describing drivers' psychological reactions and expectations. The action points are determined from collected data, from which the unconscious and conscious reaction regimes can be identified. Based on this identification, the human-like driving mode is carried out, and its corresponding acceleration model is developed to reproduce empirical car-following spiral within the unconscious regime, whereas the conventional autonomous mode driven by the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is used to calculate changes in acceleration for the conscious regime. To integrate the two modes, a switching rule considering the random occurrence of action points is also determined. The results of numerical experiments reveal that simulated macroscopic traffic is compatible with the three-phase theory. Moreover, traffic mobility in terms of throughput and speed is significantly improved compared to that achieved by the classical IDM. Asymptotic stability is achieved in four typical fluctuation scenarios, as the amplitudes of fluctuations converge while travelling along the vehicular platoon. However, the classical IDM fails to maintain such stability. The proposed model enables ACC to drive in accordance with drivers' psychological traits, and consequently has the potential to increase the acceptance of autonomous driving. It also has the ability to help ACC enhance traffic efficiency and safety.

AB In the shipping digitalisation process, the peak will be reached with the advent of a wholly autonomous and at the same time safe and reliable ship. Full autonomy could be obtained by two linked Artificial-Intelligence systems representing the ship navigator and the ship engineer that possess sensing and analysis skills, situational awareness, planning, and control capabilities. Many efforts have been made in developing onboard systems; however, the shore facilities are not ready yet to deal with these new technologies. The paper aims to present the innovative technologies and methodologies needed to develop a futuristic Vessel Traffic System. The proposed systems will aim at faultless data acquisition and processing, provide input to decision-making systems, and suggest evasive manoeuvre; to deal with hazards and systems failure without human intervention onboard. The system is composed of three different and interacting layers. The first is an artificially intelligent tool to detect and control autonomous ships, thanks to situation recognition and obstacle avoidance strategies. The second is an orchestration and management platform designed to coordinate the sensing/actuation infrastructure and the AI algorithms' results made available by multiple ships, mustering edge, and distributed computing techniques to fulfil the specific harsh requirements of the sea environment. The final part is a holistic guidance-navigation-control framework to manage autonomous ships' navigation in a crowded area. Eventually, a cyber-physical scenario, using both a ship digital-twin and a real model-scale ship, is suggested to test and validate the innovative system without the availability of a full-scale scenario.

AB In recent years, the neural network (NN) has shown its great potential in image recognition tasks of autonomous driving systems, such as traffic sign recognition, pedestrian detection, etc. However, theoretically well-trained NNs usually fail their performance when facing real-world scenarios. For example, adverse real-world conditions, e.g., bad weather and lighting conditions, can introduce different physical variations and cause considerable accuracy degradation. As for now, the generalization capability of NNs is still one of the most critical challenges for the autonomous driving system. To facilitate the robust image recognition tasks, in this work, we build the RobuTS dataset: a comprehensive Robust Traffic Sign Recognition dataset, which includes images with different environmental variations, e.g., rain, fog, darkening, and blurring. Then to enhance the NN's generalization capability, we propose two generalization-enhanced training schemes: 1) REIN for robust training without data in adverse scenarios and 2) Self-Teaching (ST) for robust training with unlabeled adverse data. The great advantages of such two training schemes are they are data-free (REIN) and label-free (ST), thus effectively reducing the huge human efforts/cost of on-road driving data collection, as well as the expensive manual data annotation. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our methods' performance on both classification and detection tasks. For classification tasks, our proposed training algorithms could consistently improve model performance by +15%-25% (REIN) and +16%-30% (ST) in all adverse scenarios of our RobuTS datasets. For detection tasks, our ST could also improve the detector's performance by +10.1 mean average precision (mAP) on Foggy-Cityscapes, outperforming previous state-of-the-art works by +2.2 mAP.

AB Featured Application This paper can be applied to an autonomous vehicle and driving assistance system.
   Abstract Pedestrian detection is the core of the driver assistance system, which collects the road conditions through the radars or cameras on the vehicle, judges whether there is a pedestrian in front of the vehicle, supports decisions such as raising the alarm, automatically slowing down, or emergency stopping to keep pedestrians safe, and improves the security when the vehicle is moving. Suffering from weather, lighting, clothing, large pose variations, and occlusion, the current pedestrian detection still has a certain distance from the practical applications. In recent years, deep networks have shown excellent performance for image detection, recognition, and classification. Some researchers employed deep network for pedestrian detection and achieve great progress, but deep networks need huge computational resources, which make it difficult to put into practical applications. In real scenarios of autonomous vehicles, the computation ability is limited. Thus, the shallow networks such as UDN (Unified Deep Networks) is a better choice, since it performs well while consuming less computation resources. Based on UDN, this paper proposes a new deep network model named two-stream UDN, which augments another branch for solving traditional UDN's indistinction of the difference between trees/telegraph poles and pedestrians. The new branch accepts the upper third part of the pedestrian image as input, and the partial image has less deformation, stable features, and more distinguished characters from other objects. For the proposed two-stream UDN, multi-input features including the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature, Sobel feature, color feature, and foreground regions extracted by GrabCut segmentation algorithms are fed. Compared with the original input of UDN, the multi-input features are more conducive for pedestrian detection, since the fused HOG features and significant objects are more significant for pedestrian detection. Two-stream UDN is trained through two steps. First, the two sub-networks are trained until converge; then, we fuse results of the two subnets as the final result and feed it back to the two subnets to fine tune network parameters synchronously. To improve the performance, Swish is adopted as the activation function to obtain a faster training speed, and positive samples are mirrored and rotated with small angles to make the positive and negative samples more balanced.

AB Planar type docking enables a convenient underwater energy supply for irregularly shaped autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), but the corresponding control method is still challenging. Conventional control methods for torpedo-shaped AUVs are not suitable for planar type docking due to the significant differences in system structures and motion characteristics. This paper proposes a two-step adaptive control method to solve the planar type docking problem. The method makes a seamless combination of horizontal dynamic positioning and visual servo docking considering ocean current disturbance. The current disturbance is estimated and canceled in the pre-docking step using a current observer, and the positioning error is further compensated for by the vertical visual servo technique in the docking step. Reduced order dynamic models are distinctively established for different docking steps according to the motion characteristics, based on which the dynamic controllers are designed considering the model parameter uncertainties. Simulation is conducted with an initial distance of 10 m in the horizontal direction and 3 m in depth. Stable and accurate dynamic positioning under up to 0.4 m/s of current disturbances with different directions is validated. A 0.5 m lateral positioning error is successfully compensated for by the visual servo docking step. The proposed control method provides a valuable reference for similar types of docking application.

AB Hydrobatic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can be efficient in range and speed, as well as agile in maneuvering. They can be beneficial in scenarios such as obstacle avoidance, inspections, docking, and under-ice operations. However, such AUVs are underactuated systems-this means exploiting the system dynamics is key to achieving elegant hydrobatic maneuvers with minimum controls. This paper explores the use of model predictive control (MPC) techniques to control underactuated AUVs in hydrobatic maneuvers and presents new simulation and experimental results with the small and hydrobatic SAM AUV. Simulations are performed using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) on the full AUV system to provide optimal control policies for several hydrobatic maneuvers in Matlab/Simulink. For implementation on AUV hardware in robot operating system, a linear time varying MPC (LTV-MPC) is derived from the nonlinear model to enable real-time control. In simulations, NMPC and LTV-MPC shows promising results to offer much more efficient control strategies than what can be obtained with PID and linear quadratic regulator based controllers in terms of rise-time, overshoot, steady-state error, and robustness. The LTV-MPC shows satisfactory real-time performance in experimental validation. The paper further also demonstrates experimentally that LTV-MPC can be run real-time on the AUV in performing hydrobatic maneouvers.

AB Accurate positioning and state estimation of surface vessels are prerequisites to achieving autonomous navigation. Recently, the rapid development of 3D LiDARs has promoted the autonomy of both land and aerial vehicles, which has aroused the interest of researchers in the maritime community accordingly. In this paper, the state estimation schemes based on 3D LiDAR scan matching are explored in depth. Firstly, the iterative closest point (ICP) and normal distribution transformation (NDT) algorithms and their variants are introduced in detail. Besides, ten representative registration algorithms are selected from the variants for comparative analysis. Two types of experiments are designed by utilizing the field test data of an ASV equipped with a 3D LiDAR. Both the accuracy and real-time performance of the selected algorithms are systemically analyzed based on the experimental results. It follows that ICP and Levenberg-Marquardt iterative closest point (LMICP) methods perform well on single-frame experiments, while the voxelized generalized iterative closest point (FastVGICP) and multi-threaded optimization generalized iterative closest point (FastGICP) methods have the best performance on continuous-frame experiments. However, all methods have lower accuracy during fast turning. Consequently, the limitations of current methods are discussed in detail, which provides insights for future exploration of accurate state estimation based on 3D LiDAR for ASVs.

AB The infrastructure and construction of roads are crucial for the economic and social development of a region, but traffic-related challenges like accidents and congestion persist. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have been used in road infrastructure and construction, particularly with the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Object detection in Computer Vision also plays a key role in improving road infrastructure and addressing traffic related problems. This study aims to use You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7), Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), the most optimized object-detection algorithm, to detect and identify traffic signs, and analyze effective combinations of adaptive optimizers like Adaptive Moment estimation (Adam), Root Mean Squared Propagation (RMSprop) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with the YOLOv7. Using a portion of German traffic signs for training, the study investigates the feasibility of adopting smaller datasets while maintaining high accuracy. The model proposed in this study not only improves traffic safety by detecting traffic signs but also has the potential to contribute to the rapid development of autonomous vehicle systems. The study results showed an impressive accuracy of 99.7% when using a batch size of 8 and the Adam optimizer. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model for the image classification task of traffic sign recognition.

AB Ensuring safety is crucial for the successful deployment of autonomous systems, such as self-driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots acting close to humans. While there exist many controllers that optimize certain criteria, such as energy consumption, comfort, or low wear, they are usually not able to guarantee safety at all times for constrained nonlinear systems affected by disturbances. Many controllers providing safety guarantees, however, have no optimal performance. The idea of this article is, therefore, to synthesize a formally correct controller that serves as a safety net for an unverified, optimal controller. This way, most of the time, the optimal controller is in charge and leads to a desired, optimal control performance. The safety controller constantly monitors the actions of the optimal controller and takes over if the system would become unsafe. The safety controller utilizes a novel concept of backward reachable set computation, where we avoid the need of computing underapproximations of reachable sets. We have further developed a new approach that analytically describes reachable sets, making it possible to efficiently maximize the size of the backward reachable set. We demonstrate our approach by a numerical example from autonomous driving.

AB Motivated by a changing acoustic environment in the Arctic Beaufort Sea, in this article, we present a tactical decision aid framework for a human decision-maker collaborating with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to integrate the vertical sound-speed profile for underwater navigation and communication. In a predeployment phase, using modeled and real oceanographic data, we load basis function representations of the sound-speed perturbations onto one or more AUVs on deck, where a handful of weights can estimate a sound-speed profile. During deployment, these weights are updated on an AUV through a digital acoustic message to improve navigation and reciprocal communication throughout the duration of an under-ice mission. Field work applying this framework in the Beaufort Sea is presented, highlighting key decisions regarding predeployment oceanographic data assimilation, CTD cast collection, and in situ weight choice. Selected examples evaluate the framework's ability to adapt to a depth-limited CTD cast and the appearance of an anomalous microlens feature in the profile. We show that the framework effectively balances the need to adapt in a changing acoustic environment in real time while maintaining operator trust in an AUV's embedded intelligence.

AB Scene understanding is a pivotal task for autonomous vehicles to safely navigate in the environment. Recent advances in deep learning enable accurate semantic reconstruction of the surroundings from LiDAR data. However, these models encounter a large domain gap while deploying them on vehicles equipped with different LiDAR setups which drastically decreases their performance. Fine-tuning the model for every new setup is infeasible due to the expensive and cumbersome process of recording and manually labeling new data. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques are thus essential to fill this domain gap and retain the performance of models on new sensor setups without the need for additional data labeling. In this paper, we propose AdaptLPS, a novel UDA approach for LiDAR panoptic segmentation that leverages task-specific knowledge and accounts for variation in the number of scan lines, mounting position, intensity distribution, and environmental conditions. We tackle the UDA task by employing two complementary domain adaptation strategies, data-based and model-based. While data-based adaptations reduce the domain gap by processing the raw LiDAR scans to resemble the scans in the target domain, model-based techniques guide the network in extracting features that are representative for both domains. Extensive evaluations on three pairs of real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that AdaptLPS outperforms existing UDA approaches by up to 6.41 pp in terms of the PQ score.

AB As a prototype of the underwater Internet of Things-enabled maritime transportation systems, multi-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)-based Underwater Wireless Networks (UWNs) have become an important research topic due to their distribution and robustness. In this paper, the concept of multi-AUV-based UWNs is first defined, where AUV is regarded as a network node, and communication among the AUVs is the potential network links. Then, to improve network scalability and controllability, a paradigm of Software Defined multi-AUV-based UWNs (SD-UWNs) is proposed, where the Software Defined Network (SDN) technique is used to upgrade the UWN architecture by directing intelligent network functions. Topology and artificial potential field theories are applied to construct a network control model for the SD-UWNs. Based on the efficient data sharing ability of the SD-UWNs, an early warning obstacle avoidance-enabled path planning scheme is proposed to guarantee safe sailing of the SD-UWNs, where comprehensive obstacle avoidance scenarios are taken into account. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in planning the cooperative operation for the SD-UWNs and is capable of performing accurate and reliable obstacle avoidance tasks.

AB The use of optical communications systems is prevalent in underwater robotics when short-range data transmission is required or preferred. This paper proposes a method of producing and testing an optical communications system for use in the assistance of optical docking for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). It describes how the SIMULINK modelling environment was used to program and simulate a model of a transmitter, which was then implemented on a microcontroller. The transmitter model implemented on hardware was then used to produce an optical signal, which was sampled, logged and used to design a receiver model in SIMULINK. For signalling purposes, the experiment used a light-emitting diode (LED) with a driver circuit and photodiode based receiver. This simulated approach using real world data enabled the analysis of the system at every point during the process, allowing for a hardware in the loop style approach to be used in the receiver model design. Consequently, the SIMULINK Coder was used to produce the receiver model's equivalent in C++ for later deployment. A benchmark was determined through experimentation to compare within future studies; the system was tested and found to operate effectively at distances between 1 m and 12 m in a controlled in air test environment.

DE Self-driving cars; Product liability directive; Technological
   Evolutions; Legal Issues
AB Self-driving cars are gradually being introduced in the United States and in several Member States of the European Union. Policymakers will thus have to make important choices regarding the application of the law. One important aspect relates to the question who should be held liable for the damage caused by such vehicles. Arguably, product liability schemes will gain importance considering that the driver's fault as a cause of damage will become less likely with the increase of autonomous systems. The application of existing product liability legislation, however, is not always straightforward. Without a proper and effective liability framework, other legal or policy initiatives concerning technical and safety matters related to self-driving cars might be in vain. The article illustrates this conclusion by analysing the limitation periods for filing a claim included in the European Union Product Liability Directive, which are inherently incompatible with the concept of autonomous vehicles. On a micro-level, we argue that every aspect of the Directive should be carefully considered in the light of the autonomisation of our society. On the macro-level, we believe that ongoing technological evolutions might be the perfect moment to bring the European Union closer to its citizens. (C) 2018 Jan De Bruyne and Jarich Werbrouck.

AB The advantage of self-relocation of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) can eliminate heavy searching-for-parking traffic in areas with limited parking availability. However, the floating trips will exacerbate local traffic congestion and parking competition if relocated CAVs are not well distributed in the network. To address these issues, this paper proposes a centralized dispatching-for-parking system to dynamically dispatch CAVs between different regions to optimize parking resource utilization and traffic distribution. A macroscopic modeling approach is presented with the consideration of mixed traffic flows of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs. The system dynamics are modeled with the representation of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) in a multiregion road network. The objective of the system is to minimize the total network delay, which is formulated by the framework of model predictive control (MPC). Results of the numerical experiments in a two-region network show that the approach improves the performance of system operation and alleviates traffic congestion and imbalance between parking supply and demand in downtown areas. The sensitivity analysis on the level of CAV penetration reveals that the total network delay gradually decreases with the penetration increase, and HDVs benefit more from the MPC controller. The study demonstrates the applicability and implication of the dispatching-for-parking system in an era of CAVs.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been a research focus in recent years. The path planner is a key element of the unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous control module. In this paper, the modified wolf pack search (WPS) algorithm is applied to compute the quasi-optimal trajectories for the rotor wing UAVs in the complex three-dimensional (3D) spaces including the real and fake 3D spaces. Moreover, it adopts the multi-objective cost function. In the path planning process, some concepts in the genetic algorithm (GA) are applied to realize the WPS algorithm. Then, the crossover and mutation operators in the GA method are introduced to improve the original WPS algorithm. Considering the dynamic properties of the vehicle, the path smoothing process based on the cubic B-spline curve is used to make the planning path suitable for the fixed wing UAVs. Simulation results show that this approach is efficient for the rotor wing UAVs and the fixed wing UAVs when taking into account of all kinds of constraints and the path generated is flyable. Moreover, the comparisons of the four algorithms show that the trajectories produced by the modified WPS algorithm are far superior to the original WPS algorithm, the GA and the random search way under the same conditions.

AB Trajectory prediction is a fundamental problem and challenge for autonomous vehicles. Early works mainly focused on designing complicated architectures for deep-learning-based prediction models in normal-illumination environments, which fail in dealing with low-light conditions. The paper proposes a novel approach for trajectory prediction in low-illumination scenarios by leveraging multi-stream information fusion, which integrates image, optical flow, and object trajectory information. This is achieved by applying Convolutional Neural Network-based (CNN) Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal information from the image channel, Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) to model relative motion between adjacent camera frames through the optical flow channel, and recognizing high-level interactions between vehicles in the trajectory channel. Further, to investigate the reliability of the model in low-illumination scenarios, epistemic uncertainty estimation is conducted by applying Monte Carlo Dropout. The proposed approach is validated on HEV-I and newly generated Dark-HEV-I datasets focusing on graph-based interaction understanding and low illumination conditions. The experimental results show improved performance compared to baselines in both standard and low-illumination scenarios. Importantly, our approach is generic and applicable to scenarios with different types of perception data. The source code is available at https://github.com/TommyGong08/MSIF.

AB Featuring agile controllability, high-level autonomy, and powerful field operational advantages, autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) are gaining increasing attention worldwide. Central to the control of ASVs, path planning is one of the key technologies that ensure the navigation safety. However, many of the previous works to solve the path planning problem are to find a collision-free and shortest path, but the solutions are not satisfied by the safety requirements and the non-holonomic constraints of ASVs. This paper expands on our previous work on the improved artificial fish algorithm (IAFSA) to address these challenges. The expanding technique is introduced to modify the grid cost, and a B-spline-based path smoother is applied to the algorithm to enhance its feasibility in cooperating with the ASV controller. Simulation experiments have been conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, the new algorithm is tested in the USV control system model in a practical environment. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed method is more efficient than the other state-of-the-art algorithms, and the simulation with the ASV model illustrated its excellent performance cooperating with the control system. Therefore, the proposed method can be considered as a reliable algorithm to solve the path planning problem of ASVs.

AB As an important tool for marine exploration, the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) must home in and dock at a docking station (DS) to be recharged, repaired, or to exchange information at set intervals. However, the complex and hostile underwater environment makes this process challenging. This study proposes a real-time method based on polarized optical guidance for determining the position and attitude of the AUV relative to its DS. Four polarized artificial underwater landmarks are positioned at the DS, which are recognized by the AUV vision system. Compared with light intensity, the polarization of a light beam is known to be better maintained at greater propagation distances, especially in underwater environments. The proposed method, which is inspired by the ability of marine animals to communicate, calculates the pose parameters in less than 10 ms without any other navigational information. The simulation results reveal that the angle errors are small and the position errors are no more than 0.116 m within 100 m in the coastal ocean. The results of underwater experiments further demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, which extends the operating distance of the AUV beyond what is currently possible while maintaining the precision of traditional optical guidance.

DE Highly-Automated Driving (HAD); Collision avoidance; Vibro-tactile cues
ID S-R COMPATIBILITY; VIBROTACTILE; TASKS
AB One of the most significant safety concerns regarding Highly-Automated Driving (HAD) is drivers' ability to regain control of the vehicle safely. Vibro-tactile alerts were already suggested as an effective modality for Take-Over Requests (TOR) in terms of reducing reaction times. However, it is not clear yet whether such alerts should be compatible or incompatible with the location of hazards that might be present when the TOR is initiated. Studies regarding tactile directionality in other domains, and in manual vehicles have found mixed results. It is argued that part of the contradictory evidence may be related to contextual differences between the driving domain and other domains. Thus, this study aimed to test which directional design would be preferable for TORs in time-critical situations. Twenty-seven participants drove a highly-automated vehicle on a highway with two lanes in each travel direction, in a driving simulator. Each participant experienced five TORs in which they were required to take control and divert their vehicle away from an impending hazard that shut down an entire lane and was situated four seconds ahead. The disengagement of the autonomous driver was signaled using a tactile alert. For the first group, the tactile alert was directed towards the hazard (incompatible with the required action), for the second, it was directed away from it (compatible with the required action), and for the control group, the alert was non-directional. Results showed that drivers using the compatible alert reacted faster and more accurately than those using the incompatible alert. Participants using the non-directional alert reacted slower and less accurately than participants in both directional groups. The results contradict previous findings in the manual driving domain, where drivers are faster and more accurate to respond when the alert is compatible with the location of the hazard and not with the direction of the required action. It is argued that these discrepancies stem from the modified HAD driving task demands where drivers are disengaged from the driving task for long periods and are less aware of the driving environment. The implications for the design of autonomous vehicles are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Localization for precision navigation in agricultural fields-Beyond crop
   row following
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID IMAGE-ANALYSIS
AB The growing world population calls for more efficient and sustainable farming technologies. Automating agricultural tasks has great potential to improve farming technologies. A key requirement for full automation is the ability of agricultural vehicles to accurately navigate entire fields without damaging value crops. One important precondition for autonomous navigation is localization, that is, the ability of a vehicle to accurately estimate its pose relative to the crops. A majority of localization approaches detect crop rows to track the heading and lateral offset of the vehicle. This is sufficient to guide the vehicle along crop rows while driving inside the field. However, switching between rows requires a longitudinal pose estimate to determine when to turn at the end of the field. Additionally, at the end of the field sensor data contains less crop row structure and more noise from wild growing vegetation. This can lead to false-positive crop row detections. In this paper, we present a localization approach that goes beyond state-of-the-art crop row following algorithms by providing robust pose estimates not only inside the field but also at the end of the field. The underlying concept of our approach is to estimate the vehicle pose relative to a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-referenced map of crop rows. This allows us to fuse crop row detections with GNSS signals to obtain a pose estimate with the accuracy comparable to a row following approach in the heading and lateral offset, while at the same time maintaining at least GNSS accuracy along the row. Employing a GNSS-referenced map of crop rows poses several challenges. To relate the detected crop rows to those in the map, we propose a data association strategy that finds correspondences between two sets of lines, that is, crop rows. Furthermore, we improve the GNSS-based longitudinal pose estimate by detecting the end of the field from vegetation data. Additionally, we introduce a novel method to determine false-positive crop row detections to increase the overall robustness in particular in challenging scenarios at the end of the field. Extensive real-world experiments on three different types of crops demonstrate that our localization approach is well suited for fully autonomous navigation in entire fields.

AB In this paper, we present a new seabed detection method based on the use of a single beam electro-acoustic transducer (echo sounder). This method uses both acoustic diffraction and bottom backscattering properties to determine the 2D or 3D equation for seabed slopes. It can thus be used for bottom tracking (e,g, for autonomous underwater vehicles). In comparison to existing sonar-based processes, our method offers the advantages of mono-beam transducers: low computational cost, lower power consumption and higher sampling rate.

AB The emerging connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology offers a significant opportunity to address the congestion problem caused by the selfish routing behavior of human drivers. If the transportation management center (TMC) can control the routing of all vehicles on the network, they could easily reverse this effect. However, during the transition period, CAVs will share roads with human-piloted vehicles (HVs). In the era of mixed autonomy, a more realistic scenario is to route the CAVs to lead the traffic state towards the desired equilibrium. We first consider a repeated routing game in which the TMC can control the routes of CAVs to minimize the system travel time, i.e., CAVs follow the system optimal (SO) routing principle. In this manner, we can influence the travel time traversing each link, which indirectly influences HV users' route choices. As a consequence, HV users may adjust their routes dynamically through day-to-day (DTD) learning to minimize individual travel cost. On the other hand, the SO routing strategy may induce higher travel time for CAVs than HVs within the same origin-destination (OD) pair. To address such inherent unfairness, road pricing is used to influence route choices of HVs to achieve specific supply regulation targets, e.g., traffic restraint. We present qualitative analysis on the stability of the controlled DTD dynamics and the effect of road pricing regarding the unfairness. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to design dynamic pricing schemes for a mixed autonomy system under DTD learning dynamics. We carry out numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control schemes. The cooperative CAVs could reduce the total travel time when the market penetration rate of CAVs reaches the lower minimum control ratio that the network could escape the user equilibrium (UE) condition. When the market penetration rate of CAVs reaches the upper minimum control ratio, the network would achieve SO condition even though there are non-cooperative HVs. On the other hand, the pricing scheme can reduce the unfairness index and total travel time of the network when the market penetration rate of CAVs is low.

AB There have been enormous efforts to implement automated vehicle-based mobility (AVM) by considering smart infrastructure such as cooperative intelligent transportation system. However, there is lack of consideration on economical approach for an optimal deployment strategy of the AVM service and smart infrastructure. Furthermore, the influence of travel demand in service area has been ignored. We develop a new framework for maximizing the profit of connected and automated vehicle-based mobility (CAV-M) service using cost modeling and metaheuristic optimization algorithm. The proposed framework extracts an optimal sub-network, which is selected by a set of optimal links in the service area, and identifies an optimal construction strategy for the smart infrastructure depending on given operational design domain and travel demand. Based on service network analyses with varying demand patterns and volumes, we observe that the optimal sub-network varies with the combination of trip demand patterns and volumes. It is also found that the benefit of deploying the smart infrastructure is obtainable only when there are sufficient travel demands. Furthermore, the optimal sub-network is always superior to raw network in terms of economical profit, which suggests the proposed framework has great potential to prioritize road links in the target area for the CAV-M service.

AB Multi-modal sensor fusion has become ubiquitous in the field of vehicle motion estimation. Achieving a consistent sensor fusion in such a set-up demands the precise knowledge of the misalignments between the coordinate systems in which the different information sources are expressed. In ego-motion estimation, even sub-degree misalignment errors lead to serious performance degradation. The present work addresses the extrinsic calibration of a land vehicle equipped with standard production car sensors and an automotive-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU). Specifically, the article presents a method for the estimation of the misalignment between the IMU and vehicle coordinate systems, while considering the IMU biases. The estimation problem is treated as a joint state and parameter estimation problem, and solved using an adaptive estimator that relies on the IMU measurements, a dynamic single-track model as well as the suspension and odometry systems. Additionally, we show that the validity of the misalignment estimates can be assessed by identifying the misalignment between a high-precision INS/GNSS and the IMU and vehicle coordinate systems. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration procedure is demonstrated using real sensor data. The results show that estimation accuracies below 0.1 degrees can be achieved in spite of moderate variations in the manoeuvre execution.

AB The piezoelectric fast steering platform (PFSP) enhances the scanning capabilities of lidar systems for autonomous vehicles. However, hysteresis nonlinearity degrades the scanning accuracy of the PFSP. To meet this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach for hysteresis modeling and compensation using multiple nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA)-L2 models. First, the hysteresis model is partitioned into a collection of submodels based on the K-means methodology, where the feature vector stems from the classical Bouc-Wen (CBW) model. Each submodel describes the dynamics of a specific hysteresis segment by a single NARMA-L2 model. The composite neural network (CNN), formed by combining two multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks, is trained to estimate the hysteresis output of the single NARMA-L2 model. Compared to the submodels obtained by evenly partitioning according to the input range, the submodels obtained by K-means partitioning offer higher hysteresis modeling accuracy. To compensate for the hysteresis nonlinearity, a novel adaptive Multi-NARMA-L2 (AMNL2) controller is then designed by online adjusting the parameters of the CNN. Furthermore, an adaptive filter is proposed to alleviate the oscillation caused by high-frequency disturbances during switching. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the AMNL2 controller outperforms the traditional MNL2 controller and the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.

AB The tradeoff between speed and accuracy is important in semantic segmentation problems, especially for resource-constrained platforms, such as intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a well-deployed real-time semantic segmentation architecture named MLFNet. Specifically, we first build a lightweight backbone (SEFE) with a larger receptive field and multi-scale contextual representation performance to encode the pixel-level features. For better preserving target boundaries and contours, a spatial compensation branch (SPFE) is designed to gradually reduce the dimension of feature maps and refine the low-level specifics. In the decoding phase, we introduce a well-designed multi-branch fusion extractor (MBFD) for integrating the spatial details into high-level layers. Finally, the outputs from the semantic and spatial branches are fused to predict the final segmentation results. Extensive offline and online experiments have shown that our model has a superior speed and accuracy trade-off. On the Cityscapes test dataset, our model (MLFNet-Res18) achieves 71.0% mIoU with 95.1 FPS for 512 x 1024 inputs, and 72.1% mIoU with 72.2 FPS while inferring on MLFNet-Res34 model. Meanwhile, MLFNet-Res18 can reach 24.5 FPS when deployed to NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and 64.0 FPS with an experimental vehicle.

AB Recent deep learning frameworks draw strong research interest in application of ego-motion estimation as they demonstrate a superior result compared to geometric approaches. However, due to the lack of multimodal datasets, most of these studies primarily focused on single-sensor-based estimation. To overcome this challenge, we collect a unique multimodal dataset named LboroAV2 using multiple sensors, including camera, light detecting and ranging (LiDAR), ultrasound, e-compass and rotary encoder. We also propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture for fusion of RGB images and LiDAR laser scan data for odometry application. The proposed method contains a convolutional encoder, a compressed representation and a recurrent neural network. Besides feature extraction and outlier rejection, the convolutional encoder produces a compressed representation, which is used to visualise the network's learning process and to pass useful sequential information. The recurrent neural network uses this compressed sequential data to learn the relationship between consecutive time steps. We use the Loughborough autonomous vehicle (LboroAV2) and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Institute (KITTI) Visual Odometry (VO) datasets to experiment and evaluate our results. In addition to visualising the network's learning process, our approach provides superior results compared to other similar methods. The code for the proposed architecture is released in GitHub and accessible publicly.

AB The high redundant brake-by-wire system reveals vehicular safety handling ability and rarely emerges in the automotive area at the present time. This paper presents a novel brake-by-wire system, DREHB (Double Redundant Electro-Hydraulic Brake), with extensible fail-safe operations for high-automation autonomous driving vehicles. The DREHB is designed as a decoupled-architecture system containing three-layer cascaded modules, including a hydraulic power provider, a hydraulic flow switcher, and a hydraulic pressure modulator, and each of the modules can share dual redundancy. The operating principles of the DREHB in normal and degraded initiative braking modes are introduced, especially for the consideration of fail-safe and fail-operational functions. The matching and optimization of selected key parameters of the electric boost master cylinder and the linear solenoid valve were conducted using computer-aided batched simulations with a DREHB system modeled in MATLAB/Simulink and AMESim. The prototype of the DREHB was tested in hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The test results of typical braking scenarios verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the DREHB system, and the hydraulic pressure response as 28.0 MPa/s and tracking error within 0.15 MPa and the desirable fail-safe braking ability fully meets the requirements of higher braking safety and efficiency.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly being used within safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs). It is important to validate both the timing and functional correctness of these systems. However, most approaches in the literature consider guaranteeing only the functionality of the ANN-based controllers. This issue stems largely from the implementation strategies used within common neural network frameworks-their underlying source code is often simply unsuitable for formal techniques such as static timing analysis. As a result, developers of safety-critical CPS must rely on informal techniques, such as measurement-based approaches, to prove correctness, techniques that provide weak guarantees at best. In this letter, we address this challenge. We propose a design pipeline whereby neural networks trained using the popular deep learning framework Keras are compiled to functionally equivalent C code. This C code is restricted to simple constructs that may be analyzed by the existing static timing analysis tools. As a result, if compiled to a suitable time-predictable platform, all execution bounds may be statically derived. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we execute an ANN trained to drive an autonomous vehicle around a race track. We compile the ANN to the Patmos time-predictable controller and show that we can derive the worst-case execution timings.

AB When autonomous robots begin to share the human living and working spaces, safety becomes paramount. It is legally required that the safety of such systems is ensured, e.g. by certification according to relevant standards such as IEC 61508. However, such safety considerations are usually not addressed in academic robotics. In this paper we report on one such successful endeavor, which is concerned with designing, implementing, and certifying a collision avoidance safety function for autonomous vehicles and static obstacles. The safety function calculates a safety zone for the vehicle, depending on its current motion, which is as large as required but as small as feasible, thus ensuring safety against collision with static obstacles. We outline the algorithm which was specifically designed with safety in mind, and present our verification methodology which is based on formal proof and verification using the theorem prover Isabelle. The implementation and our methodology have been certified for use in applications up to SIL 3 of IEC 61508 by a certification authority (TV Sud Rail GmbH, Germany). Throughout, issues we recognized as being important for a successful application of formal methods in robotics are highlighted. Moreover, we argue that formal analysis deepens the understanding of the algorithm, and hence is valuable even outside the safety context.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)-assisted mobile data collection in underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) has received significant attention because of their mobility and flexibility. To satisfy the increasing demand of diverse application requirements for underwater data collection, such as time-sensitive data freshness, emergency event security as well as energy efficiency, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal AUV-assisted data collection scheme which integrates both acoustic and optical technologies and takes advantage of their complementary strengths in terms of communication distance and data rate. In this scheme, we consider the age of information (AoI) of the data packet, node transmission energy as well as energy consumption of the AUV movement, and we make a trade-off between them to retrieve data in a timely and reliable manner. To optimize these, we leverage a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to find the optimal motion trajectory of AUV by selecting the suitable communication options. In addition to that, we also design an optimal angle steering algorithm for AUV navigation under different communication scenarios to reduce energy consumption further. We conduct extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and the results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the weighted sum of AoI as well as energy consumption.

AB An accurate mathematical model is a basis for controlling and estimating the state of an Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system, so how to improve its accuracy is a fundamental problem in the field of automatic control. However, AUV systems are complex, uncertain, and highly non-linear, and it is not easy to obtain through traditional modeling methods. We fit an accurate dynamic AUV model in this study using the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network approach. As hyper-parameter values have a significant impact on LSTM performance, it is important to select the optimal combination of hyper-parameters. The present research uses the improved Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve this aim by improving its recognition accuracy on the verification dataset. To improve the efficiency of action exploration, we improve the Q-learning algorithm and choose the optimal initial state according to the Q table in each round of learning. It can effectively avoid the ineffective exploration of the reinforcement learning agent between the poor-performing hyperparameter combinations. Finally, the experiments based on simulated or actual trial data demonstrate that the proposed model identification method can effectively predict kinematic motion data, and more importantly, the modified Q-Learning approach can optimize the network hyperparameters in the LSTM.

TI Fast Ground Segmentation for 3D LiDAR Point Cloud Based on
   Jump-Convolution-Process
SO REMOTE SENSING
LA English

DE autonomous vehicles; LiDAR; ground segmentation; convolution; real-time
AB LiDAR occupies a vital position in self-driving as the advanced detection technology enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to obtain much environmental information. Ground segmentation for LiDAR point cloud is a crucial procedure to ensure AVs' driving safety. However, some current algorithms suffer from embarrassments such as unavailability on complex terrains, excessive time and memory usage, and additional pre-training requirements. The Jump-Convolution-Process (JCP) is proposed to solve these issues. JCP converts the segmentation problem of the 3D point cloud into the smoothing problem of the 2D image and takes little time to improve the segmentation effect significantly. First, the point cloud marked by an improved local feature extraction algorithm is projected onto an RGB image. Then, the pixel value is initialized with the points' label and continuously updated according to image convolution. Finally, a jump operation is introduced in the convolution process to perform calculations only on the low-confidence points filtered by the credibility propagation algorithm, reducing the time cost. Experiments on three datasets show that our approach has a better segmentation accuracy and terrain adaptability than those of the three existing methods. Meanwhile, the average time for the proposed method to deal with one scan data of 64-beam and 128-beam LiDAR is only 8.61 ms and 15.62 ms, which fully meets the AVs' requirement for real-time performance.

AB On-demand mobility services - autonomous as well as human-driven - promise to transform transportation and urban living. Yet, designing such services involves an array of challenges: from demand data acquisition and processing, to building a versatile simulation framework, to finally evaluating a variety of service configurations and making recommendations. This article illustrates the process of designing and analyzing various types of on-demand mobility services using the City of Chicago, Illinois, as a test case. We start by surveying and categorizing a large number of articles on simulation-based design of on-demand mobility services. This is followed by an extensive experimental study, which analyzes how different service designs perform under real transportation demand patterns in terms of key performance indicators such as demand acceptance rate, excess ride time, deviation from the desired pickup time, vehicle occupancy, and various fleet efficiency metrics. This type of analysis helps mobility service providers and public transit authorities gain insights into the interplay of the different passenger-and fleet-related key performance indicators. Finally, we introduce the fundamental ridesharing diagram, which quantifies the relationship between passenger convenience and fleet efficiency, and helps identify socially optimal service designs.

AB The high-definition map (HD-map) of road structures is crucial for the safe planning and control of autonomous vehicles. However, generating and updating such maps requires intensive manual work. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is able to automatically build and update a map of the environment. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of SLAM method for generating vector-based road structure maps. In this paper, we propose a vector-based SLAM method for the road structure mapping using vehicle-mounted multibeam LiDAR. We propose using polylines as the primary mapping element instead of grid maps or point clouds because the vector-based representation is lightweight and precise. We explored the following: (1) the extraction and vectorization of road structures based on multiframe probabilistic fusion; (2) the efficient vector-based matching between frames of road structures; (3) the loop closure and optimization based on the pose-graph; and (4) the global reconstruction of the vector map. One specific road structure, the road boundary, is taken as an example. We applied the proposed mapping method to three road scenes, ranging from hundreds of meters to over ten kilometers and the results are automatically generated vector-based road boundary maps. The average absolute pose error of the trajectory in the mapping is 1.83 m without the aid of high-precision GPS.

AB Global positioning system signal does not penetrate into the water volume, and autonomous underwater vehicle have to use the inertial navigation system that will cause an inevitable cumulative error. Terrain reference position can zero out the inertial navigation system error and have been widely used. To improve the positioning accuracy, the planning path of the underwater robot is required to pass through the suitable matching areas in the path planning stage. So, a gridding map is needed to quantify the suitability of the terrain and to partition the suitable matching area and the unsuitable matching area optimally. In this article, we will focus on the quantitative method of terrain suitability and the grid parameter solution method for optimal partition of suitable matching area. Finally, the validity of the algorithm is obtained using the ship borne data. The results show that in the low suitability blocks, the influence of measurement error on terrain reference position accuracy is higher than that in high suitability blocks. And the average of terrain reference position deviation obtained of the path passed through the high suitability area is 53.3% which is lower than that of the path passed through the low suitability area, and the standard deviation of the position deviation is reduced by 21.15%.

AB Here we consider the problem of a robot that must follow a previously designated path outdoors. While the nominal path, a series of closely spaced via points, is provided with an assurance that it will lead to the destination, we can't be guaranteed that it will be obstacle free. We present an efficient system capable of both following the path as well as being perceptive and agile enough to avoid obstacles in its way. We present a system that detects obstacles using laser ranging, as well as a layered system that continuously tracks the path, avoiding obstacles and replanning the route when necessary. The distinction of this system is that compared to the state of the art, it is minimal in sensing and computation while achieving high speeds. In this paper, we present an algorithm that is based on models of obstacle avoidance by humans and show variations of the model to deal with practical considerations. We show how the parameters of this model are automatically learned from observation of human operation and discuss limitations of the model. We then show how these models can be extended by adding online route planning and a formulation that allows for operation at varying speeds. We present experimental results from an autonomous vehicle that has operated several hundred kilometers to validate the methodology.

AB The study investigates underwater multi-target tracking (MTT) in a multistatic system using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as receivers separately from transmitters. The most critical aspect of MTT is the accurate extraction of target tracks from the collected measurements, which can be affected by clutter, missed detections, and port-starboard ambiguities. Moreover, the detection parameters-the target-detection probability and clutter rate-used in MTT methods are typically unknown and change with varying environmental conditions and geometric distributions of the AUV, target, and sound transmitter. In view of these challenges, we propose a robust multi-sensor Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture (R-MS-PMBM) filter immune to unknown detection parameters that treats clutter rates and detection probabilities as continuous random variables modeled by beta and gamma distributions, respectively. The R-MS-PMBM filter is a conjugate prior, and its closed form is derived. We introduce a measurement-driven adaptive birth model to initiate target tracks quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, a suboptimal Gibbs sampler is used to reduce the computational complexity of its practical implementation. The simulation results show that the proposed filter is resilient to unknown detection parameters and can effectively perform in challenging underwater scenarios.

To fulfill the real-time requirements in real-world applications, it is necessary to efficiently segment the LiDAR scans. Most of previous approaches directly project 3D point cloud onto the 2D spherical range image so that they can make use of the efficient 2D convolutional operations for image segmentation. Although having achieved the encouraging results, the neighborhood information is not well-preserved in the spherical projection. Moreover, the temporal information is not taken into consideration in the single scan segmentation task. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel approach to semantic segmentation for LiDAR sequences named Meta-RangeSeg, where a new range residual image representation is introduced to capture the spatial-temporal information. Specifically, Meta-Kernel is employed to extract the meta features, which reduces the inconsistency between the 2D range image coordinates input and 3D Cartesian coordinates output. An efficient U-Net backbone is used to obtain the multi-scale features. Furthermore, Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) strengthens the role of range channel and aggregates features at different levels. We have conducted extensive experiments for performance evaluation on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS. The promising results show that our proposed Meta-RangeSeg method is more efficient and effective than the existing approaches.

AB An increasing number of municipalities are striving for energy autonomy. This study determines in which municipalities and at what additional cost energy autonomy is feasible for a case study of Germany. An existing municipal energy system optimization model is extended to include the industrial, commercial and personal transport sectors. Multiple regression methods are benchmarked in order to identify the model best suited for the transfer of individual optimization results to a large proportion of German municipalities. The resulting levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from the optimization of representative case study municipalities are transferred using energy-relevant indicators. The study demonstrates that energy autonomy is technically feasible in 6,314 (56%) municipalities. Thereby, the LCOEs increase in the autonomous case on average by 0.41 euro/kWh compared to the minimum cost scenario. Apart from energy demand, base-load-capable bioenergy and deep geothermal energy have the greatest influence on the LCOEs. Overall, it appears that municipal energy autonomy is not economically viable under current framework conditions. This study represents a starting point for defining possible scenarios in studies of future national energy system or transmission grid expansion planning, which for the first time consider completely energy autonomous municipalities.

AB The path planning and following control problems of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in three-dimension (3D) are studied in this paper. In order to realize obstacle avoidance and path optimization, a path planning method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and cubic spline interpolation is developed. The curvature of the path obtained by this method is continuous, which can not only avoid obstacles but also meet the constraint of AUV's minimum radius of rotation. In the design of kinematics controller, an optimal guidance scheme based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed, which takes into account the wave disturbances. Adaptive dynamical sliding mode control (ADSMC) technology is used to design dynamic controller, which can effectively overcome the influence of model uncertainties. In order to ensure the stability of the system, the stability condition of MPC is designed, and the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed by applying cascade system theory. The control strategy proposed in this paper is compared with the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance through simulation experiment. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can not only improve the quality of path following, but also reduce the disturbance of waves, and thus is more conducive to energy saving.

AB As a typical navigation system, the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) is crucial for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) since the SINS accuracy determines the performance of AUVs. Initial alignment is one of the key technologies in SINS, and initial alignment time and initial alignment accuracy affect the performance of SINS directly. As actual systems are nonlinear, the nonlinear filter is widely used to improve the accuracy of the initial alignment. Due to its higher precision and lower computational load, the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) has done well in state estimation. However, the noise characteristics need to be known exactly as prior knowledge, which is difficult or even impossible to achieve. Thus, the adaptive filter should be introduced in the initial alignment algorithm to suppress the uncertainty effect caused by the unknown system noise. Therefore, taking the nonlinearity and uncertainty into account, a novel initial alignment algorithm for AUVs is proposed in this manuscript, based on CKF and the adaptive variance components estimation (VCE) filter (VCKF). Additionally, the simulation and experiment results show that not only the accuracy, but also the convergence speed can be improved with this proposed method. The validity and superiority of this novel adaptive initial alignment algorithm based on VCKF are verified.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; DESIGN
AB Water hydraulic variable ballast system (WHVBS) is a competitive mechanism to realize the hovering system which is one of the most popular ways to expand the maneuvering capability of AUVs. However, the WHVBSs equipped in AUVs almost were on-off type without controlling the flow rate of the in/out ballast water, which limits the hovering performance of the AUVs operated in complex underwater environment. In this paper, three novel types of WHVBS, which supports one or two low cost means to control the flow rate of ballast water, have been proposed to improve the performance of an AUV hovering system. A torpedo-like AUV equipped with WHVBS was used as a simulation platform to verify the effectiveness of the proposed WHVBSs. Numerical simulation results support the idea that compared with the commonly used on-off type WHVBS, the WHVBSs introduced flow rate control can significantly improve the hovering performance of the AUV, especially in the situations with unfavorable sea wave disturbances. Additionally, the statistics on water usage of different WHVBSs in numerical simulation indicated that the novel WHVBSs have the potential to extend the mission duration of AUV.

AB The problem of simultaneous fault detection and consensus control (SFDCC) of linear continuous-time multi-agent systems is addressed in this paper. A mixed H-infinity/H- formulation of the SFDCC problem is presented and distributed detection filters are designed using only relative output information among the agents. With our proposed methodology, all agents reach either a state consensus or a model reference consensus while simultaneously collaborate with one another to detect the occurrence of faults in the team. Indeed, each agent not only can detect its own fault but also is capable of detecting its neighbor's faults. It is shown that through a decomposition approach the computational complexity of solving the distributed problem is significantly reduced as compared to an optimal centralized solution. The extended linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are used to reduce the conservativeness of the SFDCC results by introducing additional matrix variables to eliminate the couplings of Lyapunov matrices with the system matrices. It is shown that under a special condition on the network topology the faulty agent can be isolated in the team. Simulation results corresponding to a team of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (AUVs) demonstrate and illustrate the effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed design methodology.

AB Helicopters have generated considerable interest in both the control community due to their complex dynamics, and in military community because of their advantages over regular aerial vehicles. In this paper, we present the modeling and control of a four rotor vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned air vehicle known as quadrotor aircraft. This model has been generated using Newton-Euler equations. In order to control the helicopter, classical PD (proportional derivative) and Hybrid Fuzzy PD controllers have been designed. Although fuzzy control of various dynamical systems has been presented in literature, application of this technology to quadrotor helicopter control is quite new. A quadrotor helicopter has nonlinear characteristics where classical control methods are not adequate especially when there are time delays, disturbances and nonlinear vehicle dynamics. On the other hand, Fuzzy control is nonlinear and it is thus suitable for nonlinear system control. Matlab Simulink has been used to test, analyze and compare the performance of the controllers in simulations. For the evaluation of the autonomous flight controllers, some experiments were also performed. For this purpose, an experimental test stand has been designed and manufactured. This study showed that although, both of the classical PD and the Fuzzy PD controllers can control the system properly, the Fuzzy PD controllers performed slightly better than the classical PD controllers, and have benefits such as better disturbance rejection, ease of building the controllers.

AB Improving the performance of autonomous vehicles in adverse weather conditions is vital for the commercialization of such automated systems. Existing synthetic datasets for developing rain-tolerant vision are of limited value. To address this deficiency, a closed environment capable of simulating different degrees of rainfall is constructed. And a new Closed Field Rain dataset is collected in 36 testing cycles. Inspired by the idea that human can infer the content of rainy images directly without removing the raindrops. A new single-image deraining method is proposed, that does not require ground truth images. This method incorporates an image content estimation module applied to predict the scene content representation, and a pixel-wise content attention block used to evaluate the significance of each pixel. After that, an encoder-decoder network is applied to complete the image. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to obtain the ground truth of rainy images because of the dynamic characteristics of real traffic environment. Thus, the model is trained by employing PatchGAN, using a patch-based loss. Using common no-reference and feature point metrics as performance indicators, this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets including Closed Field Rain dataset. Results show the effectiveness of our model quantitatively and qualitatively.

AB Regular inspection and monitoring of buildings and infrastructure, that is collectively called the built environment in this paper, is critical. The built environment includes commercial and residential buildings, roads, bridges, tunnels, and pipelines. Automation and robotics can aid in reducing errors and increasing the efficiency of inspection tasks. As a result, robotic inspection and monitoring of the built environment has become a significant research topic in recent years. This review paper presents an in-depth qualitative content analysis of 269 papers on the use of robots for the inspection and monitoring of buildings and infrastructure. The review found nine different types of robotic systems, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being the most common, followed by unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The study also found five different applications of robots in inspection and monitoring, namely, maintenance inspection, construction quality inspection, construction progress monitoring, as-built modeling, and safety inspection. Common research areas investigated by researchers include autonomous navigation, knowledge extraction, motion control systems, sensing, multi-robot collaboration, safety implications, and data transmission. The findings of this study provide insight into the recent research and developments in the field of robotic inspection and monitoring of the built environment and will benefit researchers, and construction and facility managers, in developing and implementing new robotic solutions.

ID PERFORMANCE; TIME
AB Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated fishing is a major threat to human food supply and marine ecosystem health. Not only is it a cause of significant economic loss but also its effects have serious long-term environmental implications, such as overfishing and ocean pollution. The beginning of the fight against this problem dates since the early 2000s. From that time, a number of approaches and methods have been developed and reported. A key role in this topic is played by machine learning algorithms which exploit data provided by classical and high-tech sensors, devices and systems such as for example: CCTV, on-board cameras placed on autonomous vehicles, Global Positioning Systems, radars, Automatic Identification Systems, Vessel Monitoring Systems, or Coastal Surveillance Systems. The main objective of this paper is to provide the reader with knowledge about the scale of this phenomenon, methods to tackle the issue, and the current state of research on the subject. This has been achieved through a review of existing approaches that deal with these harmful phenomena by using dedicated artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, as well as the accompanying equipment and devices. In addition, flaws and gaps in current methods, and future directions are disscussed.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), possessing the characteristics of a sensor and a sensing function, are in great demand in emergency rescue, agricultural plant protection, police and law enforcement, geological exploration, environmental monitoring, film and television entertainment, and other industries. However, the UAV industry is faced with various bottlenecks, such as the low intelligence level of UAVs, the high technical threshold for completing complex tasks, the lack of autonomous cooperative ability between the formation of UAVs, and the lack of an intelligent operating system. To achieve the route planning and monitoring design of UAVs, we first designed a remote intelligent monitoring system for a UAV based on multimode communication and cloud computing, which consisted of an intelligent control module, a coordination module for the multimode communication and autonomous formation of UAVs, a UAV cloud operating system, and panoramic image dynamic fusion technology. Then, we presented an adaptive data transmission method based on priority in the multimode communication system. Finally, a route planning and monitoring design based on a global particle algorithm was designed for the remote intelligent monitoring system of the UAV. The simulation results show that the remote security system operates normally and meets urgent communication needs. At the same time, both data and video image transmission can be achieved, and the route of the UAV can be effectively planned.

DT Article
DE Collision avoidance; deep learning in robotics and automation
ID TRACKING CONTROL; QUADROTORS
AB Unlike autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a higher dimensional configuration space, which makes the motion planning of multi-UAVs a challenging task. In addition, uncertainties and noises are more significant in UAV scenarios, which increases the difficulty of autonomous navigation for multi-UAV. In this letter, we proposed a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) based multi-UAV collision avoidance approach without explicitly modeling the uncertainty and noise in the environment. Our goal is to train a policy to plan a collision-free trajectory by leveraging local noisy observations. However, the reinforcement learned collision avoidance policies usually suffer from high variance and low reproducibility, because unlike supervised learning, RL does not have a fixed training set with ground-truth labels. To address these issues, we introduced a two-stage training method for RL based collision avoidance. For the first stage, we optimize the policy using a supervised training method with a loss function that encourages the agent to follow the well-known reciprocal collision avoidance strategy. For the second stage, we use policy gradient to refine the policy. We validate our policy in a variety of simulated scenarios, and the extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that our policy can generate time-efficient and collision-free paths under imperfect sensing, and can well handle noisy local observations with unknown noise levels.

AB Real-time path planning for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a very difficult and challenging task. Bioinspired neural network (BINN) has been used to deal with this problem for its many distinct advantages: that is, no learning process is needed and realization is also easy. However, there are some shortcomings when BINN is applied to AUV path planning in a three-dimensional (3D) unknown environment, including complex computing problem when the environment is very large and repeated path problem when the size of obstacles is bigger than the detection range of sensors. To deal with these problems, an improved dynamic BINN is proposed in this paper. In this proposed method, the AUV is regarded as the core of the BINN and the size of the BINN is based on the detection range of sensors. Then the BINN will move with the AUV and the computing could be reduced. A virtual target is proposed in the path planning method to ensure that the AUV can move to the real target effectively and avoid big-size obstacles automatically. Furthermore, a target attractor concept is introduced to improve the computing efficiency of neural activities. Finally, some experiments are conducted under various 3D underwater environments. The experimental results show that the proposed BINN based method can deal with the real-time path planning problem for AUV efficiently.

DE Seafloor deposit; Hybrid gravity survey; Gravity gradiometer; Forced

AB Gravity surveys are used to detect underground density structures. Hybrid survey configurations using a gravimeter and a gravity gradiometer are particularly effective in this regard. A gravity gradiometer was developed for use in hybrid gravity surveys of massive subseafloor deposits. Its performance was evaluated in an ocean-based trial using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The gradiometer consisted of two identical vertical long-period pendulums, acting as gravity sensors, with a separation of 0.44 m. The self-noise of the gradiometer was estimated to be 6 E (6 x 10(-9)/s(2)) at 2-50 mHz, with which the gravity gradient signal could be detected when the AUV was above a typical ore deposit. The gravity gradiometer was mounted on a forced gimbal vertically controlled by fiber optic gyroscopes and tiltmeters. The ocean-based trial observation performed at a depth of approximately 1300 m in Sagami Bay using the AUV Urashima (JAMSTEC) showed that the system operated steadily on a moving platform except during periods of extreme motion, such as turning and pitching. The resulting gravity gradient was highly affected by the motion of the platform and the estimated resolution was 3 x 102 E, which was mainly limited by the noise of the recording system.

DT Review
ID ENVIRONMENT; SLAM
AB This paper addresses the problem of implementing a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm combined with a non-reactive controller (such as trajectory following or path following). A general study showing the advantages of using predictors to avoid mapping inconsistences in autonomous SLAM architectures is presented. In addition, this paper presents a priority-based uncertainty map construction method of the environment by a mobile robot when executing a SLAM algorithm. The SLAM algorithm is implemented with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and extracts corners (convex and concave) and lines (associated with walls) from the surrounding environment. A navigation approach directs the robot motion to the regions of the environment with the higher uncertainty and the higher priority. The uncertainty of a region is specified by a probability characterization computed at the corresponding representative points. These points are obtained by a Monte Carlo experiment and their probability is estimated by the sum of Gaussians method, avoiding the time-consuming map-gridding procedure. The priority is determined by the frame in which the uncertainty region was detected (either local or global to the vehicle's pose). The mobile robot has a non-reactive trajectory following controller implemented on it to drive the vehicle to the uncertainty points. SLAM real-time experiments in real environment, navigation examples, uncertainty maps constructions along with algorithm strategies and architectures are also included in this work.

AB Pine Island Glacier (PIG), West Antarctica, has been experiencing acceleration in its flow speed and mass loss for nearly two decades, driven in part by an increase in the delivery of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). However, at present, the configuration of the sub-ice-shelf cavity and bed conditions beneath the PIG ice shelf that dictate such oceanic influences remain poorly understood. Here, we use aerogravity data and ocean bottom depths measured by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to model the bathymetry and sediment layer thickness beneath the PIG ice shelf. Results reveal that the deep basins, previously found by AUV on both landward and seaward sides of a submarine ridge, extend substantially to the north and south. The water column thickness of the basins reaches 400-550 m on the landward side of the ridge and 500-600 m on the seaward side. The sediment layer covers the whole expanse of the seabed beneath the ice shelf, and the thickness is in the range similar to 200-1000 m. The thinnest sediments (<200 m) are found on the seaward slope of the submarine ridge, suggesting that erosion by advancing ice may have been concentrated in the lee of the topographic high.

AB An articulated intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (AIAUV) is a slender, multi-articulated underwater robot. Accurate trajectory tracking is essential for AIAUV operations. Furthermore, due to hydrodynamic and hydrostatic parameter uncertainties, uncertain thruster characteristics, unknown disturbances, and unmodelled dynamic effects, robustness is crucial. In this paper, we present a super-twisting algorithm (STA) with adaptive gains and a generalized super-twisting algorithm (GSTA) for trajectory tracking of the position and orientation of AIAUVs. A higher-order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) for estimating the linear and angular velocities when velocity measurements are unavailable is also presented. The tracking errors for the resulting system are proven to converge asymptotically to zero. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the presented control laws with comprehensive simulation and experimental results and perform a comparison study, with two tests (C-shape and C-shape with a moving head), between the two algorithms and also a benchmark PID controller. The STA with adaptive gains exhibits the best overall tracking performance, with average position root mean square error (RMSE) 0.0121 m and average orientation RMSE 0.0335 rad. The GSTA also presented good results with average position RMSE 0.0267 m and average orientation RMSE 0.0292 rad. The PID controller gave average position RMSE 0.0371 m and average orientation RMSE 0.0491 rad.

AB This paper studies the problem of spectrum shortage in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network during critical missions such as wildfire monitoring, search and rescue, and disaster monitoring. Such applications involve a high demand for high-throughput data transmissions such as real-time video-, image-, and voice- streaming where the assigned spectrum to the UAV network may not be adequate to provide the desired Quality of Service (QoS). In these scenarios, the aerial network can borrow an additional spectrum from the available terrestrial networks in trade of a relaying service for them. We propose a spectrum sharing model in which the UAVs are grouped into two classes of relaying UAVs that service the spectrum owner and the sensing UAVs that perform the disaster relief mission using the obtained spectrum. The operation of the UAV network is managed by a hierarchical mechanism in which a central controller assigns the tasks of the UAVs based on their resources and determine their operation region based on the level of priority of impacted areas and then the UAVs autonomously fine-tune their position using a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the individual throughput and prolong their lifetime. We analyze the performance and the convergence for the proposed method analytically and with extensive simulations in different scenarios.

AB During the flapping motion of a fish's tail, the caudal fin exhibits antero-posterior bending and dorso-ventral bending, the latter of which is referred to as chord-wise bending herein. The impact of chord-wise tip curvature on the hydrodynamic forces for flapping plates is investigated to explore potential mechanisms to improve the maneuverability or the performance of autonomous underwater vehicles. First, actuated chord-wise tip curvature is explored. Comparison of rigid curved geometries to a rigid flat plate as a baseline suggests that an increased curvature decreases the generated forces. An actuated plate with a dynamic tip curvature is created to illustrate a modulation of this decrease in forces. Second, the impact of curvature is isolated using curved plates with an identical planform area. Comparison of rigid curved geometries as a baseline corroborates the result that an increased curvature decreases the generated forces, with the exception that presenting a concave geometry into the flow increases the thrust and the efficiency. A passively-actuated plate is designed to capitalize on this effect by presenting a concave geometry into the flow throughout the cycle. The dynamically and passively actuated plates show potential to improve the maneuverability and the efficiency of autonomous underwater vehicles, respectively.

ID POWER TRANSFER SYSTEM; UNDERWATER; DESIGN
AB The wireless charging system (WCS) is widely employed to solve the problem of underwater charging of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, the AUV is prone to misalignment caused by the tidal currents, which directly leads to fluctuations in transmission efficiency and output power. For this reason, a circular-arc-type (CA-type) magnetic coupler with strong misalignment tolerance was proposed in this article. Compared with the ring-type magnetic coupler, the proposed magnetic coupler had better magnetic field convergence and lower weight. Further, the effect of dimensional parameters on the CA-type magnetic coupler performance was analyzed by ANSYS Maxwell, with which the parameters of the magnetic coupler were optimized, and its coupling coefficient could finally reach 0.671. To analyze the influence of misalignment on the CA-type magnetic coupler, EE-type and UI-type magnetic cores are compared. Within the same range of rotation misalignment [-10 degrees, 10 degrees] and axial misalignment [-30, 30 mm], the CA-type magnetic core has stronger misalignment adaptability, and it can achieve a stable output power of 575 W and DC-DC efficiency of 92.51% when rotational misalignment occurs. A WCS experimental prototype is built based on one of the magnetic couplers and its experimental results verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and simulation results.

AB Diverse passengers have various driving habits and driving preferences, thus the function of personalized driving is one of the most important features for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, the variable driving style factor is proposed to describe the preferences of aggressiveness for different passengers. Based on this, a cooperative trajectory planning framework that includes longitudinal speed adjustment and lateral trajectory planning for lane changing is proposed. In the longitudinal speed adjustment, a cooperative game approach that considers driving safety, ride comfort, travel efficiency, and the preferences of aggressiveness is proposed to extend the longitudinal distance between the ego car and cars moving on the adjacent lane before lane changing. In the lateral trajectory planning, an alternate trajectory set (ATS) method is proposed to obtain a set of trajectories, and the artificial potential field (APF) method is deployed to select the optimal safe trajectories subject to the environmental constraints. Then, the B-spline method is utilized to generate safe and smooth lane-changing trajectories considering the driving style factors. Finally, a modified pure pursuit tracker is designed to accurately track the planned trajectories. Experimental results show that the real-time system can generate safe and personalized trajectories for AVs with different driving preferences, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB Pedestrian trajectory perception is always a challenging task for autonomous urban driving since the weak echoes from pedestrians may be masked by strong background clutters, for example, road infrastructures and other vehicles. As a consequence, this article presents a frequency-modulated continuous wave-multiple input multiple output (FMCW-MIMO) radar-based trajectory tracking method to realize continuous pedestrian detection and tracking under low-observable environments. More specifically, the keystone transform-constant false alarm ratio (KT-CFAR) is first proposed to maximize the output signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) depending on the time-space correlations of a sequence of consecutive echoes, for the sake of improving the pedestrian detection probability under low-observable conditions. Then, the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is employed to provide a high azimuth resolution to improve the multitarget resolving ability. After that, a pedestrian trajectory tracking framework is constructed by means of Bayesian theory and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain high-precision pedestrian trajectory tracking under low SINR conditions compared with conventional Kalman filter (KF)-based tracking methods.

AB Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms face challenges in complex underwater scenarios, such as turbidity, dynamism, and low texture, where point features are unreliable and can lead to weakened or even failed systems. To overcome these issues, high-level object features are considered due to their accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we introduce an effective object-level SLAM method that employs a stereo camera to enhance the navigation robustness of autonomous underwater vehicles and generates a detailed semantic map. Point features and object features are integrated to serve the proposed approach. We begin by detecting 2D objects in images using a state-of-the-art neural network, followed by obtaining 3D objects described by the general model through the principle of multi-view geometry and eventually constructing semantic landmarks. To account for object data association, we present an object match method that takes into consideration the stereo camera characteristics in a single stereo frame and a filter-based approach to track the landmarks in odometry. Experiments are also conducted using the KITTI dataset and our sequences collected from the pool and coast. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed method can improve the performance of ORBSLAM2 in terms of both navigation robustness and mapping information in underwater scenarios.

AB This article presents a constraint modeling approach to global coverage-path planning for linear-infrastructure inspection using multiple autonomous UAVs. The problem is mathematically formulated as a variant of the Min-Max K-Chinese Postman Problem (MM K-CPP) with multi-weight edges. A high-level constraint programming language is used to model the problem, which enables model execution with different third-party solvers. The optimal solutions are obtained in a reasonable time for most of the tested instances and different numbers of vehicles involved in the inspection. For some graphs with multi-weight edges, a time limit is applied, as the problem is NP-hard and the computation time increases exponentially. Despite that, the final total inspection cost proved to be lower when compared with the solution obtained for the unrestricted MM K-CPP with single-weight edges. This model can be applied to plan coverage paths for linear-infrastructure inspection, resulting in a minimal total inspection time for relatively simple graphs that resemble real transmission networks. For more extensive graphs, it is possible to obtain valid solutions in a reasonable time, but optimality cannot be guaranteed. For future improvements, further optimization could be considered, or different models could be developed, possibly involving artificial neural networks.

AB Once automatic vehicles (AV) are available, working from self-driving cars (WFC) will be an option. It allows firms to socialize office land costs to road infrastructure used by AV's mobile offices. Employees, in turn, can switch wasted commuting time into working and substitute office hours. We model employers' offers and employees' discrete choice of WFC contracts and decisions on WFC hours, considering heterogeneous preferences for WFC. We further perform Monte Carlo studies for the U.S. and Germany to quantify these decisions, assess consequences on distances traveled and traffic-related externalities, and evaluate whether transport pricing can reduce the latter. Our findings suggest that WFC is a likely feature of tomorrow's world, but it comes at the cost of induced traffic and traffic-related externalities. Eventually, we see that standard transport-policy instruments on car use, traveling, and parking affect the number of mobile employees, i.e., those with WFC contracts, but do not lower distances traveled per mobile employee. Given these tentative findings, a policy to lower traffic and emissions shall primarily focus on avoiding WFC contracts. Once WFC contracts exist, standard policy instruments to reduce travel may need to be revised.

AB Communication-aware motion planning of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is regarded as an emergent requirement for marine intelligent transportation system. However, the fading acoustic channel and the complex underwater environment make it difficult to realize such task. This paper is concerned with a communication-aware motion planning issue for AUV in obstacle-dense environment. We first develop an intelligent AUV system, which includes binocular cameras for short-distance obstacle avoidance, sonars for long-distance detection, and modems for acoustic communication with buoys. For such system, the parallax angles from AUV to obstacles are utilized to construct an optimal motion planning problem by integrating our previously proposed channel estimation approach. In order to solve the above problem, a deep learning method called depth deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is developed to minimize the cost function, such that a collision-free path can be planed for AUV while maintaining the communication quality. Note that the advantages of our solution are highlighted as: 1) balance the communication quality and motion stability over the disk model-based methods; 2) improve the collision-avoidance efficiency in path lengths and control efforts as compared with the distance-based methods. Finally, simulation and experimental studies are both provided to verify the effectiveness of our method.

AB Autonomous railway inspection with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has huge advantages over traditional inspection methods. As a prerequisite for UAV-based autonomous following of railway lines, it is quite essential to develop intelligent railway track detection algorithms. However, there are no existing algorithms currently that can efficiently adapt to the demand for the various forms and changing inclination angles of railway tracks in the UAV aerial images. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a novel anchor-adaptive railway track detection network (ARTNet), which constructs a dual-branch architecture based on projection length discrimination to realize full-angle railway track detection for the UAV aerial images taken from arbitrary viewing angles. Considering the potential capacity imbalance of the two branches that can be caused by the uneven distribution of railway tracks in the dataset, a balanced transpose co-training strategy is proposed to train the two branches coordinately. Moreover, an extra customized transposed consistency loss is designed to guide the training of the network without increasing any computational complexity. A set of experiments have been conducted to verify the feasibility and superiority of the ARTNet. It is demonstrated that our approach can effectively realize full-angle railway track detection and outperform other popular algorithms greatly in terms of both detection accuracy and reasoning efficiency. ARTNet can achieve a mean F1 of 76.12 and run at a speed of 50 more frames per second.

AB In this study, a heuristic algorithm is used to find an optimal route for smart logistics loading and unloading applications. Various environments, such as traditional building blocks, satellite images, terrain environments, and Google map environments are developed by converting into a binary occupancy grid and used to optimize the viable path in the smart mobile logistics application. The proposed autonomous vehicle (AV) route planning navigation approach is to forecast the AV's path until it detects an imminent obstacle, at which point it should turn to the safest area before continuing on its route. To demonstrate the path navigation results of proposed algorithms, a navigational model is developed in the MATLAB/Simulink 2D virtual environment. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, the Bat search algorithm, and its proposed variants are used to identify a smooth and violation-free path for a given application environment. The proposed variants improve the algorithm's effectiveness in finding a violation-free path while requiring less time complexity by using cubic spline curve interpolation and its improved constriction factor. Extensive simulation and benchmark validation results show the proposed standard PSO has a significantly shorter violation-free path, quick convergence rate and takes less time to compute the distance between loading and unloading environment locations than the cooperative coevolving PSO, Bat algorithm, or modified frequency Bat algorithms.

AB Autonomous vehicles rely on perceiving the road environment through a perception pipeline fed by a variety of sensor modalities, including camera, lidar, radar, infrared, gated camera, and ultrasonic. The vehicle computer must perform sensor fusion reliably in various sensor signals degrading environments, which can be performed parametrically or using machine learning. We study sensor fusion of a forward-facing camera and a lidar sensor using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for drivable area detection in winter driving, where the roads are partially covered with snow, tire tracks obscuring lane markers. Seven fusion models are developed and evaluated for their ability to classify pixels into two classes: drivable and nondrivable. A total of seven models are designed and tested, including camera only, lidar only, early fusion, (three types of) intermediate fusion, and late fusion. The models have accuracies between 84% and 89%, with runtimes between 23 and 61 ms. To select the best model from this group, we introduce a unique metric, named normalized accuracy runtime (NAR) score. A network in a group has a higher NAR score, the more accurate it is, and the shorter its runtime is. The models are evaluated on a winter driving DENSE dataset. Camera and lidar fog noise are synthesized to examine model robustness. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB Automated in-field data gathering is essential for crop monitoring and management and for precision farming treatments. To this end, consumer-grade digital cameras have been shown to offer a flexible and affordable sensing solution. This paper describes the integration and development of a cost-effective multi-view RGB-D device for sensing and modeling of agricultural environments. The system features three RGB-D sensors, arranged to cover a horizontal field of view of about 130 deg in front of the vehicle, and a suite of localization sensors consisting of a tracking camera, an RTK-GPS sensor and an IMU device. The system is intended to be mounted on-board an agricultural vehicle to provide multi-channel information of the surveyed scene including color, infrared and depth images, which are then combined with localization data to build a multi-view 3D geo-referenced map of the traversed crop. The experimental demonstrator of the multi-sensor system is presented along with the steps for the integration of the different sensor data into a unique multi-view map. Results of field experiments conducted in a commercial vineyard are included, as well, showing the effectiveness of the proposed system. The resulting map could be useful for precision agriculture applications, including crop health monitoring, and to support autonomous driving.

AB The autonomous cooperation of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will effectively improve the efficiency of task completion and meet the needs of task diversity. The information interaction and mutual control between UAVs restrict the autonomy of multi-UAVs. The number and selection of control units not only affect the equipment cost of the network but also affect the stability of the network. Link information, such as bandwidth resources and the computing power of the control unit, also affect the resource adjustment of other related links. In order to improve the efficiency and stability of UAVs computing first network, considering the number of control units and link information, this article creatively puts forward the concepts of incidence control, sign incidence control, and incidence complete control. The minimum incidence control number and incidence complete control number of general graphs are calculated. When the network topology of UAV meets the requirements of path, circle, and star, the exact value of the sign incidence control number is calculated. When the network topology of UAV meets the requirements of the complete graph, complete bipartite graph, and wheel graph, the bounds of the sign incidence control number are calculated. The number of control units of the UAV network is further determined.

AB High end-to-end delay is a significant challenge in the data collection process in the underwater environment. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are a considerably reliable source of data collection if they have significant trajectory movement. Therefore, in this paper, a new routing algorithm known as Elliptical Shaped Efficient Data Gathering (ESEDG) is introduced for the AUV movement. ESEDG is divided into two phases: first, an elliptical trajectory has been designed for the horizontal movement of the AUV. In the second phase, the AUV gathers data from Gateway Nodes (GNs) which are associated with Member Nodes (MNs). For their association, an end-to-end delay model is also presented in ESEDG. The hierarchy of data collection is as follows: MNs send data to GNs, the AUV receives data from GNs, and forwards it to the sink node. Furthermore, the ESEDG was evaluated on the network simulator NS-3 version 3.35, and the results were compared to existing data collection routing protocols DSG-DGA, AEEDCO, AEEDCO-A, ALP, SEDG, and AEDG. In terms of network throughput, end-to-end delay, lifetime, path loss, and energy consumption, the results showed that ESEDG outperformed the baseline routing protocols.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the benefits of the turning point layout; a simulation model being applicable for strategic level is designed that compares systems with and without turning points. Specifically, the avoidance of deadlocks and prevention of conflicts is substantial. Design/methodology/approach Optimization process for different layouts and configuration of autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) are worked out using statistical methods for design parameters. Regression analysis is used to find effective design parameters and analysis of variance is applied for adjusting critical factors. Also, the optimal design is then implemented in a manufacturing system for an industrial automation and the results are reported. Findings The outputs imply the effectiveness of the proposed approach for real industrial cases. This research will combine both simulation-based method and optimization technique to improve the quality of solutions. Originality/value In AGV systems, the begin-end combinations are usually connected by using a fixed layout, which is not the optimal path. The capability of these configurations is limited and often the conflict of multiple AGVs and deadlock are inevitable. By appearing more flexible layouts and advanced technology, the positioning and dispatching of AGVs increased. A new concept would be to determine each path dynamically. This would use the free paths for AGVs leading to overcome the conflicts and deadlocks.

AB This paper presents an integrated and iterative approach to the identification and understanding of seafloor and shallow geohazards at a complex geologic setting in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The approach, focusing on geophysical data gathering and processing, allowed continuous improvement in the understanding of individual geohazard risks ahead of any eventual selection of wildcat drilling locations.
   The progressive development of increased image resolution has included the use of the following data types: exploration 3D, autonomous underwater vehicle seabed clearance, short-offset 3D, a full-waveform inversion velocity model, HR3D acquisition, HR3D, autonomous underwater vehicle high-resolution sonar, and seabed photographic transects.
   Data have assisted in revealing the presence and the understanding of, numerous seafloor and sub-seafloor geologic features that could potentially affect the choice of well location, well trajectory, and final drilling practices. Features that have been defined have included active benthic communities, widespread seafloor faulting, multi-scale active seabed expulsion features, slope-failure scarps, mass transport complexes, shallow gas, and various effects from the presence and transmission of shallow overpressure towards the seafloor.
   The final, integrated geologic model that is developed will allow selection of well surface locations and trajectories that meet local regulatory requirements for safe drilling and environmental protection, as well as the adoption of safe drilling practices to mitigate identified hazards.

AB In this study, we investigated the performance of a typical propeller behind an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) at a fully turbulent flow regime at different angles of attack by the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. For this purpose, preliminarily, numerical results for the open water performance of the propeller were validated against the empirical data. Then, the study of the behind-hull effects and self-propulsion point of the AUV were carried out for diverse propeller to hull diameter ratios (D-prop/D-hull). After all, the performance of the propeller with minimum behind-hull effects was investigated at different angles of attack and the results were discussed for high and moderate propeller loads. Our findings demonstrate that despite similar hydrodynamic efficiency for propeller at different angles of attack, the generated thrust and consequently the required propeller torque were significantly higher than those in straight motion. In addition, for the prediction of the behind-hull performance of propellers, the propeller thrust and torque coefficients in open water condition were at least 8% over-estimated for AUV straight motion and 7.5% under-estimated for descent at high angle of attack.

AB [1] Data collected from the near-field region (first several kilometers) of the Merrimack River plume are analyzed to provide estimates of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rates. Measurement techniques included a control volume method incorporating density and velocity survey data, and direct dissipation rate measurements by turbulence sensors mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). These two distinct observational approaches are compared with TKE dissipation rates derived from a highly resolved three-dimensional numerical model. In general, there is good agreement between the three estimates of dissipation rate. Differences occurred in two regions: (1) at the base of the plume, where plume density increased, and (2) in the very near field of the plume, which is characterized by rapid acceleration and strong shoaling. Results suggest that there is a feedback between the turbulence and the plume evolution with the result that the spreading rate of the plume is constrained. A scaling parameterization, relating turbulent dissipation rate to plume density and velocity, is also examined. Immediately seaward of the front this parameterization appears to be consistent with observed rates of dissipation, but progressing seaward, a modification to the parameterization may be necessary to account for plume spreading and deepening.

AB Active suspension systems (ASSs) are crucial for realizing the improvement demand of ride comfort in autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper presents a novel integrated robust preview control (PC) algorithm to further improve the ride comfort by effectively handling actuator delay. An augmented ASS model is first established to consider actuator delay. Then, to obtain the time-domain feedforward disturbance, updating the local spatial road dataset from sensing systems by low-pass filtering and introducing speed for conversion. A predictive control framework that utilizes preview road disturbances is developed to achieve better ride comfort. And assuming parameterized disturbances, it is transformed into a consistent quadratic programming (QP) problem for real-time application in ASS. Furthermore, an innovative design of combined observer provides accurate and robust observations under multiple uncertainties, with which the algorithm can effectively compensate for actuator delay under different road conditions. Finally, the bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability of the algorithm is well demonstrated. Simulation and bench test results indicate that the proposed algorithm can not only significantly improve road holding and ride comfort, but also realize a robust observation of the augmented ASS state. In addition, the solving time of the bench test satisfies the real-time requirements of the algorithm.

AB Aiming at the challenging underwater navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), this article develops a novel filtering method with a guided trajectory. The relatively low frequency of ultra-short baseline positioning system (USBL) measurement and the noise caused by complex scenes have a significant impact on the accuracy of AUV motion estimation. Although the existing adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) and adaptive unscented Kalman filter (UKF) can roughly eliminate these outliers, the filtering results of these algorithms are not smooth and have a serious degree of jitter, and then greatly affect the local consistency and quality of topographic map seamless stitching. We exploit the relatively smooth strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) as the guided trajectory for motion estimation, and propose a trajectory smoothness-preserving filter algorithm. This system has the advantage of maintaining local gradient consistency, which not only improves the navigation accuracy, but also ensures the smoothness of the estimation system. Simulation results show that our approach has high robustness and good smoothness. The effectiveness and practicability of the method are demonstrated by real experiments in multiple deep-sea areas with an average depth of more than 1000 m in the southwest Indian Ocean.

AB This paper presents a kind of attitude estimation algorithm based on quaternion-vector switching and square-root cubature Kalman filter for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The filter formulation is based on geomagnetic field tensor measurement dependent on the attitude and a gyro-based model for attitude propagation. In this algorithm, switching between the quaternion and the three-component vector is done by a couple of the mathematical transformations. Quaternion is chosen as the state variable of attitude in the kinematics equation to time update, while the mean value and covariance of the quaternion are computed by the three-component vector to avoid the normalization constraint of quaternion. The square-root forms enjoy a continuous and improved numerical stability because all the resulting covariance matrices are guaranteed to stay positively semidefinite. The entire square-root cubature attitude estimation algorithm with quaternion-vector switching for the nonlinear equality constraint of quaternion is given. The numerical simulation of simultaneous swing motions in the three directions is performed to compare with the three kinds of filters and the results indicate that the proposed filter provides lower attitude estimation errors than the other two kinds of filters and a good convergence rate.

TI Minimum Speed Seeking Control for Nonhovering Autonomous Underwater
   Vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Most autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are propelled by a single thruster, use elevators and rudders as control surfaces, and are torpedo-shaped. Furthermore, they are positively buoyant to facilitate recovery during an emergency. For this class of nonhovering AUVs, there is a minimum speed at which the AUV must travel for stable depth control. Otherwise, the extra buoyancy will bring the AUV up to the surface when the fin loses its effectiveness at low speeds. Hence, we develop a novel algorithm such that the AUV is automatically controlled to travel at its minimum speed while maintaining a constant depth. This capability is important in a number of practical scenarios, including underwater loitering with minimum energy consumption, underwater docking with minimum impact, and high-resolution sensing at minimum speed. First, we construct a depth dynamic model to explain the mechanism of the minimum speed, and we show its relationship with the buoyancy, the righting moment, and the fin's effectiveness of the AUV. Next, we discuss the minimum speed seeking problem under the framework of extremum seeking. We extend the framework by introducing a new definition of steady-state mapping that imposes new structure on the seeking algorithm. The proposed algorithm employs a fuzzy inference system, which is driven by the real-time measurements of pitch error and elevator deflection. The effectiveness of the algorithm in seeking the minimum speed is validated in both simulations and field experiments.

AB Monitoring marine habitats and biodiversity is critical for understanding ecological processes, conserving natural resources, and achieving ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). Here, we describe the application of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technology to conduct ongoing monitoring of benthic habitats at two key locations in Western Australia. Benthic assemblages on rocky reefs were sampled with an AUV, which captured.200 000 geo-referenced images. Surveys were designed to obtain 100% coverage of 25 x 25 m patches of benthic habitat. In 2010, multiple patches were surveyed at 15-40-m depths at three reference sites at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands and at six reference sites at Rottnest Island. The following year, repeat surveys of the same geo-referenced patches were conducted. Benthic assemblages at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands were varied in that one reference site was dominated by hard corals, whereas the other two were macroalgae dominated. Conversely, assemblages at Rottnest Island were dominated by the kelp Ecklonia radiata. The AUV resurveyed each patch with high precision and demonstrated adequate power to detect change. Repeated observations at the reference sites will track natural variability in benthic habitat structure, which in turn will facilitate the detection of ecological change and ultimately feed back into EBFM processes.

AB It is now possible to make highly resolved vertical (<1 m) and horizontal (3 m at constant depth and,400 m when undulating from surface to 100 m) measurements of nitrate concentration in the upper ocean using sensors deployed on propeller-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The ability to make such highly resolved measurements opens the possibility of detecting small-scale anomalies in nutrient fields that are created by locally high rates of primary production. We employed an in situ ultraviolet spectrophotometer optical nitrate sensor and Sea-Bird oxygen sensor mounted on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute Dorado AUV to investigate the spatial variability of nitrate and oxygen in Monterey Bay, California. The Dorado conducts missions up to 100 km in length. A very simplified diffusion and reaction model for nitrate, ignoring horizontal processes and advection and assuming steady state, would require that consumption rate = K(Z) X partial derivative(2)NO(3)(-)/partial derivative Z(2) (K(Z) = vertical eddy diffusion coefficient). Water column regions exhibiting elevated nitrate uptake rates are identified from anomalies in the second derivatives of the vertical concentration profiles relative to the second derivative of conservative properties. The relationship between chlorophyll a fluorescence and the inferred productivity rates exhibits coherent spatial variability across the bay.

AB In this article, a novel adaptive robust trajectory tracking framework with roll control is created for a X-Rudder autonomous underwater vehicle (XAUV) subjects to system nonlinearities, unknown disturbances, and complex actuator dynamics. First, a roll control law is introduced to the kinematics control loop, and the hyperbolictangent Line-of-sight (HLOS) based guidance law is proposed, which considers the three-dimensional (3D) tracking errors, collaboratively governing heading, pitch, and roll. Second, a novel super-hyperbolic switching algorithm (SHSA) based sliding mode controller is deployed in the dynamics control loop to achieve trajectory tracking and roll control, which combines the advantages of the two hyperbolic functions, avoids the chattering problem while achieving rapid convergence, this enhancing the control accuracy and stability simultaneously. Besides, the robustness to unknown disturbances (including environmental disturbances and propeller reaction torque) is enhanced by nonlinear disturbance observers. To tackle the potential instabilities from compound actuator dynamics, an anti-windup compensator is resorted to compensate for the control truncation of propulsion system, and an optimal X-Rudder allocator is utilized to solve the rudder angle assignment problem with multiple constraints. Finally, comparative numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of proposed controller.

AB Radio maps find numerous applications in wireless communications and mobile robotics tasks, including resource allocation, interference coordination, and mission planning. Although numerous existing techniques construct radio maps from spatially distributed measurements, the locations of such measurements are predetermined beforehand. In contrast, this paper proposes spectrum surveying, where a mobile robot such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collects measurements at a set of locations that are actively selected to obtain high-quality map estimates in a short surveying time. This is performed in two steps. First, two novel algorithms, a model-based online Bayesian estimator and a data-driven deep learning algorithm, are devised for updating a map estimate and an uncertainty metric that indicates the informativeness of measurements at each possible location. These algorithms offer complementary benefits and feature constant complexity per measurement. Second, the uncertainty metric is used to plan the trajectory of the UAV to gather measurements at the most informative locations. To overcome the combinatorial complexity of this problem, a dynamic programming approach is proposed to obtain lists of waypoints through areas of large uncertainty in linear time. Numerical experiments conducted on a realistic dataset confirm that the proposed scheme constructs accurate radio maps quickly.

AB The information about optical flow, i.e., the movement of pixels between two consecutive images from a video sequence, is used in many vision systems, both classical and those based on deep neural networks. In some robotic applications, e.g., in autonomous vehicles, it is necessary to calculate the flow in real time. This represents a challenging task, especially for high-resolution video streams. In this work, two gradient-based algorithms-Lucas-Kanade and Horn-Schunck-were implemented on a ZCU 104 platform with Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC FPGA. A vector data format was used to enable flow calculation for a 4K (Ultra HD, 3840 x 2160 pixels) video stream at 60 fps. In order to detect larger pixel displacements, a multi-scale approach was used in both algorithms. Depending on the scale, the calculations were performed for different data formats, allowing for more efficient processing by reducing resource utilisation. The presented solution allows real-time optical flow determination in multiple scales for a 4K resolution with estimated energy consumption below 6 W. The algorithms realised in this work can be a component of a larger vision system in advanced surveillance systems or autonomous vehicles.

AB The amount of high dimensional data produced by visual sensors in the smart environments and by autonomous vehicles is increasing exponentially. In order to search and model this data for real-time applications, the dimensionality of the data should be reduced. In this paper, a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm based on fuzzy rough set theory, called Centralized Binary Mapping (CBM), is proposed. The fuzzy CBM kernel is used for extracting the central elements and the memory cells from the blocks of high dimensional data. The proposed applications of CBM in this paper include hashing and generative modelling of multimedia big data. The robustness of the proposed CBM based hashing algorithm is 10% higher than comparable methods. Furthermore, based on the CBM, a novel architecture for neural networks called Deep Root Dimensional Mapping (DRDM) is proposed. The DRDM is used for generative modelling of multimedia big data using a new autonomous vehicle visual navigation dataset as well as the standard datasets. The simulation results show that the proposed DRDM converges rapidly and the perceptual quality of the outputs at the same epoch is higher than generative adversarial networks. The proposed CBM can be used as a new data structures in various pattern recognition and machine learning tasks.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; TRACKING CONTROL
AB This paper introduces a model-driven control realization, which is based on the systems engineering concepts of the model-driven architecture (MDA)/model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach combined with the real-time UML/SysML, extended/unscented Kalman filter (EKF/UKF) algorithms, and hybrid automata, in order to conveniently deploy controllers of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This model also creates a real-time communication pattern, which can permit the designed components to be customizable and reusable in new application developments of different AUV types. The paper brings out stepwise adapted AUV dynamics for control that are then combined with the specialization of MDA/MBSE features as follows: the computation independent model (CIM) is defined by the specification of the use-case model together with hybrid automata to gather the requirement analysis for control; the platform-independent model (PIM) is then designed by specializing the real-time UML/SysML's features including main control capsules that depict structures and behaviors of controllers in detail; and the detailed PIM is subsequently converted into the platform-specific model (PSM) by object-oriented platforms to rapidly implement the AUV controller. Based on this proposed model, a horizontal planar trajectory-tracking controller was deployed and tested that permits a miniature AUV possessing a torpedo shape to reach and follow the desired horizontal planar trajectory.

AB The noncooperative target tracking is an important issue for the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are preferred options to achieve the target tracking especially in anchor-free environments, where no equipments with known positions, named anchors, are deployed. The self-organized mobile network of multiple AUVs can localize and continuously monitor the target. Thus, in this article, we investigate the problem of the noncooperative target tracking using multiple AUVs in anchor-free environments. In the target tracking, AUVs play as references and their positions need to be estimated first. We propose a multi-AUV cooperative localization and target tracking (MCLTT) framework based on belief propagation (BP). Under MCLTT, BP-based underwater cooperative localization (BPUCL) and noncooperative mobile target tracking (NcMTT) algorithms are designed. Gaussian approximations are used to reduce communication costs among AUVs. The designed BPUCL alleviates the impact of the accumulated errors in the inertial measurements of AUVs and slows down the growth of the localization error. In NcMTT, model-free position prediction processes are proposed and a novel form of the particle-based BP message is designed using time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements. The simulation results validate the proposed algorithms by comparing with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Information fusion method of INS/GPS navigation system based on filtering technology is a research focus at present. In order to improve the precision of navigation information, a navigation technology based on Adaptive Kalman Filter with attenuation factor is proposed to restrain noise in this paper. The algorithm continuously updates the measurement noise variance and processes noise variance of the system by collecting the estimated and measured values, and this method can suppress white noise. Because a measured value closer to the current time would more accurately reflect the characteristics of the noise, an attenuation factor is introduced to increase the weight of the current value, in order to deal with the noise variance caused by environment disturbance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a series of road tests are carried out in urban environment. The GPS and IMU data of the experiments were collected and processed by dSPACE and MATLAB/Simulink. Based on the test results, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 20% higher than that of a traditional Adaptive Kalman Filter. It also shows that the precision of the integrated navigation can be improved due to the reduction of the influence of environment noise. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nanomotors exhibit autonomous self-propulsion using nanolocomotion; the process in which any nanoscale object move forward via an anisotropic force which is usually facilitated by an asymmetric structure. Nanomotors mostly can be used for catalysis, bio-sensing and site specific drug delivery. But the major problem in current micro and nanomotor systems are less biocompatibility, less drug loading capacity and the inability to execute motion at a non-toxic and neutral pH, thus limiting the possibility to use in biological applications. Hence, the synthesis of a nanomotor with optimal conditions for biological applications is examined. In this paper we report, for the first time, gold/palladium coated magnesium nanoparticles contain mesoporous silica nanomotors to produce hydrogen gas to execute nanolocomotion in neutral pH. The aspirin was used as a model drug in this study and the results indicate that the fabricated nanomotor systems are appropriate delivery vehicles for the storage of fuel and cargo. Kinetic model of drug release via nanomotors in simulated body fluids at room temperature agreed well with the Higuchi model with R-2 = 0.989. This design shows high levels of biocompatibility and the capability of storing payloads or fuel as desired.

AB The marine self-potential (SP) method is currently playing an increasing role in the exploration and resource evaluation of seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits. SP surveys are conducted using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), which yield multicomponent electric field datasets. By comparing with the single-component electrical field data used to date, the inversion of these multicomponent data is expected to provide a more accurate description of the 3D structure of SMS deposits beneath the seafloor (like gradiometry in gravity surveys). We introduce an inversion algorithm specifically adapted to multicomponent SP data. A synthetic model demonstrates that the inversion of multicomponent datasets allows us to better recover the amplitude of the current density and the morphology of the ore bodies compared to using a single component of the electrical field. Next, we apply our approach to a multicomponent SP dataset collected during the DY58 oceanic cruise at the Yuhuang hydrothermal field on the Southwest Indian Ridge. Subsequently, we reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the SMS deposits beneath the seafloor. The AUV-based SP system with the collection of multicomponent SP data inversion appears to be a powerful tool in the exploration and evaluation of seafloor sulfide resource and, in the future, could be used in concert with induced polarization data.

AB Information technology is based on data management between various sources. Software projects, as varied as simple applications or as complex as self-driving cars, are heavily reliant on the amounts, and types, of data ingested by one or more interconnected systems. Data is not only consumed but is transformed or mutated which requires copious amounts of computing resources. One of the most exciting areas of cyber-physical systems, autonomous vehicles, makes heavy use of deep learning and AI to mimic the highly complex actions of a human driver. Attempting to map human behavior (a large and abstract concept) requires large amounts of data, used by AIs to increase their knowledge and better attempt to solve complex problems. This paper outlines a full-fledged solution for managing resources in a multi-cloud environment. The purpose of this API is to accommodate ever-increasing resource requirements by leveraging the multi-cloud and using commercially available tools to scale resources and make systems more resilient while remaining as cloud agnostic as possible. To that effect, the work herein will consist of an architectural breakdown of the resource management API, a low-level description of the implementation and an experiment aimed at proving the feasibility, and applicability of the systems described.

AB Underwater navigation is a challenging topic in the field of underwater exploration. Accurate and effective underwater navigation is necessary in applications such as 3D seafloor topography scanning, cable laying, deepsea resource survey and wreck salvage. However, underwater navigation becomes difficult due to the variability and complexity of underwater environment. In the deep-sea environment, the ultra-short baseline positioning system (USBL) is very unstable, and the flying abnormal points and signal loss often occur. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a two-step filtering scheme combined with doppler velocity log (DVL). The first step is to construct a rough Monte Carlo particle filter (MPF) model for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) position, and then select candidate particles with the strategy of minimizing the local backward dead reckoning (DR) errors. In the second step, the results of the first step are further smoothed and optimized using the weighted extended Kalman filter (WEKF). Finally, the robustness and practicability of the proposed method are verified by the multiple data obtained from several sea trials in the South-West Indian Ocean. The results also show that the integrated navigation framework is superior to single navigation method and other traditional filtering methods. The best balance between accuracy and computational cost is achieved.

AB The real-time control system (RCS) methodology has evolved over a number of years as a technique to capture task knowledge and organize it in a framework conducive to implementation in computer control systems. The fundamental premise of this methodology is that the present state of the task activities sets the context that identifies the requirements for all the support processing. In particular, the task context at any time determines what is to be sensed in the world, what world model states are to be evaluated, which situations are to be analyzed, what plans should be invoked, and which behavior generation knowledge is to be accessed. This results in a methodology that concentrates first and foremost on the task definition. It starts with the definition of the task knowledge in the form of a decision tree that clearly represents the branching of tasks into layers of simpler and simpler subtask sequences. This task decomposition framework is then used to guide the search for and to emplace all of the additional knowledge. This paper explores this process in some detail, showing how this knowledge is represented in a task context-sensitive relationship that supports the very complex real-time processing the computer control systems will have to do.

AB Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are of great significance to the development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). The UGVs are supposed to serve a large number of missions with multiple functions in civilian use. Therefore, it requires UGV to be grouped as a platoon to complete the given missions. A novel platoon topology, Vehicle-Cloud Bidirectional Leader (VCBDL), is proposed in this paper to provide the basement for the group control of multi-functional UGVs. The VCBDL topology takes consideration of a cloud brain control center, which is capable of analyzing and making autonomous decisions for the UGVs. In order to realize the stable operation of the platoon with VCBDL topology, this paper analyzes the design of the platoon controller based on the graph theory method and obtains the range of controller gain. The robustness of the running platoon is analyzed and the convergence range of the platoon robustness index is defined. The above conclusions are verified by simulation based on the control of the police-used patrol UGV. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of controller design, and the robustness performance is investigated by simulated random platoon disturbance. In addition, the experiments with real shuttle UGVs testbeds platoon are performed to verify the performance of the proposed controller.

AB As autonomous and connected vehicles are becoming a reality, mobile-edge computing (MEC) off-loading provides a promising paradigm to trade off between the long latency of clouding computing and the high cost of upgrading the on-board computers of vehicles. However, due to the randomness of task arrivals, vehicles always have a tendency to choose MEC server for offloading in a selfish way, which is not satisfactory for the social good of the whole system and even results in a failure possibility of some tasks due to the overflow of MEC servers. This paper elaborates the modeling of task arrival process and the influence of various offloading modes on computation cost. Interestingly, by formulating task arrivals as a compound process of vehicle arrivals and task generations, we found that the task arrival model for MEC servers does not belong to the standard Poisson distribution, which contradicts the popular assumption in most existing studies. Considering the load distribution and the prediction of cost, we propose a load-aware MEC offloading method, in which each vehicle makes MEC server selection based on the predicted cost with the updated knowledge on load distribution of MEC servers. Analysis and simulation show that the proposed scheme can achieve up to 65% reduction of total cost with almost 100% task success ratio.

AB There has been an increase of automated vehicle (AV) technologies in recent years. Using qualitative methods, this study explored drivers' responses to the experience of AVs centered on theoretical themes of trust, particularly around ability, helpfulness, and integrity as well as individual factors of identity, norms, and efficacy. Participants (n = 68, Mage = 43. 2 years) first completed a 20-minute drive in an advanced high-fidelity driving simulator that simulated driving an AV with intermittent periods of manual vehicle control. Participants identified consideration of financial concerns and described a need to trust that the AV system worked as expected and that it would function similar to human drivers, including their speed management. They also identified trust with regard to potential benefits (helpfulness regarding mobility and secondary task performance). Hacking and privacy were identified integrity issues, although primarily privacy was not considered relevant to their behaviour. The findings from participant interviews also revealed that individual difference constructs around identity (as an early technology adopter or 'car' person), social norms, and efficacy were important factors in their intentions to drive or own a fully AV. Finally the participants described emotive outcomes, relating to benefits of relaxing or reducing stress and use being fun and safe. Overall, these findings provide some insights into the way in which drivers' describe the benefits and potential concerns associated with emerging AV technologies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Autonomous navigation requires multi-sensor fusion to achieve a high level of accuracy in different environments. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers are the main components in most navigation systems. However, GNSS signals are subject to blockage and multipath effects in challenging areas, e.g., tunnels, underground parking, and downtown or urban areas. Therefore, different sensors, such as inertial navigation systems (INSs) and radar, can be used to compensate for GNSS signal deterioration and to meet continuity requirements. In this paper, a novel algorithm was applied to improve land vehicle navigation in GNSS-challenging environments through radar/INS integration and map matching. Four radar units were utilized in this work. Two units were used to estimate the vehicle's forward velocity, and the four units were used together to estimate the vehicle's position. The integrated solution was estimated in two steps. First, the radar solution was fused with an INS through an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Second, map matching was used to correct the radar/INS integrated position using OpenStreetMap (OSM). The developed algorithm was evaluated using real data collected in Calgary's urban area and downtown Toronto. The results show the efficiency of the proposed method, which had a horizontal position RMS error percentage of less than 1% of the distance traveled for three minutes of a simulated GNSS outage.

AB Digital models are the foundation of digital twins, which form the basis of autonomous off-road vehicles. Developing virtual models of off-road vehicles using dynamic reduction techniques is one of several approaches. The article commences with a comprehensive overview of the most widely used dynamic reduction methods and then introduces performance metrics for assessing their efficacies in the context of digital twins. The paper additionally includes a detailed mathematical derivation of the state-space representation for reduced-order finite element models. The state-space representation of the reduced finite element models facilitates their export to problem-solving environments for dynamic analysis. The state-space models are eventually solved utilizing the built-in libraries of numerical solvers in textual and graphical programming platforms. In addition, the article identifies the set of solvers that best suit the simulation of virtual models for off-road vehicles. This article also includes an evaluation of the simulation results for digital models with modes ranging from 0 to 30 Hz. In addition, the article demonstrates the lower bound of the frequency range necessary and sufficient to be retained in off-road vehicle virtual models. Finally, the paper presents the simulation outcomes for digital models of commercial off-road vehicles with custom-built virtual modules of powertrain, electrical, and control systems in a problem-solving environment.

AB The increased automation and connectivity of vehicles and road infrastructure can make future transportation systems more efficient and smarter and enable new transportation business models. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) may form a group of autonomous fleets to transform today's shared mobility services and also play the role of mobile sensors, which share real-time traffic and road information for transportation management. However, these technological advancements also lead to new cyher and physical threats that cause safety hazards or other undesired consequences. Although there have been a large number of papers about identifying and mitigating each type of threat, the lack of design support still challenges security engineering for developing CAVs. This limits the engineering capabilities of original equipment manufacturers to prioritize among multiple system properties, including safety, security, and privacy, and dealing with ever-changing attack surfaces and the power of attackers. This paper surveys security vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms for CAVs from an engineering design perspective. We illustrate how to identify and mitigate physical threats that compromise the safety of individual vehicles and cyber threats that disrupt newly CAV-enabled transportation services in a systematic way. An integrated security engineering process and a multi-layer design framework are presented for providing traceability and guidance in threat identification and mitigation.

AB With the advent of self-driving cars and the push by large companies into fully driverless transportation services, monitoring passenger behaviour in vehicles is becoming increasingly important for several reasons, such as ensuring safety and comfort. Although several human action recognition (HAR) methods have been proposed, developing a true HAR system remains a very challenging task. If the dataset used to train a model contains a small number of actors, the model can become biased towards these actors and their unique characteristics. This can cause the model to generalise poorly when confronted with new actors performing the same actions. This limitation is particularly acute when developing models to characterise the activities of vehicle occupants, for which data sets are short and scarce. In this study, we describe and evaluate three different methods that aim to address this actor bias and assess their performance in detecting in-vehicle violence. These methods work by removing specific information about the actor from the model's features during training or by using data that is independent of the actor, such as information about body posture. The experimental results show improvements over the baseline model when evaluated with real data. On the Hanau03 Vito dataset, the accuracy improved from 65.33% to 69.41%. On the Sunnyvale dataset, the accuracy improved from 82.81% to 86.62%.

AB Modern vehicles nowadays have many capabilities apart from the basic function of driving. These are now intelligent, smart, and can communicate over the Internet. A vehicle-to-everything (V2X) wireless network represents a network where vehicles communicate vital sensor data with other vehicles, pedestrians, and fixed infrastructure over the internet. There are various challenges in V2X communication that may affect the efficiency of autonomous devices, systems, and infrastructure. Of the many challenges, time synchronization among many devices in V2X networks is a key challenge. In a V2X network, all nodes within the network need to be time-synchronized; this is essential for task scheduling, computation off-loading, event sequencing, resource sharing, and efficient utilization of resources in the network. In recent works, many researchers have addressed time synchronization in V2X networks by considering multiple timestamps in order to estimate the time skew offset with varying results. In this paper, we consider a skew-based approach, namely, a single-timestamp skew correction (STSC) for time synchronization in V2X networks. The proposed method needs a single timestamp to estimate time skew at the hardware level with the help of physical-layer time synchronization using symbol timing recovery. Implementation results prove that the STSC accurately synchronizes the nodes in phase and frequency, therefore resulting in a greater accuracy and better energy savings in the V2X networks.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) have emerged rapidly in recent years, becoming a focus of high expectations and heated debates. Advocates argue that the arrival of AVs will make driving safer, greener, cheaper, and faster, bringing ubiquitous access to transportation while significantly reducing traffic congestion and environmental impacts. Skeptics, in contrast, suggest that the appeal of AVs will induce additional driving, offsetting or even overwhelming the positive effects of increased automation. Many analysts now believe that the solution lies in ensuring that most vehicle trips are shared to serve the same number of passenger miles with fewer vehicle miles, reducing traffic congestion. However, these analyses fail to recognize that reducing congestion will induce yet more demand for driving and attract riders from other transportation modes including public transit, which is already experiencing falling ridership in many cities. In this study, we explore the impact of AVs and pooling on consumer mode choice and the effect on the performance of both road and public transit systems. We show that the well-intentioned move to promote pooling may have the unintended consequence of triggering a public transit death spiral, leading to both worse public transit quality and more rather than less traffic congestion. We argue that the deployment of AVs and pooling can be effective at accelerating the transition to sustainable urban mobility, but only when accompanied by policies that make driving less attractive, not more.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Speech-based human machine interaction (HMI) is essential to electronic navigation, autonomous cars, and intelligent vehicles. The noises generated by the mechanical motion or electric power equipment degrade speech quality and result in HMI failing to work effectively. However, there is relatively little literature available on speech enhancement under electric vehicle noise condition. This paper presents a speech enhancement method based on improved nonnegative matrix factorization (ImNMF). Unlike the traditional nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) trains its speech dictionary using speech recorded in advance which inevitably contains a little noise component, ImNMF generates the speech dictionary using the spectra of pitch and their harmonics via mathematical model. This purpose is to guarantee the purity of speech dictionary. In addition, in order to alleviate the loss of the information of the noise sample, ImNMF constructs noise dictionary by a combination of the gain adjusted spectrum frames of the noise samples separated online. Compared with traditional NMF, the ImNMF noise atoms are relatively larger. Thus, the representation of speech signal mixed with noise atoms is greatly reduced. Therefore, ImNMF can reduce distortion of reconstructed speech while enhancing the recovered speech quality. Speech enhancement and speaker verification experiments on NUST603 and TIMIT data showed that the proposed ImNMF can effectively enhance speech signal in the noise environment of electric vehicles and further can reduce the equal error rate of the speaker verification system.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a critical sensor for autonomous vehicle systems, providing high-resolution distance measurements in real-time. However, adverse weather conditions such as snow, rain, fog, and sun glare can affect LiDAR performance, requiring data preprocessing. This paper proposes a novel approach, the Adaptive Outlier Removal filter on range Image (AORI), which combines a projection image from LiDAR point clouds with an adaptive outlier removal filter to remove snow particles. Our research aims to analyze the characteristics of LiDAR and propose an image-based approach derived from LiDAR data that addresses the limitations of previous studies, particularly in improving the efficiency of nearest neighbor point search. Our proposed method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy (>96%) and processing speed (0.26 s per frame) for autonomous driving systems under harsh weather from raw LiDAR point clouds in the Winter Adverse Driving dataset (WADS). Notably, AORI outperforms state-of-the-art filters by achieving a 6.6% higher F1 score and 0.7% higher accuracy. Although our method has a lower recall than state-of-the-art methods, it achieves a good balance between retaining object points and filter noise points from LiDAR, indicating its promise for snow removal in adverse weather conditions.

AB Several control strategies have been proposed for the trajectory tracking problem of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). Most of them are model-based, hence, detailed knowledge of the parameters of the robot is needed. Few works consider a finite-time convergence in their controllers, which offers strong robustness and fast convergence compared with asymptotic or exponential solutions. Those finite-time controllers do not permit the users to predefine the convergence time, which can be useful for a more efficient use of the robot's energy. This paper presents the experimental validation of a model-free high-order Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) with finite-time convergence in a predefined time. The convergence time is introduced by the simple change of a time-base parameter. The aim is to validate the controller so it can be implemented for cooperative missions where the communication is limited or null. Results showed that the proposed controller can drive the robot to the desired depth and heading trajectories in the predefined time for all the cases, reducing the error by up to 75% and 41% when compared with a PID and the same SMC with asymptotic convergence. The energy consumption was reduced 35% and 50% when compared with those same controllers.

AB The navigation and localization of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in seawater are of the utmost importance for scientific research, petroleum engineering, search and rescue, and military missions concerning the special environment of seawater. However, there is still no general method for AUVs navigation and localization, especially in the featureless seabed. The reported approaches to solving AUVs navigation and localization problems employ an expensive inertial navigation system (INS), with cumulative errors and dead reckoning, and a high-cost long baseline (LBL) in a featureless subsea. In this study, a simultaneous localization and mapping (AMB-SLAM) online algorithm, based on acoustic and magnetic beacons, was proposed. The AMB-SLAM online algorithm is based on multiple randomly distributed beacons of low-frequency magnetic fields and a single fixed acoustic beacon for location and mapping. The experimental results show that the performance of the AMB-SLAM online algorithm has a high robustness. The proposed approach (the AMB-SLAM online algorithm) provides a low-complexity, low-cost, and high-precision online solution to the AUVs navigation and localization problem in featureless seawater environments. The AMB-SLAM online solution could enable AUVs to autonomously explore or autonomously intervene in featureless seawater environments, which would enable AUVs to accomplish fully autonomous survey missions.

AB Data acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) towing a source (1600-3500 Hz) and a horizontal array of hydrophones have been analysed to image discrete, isolated or even a small cluster of scatterers within the sediment, to determine shallow migration paths of hydrocarbons in a mud volcano system of the Malta Plateau. An algorithm based on a semblance function was applied to the acoustic data to highlight scatterers rather than interface reflections. The resulting scatterer map, obtained along the AUV track, generated a pseudo-three-dimensional coverage of the study area, with a horizontal and vertical resolution of roughly 3-5 m and 5-10 m, respectively. This map was combined with high-resolution bathymetric and backscattering seafloor maps obtained from previous explorations. This integrated dataset provides new evidence for the role of fault zones as a preferential path for gas/fluid migration and reveals the intermittent activity of seeping gas. The data show, in particular, that gas bubble slugs, i.e. discontinuous gas columns, rise through Plio-Quaternary sediments along a complex system of conduits terminating at the surface into quiescent mud volcanoes. The gas flux is facilitated by the regional stress field that results in dilatant conditions on the mapped fault zones.

AB We consider underwater multi-modal wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) suitable for applications on submarine surveillance and monitoring, where nodes offload data to a mobile autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) via optical technology, and coordinate using acoustic communication. Sensed data are associated with a value, decaying in time. In this scenario, we address the problem of finding the path of the AUV so that the Value of Information (VoI) of the data delivered to a sink on the surface is maximized. We define a Greedy and Adaptive AUV Path-finding (GAAP) heuristic that drives the AUV to collect data from nodes depending on the VoI of their data. For benchmarking the performance of AUV path-finding heuristics, we define an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that accurately models the considered scenario, deriving a path that drives the AUV to collect and deliver data with the maximum VoI. In our experiments GAAP consistently delivers more than 80 percent of the theoretical maximum VoI determined by the ILP model. We also compare the performance of GAAP with that of other strategies for driving the AUV among sensing nodes, namely, random paths, TSP-based paths and a "lawn mower"-like strategy. Our results show that GAAP always outperforms every other heuristic in terms of delivered VoI, also obtaining higher energy efficiency.

AB The continuing urbanization and corresponding increase in transport demand are putting pressure on the accessibility, safety, sustainability, livability, and efficiency of urbanized regions. Public transport is regarded as a sustainable mode of transport for these regions and therefore transport policies aim to increase its attrac-tiveness. However, public transport is facing last-mile connectivity problems. The application of Autonomous Mobility on-Demand (AMoD) as a feeder service for public transport hubs can potentially improve the first and last-mile trip leg which increases the attractivity of public transport. However, will such a system be financially viable when applied in an urban area? and what kind of operation will lead to the highest system performance? In this research, this question is addressed by proposing a method that connects macro transport modeling and agent-based modeling (ABM). An existing gravity-based travel demand estimation model built in a macro simulation tool is used to predict passenger demand across all the OD pairs of a city. For those OD pairs that can use the AMoD as first /last mile this is modeled using an agent-based rationale to be able to simulate the behavior of passengers and vehicles within that specific area of the city. The simulation model is applied to the case study area of the south of Rotterdam, in The Netherlands, where metro Station Zuidplein and the rail Station Lom-bardijen function as two AMoD hubs. Using the case study, the impact of relocation, ridesharing, and charging strategy is assessed in regards to financial viability. Among other insights, results show that the AMoD service leads to a profit on a typical business day for the operating companies despite the high-quality level of the service (very low average waiting time for a vehicle). If this particular system would not consist of automated vehicles and one would have to pay a salary to drivers, it would not be possible to make a profit on a typical business day. Moreover, results show that activating dynamic ridesharing and using wireless fast chargers at the stations results in the most financially viable operation. Activating automatic relocations results in the most costly operation.

AB The development of intelligent vehicle systems has resulted in an increased need for a high-precision road map. However, conventional road maps that are used for vehicle navigation systems or geographical information systems (GISs) are insufficient to satisfy new requirements of intelligent vehicle systems such as autonomous driving. There are three primary road-map requirements for intelligent vehicle systems: centimeter-level accuracy, storage efficiency, and usability. However, no existing researches have met these three requirements simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a precise and efficient lane-level road-map generation system that conforms to the requirements all together. The proposed map-building process consists of three steps: 1) data acquisition, 2) data processing, and 3) road modeling. The road data acquisition and processing system captures accurate 3-D road geometry data by acquiring data with a mobile 3-D laser scanner. The road geometry data are then refined to extract meta information, and in the road modeling system, the refined data are represented as sets of piecewise polynomials to ensure storage efficiency and usability of the map. The proposed mapping system has been extensively tested and evaluated on a real urban road and highway. The experimental results show that the proposed mapping system outperforms conventional systems in terms of the road-map requirements.

AB In modern security situations, tracking multiple human objects in real-time within challenging urban environments is a critical capability for enhancing situational awareness, minimizing response time, and increasing overall operational effectiveness. Tracking multiple entities enables informed decision-making, risk mitigation, and the safeguarding of civil-military operations to ensure safety and mission success. This paper presents a multi-modal electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) and radio frequency (RF) fused sensing (MEIRFS) platform for real-time human object detection, recognition, classification, and tracking in challenging environments. By utilizing different sensors in a complementary manner, the robustness of the sensing system is enhanced, enabling reliable detection and recognition results across various situations. Specifically designed radar tags and thermal tags can be used to discriminate between friendly and non-friendly objects. The system incorporates deep learning-based image fusion and human object recognition and tracking (HORT) algorithms to ensure accurate situation assessment. After integrating into an all-terrain robot, multiple ground tests were conducted to verify the consistency of the HORT in various environments. The MEIRFS sensor system has been designed to meet the Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) requirements for installation on autonomous ground and aerial vehicles.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation and localization in the complex and changeable marine environment is crucial and challenging. The inaccurate noise covariance matrix may result in significant prediction errors or even filtering divergence for traditional navigation algorithms. Meanwhile, the outliers in sensor observations also have a substantial adverse effect on the AUV positioning accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Improved Interacting Multiple Model-Unscented Kalman Filter (IIMM-UKF) with both adaptivity and robustness for AUV navigation. Firstly, the Variational Bayesian (VB) based UKF algorithm is proposed as adaptive sub-models of IIMM to estimate the time-varying measurement noise covariance adaptively. Secondly, an outliers detector sub-model is proposed to enhance the robustness of IIMM. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is used to regress state pseudo values for each sub-model as estimations of the filtering process when the outliers are detected by the residual x 2 detector. Multiple models work in parallel to achieve high-precision and robust AUV navigation. The performance of the IIMM-UKF algorithm has been evaluated on AUV with simulation and actual experimental data. In sea trials, the average AUV navigation accuracy of the IIMM-UKF is improved by 61.02% compared to EKF, 43.44% compared to UKF, and 35.54% compared to the IMM-UKF.

AB To improve the reliability of the shared steering control system, and weaken the influence of uncertain driver behavior on driving safety, an extended shared steering control system with an authority adaptive allocation model is proposed. The system framework consists of upper-level and lower-level. The upper-level is an adaptive authority allocation model, which is composed of a reference model and an authority dynamic allocation model. The reference authority level can be calculated by the reference model, which is used as the reference of the authority dynamic allocation model. The authority levels of the autonomous controller and driver are gained by the adaptive authority allocation model. The lower level is the human-machine shared steering control, which includes the driver and autonomous controller. Using the authority level obtained by the upper-level, the lower-level can realize the coordinated control of human and machine. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by simulation. The results show that relative to the numerical function model, the proposed approach can effectively weaken the impact of driver misoperation and poor preview time, the trajectory tracking ability and handling stability are improved significantly, and the human-machine conflict and the workload of the controller are weakened.

AB As the research topics in ocean emerge, underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have become ever more relevant. Consequently, challenges arise with the security and privacy of the UASNs. Compared to the active attacks, the characteristics of passive attacks are more difficult to discriminate. Thus, the focus of this study is on the passive attacks in UASNs, where a push-based probabilistic method for source location privacy protection (PP-SLPP) is proposed. The fake packet technology and the multipath technology are utilized in the PP-SLPP scheme to counter the passive attacks, so as to protect the source location privacy in UASNs. Moreover, the Ekman drift current model is employed to simulate the underwater environment. And the mean shift algorithm and the k-means algorithm are adopted in the dynamic layer and static layer of the Ekman drift current model, respectively, to increase the stability of the clusters. Finally, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarm is implemented to collect data in clusters. Through the comparison with existing data collection schemes in UASNs, the simulation results have demonstrated that the PP-SLPP scheme can achieve a longer safety period, with a minor compromise of energy consumption and delay.

AB The accuracy of cooperative localization for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with low precise proprioceptive localization sensors can be improved by using relative location information between individuals and Bayesian filtering. However, when the relative location measurement errors are high, its accuracy will be reduced. Two measurement for rough estimation algorithms under the constraint environment of the cooperative structure are developed in this paper: the first algorithm is based on the underwater acoustic isotropic transmission. And the second algorithm is based on the common observation environment. In the first algorithm, it builds under the assumption that the distance errors calculated from the simultaneous omnidirectional response signals from the same transmitting source have correlated. Similarly, in the second algorithm, the assumption that "common observation environment'' is correlated is made. First, the correlation between the errors is used roughly to estimate the measurement of information. Then, a suitable filter is applied to fuse the rough estimation measurement with dead-reckoning estimation that improves the location estimation accuracy. The final simulation, by changing the AUV formation navigation paths and the sensor observation noises, shows the proposed processing methods have effectiveness and consistency compared to the traditional algorithm.

ID TRAVEL MODE; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; ATTITUDES; CHOICE; HABIT; ISSUES
AB With the goal of understanding autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption and use behavior, numerous behavioral studies and surveys have included variables intended to capture individuals' perceptions of and attitudes toward AVs. However, the selection of questions to measure these psychometric variables appears to be ad hoc and, in many cases, arbitrary. In contrast, this study defines psychometric latent variables (LVs) that are related to the adoption and use of AVs and develops a set of questions to reliably measure them. By considering three psychological concepts (norms, perceptions, and attitudes) and nine qualitative utility constructs that influence individuals' travel behavior, this study defines a comprehensive list of LVs and identifier questions to support their construction. A factor analysis of a nationwide n = 347 sample was used to obtain a minimum set of relevant LVs and questions to measure them. Ultimately, the factor analysis resulted in a final set of nine LVs specified by 44 questions (four or five questions for each LV). The final set of questions may be used by researchers or survey organizations interested in studying future trends of demand and adoption for AVs or other emerging transportation modes. The approach used in this study may also be employed in other contexts to define psychometric variables of interest and the questions needed to reliably measure them.

AB Combination of propeller and rudder is most widely used by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). But the cavitations and noise caused by the revolving blades along with the steering shortage of rudder in special working condition make it inadequate for AUVs which require high speed, high mobility and acoustic stealth performance. A water jet thrust vectoring method is put forward in this paper for AUV's propelling and heading and attitude control. Though this method, reaction thrust of water jet produced by volumetric water pump can be directionally controlled by a vectored nozzle. This approach has advantages of low cavitations, low noise and high mobility. The structure of an AUV equipped with a vectored thruster was presented. Additionally, a 3-DOF parallel manipulator is employed for thrust vector control which is driven by water hydraulic system, and the parallel manipulator is analyzed in kinematics and dynamics. With regard to defects in conventional PID control, an integral separation PID controller was designed for the parallel manipulator. Modeling and simulation of the parallel manipulator was conducted in Simulink and SimMechanics to verify the performance of the thrust vector control system. Finally, analysis of vectored thrust shows superiority and potential for steering of high speed AUVs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A decade of research into electroactive polymer actuators is leading to the exploration of applications. These technologies are not ready to compete with the internal combustion engine and electric motors in high power propulsion systems but are suitable for intermittent or aperiodic applications with moderate cycle life requirements, providing an alternative to solenoids and direct drive electric motors. Polypyrrole, an emerging actuator material, is applied to drive hydrodynamic control surfaces and in particular to change the camber of a foil. The foil is intended for use in the propeller blade of an autonomous underwater vehicle. A scaled prototype is constructed which employs polypyrrole actuators imbedded within the blade itself to vary camber. The kinematics required to generate camber change are demonstrated, with >30degrees deflections of the trailing edge being observed from both bending bilayer and linear actuator designs. Forces developed in still conditions are five times lower than the 3.5 N estimated to be required to implement variable camber. The observed 70 kJ/m(3) polypyrrole work density however is more than sufficient to produce the desired actuation from within the limited blade volume, enabling an application that is not feasible using direct drive electric motors. A key challenge with the polypyrrole actuators is to increase force without sacrificing speed of actuation.

AB One of the greatest difficulties in stereo vision is the appearance of ambiguities when matching similar points from different images. In this article we analyze the effectiveness of using a fusion of multiple baselines and a range finder from a theoretical point of view, focusing on the results of using both prismatic and rotational articulations for baseline generation, and offer a practical case to prove its efficiency on an autonomous vehicle.

AB A swarm of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can provide richer spatial-temporal information than the traditional single-robot system, which can be used for underwater mapping, exploration, target tracking, among others. However, the limitation of AUVs' battery cannot support persistent services, which restricts AUVs' operating range and mission duration. In this paper, a mobile underwater charging solution is developed that can continuously recharge a swarm of AUVs by using a wireless mobile charger. Magnetic induction-based communication and wireless energy transfer are employed. This paper first shows that by using tri-axis coils, reliable wireless communication and wireless energy transfer without coil orientation losses can be obtained. After that, wireless communication, motion control, and wireless energy transfer are jointly designed for a swarm of mission-driven AUVs. In particular, optimal continuous motion controllers are developed for AUVs to avoid intra-swarm collisions and networking protocols are designed to optimally allocate resources for wireless communication and wireless energy transfer. The proposed approach can guide AUVs to their destinations, while maintaining wireless network integrity and maximizing wireless energy transfer efficiency, upon which the constraints on AUVs' batteries can be eliminated and cheaper and smaller AUVs can be employed for various underwater applications.

AB In today's world, control and navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are quite challenging issues. In these fields, obtaining an identified dynamic model of AUV is a vital part. In this paper, a method for parameter estimation of an AUV planar model is proposed, which uses augmented state space technique and Square Root Transformed Unscented Kalman Filter (SR-TUKF) as an estimator. Furthermore, by modeling, misalignment between Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) is estimated, simultaneously. Parameter identification is conducted using data of an AUV, equipped with Gyroscope, DVL and Encoder for measuring control inputs, in a planar maneuver. According to the experimental results, the output of the identified model has matched appropriately to the output of sensors in validation maneuvers. With and without considering the estimated misalignment between IMU-DVL, navigation is performed by fusing inertial navigation system (INS) with DVL. The results show an improvement in the end point error with respect to the travel distance by 53 percent in a maneuver with a distance of 6557 meters. Therefore, the proposed method for estimation of a planar model of AUV and misalignment of sensors has a plausible result, experimentally verified by raw data of a simple maneuver.

AB In traditional automated storage and retrieval (AS/R) systems, the storage and retrieval machine travels simultaneously in the horizontal and vertical directions. The so-called split-platform AS/R (or SP-AS/R) system consists of platforms (or shuttles and lifts) that can move independently in horizontal (shuttles) and vertical (lifts) directions. This paper studies two dual command travel time models for such systems. We formulate a continuous travel time model for an SP-AS/R system with a dedicated lift per rack and another travel time model for an SP-AS/R system with a dedicated lift per job type. Then we analyse the performance of these two models. The two models are validated by computer simulation and give quite accurate results. We show that the optimal cycle time gap with the upper bound derived by an existing literature can be as large as 26%. We find interesting management insights for system implementation: when the shape factor of the rack is approximately less than 1, the policy using a dedicated lift per rack is better; when the shape factor of the rack is approximately more than 1, the policy using a dedicated lift per job type outperforms.

AB On abyssal plains, demersal fish are believed to play an important role in transferring energy across the seafloor and between the pelagic and benthic realms. However, little is known about their spatial distributions, making it difficult to quantify their ecological significance. To address this, we employed an autonomous underwater vehicle to conduct an exceptionally large photographic survey of fish distributions on the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (NE Atlantic, 4850 m water depth) encompassing two spatial scales (1-10 km(2)) on and adjacent to a small abyssal hill (240 m elevation). The spatial distributions of the total fish fauna and that of the two dominant morphotypes (Coryphaenoides sp. 1 and C. profundicolus) appeared to be random, a result contrary to common expectation but consistent with previous predictions for these fishes. We estimated total fish density on the abyssal plain to be 723 individuals km(-2) (95% CI: 601-844). This estimate is higher, and likely more precise, than prior estimates from trawl catch and baited camera techniques (152 and 188 individuals km(-2) respectively). We detected no significant difference in fish density between abyssal hill and plain, nor did we detect any evidence for the existence of fish aggregations at any spatial scale assessed.

AB As an effective path planning approach, Potential Field Method has been widely used for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in underwater probing projects. However, the complexity of the realistic environments (e.g. the three dimensional environments rather than two dimensional environments, and limitations of the sensors in AUVs) have limited most of the current potential field approaches, in which the approaches can only be adapted to theoretic environments such as 2D or static environments. A novel heuristic potential field approach (HPF) incorporating a heuristic obstacle avoidance method is proposed in this paper for AUVs path planning in three dimensional environments which have dynamic targets. The contributions of this paper are: (1) The approach is able to provide solutions for more realistic and difficult conditions (such as three dimensional unknown environments and dynamic targets) rather than hypothetic environments (flat 2D known static environments); (2) The approach results in less computation time while giving better trade-offs among simplicity, far-field accuracy, and computational cost. The performance of the HPF is compared with previous published Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) based methods. They are analyzed in several environments. The performance of the heuristic potential field approach is demonstrated through case studies not only to be effective in obtaining the optimal solution but also to be more efficient in processing time for dynamic path planning.

AB In various studies of attacks on autonomous vehicles (AVs), a phantom attack in which advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) misclassifies a fake object created by an adversary as a real object has been proposed. In this paper, we propose F-GhostBusters, which is an improved version of GhostBusters that detects phantom attacks. The proposed model uses a new feature, i.e, frequency of images. Experimental results show that F-GhostBusters not only improves the detection performance of GhostBusters but also can complement the accuracy against adversarial examples.

AB Anautonomous object moves at a constant speed along the shortest path, while bypassing an ordered collection of pairwise disjoint convex sets. The object is tracked by an observer. The goal of the observer is to find a trajectory of motion along which the object can be tracked at each moment of time and can be followed at a given distance at possibly low speed. Options for the observer's trajectories with an indication of the speed limit are proposed.

AB Vehicular edge computing has emerged as a solution for enabling computation-intensive applications within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), encompassing domains like autonomous driving and augmented reality. Despite notable progress in this domain, the efficient allocation of constrained computational resources to a spectrum of time-critical ITS tasks remains a substantial challenge. We address this challenge by devising an innovative task assignment scheme tailored for vehicles navigating a highway. Given the high speed of vehicles and the limited communication radius of roadside units (RSUs), the dynamic migration of computation tasks among multiple servers becomes imperative. We present a novel approach that formulates the task assignment challenge as a binary nonlinear programming (BNLP) problem, managing the allocation of computation tasks from vehicles to RSUs and a macrocell base station. To tackle the potentially large dimensionality of this optimization problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent regret-matching learning algorithm. Incorporating the method of regret minimization, our proposed algorithm employs a forgetting mechanism that enables a continuous learning process, thereby accommodating the high mobility of vehicle networks. We prove that this algorithm converges towards correlated equilibrium solutions for our BNLP formulation. Extensive simulations, grounded in practical parameter settings, underscore the algorithm's ability to minimize total delay and task processing costs, while ensuring equitable utility distribution among agents.

AB Vehicle and pedestrian perception are key for autonomous vehicles, and camera images are a common part of the sensor suite. This study explored the use of synthetic datasets from the CARLA simulator and computer vision algorithms were trained and evaluated in WAYMO Open, a real-world dataset. An efficient automated pedestrian and vehicle identification and counting has been developed, which enables high-speed identification of target features among many images and can count and output formatted identification results. For 2D object detection was applied the Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Network features combined with a Residual Neural Network 50 (ResNet50) together with a Feature Pyramid Network as the backbone. For monocular depth estimation, the monodepth2 model hybrid with a U-Net image segmentation and ResNet18 as the backbone was the best-evaluated dataset. The best-evaluated model uses the pre-trained weights from Common Objects in Context (COCO) obtaining 55.25 and 59.34 average precision performance metric for vehicles and pedestrians, respectively. For monocular depth estimation the inclusion of synthetic data aided model generalization. Thus, the best model presented a 1.277 absolute average error, and 0.211, 0.408, and 0.593 depth accuracy metrics on thresholds 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The data collection tool, object detection, and monocular depth estimation code are open source1.

AB With the development of Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technology, different information flow topologies (IFTs) have been applied to CAV Ad Hoc Networks. Firstly, from the perspective of the controller, a general model is proposed to directly reflect the actual communication effect on the controller instead of simply abstracting it into the optimal time interval, which is more feasible. Secondly, linear stability analysis is carried out based on the general model where different time delays are considered, and stability criterion is obtained for subsequent analysis. Finally, we compare the three main IFTs through numerical simulations and analyze the difference in stability region, robustness, traffic safety, and Eco-driving between platoon Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) controllers based on different IFTs. It is found that adopting CACCs can notably improve the traffic capacity and traffic safety relative to Manual Vehicle (MV) no matter what IFT is adopted. As for the difference between the three IFTs, predecessor-leader following (PLF) and multiple-predecessor-leader following (MPLF) are significantly superior to predecessor following (PF), while the choice between PLF and MPLF depends on the communication bandwidth. With higher communication bandwidth or fewer communication vehicles, MPLF will be a better option; on the contrary, PLF is more suitable.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation requires accurate positioning information from the environment. Existing underwater navigation paradigms employ active acoustic transponders that assist in this task, but these more complex and costly systems require maintenance and power. This paper presents instead a passive underwater marker made of different horizontally stacked acoustically reflective materials that is cost effective and relatively simple to service. A marker's characteristic acoustic signature can be detected by AUVs as acoustic backscattering upon tag insonification, and hence be used for navigation purposes.

AB Autonomous driving technology faces significant safety challenges due to the lack of a global perspective and the limitations of long-range perception capabilities. It is widely recognized that vehicle-infrastructure cooperation is essential to achieve Level 5 autonomy. Therefore, it is imperative to develop vehicle-road collaboration to enable accurate 3D target detection over a wide range and multiple targets infrastructure. In this paper, we propose using ResNet50+FPN as the backbone network and adding CoTNet and CBAM dual attention mechanisms to extract and encode four levels of image features. In point cloud feature extraction, We divide a point cloud into equally spaced 3D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In multi-mode fusion, we propose a simple and effective multi-mode fusion method based on regional point fusion and regional voxel fusion for multi-mode fusion. Additionally, the VoxelNet architecture is utilized to combine image features and point cloud features. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the DAIR-V2X dataset in 3D and BEV perspectives, and results show a significant improvement in the average precision (AP) of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists in 3D object detection on the infrastructure side, in a wide area with multiple objects, compared to existing 3D object detection algorithms.

ID KALMAN FILTERS; NAVIGATION
AB Fusion of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) for navigation of ground vehicles is an extensively researched topic for military and civilian applications. Micro-electro-mechanical-systems-based inertial measurement units (MEMS-IMU) are being widely used in numerous commercial applications due to their low cost; however, they are characterized by relatively poor accuracy when compared with more expensive counterparts. With a sudden boom in research and development of autonomous navigation technology for consumer vehicles, the need to enhance estimation accuracy and reliability has become critical, while aiming to deliver a cost-effective solution. Optimal fusion of commercially available, low-cost MEMS-IMU and the GPS may provide one such solution. Different variants of the Kalman filter have been proposed and implemented for integration of the GPS and the INS. This paper proposes a framework for the fusion of adaptive Kalman filters, based on Sage-Husa and strong tracking filtering algorithms, implemented on MEMS-IMU and the GPS for the case of a ground vehicle. The error models of the inertial sensors have also been implemented to achieve reliable and accurate estimations. Simulations have been carried out on actual navigation data from a test vehicle. Measurements were obtained using commercially available GPS receiver and MEMS-IMU. The solution was shown to enhance navigation accuracy when compared to conventional Kalman filter.

AB Vision-based autonomous driving is rapidly growing. There are, however, presently no agreed-upon metrics for assessing how well deep neural network (DNN) models perform in driving. To compare novel approaches and architectures to existing ones, some researchers employed a mean error between labeled and predicted values in a test dataset and others presented a new metric that is designed to match their requirements. The discrepancy in the usage of various performance metrics and lack of objective metrics to judge the driving performance were our primary motives for developing a feasible solution. In this study, we propose online performance evaluation metrics index (OPEMI), an integrated metric that can evaluate the driving capabilities of autonomous driving models in various driving scenarios. To evaluate driving performance precisely and objectively, OPEMI incorporates several variables, including driving control stability, driving trajectory stability, journey duration, travel distance, success rate, and speed. To demonstrate the validity of OPEMI, we first confirmed that the prediction accuracy has a weak correlation with driving performance. Then, we have discussed the constraints in the existing driving performance metrics in certain circumstances, and their failure to assess the driving models. Finally, we conducted experiments with four popular DNN models and two in-house models under three different driving scenarios (generic, urban, and racing). The results show that the proposed evaluation metric, OPEMI, realistically displays driving performance and demonstrates its validity in various driving scenarios.

AB As agriculture meets digital technologies, a new frontier of innovation is emerging and creating multiple pathways to a smart farming future. This paper presents a case study of a smart farming innovation originating from a small-to-medium sized enterprise (SME) that designs and manufactures machinery used in broadacre, conservation tillage farming. The innovation, known as DOTT, is an entrepreneur's response to problems in the agriculture industry. Applying the innovation opportunity space (IOS) conceptual framework, this study identified the process of innovation was based on synthesis of tacit knowledge (experience-based knowledge of farming and agribusiness) and codified knowledge (drawing on computer programming). The innovation offers a solution for farming problems, and other firms are incorporating the autonomous functionality into their short-line manufacturing operations through licensing agreements, and early farmer adoption is positive. However, this smart farming IOS is presently an Unstable IOS and there remain some gaps: public policy for safe deployment of autonomous agriculture vehicles is lagging behind the invention and commercialization; the new business models for manufacture and commercialization of high-tech equipment are just emerging, and data ownership and control remain unresolved; and evidence of the value of smart farming technologies to farmers and the larger social system and biosphere remains scant.

AB In this article, we present a middleware protocol, that transmits larger-than-a-frame data samples within application real-time and reliability requirements over a lossy wireless channel. The protocol efficiently deploys an intelligent retransmission control that exploits the extended deadline requirements of a sample for frame-level scheduling. The transmission of such samples is placed in the context of the necessary integration of such external sensor data into the decision-making process of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, we provide parameterization and access rules for communication links in resource-managed scenarios and lay out how to integrate the protocol into the popular DDS middleware. The performance of the parameterized links to satisfy their reliability requirements is studied and compared to error protection protocols in the current software stack. We base the evaluation on an OMNeT++ simulation, whereby an established wireless error model is used. The use case is placed in the context of collaborative sensing in a valet parking environment, where external infrastructure sensor data augments the autonomous vehicle's data processing chain via a lossy wireless link. Thereby, the use case adheres to the underlying safety requirements. Results show that if the protocol's awareness of the application requirements is used for parameterization, guarantees for reliability can be provided that outperform existing solutions.

AB Autonomous vehicles require efficient self-localisation mechanisms and cameras are the most common sensors due to their low cost and rich input. However, the computational intensity of visual localisation varies depending on the environment and requires real-time processing and energy-efficient decision-making. FPGAs provide a solution for prototyping and estimating such energy savings. We propose a distributed solution for implementing a large bio-inspired visual localisation model. The workflow includes (1) an image processing IP that provides pixel information for each visual landmark detected in each captured image, (2) an implementation of N-LOC, a bio-inspired neural architecture, on an FPGA board and (3) a distributed version of N-LOC with evaluation on a single FPGA and a design for use on a multi-FPGA platform. Comparisons with a pure software solution demonstrate that our hardware-based IP implementation yields up to 9x lower latency and 7x higher throughput (frames/second) while maintaining energy efficiency. Our system has a power footprint as low as 2.741 W for the whole system, which is up to 5.5-6x less than what Nvidia Jetson TX2 consumes on average. Our proposed solution offers a promising approach for implementing energy-efficient visual localisation models on FPGA platforms.

AB Rescue assignments strategy are crucial for multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (multi-AUV) systems in three dimensional (3-D) complex underwater environments. Considering the requirements of rescue missions, multi-AUV systems need to be cost-effective, fast-rescuing, and less concerned about the relationship between rescue missions. The real-time rescue plays a vital role in the multi-AUV system with the characteristics mentioned above. In this paper, we propose an efficient Reward acting on Reinforcement Learning and Particle Swarm Optimization (R-RLPSO), to provide a strategy of real-time rescue assignment for the multi-AUV system in the 3-D underwater environment. This strategy consists of the following three parts. Firstly, we present a reward-based real-time rescue assignment algorithm. Secondly, we propose an Attraction Rescue Area containing a Rescue Area. For the waypoints in each Attraction Rescue Area, the reward is calculated by a linear reward function. Thirdly, to speed up the convergence of the R-RLPSO and mark the rescue states of Attraction Rescue Area and rescue area, we develop a Reward Coefficient based on the reward of all Attraction Rescue Areas and Rescue Areas. Finally, simulation results show that the system based on R-RLPSO is more cost-effective and time-saving than that of based on comparison algorithms ISOM and IACO.

AB Many global automotive companies have been putting efforts to reduce traffic accidents by developing advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) as well as autonomous vehicles. Lane detection is essential for both autonomous driving and ADAS because the vehicle must follow the lane. However, existing lane detection algorithms have been struggling in achieving robust performance under real-world road conditions where poor road markings, surrounding obstacles, and guardrails are present. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-lane detection algorithm that is robust to the challenging road conditions. To solve the above problems, we introduce three key technologies. First, an adaptive threshold is applied to extract strong lane features from images with obstacles and barely visible lanes. Next, since erroneous lane features can be extracted, an improved RANdom SAmple Consensus algorithm is introduced by using the feedback from lane edge angles and the curvature of lane history to prevent false lane detection. Finally, the lane detection performance is greatly improved by selecting only the lanes that are verified through the lane classification algorithm. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on our dataset that captures challenging road conditions. The proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art method, showing 3% higher True Positive Rate and 2% lower False Positive Rate performance.

AB CAVs (connected and autonomous vehicles) are developing quickly and changing how people drive. Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) technology is rekindling corporate interest as 5G and 6G technologies take off. The absence of a reliable functional testing approach is one of the main issues with current technology. Currently, testing scenario libraries are created manually by testers, which has the drawback of being scarce and ineffective. Traditional automated generating algorithms provide limited-coverage scenarios that do not account for the influence of sensors. Our contributions to solving these issues are as follows. First, we extract the roads in the research region from OpenStreetMap (OSM), filter them, and annotate them using hierarchical clustering of feature values, which creates a static road library. Second, reinforcement learning is used to model dynamic situations using a partly observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in conjunction with sensor inputs. The creation process can be run concurrently with functional tests. Third, the efficiency of simulation testing is increased by integrating the static road library and the dynamic scenario section to produce a sizable library of test scenarios. This increases the realism and coverage of the library. The experimental results show that the proposed scene construction method is well suited for use in SUMO, VTD and other simulators, and has a 388% improvement in scenario coverage compared to the traditional method.

DE Vehicle motion segmentation; Deep learning; Multiple moving objects;

AB Motion segmentation is important for autonomous robots' activities in dynamic scenes, which has been a challenging problem due to the dual motion caused by the camera and moving objects. The existing methods based on the optical or scene flow are sensitive to the environment, whereas deep learning based methods commonly do not consider geometric constraints. Aiming at a vehicle, as the most common object in outdoor urban dynamic scenes because other objects, such as people, can be almost directly determined as a moving object, this paper proposes an object-level motion segmentation method for multiple moving objects combining geometric methods and deep learning. First, we choose three kinds of learned information, constructing object-level three-dimensional (3D) scene structure. And then, to infer motion segmentation results from learned information, we propose an instance cross-matching method to obtain instance correspondence and a motion segmentation extraction method based on instance reprojection residual to determine whether the objects are moving or not. The proposed approach is simple and direct, and it can obtain vehicle motion segmentation results from the original RGB images without using the optical or scene flow commonly used to extract motion information. Experiments on public motion segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the performance of vehicle motion segmentation and is superior to the most advanced methods in terms of accuracy.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Unravelling submarine channel morphology in the lower Bengal Fan through

AB The Bengal Fan, the largest submarine fan in the world, spanning the whole Bay of Bengal resulted from the India-Asia collision event and subsequent Himalayan orogeny. It is a significant depositional feature formed by the major river systems: the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Previous studies revealed the occurrence of an extensive channel-levee system in the Bengal Fan through various marine geoscientific investigations. In the present study, we have successfully mapped a submarine channel-levee segment in the lower Bengal Fan using hull-mounted multibeam bathymetry data collected for the first time. In addition, we conducted a pioneering study of a submarine channel segment using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) within the identified channel. The identified channel, characterized by moderate sinuosity, maintains a smooth morphology throughout its course, with the channel incision increasing towards the lower course. The microbathymetric observations revealed fine-scale features such as mass wasting, sediment waves and scour/depressions indicating the direct interaction between turbidity currents and the channel floor. The newly identified channel is proposed to result from the channel bifurcation of the previously identified channel W6 described by Curray et al. (2003). This study showcases the importance of near-bottom observations in complex submarine channel-levee systems for a better understanding of the formation processes involved in such systems.

AB Gravity-aided inertial navigation system (GAINS) is an important development in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. An effective path planning algorithm plays an important role in the performance of navigation in long-term underwater missions. By combining the gravity information obtained at each position with the error information from the INS, the posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB) of GAINS is derived in this paper. The PCRB is the estimated lower bound of position variance for navigation along the planned trajectory. And the sum of PCRB is used as the minimum cost from the initial state to the current state in the state space, and the position error prediction variance of inertial navigation system (INS) is used as the minimum estimated cost of the path from the current state to the goal state in the A* algorithm. Thus, a path planning method with optimal navigation accuracy is proposed. According to simulation results, traveling along the path planned by the proposed method can rapidly improve the positioning accuracy while consuming just slightly more distance. Even when measuring noise changes, the planned path can still maintain optimal positioning accuracy, and high positioning accuracy is possible for any trajectory located within a certain range of the planned path.

AB The Internet of underwater things (IoUT) is envisioned to be an essential part of maritime activities. Given the IoUT devices' wide-area distribution and constrained transmit power, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely adopted for collecting and forwarding the data sensed by IoUT devices to the surface-stations. In order to accommodate the diverse requirements of IoUT applications, it is imperative to conceive a multi-tier underwater computing (MTUC) framework by carefully harnessing both the computing and the communications as well as the storage resources of both the surface-station and of the AUVs as well as of the IoUT devices. Furthermore, to meet the stringent energy constraints of the IoUT devices and to reduce the operating cost of the MTUC framework, a joint environment-aware AUV trajectory design and resource management problem is formulated, which is a high-dimensional NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we first transform the problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it with the aid of the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our scheme.

AB As the demand for ocean exploration increases, studies are being actively conducted on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that can efficiently perform various missions. To successfully perform long-term, wide-ranging missions, it is necessary to apply fault diagnosis technology to AUVs. In this study, a system that can monitor the health of in situ AUV thrusters using a convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed. As input data, an acoustic signal that comprehensively contains the mechanical and hydrodynamic information of the AUV thruster was adopted. The acoustic signal was pre-processed into two-dimensional data through continuous wavelet transform. The neural network was trained with three different pre-processing methods and the accuracy was compared. The decibel scale was more effective than the linear scale, and the normalized decibel scale was more effective than the decibel scale. Through tests on off-training conditions that deviate from the neural network learning condition, the developed system properly recognized the distribution characteristics of noise sources even when the operating speed and the thruster rotation speed changed, and correctly diagnosed the state of the thruster. These results showed that the acoustic signal-based CNN can be effectively used for monitoring the health of the AUV's thrusters.

AB One of the biggest challenges in autonomous vehicles is processing massive data in real-time and task reliable decisions on time. In order to process data in real-time, the onboard unit is allocated with additional resources, which makes it more complex and consumes much power. To overcome this, an energy harvesting scheme (EH) along with offloading of tasks is proposed. The main motivation of autonomous vehicle is to avoid unnecessary accidents caused by negligence and human error. In this paper, allocation of the tasks between onboard unit and server unit utilizes the resources efficiently, and a novel task allocation scheme for allocating tasks between onboard unit and server unit is proposed. The decision of offloading, the processing unit frequencies and the corresponding power transmitted is computed using the proposed Harvest Energy Residue algorithm. This is a critical feature that enables reliable communication and produces a greater efficiency in IoT than the existing one. These decisions depend on direct data obtained, not on the distributed values of the channel, task details, and the EH process. The model is analyzed for EH and different allocation modes over the entire duration of the task. The results are simulated and shows that there is an improvement in the ratio of offloading computation tasks.

AB In real-world driving scenarios, the model mismatch can severely impair the robustness of the tracking system controlled by Model Predictive Control (MPC). Tube-based MPC (TMPC) addresses this problem by keeping the model mismatch error in an invariant tube. The TMPC algorithms, however, cannot deal with state-dependent uncertainty since TMPC relies on the fixed tubes. This paper presents a practical algorithm for improving the capability of TMPC to handle multiplicative uncertainty. Firstly, this algorithm adopts a Homothetic Tube-based MPC (HTMPC) framework to optimize the system's future trajectory and tube geometry simultaneously, which dynamically resizes tubes according to uncertainty and the system's current state. Secondly, this algorithm provides both the feasible formulation of the tube and the homothetic factor with low computational complexity. Thirdly, we aim to systematically evaluate the algorithm's robustness by the simulations of different scenarios where the system parameters and the measurement noises might change over time. We have conducted and analyzed the Monte-Carlo simulations to compare the robustness and tracking capability of the proposed algorithm and other control algorithms. The comparative analysis shows that the HTMPC algorithm provides a higher level of performance than MPC and TMPC, and it performs closely to the robust controller based on the immersion and invariance (I & I) principle.

AB This paper investigates the problem of trajectory tracking control for a X rudder autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subjects to nonlinearities, uncertainties, and complex actuator dynamics. Under an adaptive energy efficient tracking control scheme, the trajectory tracking problem is decomposed into kinematics and dynamics control. In kinematics control loop, an improved line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is proposed with fuzzy based look-ahead distance optimization mechanism, and feedback kinematics control law is designed utilizing Lyapunov method. The dynamics control loop is divided into two subsystems, namely surge tracking and course tracking. Adaptive chattering-free terminal sliding mode control is employed to improve the tracking performance and converging rate, which introduces fuzzy based parameter optimization method to tackle the chattering problem, and robustness to unknown disturbances is addressed by disturbance observers. The influence of complex actuator dynamics is fully considered, where an energy-efficient rudder allocation method is proposed to deal with the multi-objective optimization problem with multi-constraints, including rudder saturations, rolling restriction, etc., and radial-basis-function neural network (RBFNN) based compensator is utilized to deal with the propeller saturation problem. Finally, plenty of comparative numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The pulse induction-based detection method for subsea ferromagnetic lines detection, transient and controlled-source electromagnetic systems in marine geological fields under the category of active detection approach, are reviewed. According to the classical applications on subsea cable-like target inspection, the passive detection approach is detailed classified as crisscrossing detection and along-tracking detection, which are characterised by different trajectories of detection vehicles. Finally, the paper discusses the marine electromagnetic detection techniques in general and highlights challenges that need to be addressed in developing detection vehicles with lower electromagnetic noises and advanced autonomy on carrying out detection missions.

AB As the general mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme cannot adequately handle the emergency communication requirements in vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular edge computing networks (VECNs) are envisioned as the reliable and cost-efficient paradigm for the mobility and flexibility of UAVs. UAVs can perform as the temporary base stations to provide edge services for road vehicles with heavy traffic. However, it takes a long time and huge energy consumption for the UAV to fly from the stay charging station to the mission areas disorderly. In this paper, we design a pre-dispatch UAV-assisted VECNs system to cope with the demand of vehicles in multiple traffic jams. We propose an optimal UAV flight trajectory algorithm based on the traffic situation awareness. The cloud computing center (CCC) server predicts the real-time traffic conditions, and assigns UAVs to different mission areas periodically. Then, a flight trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize the cost of UAVs, while both the UAV flying and turning energy costs are mainly considered. In addition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning(DRL)-based energy efficiency autonomous deployment strategy, to obtain the optimal hovering position of UAV at each assigned mission area. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can obtain an optimal flight path and deployment of UAV with lower energy consumption.

AB Roll stability is a major concern in the path tracking process of intelligent heavy vehicles in emergency steering maneuvers. Due to the coupling of lateral and roll motions of heavy vehicle, steering actions for path tracking may come into conflict with that for roll stability. In this paper, a hierarchical adaptive control framework composed of a supervisor, an upper controller and a lower controller is developed to mediate conflicting objectives of path tracking and roll stability via steering control. In the supervisor, path tracking control mode or cooperative control mode of path tracking and roll stability is determined by the predicted rollover index, and a weight function is introduced to balance the control objectives of path tracking and roll stability in cooperative control mode. Then, in order to achieve multi-objective real-time optimization, model predictive control with varying optimization weights is used in the upper controller to calculate the desired front steer angle. The lower controller which integrates the real electrically assisted hydraulic steering system based on Proportional-Integral-Derivative control is designed to control steering wheel angle. Simulation and hardware-in-loop implementation results in double lane change scenario show that the proposed hierarchical adaptive control framework can enhance roll stability in emergency steering maneuvers while keeping the accuracy of path tracking for intelligent heavy vehicle within an acceptable range.

AB Underwater hyperspectral imaging is a relatively new method for characterizing seafloor composition. To date, it has been deployed from moving underwater vehicles, such as remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles. While moving vehicles allow relatively rapid surveying of several 10-1000 m(2), they are subjected to short-term variations in vehicle attitude that often compromise image acquisition and quality. In this study, we tested a stationary platform that was landed on the seabed and used an underwater hyperspectral imager (UHI) on a vertical swinging bracket. The imaged seafloor areas have dimensions of 2.3 m x 1 m and are characterized by very stable UHI data of high spatial resolution. The study area was the Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse hydrothermal field at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (26 degrees N) in water depths of 3530-3660 m. UHI data were acquired a 12 stations on an active and an inactive hydrothermal sulfide mound. Based on supervised classification, 24 spectrally different seafloor materials were detected, including hydrothermal and non-hydrothermal materials, and benthic fauna. The results show that the UHI data are able to spectrally distinguish different types of surface materials and benthic fauna in hydrothermal areas, and may therefore represent a promising tool for high-resolution seafloor exploration in potential future deep-sea mining areas.

AB This paper describes a drive controller designed to improve the lateral vehicle stability and maneuverability of a 6-wheel drive / 6-wheel steering (6WD/6WS) vehicle. The drive controller consists of upper and lower level controllers. The upper level controller is based on sliding control theory and determines both front and middle steering angle, additional net yaw moment, and longitudinal net force according to the reference velocity and steering angle of a manual drive, remotely controlled, autonomous controller. The lower level controller takes the desired longitudinal net force, yaw moment, and tire force information as inputs and determines the additional front steering angle and distributed longitudinal tire force on each wheel. This controller is based on optimal distribution control and takes into consideration the friction circle related to the vertical tire force and friction coefficient acting on the road and tire. Distributed longitudinal/lateral tire forces are determined as proportion to the size of the friction circle according to changes in driving conditions. The response of the 6WD/6WS vehicle implemented with this drive controller has been evaluated via computer simulations conducted using the Matlab/Simulink dynamic model. Computer simulations of an open loop under turning conditions and a closed-loop driver model subjected to double lane change have been conducted to demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed drive controller over that of a conventional DYC.

AB Most research in vehicle automation has mainly focused on the safety aspect with only limited studies focusing on occupants' discomfort. To facilitate their rapid uptake and penetration, autonomous vehicles (AVs) should ensure that occupants are both safe and comfortable. Recent research, however, revealed that people felt uncomfortable when AVs braked. This may be caused by the robotlike braking performance. Existing studies on drivers' braking behavior investigated data from either controlled experiments or driving simulators. There is a dearth of research on braking behavior in normal driving. The objective of the study was to examine drivers' braking behaviors by exploiting naturalistic driving data from the Pan-European TeleFOT project (Field Operational Tests of Aftermarket and Nomadic Devices in Vehicles). On a fixed route of 16.5 km, 16 drivers were asked to drive an instrumented vehicle. About 11 million observations were analyzed to identify the profile, value, and duration of deceleration events. Since deceleration events are nested within trips and trips within drivers, multilevel mixed-effects linear models were employed to develop relationships between deceleration value and duration and the factors influencing them. Results indicate that the most-used profile of the deceleration behavior follows a hard braking at the beginning when detecting a danger and then becomes smoother. Furthermore, the results suggest that the speed, reason for braking, and deceleration profile mostly affect the deceleration events. Findings from this study should be considered in examining the braking behavior of AVs.

ID MODEL
AB In a recent work (Dai et al., 2021) we proposed a multi-agent computational framework in which each agent's driving policy at micro-level is derived by maximizing its own utility function. Here we tackle the inverse problem of calibrating the utility parameters using observed vehicle trajectory data. Our starting point is to cast the state evolution as a state space model where driver's decision is treated as the control input. Then the preference calibration can be achieved with the maximum likelihood estimation technique of the associated Kalman filter. We explicitly illustrate our approach using the vehicle trajectory data from the Sugiyama experiment. Not only the estimated state filter can fit the observed data well for each individual vehicle, the inferred utility functions can also reproduce quantitatively similar pattern of the observed collective traffic pattern. Because our forward model treats driving decision process, which is intrinsically dynamic with multi-agent interactions, as a sequence of independent static optimization problems contingent on the state with a finite look ahead anticipation, we are able to sidestep solving interacting dynamic inversion problems. Consequently, our approach can be made very efficient computationally. We further demonstrate how the calibrated model can be used to gain insights on human driving behaviors via counterfactual simulations. A number of variations of the modeling setting show that our approach is robust and intuitively generalizable to similar driving contexts.

AB To realize fully functioning inland waterway communications, portable and affordable unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have become increasingly significant in wireless inland ship networks. However, USVs are struggling in handling resource-intensive services due to the limited battery and CPU resources. In addition, the power of signal transmitted between USVs and the shore base stations suffers from considerable attenuation. In this paper, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless inland ship mobile edge computing (MEC) network architecture is proposed to support USVs' communication and computation. The minimization of network energy consumption is formulated under a number of QoS requirements. To achieve an efficient solution to the formulated challenging problem, a low-complexity enhanced block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed and thus the original optimization problem can be divided into a list of sub-problems. The extensive results verify the effectiveness of jointly considering USVs' offloading decisions, USVs' transmission power, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and IRS phase shift-vector design for energy efficiency in a spare wireless inland ship MEC network and show that the proposed algorithm can decrease energy consumption by approximately 75% compared to a baseline algorithm without optimization design. Also, the network performance under different IRS elements and accuracy parameters are investigated.

AB Progress in sensors, controllers and mechatronics devices and the development of (semi-) autonomous systems that can travel safely on uneven terrain and perform many operations has encouraged research interest in the use of robotics for agriculture and forestry in hilly and mountainous terrains. Here, the main mobile configurations that are likely to be used for robotic platforms as implement-carriers (3-wheeled, conventional/articulated 4-wheeled, tracked) were reviewed and discussed in terms of their suitability for agricultural operations and their stability. A numerical index accounting for the lateral stability of a vehicle, the roll stability index, was used to indicate the in-field working capacity of these platforms during side-slope operations. Assuming the same overall dimensions for all the configurations, the 3-wheel configuration, although very simple and agile, was seen as being the least stable, while a tracked vehicle was the most stable, although it had some important drawbacks when used in an agricultural context. This drawbacks included increased soil erosion and landslides caused by its tracks especially in the areas involving turning manoeuvres. The articulated system was found to be the most suitable for uneven and side-slope terrains because of its optimal steering capacity, agility and good stability. It was found to reach a critical stability angle close to the 4-wheel vehicle. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mobile robots, including ground robots, underwater robots, and unmanned aerial vehicles, play an increasingly important role in people's work and lives. Path planning and obstacle avoidance are the core technologies for achieving autonomy in mobile robots, and they will determine the application prospects of mobile robots. This paper introduces path planning and obstacle avoidance methods for mobile robots to provide a reference for researchers in this field. In addition, it comprehensively summarizes the recent progress and breakthroughs of mobile robots in the field of path planning and discusses future directions worthy of research in this field. We focus on the path planning algorithm of a mobile robot. We divide the path planning methods of mobile robots into the following categories: graph-based search, heuristic intelligence, local obstacle avoidance, artificial intelligence, sampling-based, planner-based, constraint problem satisfaction-based, and other algorithms. In addition, we review a path planning algorithm for multi-robot systems and different robots. We describe the basic principles of each method and highlight the most relevant studies. We also provide an in-depth discussion and comparison of path planning algorithms. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this field that are worth studying in the future.

AB Accurate and timely monitoring is imperative to the resilience of forests for economic growth and climate regulation. In the UK, forest management depends on citizen science to perform tedious and time-consuming data collection tasks. In this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a light sensor and positioning capabilities is deployed to perform aerial surveying and to observe a series of forest health indicators (FHIs) which are inaccessible from the ground. However, many FHIs such as burrows and deadwood can only be observed from under the tree canopy. Hence, we take the initiative of employing a quadruped robot with an integrated camera as well as an external sensing platform (ESP) equipped with light and infrared cameras, computing, communication and power modules to observe these FHIs from the ground. The forest-monitoring time can be extended by reducing computation and conserving energy. Therefore, we analysed different versions of the YOLO object-detection algorithm in terms of accuracy, deployment and usability by the EXP to accomplish an extensive low-latency detection. In addition, we constructed a series of new datasets to train the YOLOv5x and YOLOv5s for recognising FHIs. Our results reveal that YOLOv5s is lightweight and easy to train for FHI detection while performing close to real-time, cost-effective and autonomous forest monitoring.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is expected to play a prominent role for privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) in autonomous vehicles. FL involves the collaborative training of a single ML model among edge devices on their distributed datasets while keeping data locally. While FL requires less communication compared to classical distributed learning, it remains hard to scale for large models. In vehicular networks, FL must be adapted to the limited communication resources, the mobility of the edge nodes, and the statistical heterogeneity of data distributions. Indeed, a judicious utilization of the communication resources alongside new perceptive learning-oriented methods are vital. To this end, we propose a new architecture for vehicular FL and corresponding learning and scheduling processes. The architecture utilizes vehicular-to-vehicular(V2V) resources to bypass the communication bottleneck where clusters of vehicles train models simultaneously and only the aggregate of each cluster is sent to the multi-access edge (MEC) server. The cluster formation is adapted for single and multi-task learning, and takes into account both communication and learning aspects. We show through simulations that the proposed process is capable of improving the learning accuracy in several non-independent and-identically-distributed (non-i.i.d) and unbalanced datasets distributions, under mobility constraints, in comparison to standard FL.

AB In order to realize the autonomous collision avoidance of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), an intelligent hybrid collision avoidance algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed. First, the navigation situation model of the USV is designed, the geometric model of the encounter between two ships is established based on navigation practice. According to static and dynamic obstacles, hybrid risk assessment and collision avoidance model are proposed, the risk factor is calculated. Then, for static obstacles, the collision cone is introduced, for dynamic ships, the COLREGS is observed, the encounter situation is quantified into five types. Collision avoidance strategy is formulated. Finally, the state, action, reward function and network structure are designed. Aiming at the problem of low utilization for samples in random sampling, this paper improves the original sampling mechanism of DDPG, and the priority sampling mechanism with cumulative pruning is proposed in this paper. Simulation experiments are carried out in several typical encounter scenarios. The results show that this algorithm can accurately judge the encounter situation, give reasonable collision avoidance actions, and realize effective collision avoidance in a complex environment with dynamic and static obstacles. The research can provide theoretical basis and method reference for autonomous navigation of USVs.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are abundantly becoming a part of society, which is a trend that is expected to grow even further. The quadrotor is one of the drone technologies that is applicable in many sectors and in both military and civilian activities, with some applications requiring autonomous flight. However, stability, path planning, and control remain significant challenges in autonomous quadrotor flights. Traditional control algorithms, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID), have deficiencies, especially in tuning. Recently, machine learning has received great attention in flying UAVs to desired positions autonomously. In this work, we configure the quadrotor to fly autonomously by using agents (the machine learning schemes being used to fly the quadrotor autonomously) to learn about the virtual physical environment. The quadrotor will fly from an initial to a desired position. When the agent brings the quadrotor closer to the desired position, it is rewarded; otherwise, it is punished. Two reinforcement learning models, Q-learning and SARSA, and a deep learning deep Q-network network are used as agents. The simulation is conducted by integrating the robot operating system (ROS) and Gazebo, which allowed for the implementation of the learning algorithms and the physical environment, respectively. The result has shown that the Deep Q-network network with Adadelta optimizer is the best setting to fly the quadrotor from the initial to desired position.

AB Investigation, conservation, and exploitation of seas require platforms capable of accomplishing a wide variety of missions in harsh environments with restricted human intervention for long periods of time. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are excellent tools for carrying out these missions due to their versatility and ability to access remote sites. However, despite the improvement of their capabilities, their development is not devoid of challenges. Endurance, among others, such as underwater communications or autonomy, is still a pending subject. Current battery-based solutions do not offer sufficient endurance and innovative power plants with higher energy content are needed. This work studies the advantages, in terms of endurance, of using a power plant based on Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) to power AUVs. In order to accomplish this, a multi-objective optimization tool that makes use of a genetic algorithm was developed. This tool allows quick preliminary design of AUVs with a DMFC-based power plant, complying with a user-defined payload, operation profile, and restrictions. Six designs based on a real AUV model were studied, and endurance values up to 2 times longer than the corresponding reference AUV were obtained. These results support the benefits of using DMFCs to power AUVs to increase their endurance.

AB The towing system has a wide range of applications including aircraft launch, aerial refueling, underwater docking, and submarine topography detection. Based on aerial refueling technology, an underwater towing system for recovering an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is designed in this paper, which consists of one steel rod, one cable and one stable wing. First, the mechanical structure of the towing system is introduced and three steel rod models are selected. Next, the stability of the towing system is analyzed, and the numerical simulation software Star-CCM is used to study the influence of different shapes, velocities, and installation angles on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the steel rod. After the force analysis of the steel rod and the cable, the deflection of the steel rod and the vibration of the cable are studied. Through the analysis of the towing system, when the hydrodynamic center point F is located behind the center of gravity G, the towing system is more stable, the drag and lateral force of model c are smaller than that of model a and model b, and the relationship between the drag of the steel rod with the installation angle is obtained. Some other very significant conclusions are also drawn which guide the design of the towing system.

AB Collaborative exploration, sensing and communication in previously unknown environments with high network latency, such as outer space, battlefields and disaster hit areas are promising in multi-agent applications. When disasters such as large fires or natural disasters occur, previously established networks might be destroyed or incapacitated. In these cases, multiple autonomous mobile robots (AMR) or autonomous unmanned ground vehicles carrying wireless devices and/or thermal sensors can be deployed to create an end-to-end communication and sensing coverage to support rescue efforts or access the severity of damage. However, a fundamental problem is how to rapidly deploy these mobile agents in such complex and dynamic environments. The uncertainties introduced by the operational environment and wide range of scheduling problem have made solving them as a whole challenging. In this paper, we present an efficient decentralized approach for practical mobile agents deployment in unknown, burnt or disaster hit areas. Specifically, we propose an approach that combines methods from Artificial Immune System (AIS) with special token messages passing for a team of interconnected AMR to decide who, when and how to act during deployment process. A distributed scheme is adopted, where each AMR makes its movement decisions based on its local observation and a special token it receives from its neighbors. Empirical evidence of robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation.

AB An underwater magnetic induction positioning and communication system and an energy-efficient distributed control algorithm for underwater base stations are proposed in this paper. The positioning and communication system consists of a number of base stations and an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with three-axis source coils respectively. The AUV receives this signal and based on its amplitude and phase information is able to locate the AUV and communicate with the base station. Due to the short positioning distance of magnetic induction positioning technology, a large number of base stations need to be installed underwater, which puts high demands on the control of the base stations. In this paper, an energy-efficient distributed control algorithm for underwater base stations is proposed to enable the AUV to meet the operational requirements while minimizing the total energy consumption of the base station. According to the simulation results, the design solves the problem that traditional underwater positioning and communication equipment cannot work stably for long periods of time in a high radiated environment, with a positioning error of no more than 10 cm within a preset operating range, and the algorithm proposed in this paper is able to reduce energy wastage by about 20%.

AB Pockmarks are sea-floor depressions that form when gas or liquid escapes from underlying sediments. Although they are a common feature of both glaciated and lower-latitude continental shelves, pockmarks have not been reported previously from the north-east Antarctic Peninsula margin. Here we use high-resolution geophysical data acquired using autonomous underwater vehicles to map > 240 pockmarks in three locations along the north-east Antarctic Peninsula shelf. The pockmarks are 0.4-45 m wide and 0.1-2.5 m deep, encompassing both smaller unit-pockmarks and larger normal-pockmarks. The high resolution of our data enables the identification of subdued features associated with the pockmarks, including acoustic flares within the water column, ejecta rims, intra-pockmark blocks and possibly even biological structures. The overprinting of subglacial and ice-marginal landforms by the pockmarks constrains their timing of formation to the last similar to 11 ka. The high density of pockmarks within the surveyed areas, together with geophysical evidence for the active seepage of gas to the sea floor, suggests that the expulsion of subsurface fluids is a widespread process on the north-east Antarctic Peninsula shelf that could have important implications for benthic biodiversity and the global carbon cycle.

AB This study proposes the development of an underwater object-tracking control system through an image-processing technique. It is used for the close-range recognition and dynamic tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with an auxiliary light source for image processing. The image-processing technique includes color space conversion, target and background separation with binarization, noise removal with image filters, and image morphology. The image-recognition results become more complete through the aforementioned process. After the image information is obtained for the underwater object, the image area and coordinates are further adopted as the input values of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to calculate the rudder angle of the servomotor, and the propeller revolution speed is defined using the image information. The aforementioned experiments were all conducted in a stability water tank. Subsequently, the FLC was combined with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for further dynamic experiments in a towing tank. Specifically, the EKF predicts new coordinates according to the original coordinates of an object to resolve data insufficiency. Consequently, several tests with moving speeds from 0.2 m/s to 0.8 m/s were analyzed to observe the changes in the rudder angles and the sensitivity of the propeller revolution speed.

AB The growing adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for tasks such as eCommerce, aerial surveillance, and environmental monitoring introduces the need for new safety mechanisms in an increasingly cluttered airspace. In our work we thus emphasize safety issues that emerge at the intersection of infrastructures responsible for controlling the airspace, and the diverse UAVs operating in their space. We build on safety assurance cases (SAC) - a state-of-the-art solution for reasoning about safety - and propose a novel approach based on interlocking SACs. The infrastructure safety case (ISAC) specifies assumptions upon UAV behavior, while each UAV demonstrates compliance to the ISAC by presenting its own (pluggable) safety case (pSAC) which connects to the ISAC through a set of interlock points. To collect information on each UAV we enforce a "trust but monitor" policy, supported by runtime monitoring and an underlying reputation model. We evaluate our approach in three ways: first by developing ISACs for two UAV infrastructures, second by running simulations to evaluate end-to-end effectiveness, and finally via an outdoor field-study with physical UAVs. The results show that interlocking SACs can be effective for identifying, specifying, and monitoring safety-related constraints upon UAVs flying in a controlled airspace.

AB Locating an inspection robot is an essential task for inspection missions and spatial data acquisition. Giving a spatial reference to measurements, especially those concerning environmental parameters, e.g., gas concentrations may make them more valuable by enabling more insightful analyses. Thus, an accurate estimation of sensor position and orientation is a significant topic in mobile measurement systems used in robotics, remote sensing, or autonomous vehicles. Those systems often work in urban or underground conditions, which are lowering or disabling the possibility of using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) for this purpose. Alternative solutions vary significantly in sensor configuration requirements, positioning accuracy, and computational complexity. The selection of the optimal solution is difficult. The focus here is put on the assessment, using the criterion of the positioning accuracy of the mobile robot with no use of GNSS signals. Automated geodetic surveying equipment is utilized for acquiring precise ground truth data of the robot's movement. The results obtained, with the use of several methods, compared: Wheel odometry, inertial measurement-based dead-reckoning, visual odometry, and trilateration of ultra-wideband signals. The suitability, pros, and cons of each method are discussed in the context of their application in autonomous robotic systems, operating in an underground mine environment.

AB Species distribution models (SDMs) are often empirically developed on spatially and temporally biased samples and then applied over much larger spatial scales to test ecological hypotheses or to inform management. Underlying this approach is the assumption that the statistical relationships between species observations and environmental predictors are applicable to other locations and times. However, testing and quantifying the transferability of these models to new locations and times can be a challenge for resource managers because of the technical difficulty in obtaining species observations in new locations in a dynamic environment. Here, we apply two SDMs developed in the Mid-Atlantic Bight for Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrhynchus oxyrhynchus) to the South Atlantic Bight and use an autonomous underwater vehicle to test model predictions. We compare Atlantic sturgeon occurrence to two SDMs: one associating sturgeon occurrence with simple seascapes and one developed through coupling occurrences with environmental predictors in a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). Our analysis showed that the seascape model was transferable across these disparate regions; however, the complex GAMM was not. The association of the imperilled Atlantic sturgeon with simple seascapes allows managers to easily integrate this remotely sensed dynamic oceanographic product into future ecosystem-based management strategies.

AB In this paper, we consider the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) trajectory planning problem under the influence of a realistic 3D current as simulated by an ocean general circulation model (OGCM). Attention is focused on the case of a deterministic steady OGCM field, which is used to specify data for both the ocean current and for ocean bathymetry. A general framework for optimal trajectory planning is developed for this setting, accounting for the 3D ocean current and for static obstacle avoidance constraints. A nonlinear programming approach is used for this purpose, which leads to a low complexity discrete-time model that can be efficiently solved. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model, we consider the optimal time trajectory planning of an AUV operating in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, with velocity, and bathymetric data provided by an eddy-resolving MITgcm. Different optimal-time trajectory planning scenarios are implemented to demonstrate the capabilities of the model to identify trajectories that adapt to favorable and adverse currents and to avoid obstacles corresponding to a complex bathymetry environment. The simulations are also used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, and to illustrate the application of advanced visualization tools to interpret the model predictions.

AB In this paper we are interested in autonomous vehicles that can automatically develop terrain classifiers without human interaction or feedback. A key issue is the clustering of time-series data collected by the sensors of a ground-based vehicle moving over several terrain surfaces (e.g. concrete or soil). In this context, we present a novel off-line windowless clustering algorithm that exploits time-dependency between samples. In terrain coverage, sets of sensory measurements are returned that are spatially, and hence temporally, correlated. Our algorithm works by finding a set of parameter values for a user-specified classifier that minimize a cost function. This cost function is related to the change in classifier probability estimates over time. The main advantage over other existing methods is its ability to cluster data for fast-switching systems that either have high process or observation noise, or complex distributions that cannot be properly characterized within the time interval that the system stays in a single state. The algorithm was evaluated using three different classifiers (linear separator, mixture of Gaussians and k-Nearest Neighbor), over both synthetic data sets and two different mobile robotic platforms, with success. Comparisons are provided against a window-based algorithm and against a hidden Markov model trained with Expectation-Maximization, with positive results.

AB Digital Twin is an emerging technology that replicates real-world entities into a digital space. It has attracted increasing attention in the transportation field and many researchers are exploring its future applications in the development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technologies. Connected vehicles (CVs) and pedestrians are among the major traffic participants in ITS. However, the usage of Digital Twin in research involving both CV and pedestrian remains largely unexplored. In this study, a Digital Twin framework for CV and pedestrian in-the-loop simulation is proposed. The proposed framework consists of the physical world, the digital world, and data transmission in between. The features for the entities (CV and pedestrian) that need digital twining are divided into external state and internal state, and the attributes in each state are described. We also demonstrate a sample architecture under the proposed Digital Twin framework, which is based on Carla-Sumo Co-simulation and Cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE). A case study that investigates Vehicle-Pedestrian (V2P) warning system is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the presented architecture. The proposed framework is expected to provide guidance to the future Digital Twin research, and the architecture we build can serve as the testbed for further research and development of ITS applications on CV and pedestrians.

AB A critical survey has been conducted on high energy-efficient bidirectional converters, various topologies that effectively meet the automated vehicle requirements, and 24 GHz/77 GHz low-profile antennas (for automotive radar applications). The present survey has been identified into two parts on the current topic of study as perspectives and challenges. Part 1 of this survey covers energy-efficient power electronic convertor topologies and condition monitoring aspects of convertors to enhance the lifespan and improve performance. Condition-monitoring issues concerning the abnormalities of electrical components, high switching frequencies, electromagnetic interference, leakage currents, and unwanted joint ruptures have also been emphasized. It is observed that composite converters are proficient for automated hybrid electric vehicles due to fast dynamic response and reduced component count. Importantly, electrical component failures in power electronic converters are most common and need attention for the effective operation of the bidirectional converters. Hence, condition monitoring implementation schemes have also been summarized. Part 2 of this survey focuses on 24 and 77 GHz low-profile (microstrip-based) antennas for automotive radar applications, types of antenna structures, feed mechanisms, dielectric material requirements, design techniques, and performance parameters. The discussion in Part 2 also covers feed methodologies, beam scanning concepts, and side-lobe levels on the autonomous vehicle communication activities.

AB Modern infrastructure, such as dense urban areas and underground tunnels, can effectively block all GPS signals, which implies that effective position triangulation will not be achieved. The main problem that is addressed in this project is the design and implementation of an accurate vehicle location system using radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology in combination with GPS and the Global system for Mobile communication (GSM) technology, in order to provide a solution to the limitation discussed above. In essence, autonomous vehicle tracking will be facilitated with the use of RFID technology where GPS signals are non-existent. The design of the system and the results are reflected in this paper. An extensive literature study was done on the field known as the Internet of Things, as well as various topics that covered the integration of independent technology in order to address a specific challenge. The proposed system is then designed and implemented. An RFID transponder was successfully designed and a read range of approximately 31 cm was obtained in the low frequency communication range (125 kHz to 134 kHz). The proposed system was designed, implemented, and field tested and it was found that a vehicle could be accurately located and tracked. It is also found that the antenna size of both the RFID reader unit and RFID transponder plays a critical role in the maximum communication range that can be achieved.

AB Currently, the interest in creating autonomous driving vehicles and progressively more sophisticated active safety systems is growing enormously, being a prevailing importance factor for the end user when choosing between either one or another commercial vehicle model. While four-wheelers are ahead in the adoption of these systems, the development for two-wheelers is beginning to gain importance within the sector. This makes sense, since the vulnerability for the driver is much higher in these vehicles compared to traditional four-wheelers. The particular dynamics and stability that govern the behavior of single-track vehicles (STVs) make the task of designing active control systems, such as Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) systems or active or semi-active suspension systems, particularly challenging. The roll angle can achieve high values, which greatly affects the general behavior of the vehicle. Therefore, it is a magnitude of the utmost importance; however, its accurate measurement or estimation is far from trivial. This work is based on a previous paper, in which a roll angle estimator based on the Kalman filter was presented and tested on an instrumented bicycle. In this work, a further refinement of the method is proposed, and it is tested in more challenging situations using the multibody model of a motorcycle. Moreover, an extension of the method is also presented to improve the way noise is modeled within this Kalman filter.

AB Dynamic stability is critical to achieve the safety of the cars, particularly during emergency maneuvers. Coordinated control algorithms are suggestive of the enhanced safety and stability of a vehicle. Hence, a novel adaptive robust multi-input control framework is developed using the combination of direct yaw moment (DYC) and active front steering (AFS). The dynamics of the steering system mechanism is included for the reliability of the proposed control scheme. The proposed controller is developed according to the approximation capacity of the radial basis function (RBF) neural network system. The adaptation laws are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Additionally, the proposed integrated control paradigm contains a state observer and the sliding surface of the tracking errors converges to the asymptotic stability condition through the design of a smooth exponential reaching law. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is compared to a high-performance optimal robust control technique and open-loop system. In order to assess the robustness of the proposed algorithm, structured and unstructured uncertainties were also incorporated in terms of the parametric uncertainties such as the tire cornering stiffness and cross-wind gust disturbance. The results obtained for different maneuvers reveal that the proposed controller is successful to improve the handling performance and to ensure the stability of the vehicle when compared to the previously reported methods.

AB Automated Vehicles (AVs) have gained substantial attention in recent years as the technology has matured. Researchers and policymakers envision that AV deployment will change transportation, development patterns, and other urban systems. Researchers have examined AVs and their potential impacts with two methods: (1) survey-based studies of AV preferences and (2) simulation-based estimation of secondary impacts of varied AV deployment strategies, such as Shared AVs (SAVs) and Privately-owned AVs (PAVs). While the preference survey literature can inform AV simulation studies, preference study results have so far not been integrated into simulation-based research. This lack of integration stems from the absence of data that measure preferences towards PAVs and SAVs at the neighborhood level. Existing preference studies usually investigate adoption likelihood without collecting appropriate information to link preferences to precise locations or neighborhoods. This study develops a microsimulation approach, incorporating machine learning and population synthesizing, to fill this data gap, leveraging a national AV perception survey (NAVPS) and the latest National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data. The model is applied to San Francisco, CA, and Austin, TX, to test the concept. We validate the proposed model by comparing the spatial distributions of synthesized ride-hailing users and observed ride-hailing trips. High correlations between our synthesized user density and empirical trip distributions in two study areas, to some extent, verify our proposed modeling approach.

AB We consider the problem of partitioning an area in the plane populated by a team of aerial/marine vehicles into a finite collection of non-overlapping sets. The sets of this partition are in an one-to-one correspondence with the vehicles under the following rule: each point in the given set of the partition can be reached by the corresponding vehicle in this set faster than any other vehicle in the presence of a spatiotemporal drift field. Consequently, a Voronoi-like partition results, which encodes the proximity relations between the vehicles and arbitrary points in the plane with respect to the minimum time-to-go. The construction of this Voronoi-like partition is based on its interpretation as the intersection of a forest of the cost (minimum time-to-go) surfaces emanating from each generator with their common lower envelope. The characterization of each cost surface is achieved by means of an efficient expansion scheme of the level sets of the minimum time-to-go function, which utilizes, in turn, the structure of the optimal synthesis of the minimum-time problem without resorting to exhaustive numerical techniques, e.g., fast marching methods. We examine the topological characteristics of the partition by using control/system theoretic concepts and tools. The theoretical developments are illustrated with a number of numerical examples.

AB Possibly the most critical phase of an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) flight is landing. To reduce the risk due to pilot error, autonomous landing systems can be used. Environmental disturbances such as wind shear can jeopardize safe landing, therefore a well-adjusted and robust control system is required to maintain the performance requirements during landing. The paper proposes a loop-shaping-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach for autonomous UAV landings. Instead of conventional MPC plant model augmentation, the input and output weights are designed in the frequency domain to meet the transient and steady-state performance requirements. Then, the H & INFIN; loop shaping design procedure is used to synthesize the state-feedback controller for the shaped plant. This linear state-feedback control law is then used to solve an inverse optimization problem to design the cost function matrices for MPC. The designed MPC inherits the small-signal characteristics of the H & INFIN; controller when constraints are inactive (i.e., perturbation around equilibrium points that keep the system within saturation limits). The H & INFIN; loop shaping synthesis results in an observer plus state feedback structure. This state estimator initializes the MPC problem at each time step. The control law is successfully evaluated in a non-linear simulation environment under moderate and severe wind downburst. It rejects unmeasured disturbances, has good transient performance, provides an excellent stability margin, and enforces input constraints.

AB In order to complete various tasks automatically, robots need to have onboard sensors to gain the ability to move autonomously in complex environments. Here, we propose a combined strategy to achieve the real-time, safe, and smooth autonomous motion of robots in complex environments. The strategy consists of the building of an occupancy grid map of the environment in real time via the binocular system, followed by planning a smooth and safe path based on our proposed new motion-planning algorithm. The binocular system, which is small in size and lightweight, can provide reliable robot position, attitude, and obstacle information, enabling the establishment of an occupancy grid map in real time. Our proposed new algorithm can generate a high-quality path by using the gradient information of the ESDF (Euclidean Signed Distance Functions) value to adjust the waypoints. Compared with the reported motion-planning algorithm, our proposed algorithm possesses two advantages: (i) ensuring the security of the entire path, rather than that of the waypoints; and (ii) presenting a fast calculation method for the ESDF value of the path points, one which avoids the time-consuming construction of the ESDF map of the environment. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can realize the safe and smooth autonomous motion of the robot in a complex environment in real time. Therefore, our proposed approach shows great potential in the application of robotic autonomous motion tasks.

AB CAV platooning technology has received considerable attention, driven by the next generation smart transportation systems. This paper considers nonlinear vehicle dynamics and develops fully distributed optimization based CAV platooning control schemes via the platoon centered MPC approach for a possibly heterogeneous CAV platoon. The nonlinear vehicle dynamics leads to major difficulties in distributed algorithm development and control analysis. Specifically, the underlying MPC optimization problem is nonconvex and densely coupled. Further, the closed loop dynamics becomes a time-varying nonlinear system with non-vanishing external perturbations, making stability analysis rather complicated. To overcome these difficulties, we formulate the underlying MPC optimization problem as a locally coupled, albeit nonconvex, optimization problem and develop a sequential convex programming based fully distributed scheme for a general MPC horizon. Such a scheme can be effectively implemented for real-time computing using operator splitting methods. To analyze the closed loop stability, we apply various tools from global implicit function theorems, stability of linear time-varying systems, and Lyapunov theory for input-to-state stability to show that the closed loop system is locally input-to-state stable uniformly in all small coefficients pertaining to the nonlinear dynamic effects. Numerical tests on a heterogeneous CAV platoon in a real traffic condition illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Vehicles today have many advanced driver assistance control systems that improve vehicle safety and comfort. With the development of more sophisticated vehicle electronic control and autonomous driving technology, the need and effort to estimate road surface conditions is increasing. In this paper, a real-time road surface classification algorithm, based on a deep neural network, is developed using a database collected through an intelligent tire sensor system with a three-axis accelerometer installed inside the tire. Two representative types of network, fully connected neural network (FCNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), are learned with each of the three-axis acceleration sensor signals, and their performances were compared to obtain an optimal learning network result. The learning results show that the road surface type can be classified in real-time with sufficient accuracy when the longitudinal and vertical axis acceleration signals are trained with the CNN. In order to improve classification accuracy, a CNN with multiple input that can simultaneously learn 2-axis or 3-axis acceleration signals is suggested. In addition, by analyzing how the accuracy of the network is affected by number of classes and length of input data, which is related to delay of classification, the appropriate network can be selected according to the application. The proposed real-time road surface classification algorithm is expected to be utilized with various vehicle electronic control systems and makes a contribution to improving vehicle performance.

AB Intelligent vehicles can effivtively improve traffic congestion and mad traffic safety. Adaptive cruise following-control (ACFC) is a vital part of intelligent vehicles. In this paper, a new hierarchical vehicle-following control strategy is presented by synthesizing the variable time headway model, type-2 fit y control, feedforward + fuzzy proportion integration (P1) feed back (F+FPIF) control, and inverse longitudinal dynamics model of vehices. Firstly, a traditional variable time headway model is improved considering the acceleration of the lead ear. Secondly, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2 FLC) is designed for the upper structure of the ACFC system to simulate the driver's operating habits. To reduce the nonlinear influence and improve the tracking accuracy for the desired acceleration, the control strategy of F+FPIF is given for the lower control structure. Thirdly, the lower control method proposed in this paper is compared with the fuzzy Pi control and the traditional method (no lower controller for tracking desired acceleration) separately. Meanwhile, the proportion integration differentiation (PID), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), subsection function control (SFC) and type-1 fuzzy logic control (T1 FLC) are respectively compared with the IT2 FLC in control performance under different scenes. Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of IT2 FLC for the upper structure and F+FPIF control for the lower structure.

AB The development of automated vehicles (AVs) has attracted increasing attention. Understanding public acceptance of AVs and their intention to use them, which are the primary aims of the present study, are especially important considering that increasingly more AVs will be moving on the road in the coming future. A total of 527 participants voluntarily and validly completed a series of questionnaires, including the automated vehicle acceptability scale (AVAS), Big Five Inventory (BFI), and some sociodemographic variables. The results of an internal consistency, reliability, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the two-factor (contextual acceptability and impaired driving) structure of the AVAS. The Chinese public generally has a positive attitude towards AVs. In addition, our results indicate the possibility of the misuse of AVs. More importantly, the results reveal that contextual acceptability partially mediated the effect of agreeableness on the willingness to drive and the willingness to own AVs and fully mediated its effect on the willingness to rent AVs, while contextual acceptability and interest in impaired driving fully mediated the effect of the openness on the willingness to drive, own, and rent AVs. Manufacturers and retailers in the automotive vehicle industry should provide their customers with comprehensive information regarding the principles and limitations behind the system and the responsibility and obligations of the drivers to avoid misuse. Moreover, providing more targeted services according to customers' different personality traits might be a useful sales technique.

AB Traffic problems such as pollution and congestion are becoming more and more serious in urban areas. A potential solution to these problems is to develop narrow vehicles that occupy less space and have lower emissions. There has been increasing interest in underactuated mechanical systems, i.e., mobile wheeled inverted pendulum (MWIP) models, which are widely used in the field of autonomous robotics and intelligent narrow vehicles. A novel narrow vehicle based on an MWIP and a movable seat, called UW-Car, is investigated in this paper. The dynamic model of the underactuated vehicle system running on flat ground is derived by Lagrange's equation of motion. Based on the dynamic model and terminal sliding mode control method, two terminal sliding mode controllers are designed to control velocity and braking of the UW-Car. The first one is used to control the forward speed to a desired value while keeping the body upright and the seat on some fixed position. The second one is a switching sliding mode controller, composed of three terminal sliding mode controllers that quickly brakes the system according to an optimal braking scheme. All the control algorithms are tested in both MATLAB simulation and a UW-Car experiment. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the model and controllers.

AB Because of the autonomous underwater vehicles' (AUVs') slow motion and insufficient excitations, monocular visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems for AUVs still have large-scale errors and a lengthy initialization period. In this paper, we present a relative-depth-aided monocular visual-inertial odometry (RD-VIO) system based on two innovative methods: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-depth joint initialization and relative depth tightly coupled with visual-inertial. The RD-VIO performs reprojection bundle adjustment with dynamic weight factors for visual residuals. Depth measurements acquired by depth gauge or pressure sensor are compensated with reliable inter-image IMU pre-integration to account for different sensor frequencies. Also, we adopt an IMU-depth joint initialization using relative depth measurements and IMU excitations to estimate the scale and gravity direction together, which captures the complete AUV motion changes, improving scale estimation and decreasing initialization time. To reduce scale drift and improve global accuracy and consistency, a tight coupling of relative depth and visual-inertial in the RD-VIO is employed to optimize the AUV pose from depth measurements. Using two open-source datasets and our experiments from Sanya, we evaluated the performance of RD-VIO. The evaluation results show that the proposed system can achieve a more accurate trajectory than the state-of-the-art algorithms with less system initialization time and scale error.

AB Visual recognition and localization of underwater optical beacons is an important step in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) docking. The main issues that restrict the use of underwater monocular vision range are the attenuation of light in water, the mirror image between the water surface and the light source, and the small size of the optical beacon. In this study, a fast monocular camera localization method for small 4-light beacons is proposed. A YOLO V5 (You Only Look Once) model with coordinated attention (CA) mechanisms is constructed. Compared with the original model and the model with convolutional block attention mechanisms (CBAM), and our model improves the prediction accuracy to 96.1% and the recall to 95.1%. A sub-pixel light source centroid localization method combining super-resolution generative adversarial networks (SRGAN) image enhancement and Zernike moments is proposed. The detection range of small optical beacons is increased from 7 m to 10 m. In the laboratory self-made pool and anechoic pool experiments, the average relative distance error of our method is 1.04 percent, and the average detection speed is 0.088 s (11.36 FPS). This study offers a solution for the long-distance fast and accurate positioning of underwater small optical beacons due to their fast recognition, accurate ranging, and wide detection range characteristics.

AB Renewable energy sources have recently been integrated into microgrids that are in turn connected to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. In this regard, the optimal planning of microgrids is challenging with such uncertain generation and stochastic charging/discharging EV models. To achieve such ambitious goals, the best sites and sizes of photovoltaic and wind energy units in microgrids with EV are accurately determined in this work using an optimization technique. This proposed technique considers 1) generation profile uncertainty in photovoltaic and wind energy units as well as the total load demand, 2) photovoltaic and wind generation units' DSTATCOM operation capability, and 3) various branch and node constraints in the microgrid. Most importantly, the possible EV requirements are also taken into account, including initial and predetermined state of charge (SOC) arrangements, arrival and departure hours, and diverse regulated and unregulated charging strategies. A bi-level metaheuristic-based solution is established to address this complex planning model. The outer level and inner-level functions optimize renewable energy sources and EV decision variables. Sub-objectives to be optimized voltage deviations as well as grid power. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced method for planning renewable energy sources and managing EV to effectively achieve autonomous microgrids.

AB Detection of parking slots occupation is a crucial task for parking assistance, automatic parking, and autonomous driving systems. This paper proposed a novel method, called Temporal Difference of Inverse Perspective Mapping Difference (TD-IPM), without explicit 3D reconstruction or objection detection. In this method, temporal images from monocular camera are first inverse perspective mapped (IPM) onto the ground plane based on camera calibration results. Second, we proposed an algorithm, called Block Consensus based on Rotation Invariance Phase-Only Correlation (BC-RIPOC), for fast and robust motion estimation. From the estimated motion, we can align these two IPM images and generate IPM difference map. Third, the IPM difference map is segmented and filtered to generate a binary map that can distinguish objects on the ground plane or not for occupation detection. The obstacle is readily localized from the difference map as well. The proposed TD-IPM method has been validated in both underground and outdoor parking lots. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TD-IPM method can successfully detect various occupation objects, such as vehicles, cones, lockers, and others, with 97.9% average detection accuracy and speed of 17.5 frames per second (fps). The proposed method suggests an effective and low-cost solution to intelligent parking systems.

ID UNDERWATER DOCKING; SYSTEM; CAMERA
AB Docking technology plays a critical role in realising the long-time operation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this study, a binocular localisation method for AUV docking is presented. An adaptively weighted OTSU method is developed for feature extraction. The foreground object is extracted precisely without mixing or missing lamps, which is independent of the position of the AUV relative to the station. Moreover, this extraction process is more precise compared to other segmentation methods with a low computational load. The mass centre of each lamp on the binary image is used as matching feature for binocular vision. Using this fast feature matching method, the operation frequency of the binocular localisation method exceeds 10 Hz. Meanwhile, a relative pose estimation method is suggested for instances when the two cameras cannot capture all the lamps. The localisation accuracy of the distance in the heading direction as measured by the proposed binocular vision algorithm was tested at fixed points underwater. A simulation experiment using a ship model has been conducted in a laboratory pool to evaluate the feasibility of the algorithm. The test result demonstrates that the average localisation error is approximately 5 cm and the average relative location error is approximately 2% in the range of 3.6 m. As such, the ship model was successfully guided to the docking station for different lateral deviations.

AB Sensors play important roles for autonomous driving. Localization is definitely a key one. Undoubtedly, global positioning system (GPS) sensor will provide absolute localization for almost all the future land vehicles. In terms of driverless car, 1.5 m of positioning accuracy is the minimum requirement, since the vehicle has to keep in a driving lane that usually wider than 3 m. However, the skyscrapers in highly-urbanized cities, such as Tokyo and Hong Kong, dramatically deteriorate GPS localization performance, leading more than 50 m of error. GPS signals are reflected at modern glassy buildings, which caused the notorious multipath effect. Fortunately, the number of navigation satellite is rapidly increasing in a global scale, since the rise of multi-global navigation satellite system. It provides an excellent opportunity for positioning algorithm developer of GPS sensor. More satellites in the sky imply more measurements to be received. Novelty, this paper proposes to take advantage of the fact that clean measurements (refers to line-of-sight measurement) are consistent and multipath measurements are inconsistent. Based on this consistency check, the faulty measurements can be detected and excluded to obtain better localization accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve less than 1-m lateral positioning error in middle urban canyons.

AB Passive mechanosensing is an energy-efficient and effective recourse for autonomous underwater vehicles ( AUVs) for perceiving their surroundings. The passive sensory organs of aquatic animals have provided inspiration to biomimetic researchers for developing underwater passive sensing systems for AUVs. This work is inspired by the 'integumentary sensory organs' ( ISOs) which are dispersed on the skin of crocodiles and are equipped with slowly adapting ( SA) and rapidly adapting ( RA) receptors. ISOs assist crocodiles in locating the origin of a disturbance, both on the water surface and under water, thereby enabling them to hunt prey even in a dark environment and turbid waters. In this study, we construct SA dome receptors embedded with microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS) piezoresistive sensors to measure the steady-state pressures imparted by flows and RA dome receptors embedded with MEMS piezoelectric sensors to detect oscillatory pressures in water. Experimental results manifest the ability of SA and RA dome receptors to sense the direction of steady-state flows and oscillatory disturbances, respectively. As a proof of concept, the SA domes are tested on the hull of a kayak under various pressure variations owing to different types of movements of the hull. Our results indicate that the dome receptors are capable of discerning the angle of attack and speed of the flow.

AB The cyber threat to aerospace systems has been growing rapidly in recent years with several real-world and experimental cyberattacks observed. This growing threat has prompted investigation of cyberattack and defense strategies for manned and unmanned air systems, spacecraft, and other aerospace systems. The work in this paper seeks to further understand these attacks by introducing and developing a novel cyberattack for autonomous aerospace systems. The problem faced by the attacker is posed and discussed analytically using false data injection of state measurements to exploit the vehicle's onboard controller to take control of the system. It is shown that the attacker can utilize traditional control techniques to exert control over the system and eliminate the control of the victim by intercepting and modifying the vehicle's measurement data. The attacker is able to accomplish this objective without any prior knowledge of the system's plant, controller, or reference signal. The attack is demonstrated on the elevator-to-pitch-attitude-angle dynamics of a Cessna T-37 aircraft model. It is shown to be successful in eliminating the victim's control influence over the system and driving the system to its own target state.

ID AUV NAVIGATION; IMPACT
AB The errors introduced in the modeling and state estimation by conventional navigation methods will affect the AUV navigation accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a sequential learning method for AUV navigation. Firstly, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) module is used to learn the temporal relationships from raw sensor data. After the feature representation, a Self-Attention (SA) mechanism is implemented to weigh the data at different time steps. Finally, the Fully Connected (FC) layers are adopted to regress the AUV displacements. Since the sequential learning navigation method does not require state estimation computation and can calculate the AUV position by displacement accumulation, it can avoid introducing related errors. Meanwhile, this paper proposes a general correction model based on the sequential learning method to correct the errors of various state estimation techniques. The experimental results based on actual sea trial data from Sailfish 210 AUV show that the average AUV navigation accuracy of the presented sequential learning method is improved by 56.78% compared to EKF, 57.64% compared to UKF, and 47.85% compared to CKF. Meanwhile, the navigation accuracy of the proposed general correction model is improved by 62.88% compared to EKF, 49.45% compared to UKF, and 42.86% compared to CKF.

AB Energy-efficient path planning is essential for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-based ocean exploration. Existing static environment-based AUV path planners do not work well in dynamic ocean environments. A novel onboard sensing system-based AUV path planning strategy is proposed, and it is suitable for a regional dynamic environment to improve the energy utilization efficiency of an AUV working in a small-scale and dynamic mission area. Firstly, unlike the existing methods, the onboard sensing system including horizontal acoustic doppler current profile and detecting sonar is used to obtain environmental information, and the probabilistic multiple hypothesis tracker and Kalman filter are employed to carry out multi-step prediction of the environment. After that, the differential evolution algorithm is introduced as the optimizer, and a novel prediction-based path evaluator is designed to evaluate the fitness of possible paths. Besides, a novel prediction-based online re-planning strategy is designed, which is beneficial to reduce the impact of forecast error and the planning is thus closed-loop. Finally, multiple simulation experiments are designed to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the path planner, and the results show that the proposed planning strategy can reduce the AUV energy consumption by at least 4.6% compared with static environment-based planners.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Metric linear-time logic (MTL) has been widely used to specify runtime policies. Traditionally this use of MTL is to capture the qualitative aspects of the monitored systems, but recent developments in its extensions with aggregate operators allow some quantitative policies to be specified. Our interest in MTL-based policy languages is driven by applications in runtime malware or intrusion detection in platforms like Android and autonomous vehicles, which requires the monitoring algorithm to be independent of the length of the system event traces so that its performance does not degrade as the traces grow. We propose a policy language based on a past-time variant of MTL, extended with an aggregate operator called the metric temporal counting quantifier to specify a policy based on the number of times some sub-policies are satisfied in the specified past time interval. We show that a broad class of policies, but not all policies, specified with our language can be monitored in a trace-length independent way, and provide a concrete algorithm to do so. We implement and test our algorithm in both an existing Android monitoring framework and an autonomous vehicle simulation platform, and show that our approach can effectively specify and monitor quantitative policies drawn from real-world studies.

AB Nowadays, machine learning (ML), which is one of the most rapidly growing technical tools, is extensively used to solve critical challenges in various domains. Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is expected to be the key role player in reducing road casualties and traffic congestion. To ensure this role, a gigantic amount of data should be exchanged. However, current allocated wireless access for VANET is inadequate to handle such massive data amounts. Therefore, VANET faces a spectrum scarcity issue. Cognitive radio (CR) is a promising solution to overcome such an issue. CR-based VANET or CR-VANET must achieve several performance enhancement measures, including ultra-reliable and low-latency communication. ML methods can be integrated with CR-VANET to make CR-VANET highly intelligent, achieve rapid adaptability to the dynamicity of the environment, and improve the quality of service in an energy-efficient manner. This paper presents an overview of ML, CR, VANET, and CR-VANET, including their architectures, functions, challenges, and open issues. The applications and roles of ML methods in CR-VANET scenarios are reviewed. Insights into the use of ML for autonomous or driver-less vehicles are also presented. Current advancements in the amalgamation of these prominent technologies and future research directions are discussed.

AB For supporting the dynamic routing plan more efficiently, this study has been established by integrating PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) - based dynamic routing algorithm, self-tuning fuzzy controller, a stereo-vision detection technique and 6-DOF mathematical model into the inspection system of AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). Specifically, the PSO-based dynamic routing algorithm is modified by adopting the concept of Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), which is able to handle different weights of objectives in parallel. Therefore, a modular structure is applied to program design of the system by using the graphical language, LabVIEW, which is composed of 6-DOF motion module, a self-tuning fuzzy control module, a stereo-vision detection module, and a dynamic routing module. Performances resulted from the MOPSO-based dynamic routing algorithm would be discussed by conducting a series of inspection tasks in the imitated offshore wind farm. Additionally, selections of fixed weight and dynamic weight of MOPSO-based dynamic routing algorithm would be compared via Pareto frontiers for feasible solutions of both sailing time and energy consumption. Eventually, it is verified that the MOPSO-based dynamic routing algorithm in our system is not only able to estimate the feasible routes intelligently, but also identify features of underwater structures for the purpose of positioning.

AB Uniform circular arrays require a minimum number of directional sensors to ensure identical estimation accuracy at all possible directions-of-arrival. We study smaller uniform circular arrays and compensate for the loss in accuracy (Cramer-Rao bound) by a proper array orientation. We calculate, in a closed-form manner and based on the available source prior, the best (Fisher information maximizing) array direction. This scheme is suitable to autonomous 'unnamed vehicles who have maneuvering capabilities and accommodate minimally-sized arrays.

The discrepancy between road safety and infotainment must be addressed to develop safely operated modern vehicles. Head-up displays (HUDs) aim to introduce a seamless uptake of visual information for the driver while securely operating a vehicle. HUDs projected on the windshield provide the driver with visual navigation and vehicle data within the comfort of the driver's personal eye box through a customizable extended display space. Windshield HUDs do not require the driver to shift the gaze away from the road to attain road information. This article presents a review of technological advances and future perspectives in holographic HUDs by analyzing the optoelectronics devices and the user experience of the driver. The review elucidates holographic displays and full augmented reality in 3D with depth perception when projecting the visual information on the road within the driver's gaze. Design factors, functionality, and the integration of personalized machine learning technologies into holographic HUDs are discussed. Application examples of the display technologies regarding road safety and security are presented. An outlook is provided to reflect on display trends and autonomous driving.

ID CHANNEL CHARACTERIZATION; COHERENCE BANDWIDTH; DELAY; SYSTEM; MODEL
AB Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is more and more crucial in the modern transportation field, such as the applications of autonomous vehicles, dynamic traffic light sequences, and automatic road enforcement. As the upcoming fifth-generation mobile network (5G) is entering the deployment phase, the idea of cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is proposed. The same 5G networks, coming to mobile phones, will also allow vehicles to communicate wirelessly with each other. Hence, 3.5 GHz, as the main sub-6 GHz band licensed in 5G, is focused in our study. In this paper, a comprehensive study on the channel characteristics for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) link at 3.5 GHz frequency band is conducted through channel measurements and ray-tracing (RT) simulations. Firstly, the channel parameters of the V2I link are characterized based on the measurements, including power delay profile (PDP), path loss, root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread, and coherence bandwidth. Then, the measurement-validated RT simulator is utilized to conduct the simulations in order to supplement other channel parameters, in terms of the Ricean K-factor, angular spreads, the cross-correlations of abovementioned parameters, and the autocorrelation of each parameter itself. This work is aimed at helping the researchers understand the channel characteristics of the V2I link at 3.5 GHz and support the link-level and system level design for future vehicular communications of 5G.

AB Crop row detection is one of the foundational and pivotal technologies of agricultural robots and autonomous vehicles for navigation, guidance, path planning, and automated farming in row crop fields. However, due to a complex and dynamic agricultural environment, crop row detection remains a challenging task. The surrounding background, such as weeds, trees, and stones, can interfere with crop appearance and increase the difficulty of detection. The detection accuracy of crop rows is also impacted by different growth stages, environmental conditions, curves, and occlusion. Therefore, appropriate sensors and multiple adaptable models are required to achieve high-precision crop row detection. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the methods and applications related to crop row detection for agricultural machinery navigation. Particular attention has been paid to the sensors and systems used for crop row detection to improve their perception and detection capabilities. The advantages and disadvantages of current mainstream crop row detection methods, including various traditional methods and deep learning frameworks, are also discussed and summarized. Additionally, the applications for different crop row detection tasks, including irrigation, harvesting, weeding, and spraying, in various agricultural scenarios, such as dryland, the paddy field, orchard, and greenhouse, are reported.

AB A self-contained turbulence instrument from Rockland Scientific was installed on a light autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from OceanScan Marine Systems and Technology Lda. We report on the data quality and discuss limitations of dissipation estimated from two shear probes during a deployment in the Barents Sea in February 2021. The AUV mission lasted for 5 h, operating at a typical horizontal speed of 1.1 m s(-1). The AUV was programmed to find and cross the maximum along-path thermal gradient at 10, 20 and 30 m depths along 4 km transects. Although the AUV vibrations contaminate the shear probe records, the noise is mitigated by removing vibrationinduced components from shear spectra using the accelerometer signal measured in multiple directions. Dissipation rate estimates in the observed transects varied in the range 1 x 10(-8) and 6 x 10(-6) W kg(-1), with the values from the two orthogonal probes typically in agreement to within a factor of 2. Dissipation estimates from the AUV show good agreement with nearby vertical microstructure profiles obtained from the ship during the transects, indicating that the turbulence measurements from the AUV are reliable for this relatively turbulent environment. However, the lowest reliable dissipation rates are limited to 5 x 10(-8) W kg(-1), making this setup unfit for use in quiescent environments.

AB In this paper, a novel particle filter termed the wavelet-based grey particle filter (WG-PF) is proposed to self-estimate the trajectory of a manoeuvring autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) without prior manoeuvring information. To implement the WG-PF, the particles are sampled by the state transition and grey prediction. The state transition is based on a prior dynamic model, while the grey prediction is a kind of model-free method that predicts the state through historical measurements. Therefore, the WG-PF has the inherent advantages of both model-based and model-free systems. Additionally, the measurement noise covariance is modified by the wavelet transform. Thus, the WG-PF can effectively correct the prior distribution and likelihood function of the particles and then alleviate the sample degeneracy problem. The estimation performances of three filters, the proposed WG-PF, the multiple model particle filter (PF) and the adaptive extended Kalman filter, are evaluated and compared through the experimental data, in which a trajectory plotted by the underwater acoustic positioning sensors is employed as the true trajectory. The grey-prediction-based and wavelet-based PFs are also examined to demonstrate their positive effects in the WG-PF. The presented results show that the WG-PF acquires satisfactory effectiveness, robustness and better estimation accuracy than the other filters.

AB This paper aims to evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed cooperative dynamic bus lane system with microscopic traffic simulation models. The system creates a flexible bus priority lane that is only activated on demand at an appropriate time with advanced information and communication technologies, which can maximize the use of road space. A decentralized multi-lane cooperative algorithm is developed and implemented in a microscopic simulation environment to coordinate lane changing, gap acceptance, and car-following driving behavior for the connected vehicles (CVs) on the bus lane and the adjacent lanes. The key parameters for the sensitivity study include the penetration rate and communication range of CVs, considering the transition period and gradual uptake of CVs. Multiple scenarios are developed and compared to analyze the impact of key parameters on the system's performance, such as total saved travel time of all passengers and travel time variation among buses and private vehicles. The microscopic simulation models showed that the cooperative dynamic bus lane system is significantly sensitive to the variations of the penetration rate and the communication range in a congested traffic state. With a CV system and a communication range of 150 m, buses obtain maximum benefits with minimal impacts on private vehicles in the study simulation. The safety concerns induced by cooperative driving behavior are also discussed in this paper.

AB LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation algorithm is crucial to the environmental understanding of unmanned vehicles. At this stage, in autonomous vehicles, effectively integrating the complementary information of LiDAR and camera has become the focus of research. In this work, a network framework (called PI-Seg) for LiDAR point clouds semantic segmentation by fusing appearance features of RGB images is proposed. In this paper, the perspective projection module is introduced to align and synchronize point clouds with images to reduce appearance information loss. And an efficient and concise dual-flow feature extraction network is designed, a fusion module based on a continuous convolution structure is used for feature fusion, which effectively reduces the amount of parameters and runtime performance, and more suitable for autonomous driving scenarios. Finally, the fused features are added to the LiDAR point cloud features as the final output features, and the point cloud category label prediction is realized through the MLP network. The experimental results demonstrate that PI-Seg has a 5.3% higher mIoU score than SalsaNext, which is also a projection-based method, and still has a 1.4% performance improvement compared with the latest Cylinder3D algorithm, and in quantitative analyses the mAP value also has the best performance, showing that PI-Seg is better than other existing methods.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is widely used in autonomous vehicles to obtain precise 3D information about surrounding road environments. However, under bad weather conditions, such as rain, snow, and fog, LiDAR-detection performance is reduced. This effect has hardly been verified in actual road environments. In this study, tests were conducted with different precipitation levels (10, 20, 30, and 40 mm/h) and fog visibilities (50, 100, and 150 m) on actual roads. Square test objects (60 x 60 cm(2)) made of retroreflective film, aluminum, steel, black sheet, and plastic, commonly used in Korean road traffic signs, were investigated. Number of point clouds (NPC) and intensity (reflection value of points) were selected as LiDAR performance indicators. These indicators decreased with deteriorating weather in order of light rain (10-20 mm/h), weak fog (<150 m), intense rain (30-40 mm/h), and thick fog (<= 50 m). Retroreflective film preserved at least 74% of the NPC under clear conditions with intense rain (30-40 mm/h) and thick fog (<50 m). Aluminum and steel showed non-observation for distances of 20-30 m under these conditions. ANOVA and post hoc tests suggested that these performance reductions were statistically significant. Such empirical tests should clarify the LiDAR performance degradation.

AB In this paper, an underwater robot system with nonlinear characteristics is studied by a backstepping method. Based on the state preservation problem of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), this paper applies the backstepping probabilistic gain controller to the nonlinear system of the AUV for the first time. Under the comprehensive influence of underwater resistance, turbulence, and driving force, the motion of the AUV has strong coupling, strong nonlinearity, and an unpredictable state. At this time, the system's output feedback can solve the problem of an unmeasurable state. In order to achieve a good control effect and extend the cruising range of the AUV, first, this paper will select the state error to make it a new control objective. The system's control is transformed into the selection of system parameters, which greatly simplifies the degree of calculation. Second, this paper introduces the concept of a stochastic backstepping control strategy, in which the robot's actuators work discontinuously. The actuator works only when there is a random disturbance, and the control effect is not diminished. Finally, the backstepping probabilistic gain controller is designed according to the nonlinear system applied to the simulation model for verification, and the final result confirms the effect of the controller design.

AB Road surface detection is important for safely driving autonomous vehicles. This is because the knowledge of road surface conditions, in particular, dry, wet, and snowy surfaces, should be considered for driving control of autonomous vehicles. With the rise of deep learning technology, road surface detection methods using deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely used for developing road surface detection algorithms. To apply DNN in road surface detection, the dataset should be large and well-balanced for accurate and robust performance. However, most of the images of road surfaces obtained through usual data collection processes are not well-balanced. Most of the collected surface images tend to be of dry surfaces because road surface conditions are highly correlated with weather conditions. This could be a challenge in developing road surface detection algorithms. This paper proposes a method to balance the imbalanced dataset using CycleGAN to improve the performance of a road surface detection algorithm. CycleGAN was used to artificially generate images of wet and snow-covered roads. The road surface detection algorithm trained using the CycleGAN-augmented dataset had a better IoU than the method using imbalanced basic datasets. This result shows that CycleGAN-generated images can be used as datasets for road surface detection to improve the performance of DNN, and this method can help make the data acquisition process easy.

AB How do technology firms compete to colonize the urban future? This article theorizes technology patents as a medium of urban futuring. Patents secure legal exclusion by disclosing an idea or invention. However, the incentive structures behind patents are ambiguous. Patent holders must articulate inventions with enough technical specificity to warrant a property claim while remaining strategically imprecise enough to capture unanticipated future uses. I build on the Foucaultian theory of the diagram to discuss patents' interplay of disclosure and secrecy as a strategic anticipatory practice for colonizing urban futures. Whereas modern urban governance operated on spatial form to discipline citizens, smart city technology patents reflect a splintering of technical capacity and control. In the empirical section, I analyze three patent-diagrams: the first for a Wi-Fi-enabled advertising system, the second for a notification system for autonomous vehicles, and the third for an algorithmic predictive policing platform. These examples show that at a fundamental level, smart city technologies are less discrete inventions than claims to the capacity to influence human-machinic interactions. The article concludes with a reflection on how critical urbanists can learn from technology patents to advance more democratic and publicly oriented visions for the city.

AB The autonomous ship landing control issue of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is investigated. To achieve the ship landing operation efficiently and precisely, a novel mission planning consisting of an approaching stage and a landing stage is first proposed, where the desired altitude for the UAV is provided according to the requirements in each stage. Affected by rough sea wave, a feasible final landing condition is planned such that the UAV could land on the ship board in a safe environment. Then, the solution to the ship landing operation is transformed into the UAV trajectory tracking. Due to the underactuated nature of the UAV, an adaptive robust hierarchical algorithm is developed such that the position tracking to the desired trajectory and the attitude tracking to the command attitude are achieved. In particular, an asymmetric saturated command force is designed by introducing a dynamic compensator to ensure the nonsingular attitude extraction, and a tracking error constrained applied torque is exploited to avoid the nature singularity of Euler angle in sequence. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed in view of the hierarchical system stability theory. Simulations are performed to validate the proposed strategy.

ID LEVEL SET
AB Recent advances in Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) technology have facilitated the collection of oceanographic data at a fraction of the cost of ship-based sampling methods. Unlike oceanographic data collection in the deep ocean, operation of AUVs in coastal regions exposes them to the risk of collision with ships and land. Such concerns are particularly prominent for slow-moving AUVs since ocean current magnitudes are often strong enough to alter the planned path significantly. Prior work using predictive ocean currents relies upon deterministic outcomes, which do not account for the uncertainty in the ocean current predictions themselves. To improve the safety and reliability of AUV operation in coastal regions, we introduce two stochastic planners: (a) a Minimum Expected Risk planner and (b) a risk-aware Markov Decision Process, both of which have the ability to utilize ocean current predictions probabilistically. We report results from extensive simulation studies in realistic ocean current fields obtained from widely used regional ocean models. Our simulations show that the proposed planners have lower collision risk than state-of-the-art methods. We present additional results from field experiments where ocean current predictions were used to plan the paths of two Slocum gliders. Field trials indicate the practical usefulness of our techniques over long-term deployments, showing them to be ideal for AUV operations.

AB This paper anticipates the impacts of self-driving or "autonomous" vehicles (AVs), shared AVs, and Atrucks on travel across the Texas Triangle megaregion using year 2040 land use (and network) forecasts. A statewide travel demand model forecasts changes in trip generation, mode and destination choices, and thus vehicle-miles traveled (VMT), congestion, and travel patterns across the megaregion. Results suggest travelers' shifting to more distant destinations, with average person-trip distance rising from 14 to 16 miles. Within-region airline passenger travel is predicted to fall by 82%, as travelers shift to self-driving ground transport options. Without travel demand management (like credit-based congestion pricing and mandated tight headways between AVs), congestion issues will grow, due to an average 47% VMT increase, especially in the region's major cities (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin). Automobile travel is anticipated to rise across all distance categories, with increases most evident between suburban and urban zones. Almost 9.6% of link flows will exceed capacity, relative to 4.6% of segments in the no-AV case (for year 2040). Four of the 15 freight industries are predicted to experience an increase of more than 100 million ton-miles per day, due to the introduction of Atrucks, with rising truck trades largely between Houston and other major cities.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB This paper presents a model-based algorithm that estimates how the driver of a vehicle can either steer, brake, or accelerate to avoid colliding with an arbitrary object. In this algorithm, the motion of the vehicle is described by a linear bicycle model, and the perimeter of the vehicle is represented by a rectangle. The estimated perimeter of the object is described by a polygon that is allowed to change size, shape, position, and orientation at sampled time instances. Potential evasive maneuvers are modeled, parameterized, and approximated such that an analytical expression can be derived to estimate the set of maneuvers that the driver can use to avoid a collision. This set of maneuvers is then assessed to determine if the driver needs immediate assistance to avoid or mitigate an accident. The proposed threat-assessment algorithm is evaluated using authentic data from both real traffic conditions and collision situations on a test track and by using simulations with a detailed vehicle model. The evaluations show that the algorithm outperforms conventional threat-assessment algorithms at rear-end collisions in terms of the timing of autonomous brake activation. This is crucial for increasing the performance of collision-avoidance systems and for decreasing the risk of unnecessary braking. Moreover, the algorithm is computationally efficient and can be used to assist the driver in avoiding or mitigating collisions with all types of road users in all kinds of traffic scenarios.

AB In many scenarios, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aka drones, need to have the capability of autonomous flight to carry out their missions successfully. In order to fly autonomously, drones need to know their location constantly. Then, based on their current position and the final destination, navigation commands will be generated and drones will be guided to their destination. Localization can be easily carried out in outdoor environments using GPS signals and drone inertial measurement units (IMUs). However, such an approach is not feasible in indoor environments or GPS-denied areas. In this paper, we propose a localization scheme for drones called PILOT (High-Precision Indoor Localization for Autonomous Drones), which is specifically designed for indoor environments. PILOT relies on ultrasonic acoustic signals to estimate the target drone's location. To obtain a precise final estimation of the drone's location, PILOT deploys a three-stage localization scheme. The first two stages provide robustness against the multi-path fading effect of indoor environments and mitigate the ranging error. Then, in the third stage, PILOT deploys a simple yet effective technique to reduce the localization error induced by the relative geometry between transmitters and receivers, which significantly reduces the height estimation error. The performance of PILOT was assessed in different scenarios, and the results indicate that it achieves centimeter-level accuracy for three-dimensional drone localization.

ID DESIGN
AB This article presents a case study of the design of an autonomous wireless sensor network for environmental monitoring to provide data for understanding the relationships among food, energy, and water systems in suburban areas in Long Island New York. The study focuses on the existing water quality data for the two counties on Long Island, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, to understand the impact of energy and food production on the coastal waters of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. The analysis of existing data from the US Environmental Protection Agency database reveals the challenges in using such data to understand the relationships between water quality, weather events and identified point sources of pollutants. Maintaining on-going data collection programs is expensive, time-consuming and personnel intensive which is why this project examines new ways to obtain and utilize environmental data. The researchers propose the design of an autonomous wireless sensor network environmental monitoring system with an optimal sensor placement strategy to identify targeted locations for water quality monitoring. The goal is to provide environmental data that can facilitate a better understanding of the interactions of farming activities and energy production resulting in undesirable impacts on water quality. The proposed design can be used to provide real-time data to help stakeholders improve efficiency in resource management and advance early detection of potential hazardous events.

AB This paper introduces an approach to localize and track an unknown number of non-cooperative surface vessels based on passive acoustic sensing of their noise radiated underwater. Time-Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurements are extracted from pairs of hydrophones, and a recently introduced Bayesian framework for multi-object tracking is employed to detect and track vessels from TDOA measurements. Results based on data from a three-dimensional compact hydrophone array towed by an autonomous vehicle confirm that non-cooperative surface vessels can be detected and tracked.

AB In this work, the penalty functions technique together with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are employed to develop a motion planning algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles under real environment conditions. The objective functions include the traveling time, consumed energy and a combination of these quantities. The optimization procedure is conducted based on the optimal control using the trigonometric swarm. The constraints are implemented through the penalty functions approach by introducing the velocity approximation strategy to reduce the optimization process runtime. The method is verified by solving the problem under investigation in a simulated environment and performing comparison studies with the results of the other related methods. After that, its robustness and efficiency for real conditions are demonstrated by performing the motion planning of AUVs under disturbed conditions. The effects of real currents of an area in Persian Gulf (PG) on the proposed motion planning algorithm are investigated. Finally, it is shown that the use of the trigonometric swarm and also the velocity approximation strategy improve the motion planning results. In addition, it is shown that the velocity approximation strategy decreases the process runtime by up to almost 30%, and the trigonometric swarms instead of common swarms (spline) improves the objective function minimization by up to almost 31%.

AB Model mismatch caused by strong nonlinearity and other factors will severely impact the lateral path tracking control in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) under extreme conditions. Previous studies have focused on guaranteeing robust stability under possible uncertainty realizations through Tube-based Robust Model Predictive Control (TRMPC). However, three deficiencies in TRMPC applications are revealed: unknown disturbance set, simple rigid tube, and excessive conservatism. In this paper, a novel scheme named Varying Zonotopic TRMPC with Switching Logic (SVTMPC) is developed to overcome these limitations. Firstly, a zero steady-state error dynamic model is established, and a new update mechanism of the nominal state is devised to determine the unknown internal disturbance set of the AV system. Secondly, zonotopic representation of all defined sets is used to construct the prediction model, as well as a flexible tube with varying cross-sections is naturally designed to overcome excessive conservation and non-solution of Quadratic Programming (QP). Finally, a switching logic between conservative and radical strategies improves tracking performance under conventional conditions without compromising robust stability. Numerical simulation through three scenarios shows that the SVTMPC controller can comprehensively improve robust stability and adaptability compared with MPC and TRMPC. Hardware in-the-Loop (HIL) experiment verifies the effectiveness and real-time of the SVTMPC controller.

AB For autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), control over AUV heading is of key importance to enable highperformance locomotion control. In this study, the heading control is achieved by using the robust sliding mode control (SMC) method. The performance of the controller can be seriously affected by its parameters. However, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to manually adjust the parameters. Most of the existing methods rely on the accurate AUV model or prior knowledge, which are difficult to obtain. Therefore, this study is concerned with the problem of automatically tuning the SMC parameters through reinforcement learning (RL). First, an AUV dynamic model with and without current influence was successfully established. Second, a continuous hybrid Model-based Model-free (MbMf) RL method based on the deterministic policy gradient was introduced and explained. Then, the framework for tuning the parameters of SMC by the RL method was described. Finally, to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach, extensive numerical simulations were conducted on the established AUV model. The results show that our method can automatically tune the SMC parameters. The performance is more effective than SMC with fixed parameters or SMC with a purely model-free learner.

AB To improve the agility and efficiency of the highway decision-making system and overcome the local optimal dilemma of the existing safety field, this paper builds an improved safety field to reflect the advantage of the reachable states and the learning process is further employed to make the decision long-term optimal. Firstly, the improved safety field is prepared by the kinematic model-based prediction of surrounding vehicles and the boundary is determined elaborately to ensure real-time performance. Then, the field is constructed by three individual fields. One is the kinematic field, which is built based the safe-distance model to measure the colliding risk of both moving or no-moving objects accurately. Another is the road field that reflects the lane-marker constraint. The last is the efficiency field, which is introduced creatively to improve efficiency. Furthermore, the learning algorithm is adopted to learn the long-term optimal state-action sequence in the safety field. Finally, the simulations are conducted in Prescan platform to validate the feasibility of the improved safety field in complex scenarios. The results show that the proposed decision algorithm can always drive autonomous vehicle to the state with a long-term optimal payoff and can improve the overall performance compared to the existing pure safety field and the interaction-aware method.

AB Autonomous landing has become a core technology of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) guidance, navigation and control system in recent years. As a novel autonomous landing approach, computer vision has been studied and applied in rotary-wing UAV landing successfully. This paper aims to fixed-wing UAV and focus on two problems: how to find runway only depending on airborne front-looking camera and how to align UAV with the designated landing runway. The paper can be divided into two parts to solve above two problems respectively. In the first part, the paper firstly presents an algorithm of region of interest (ROI) detection, which is based on spectral residual saliency map, and then an algorithm of feature vector extraction based on sparse coding and spatial pyramid matching (SPM) is proposed, finally, ROI including designated landing runway is recognized by a linear support vector machine. In the second part, the paper presents an approach of relative position and pose estimation between UAV and landing runway. Estimation algorithm firstly selects five feature points on the runway surface, and then establishes a new earth-fixed reference frame, finally uses orthogonal iteration to estimate landing parameters including three parameters of distance, height and offset, and three pose parameters of roll, yaw, pitch. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the algorithms proposed in this paper.

We consider the look-direction as the entire half space which is generally accepted as the search region in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operation. The array geometry with an equi-bearing resolution is designed by the arithmetic summation of the beam patterns between a reference sensor and other sensors. The performance of the proposed array is examined using numerical experiments.

The latter case is important in flexible manufacturing, where reconfigurations can be costly. On the other hand, the control of mobile devices (autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, etc.) is a fundamental requirement, especially in flexible manufacturing.

AB This paper presents autonomous docking of an inhouse built resident Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), called Rover ROV, through acoustic guided techniques. A novel cage-type docking station has been developed. The docking station can be placed on a deep-sea lander, taking the Rover ROV to the seafloor. Instead of using vision-based pose estimation techniques and expensive navigation sensors, the Rover ROV docking adopts an ultra-short baseline (USBL) and low-cost inertial sensors to build an adaptive fault-tolerant integrated navigation system. To solve the problem of sonar-based failure positioning, the measurement residuals are exploited to detect measurement faults. Then, an adaptation scheme for estimating the statistical characteristics of noise in real-time is proposed, which can provide robust and smooth positioning results. It is more suitable for a compact and low-cost deep-sea resident ROV. Field experiments have been conducted successfully in the Qiandao Lake and the South China Sea area with a depth of 3000 m, respectively. The experimental results show that the functionality of autonomous docking has been achieved. Under the guidance of the navigation system, the Rover ROV can autonomously and efficiently return to the docking station within a range of 100 m even when the amounts of outliers exist in the acoustic positioning data. These achievements can be applied to current ROVs by an easy retrofit.

AB Advances in different technologies, such as global navigation satellite systems, geographic information systems, high-resolution vision systems, innovative sensors and embedded computing systems, are finding direct application in agriculture. These advances allow researchers and engineers to automate and robotise agricultural tasks no matter the inherent difficulties of the natural, semi-structured environment in which these tasks are performed. Following this current trend, this article aims to describe the development and assessment of a robotised patch spraty -20ying system that was devised for site-specific herbicide application in agricultural crops and is capable of working in groups or fleets of autonomous robots. The robotised patch sprayer consisted of an autonomous mobile robot based on a commercial agricultural vehicle chassis and a direct-injection spraying boom that was tailor-made to interact with the mobile robot. There were diverse sources (on-board and remote sensors) that can supply the weed data for the treatment. The main features of both the mobile robot and the sprayer are presented along with the controller that harmonised the behaviour of both main subsystems. Laboratory characterisation and field tests demonstrated that the system was reliable and accurate enough to accomplish the treatment over 99.5% of the detected weeds and treatment of the crop with no weed treated was insignificant; approximately 0.5% with respect to the total weed patches area, achieving a significant herbicide savings.

AB This paper proposes a novel adaptive integral terminal sliding mode (AITSM) control for a vessel train with obstacle avoidance . A vessel train comprises several autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). First, a finite time lumped uncertainty observer is used to estimate the lumped uncertainties and compensate them for the controller, which enhances the robustness of the motion system. Second, based on graph theory and a novel obstacle avoidance mechanism, the desired trajectory of ASVs is obtained for formation control and obstacle avoidance. Finally, a novel AITSM formation controller for ASVs is designed. It improves the accuracy of the system by introducing an adaptive law to follow the control gain of the sliding mode variable in realtime. Moreover, the presence of the equivalent input causes the closed-loop error of the system to quickly slide onto the sliding mode surface, whereas the switching input compensates for the remaining uncertainty, thereby increasing the robustness of the system. In conclusion, the proposed method can enhance stability and accuracy and improve the robustness of the system. Additionally, it can cause the tracking error of the system to converge to the origin in finite time. The superiority of the proposed control method is verified via using a simulation.

AB Distracted driving has become a growing traffic safety concern. With advances in autonomous driving and connected vehicle technology, a mixture of various types of intelligent vehicles will become normal in the near future, while more factors that may cause driver cognitive distraction are emerging. However, there are rarely studies on distracted driving in mixed traffic environments. To fill this gap, we conducted a natural driving experiment with three representative events at a nonsignalized intersection in a mixed traffic environment and proposed a novel method of identifying cognitive distraction based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) with attention mechanism. Forty participants were recruited for each event, who completed three different cognitive distraction experiments induced by three different secondary tasks in contrast with a normal driving process when passing a nonsignalized intersection. Related driving performance and eye movement data were collected to train and test the Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism model. Compared with the support vector machine (SVM) model, its recognition accuracy rate is 94.33%, which is 3.83% higher than that of the SVM in the total event, which has reasonable applicability for distraction recognition in a mixed traffic environment. Potential applications of this model include distraction alarm and autonomous driving assistance systems, which could avoid road traffic accidents.

AB We introduce a multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) control strategy to improve the cooperative operation ability in formation control and cluster search operations and to minimize the likelihood of collisions and interference with teammates and obstacles under various complex working conditions. Our approach uses a fusion control strategy with a redistribution mechanism (RM) based on virtual structure and leader-follower formation characteristics to improve the rapidity, stability, and accuracy of the multi-AUVs. The RM improved the rapidity and uniqueness of the random distribution formation by addressing over- and under-allocation. The combination of two (26-point and 8-point) path updating methods based on a hybrid bio-inspired self-organizing map algorithm considerably enhanced the performance of the multi-AUV system. Simulation tests and performance analyses indicated that the 8-point path updating method performed better in terms of rapidity; however, the 26-point path updating method was superior in integrity. The hunting performance of the fusion-controlled multi-AUV formation, was then analyzed to verify the feasibility of real-time formations under dynamic and static mixing of multi-obstacles by considering shape irregularities and the random distribution of multi-obstacles in three-dimensional underwater environments.

AB Autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) are driverless material handling systems used for transportation of pallets and line side supply of materials to provide flexibility and agility in shop-floor logistics. Scheduling of shop-floor logistics in such systems is a challenging task due to their complex nature associated with the multiple part types and alternate material transfer routings. This paper presents a decision support system capable of supporting shop-floor decision-making activities during the event of manufacturing disruptions by automatically adjusting both AGV and machine schedules in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMSs). The proposed system uses discrete event simulation (DES) models enhanced by the Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabled digital integration and employs a nonlinear mixed integer programming Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find near-optimal production schedules prioritising the just-in-time (JIT) material delivery performance and energy efficiency of the material transportation. The performance of the proposed system is tested on the Integrated Manufacturing and Logistics (IML) demonstrator at WMG, University of Warwick. The results showed that the developed system can find the near-optimal solutions for production schedules subjected to production anomalies in a negligible time, thereby supporting shop-floor decision-making activities effectively and rapidly.

AB Animals often select for habitats that increase their chance of survival by balancing the need to acquire food, reproduce and avoid predation. Perennial blooms of golden jellyfish (Mastigias papua etpisoni) are present in Jellyfish Lake, Palau, a popular tourist destination. Based on the species' economic importance and unusual behavioural complexity, increased understanding of jellyfish habitat selection is necessary. We used a novel approach, a REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle, to quantify jellyfish distribution, abundance and habitat, and compared these findings to traditional methods. Midday acoustic surveys showed jellyfish distribution was patchy and the population resided mainly on the eastern side of the lake, as it is known that jellyfish migrate eastward towards the sun. Highest vertical densities of jellyfish were at 6-7 m, potentially to mitigate UV damage or photoinhibition of their photosymbionts, suggesting a coupling exists between their vertical distribution and water properties. Abundance estimates of jellyfish were similar to 2.75 and similar to 7.1 million (similar to 2 million excluding bell diameters <1 cm) from acoustic and net samples, suggesting the methodology employed underestimated the population's smaller size fraction and non-synoptic surveys could impact estimates due to unresolved patchiness. Our approach could investigate population dynamics, behaviour or habitat associations on fine scales.

AB In this article, an innovative approach is proposed for multi-sensory integration applied in autonomous navigation for smart low-altitude reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The new UAV navigation technique exploits the use of a pan-tilt-based visual sensing system, which is able to implement the strategy of active perception, increasing the richness of the information acquired from the environments. In addition, based on the information theory, a significant optimality criterion, so-called observation entropy, is represented to determine which set of landmarks should be adopted as the optimal set of information source. Moreover, a chaotic reaction system, inspired by the olfactory bulb neural activity observed in rabbits subject to external stimuli, is considered to build the perception-motion dynamics loop. The loop can be used to adaptively guide the UAV actions not only when it perceives a set of landmarks, but also when the UAV is in environments without enough landmarks. Finally, the simulations and computed results show that the introduced autonomous navigation strategy has very low error rates of the path estimation supported by enough landmarks and active perceptual actions. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the chaotic evolution-based strategy is provided with robustness, which can guarantee the continuous navigation for the UAV in the complex environments without enough landmarks.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of laser scanners (LS) is investigated for assured navigation of autonomous vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in structured urban environments. The navigation solution is based on features (e. g., lines) that are extracted from laser scan images. The ultimate goal of this research effort is to develop feature-based techniques that will enable assured navigation capabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments. As a first step for achieving the set goal, detection and isolation of feature motion is investigated in order to exclude moving features from the navigation estimation problem. Relatively fast-moving features are removed using the integration with inertial sensors. This approach allows for the removal of features whose velocities exceed the inertial velocity drift. Autonomous integrity monitoring techniques that exploit redundant feature geometries are applied to detect and isolate slowly moving features (i.e., features with velocities below the inertial drift) for those cases where a single slowly moving feature is present in the laser scanner (LS) field-of-view (FOV) for any given scan. Minimum detectable feature velocity is evaluated based on the actual quality of features observed in scan images. A simulation scenario is implemented to demonstrate that the proposed detection and isolation method allows for reliable exclusion of even a very slowly moving feature (velocities at a cm/s level). Validity of the simulation setup is verified using experimental data.

AB Expected benefits of disruptive technologies such as self-driving vehicles may only materialize if they are publicly accepted. Acceptance increases when implementation is experienced as initial concerns become unfounded and individuals become familiar with the new technology. Fatal accidents, however, negatively affect acceptance. This paper examines citizens' acceptance of self-driving vehicles by contrasting pre-and post-implementation of a self-driving shuttle in Switzerland and before and after the first fatal accident involving a self-driving vehicle in Arizona (USA) in 2018 gaining high media attention. To gauge acceptance, a panel survey using a random sample of 1408 Swiss residents was used. The results indicate that news about the fatal accident abroad exerts a stronger effect on acceptance than experiencing a self-driving bus trial. Latent scepticism causes acceptance to decrease in the event of an accident but only lasts short term. However, acceptance levels are stable and at high levels, which also explains the comparably low familiarity effects. As public acceptance is necessary for technology transitions, this article provides policymakers practical insights on how citizens form preferences towards traffic automation and related policy regulations. More specifically, results show how attitudes change over time while residents experience a trial and the first fatal accident with the technology at hand.

AB A future smart car will be more than a means of transportation, as it will not only move people to a destination without requiring them to drive but will enable people to work or enjoy a trip with entertainment. For this, smart vehicles need to deal with various types of data for safety and infotainment, such as real-time traffic, multi-media contents, documents and weather information. Recently, a fleet of vehicles connected to other vehicles and infrastructure (i.e., road side units) using a legacy or 5G mmWave spectrum has been considered as a platform to cooperate for those new tasks, known as the vehicular cloud or fog. Within the vehicular cloud, data management should consider security, high availability and interoperability between vehicles. However, these are not easily achievable without a centralized service provider; it is difficult for an autonomous P2P system to guarantee data integrity, and it cannot compensate drivers that actively participate in the vehicular cloud. Fortunately, the many successes achieved in the field of crypto-currency raise the possibility of defining incentives that are necessary for a sustainable digital economy. In this paper, we propose autoCoin-an approach that aims to encourage smart vehicles to cooperate to create and exchange infotainment data securely under the assumption of rationality. We introduce a scalable blockchain architecture for autoCoin and a smart contract to exchange contents without third-parties using an off-chain technique.

AB Aiming at the problem of local path planning for structured roads, this paper proposes a framework of local path-speed planning for autonomous driving, which takes safety as the premise and improves driving efficiency. The framework simulates human driving thinking and divides the local path planning of autonomous driving into two parts: lane decision and path-speed planning. In the part of the lane decision, a lane decision algorithm based on driving risk field and safe distance is proposed, which can ensure driving efficient and ensure that the planning vehicle is always in a low-risk driving environment. In the part of the lane change path-speed planning, a candidate path generation algorithm based on uniform sampling of lane change time and a cost function considering lane change timeliness, driving safety, speed smoothness, and path continuity are proposed to achieve optimal path selection and speed planning. In the experiment part, there are six different driving tasks. In six scenes, the local path-speed planning framework proposed in this paper can plan a safe, efficient, and smooth driving path and a safe planning speed. Taking the scenario of detouring low-speed obstacles as an example, the path-speed planning algorithm proposed is compared with the path-speed planning algorithm based on discrete optimization in Hu et al. It has been verified that the algorithm proposed can ensure that planner is always at low environmental risks and drive with high driving efficiency.

AB In this article, the attitude of the master inertial navigation system (INS) installed on the autonomous drone launcher and the slave INS installed on the autonomous drone are correlated by means of establishing a time-varying model of the relative attitude. And the coupling processes of the initial attitude error of slave INS and its gyro bias are modeled in the relative attitude. Then, according to the different characteristics of the two error coupling modes, the two types of error are decoupled by the equivalent rotation vector and the higher order small terms neglected, and the nonlinear dynamic accumulation model of the gyro bias of slave INS is established in the navigation coordinate system. Next, the linear accumulation model of the gyro bias of slave INS is obtained in its own coordinate system by multiplying the dynamic accumulation amount with the attitude matrix in real-time. Finally, the gyro bias of slave INS is estimated by means of the least squares algorithm. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method can estimate more than 80% of the gyro bias of slave INS. The results of the vehicle-mounted experiment show that the compensation of the gyro bias of slave INS leads to a significant decrease in the accumulation rate of the relative attitude error over time.

SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS

AB Environmental perception is a key element of autonomous driving because the information received from the perception module influences core driving decisions. An outstanding challenge in real-time perception for autonomous driving lies in finding the best trade-off between detection quality and latency. Major constraints on both computation and power must be taken into account for real-time perception in autonomous vehicles. Larger detection models tend to produce the best results but are also slower at runtime. Since the most accurate detectors may not run in real-time locally, we investigate the possibility of offloading computation to edge and cloud platforms, which are less resource-constrained. We create a synthetic dataset to train object detection models and evaluate different offloading strategies. We measure inference and processing times for object detection on real hardware, and we rely on a network simulation framework to estimate data transmission latency. Our study compares different trade-offs between prediction quality and end-to-end delay. Following the existing literature, we aim to perform object detection at a rate of 20Hz. Since sending raw frames over the network implies additional transmission delays, we also explore the use of JPEG and H.265 compression at varying qualities and measure their impact on prediction. We show that models with adequate compression can be run in real-time on the edge/cloud while outperforming local detection performance.

AB Using autonomous molecular analytical devices embedded within an ocean observatory, we studied harmful algal bloom (HAB) ecology in the dynamic coastal waters of Monterey Bay, California. During studies in 2007 and 2008, HAB species abundance and toxin concentrations were quantified periodically at two locations by Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) robotic biochemistry systems. Concurrently, environmental variability and processes were characterized by sensors co-located with ESP network nodes, regional ocean moorings, autonomous underwater vehicle surveys, and satellite remote sensing. The two locations differed in their long-term average physical and biological conditions and in their degree of exposure to episodic wind-forced variability. While anomalously weak upwelling and strong stratification during the 2007 study favored toxigenic dinoflagellates (Alexandrium catenella), anomalously strong upwelling during the 2008 study favored toxigenic diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.). During both studies, raphidophytes (Heterosigma akashiwo) were detected within a similar range of concentrations, and they reached higher abundances at the relatively sheltered, stratified site. During 2008, cellular domoic acid reached higher concentrations and was far more variable at the shallower ESP node, where phytoplankton populations were influenced by resuspended sediments. Episodic variability caused by wind forcing, lateral mixing, internal waves, and subsurface phytoplankton layers influenced ESP detection patterns. The results illustrate the importance of mobilizing HAB detection on autonomous platforms that can intelligently target sample acquisition as a function of environmental conditions and biological patch encounter.

AB A brain-controlled vehicle (BCV) is a vehicle that uses the Brain-Computer interface (BCI) to analyze the driver's electroencephalogram (EEG) to obtain human control commands, which can help disabled people extend movement range and improve their self-independence. However, the performance of BCV is poor and the accuracy of BCI recognition varies considerably with different subjects, which severely restrict its promotion and application. To develop a better solution, with the concept of shared control, an intention preferenced fusion brain control strategy based on fuzzy logic is proposed. Firstly, based on Fuzzy Discrete Event System Supervision (FDES) theory, instructions of the driver are supervised and evaluated. At the same time, based on fuzzy logic an automatic controller which gives an automatic decision according to the cur-rent state of the vehicle is designed. Then according to the automatic decision and the correctness of the driver's instructions, a fuzzy reasoning is made, making the final decision more in line with human intentions. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, based on our previously-designed SSMVEP platform, we conduct virtual experiments, semi-object tests and full physical tests separately for verification. Compared with others shared control schemes, it not only achieves continuous control, but the final control-making is more in line with human intentions, which can encourage users to become more involved, enhancing their self-esteem and brain functions.

AB In recent years, the interest in electric vehicles (EVs) in the research community has been growing, particularly in the context of decarbonization. Additionally, there is a growing increase in their number, leading to massive energy demand on the charging stations (CSs). Energy trading management for CSs puts great pressure on the power grid and is a stimulating challenge in smart cities. In this paper, we propose an innovative market formulation in which autonomous vehicles and smart charging and discharging stations are motivated to cooperate dynamically with changing roles. In order to mathematically formulate the energy trading market, we adopt a double auction strategy that is repeated in steps. In this strategy, EVs and CSs participate by buying and selling energy. The investigated problem has high complexity, and thus, multi-objective optimization is employed so as to encapsulate the opposing objectives that the EVs and CSs have. Multi-objective optimization leads to a fairer and more efficient market operation. The performance of the presented approach is investigated through analytical and experimental results. More specifically, the proposed algorithm achieves up to 52.5% reduction in energy consumption. The performance evaluation proves that the suggested strategy offers both fairness and significant energy benefits, encouraging both electric vehicles and charging stations to take part in a double auction energy trading system.

AB Selective Catalytic Reduction systems (SCR) are very efficient on reducing NOx. However, they only perform properly when exhaust gas temperature is higher than 180 degrees C.
   This means that for low engine regimes combined with cold engine temperatures, SCR systems remains inactive. This study presents a new approach to minimize the amount of NOx emitted by diesel engines of Heavy-Duty Vehicles during low engine regimes and low exhaust gases temperature conditions. We propose the addition of an Automotive Thermoelectric Generator (ATEG) coupled to an electric Exhaust Gas Heater (EGH) to make the SCR system inject the urea solution at low engine regimes. This EGH-ATEG system, which can be retrofitted in any existing vehicle, is designed to be energetically closed, so there is no extra consumption of fuel. Experimental results show that NOx emissions can be reduced up to 80% when an EGH is added to a standard diesel-powered Euro VI Heavy Duty truck configuration. Apart from that, the use of an ATEG installed downstream of the aftertreatment system can produce the energy required by the EGH, which means that the EGH-ATEG system can work energetically autonomous and independent from the vehicle's electrical system. This system can improve SCR efficiency up to 55% during low engine regimes.

   Proximity operations; Demonstration mission; Reference mission
AB The hazards of orbital debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are well understood and concepts for Active Debris Removal (ADR) have been proposed in the literature, yet no mission has been launched to date. This is in part due to the lack of baseline space vehicle concepts. To give a point of departure design, a Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) orbital debris ferry concept and operations approach has been developed. This concept provides a feasible solution to ADR that is currently ready for a demonstration mission. This approach uses a single space vehicle to independently and autonomously rendezvous with multiple LEO debris objects, secure, and ferry them to a sufficiently low disposal orbit. This mission architecture is enabled by flight-proven, relatively high-power SEP technologies and Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (AR&D) algorithms and systems. The high Specific Impulse (4) of SEP enables low propellant requirements for removal of many debris objects with a single vehicle, and results in a low cost per target removed. Results from system sizing, low-thrust trajectory analysis, AR&D simulation, conceptual vehicle design, a concept of operations, and an implementation approach are provided. Results show that the SEP orbital debris ferry is a relatively low-cost and low-risk solution to mitigate the threat of orbital debris. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the use of scanning laser radars (LADARs) for 3D navigation of autonomous vehicles in structured environments such as outdoor urban navigation scenarios. The navigation solution ( position and orientation) is determined in unknown environments where no a priori map information is available. The navigation is based on the use of planar surfaces ( planes) extracted from LADAR scan images. Changes in plane parameters between scans are applied to compute position and orientation changes. Feasibility of the algorithms developed is verified using simulation results and initial results of live data tests.

TI Deployment of an autonomous mobile manipulator at MBZIRC
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper introduces a custom mobile manipulator and presents the planning and control architecture to execute autonomous missions including navigation and manipulation. The developed system combines a commercially available ground vehicle with a custom-designed robot arm. A typical mission requires the robot to find and navigate to its site of action, identify the suitable manipulation tools, and manipulate the correct objects according to the task specification. Our contribution includes a complete software pipeline for autonomous map building, localization, and navigation. We demonstrate stable localization on vast outdoor areas without GPS support. Our exploration strategy coupled with a path planner reliably scans the environment while avoiding obstacles until it finds the manipulation site. The position of the target location is estimated from laser data within a 5 cm radius, and the subsequent positioning procedure of the mobile base achieves a precision of +/- 4 cm. The developed manipulator uses series elastic actuation, making the system mechanically robust and compliant. Thanks to the precise joint torque controllability, a low end-effector impedance can be realized to passively overcome positioning inaccuracies during manipulation. Our solution incorporates a support vector machine to detect the manipulation object as required for visual servoing. We show how a valve stem and standard wrenches can be identified with a detection rate higher than 90%. The paper finally discusses the performance and lessons learned while participating at the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2017, where we showed the successful autonomous operation in a partially unknown environment.

AB The shuttle unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is an important element in the future intelligent transportation system (ITS), which will be widely used for public transportation in various scenarios. It has been widely accepted that the shuttle UGV will significantly improve the transportation efficiency and intelligent level of ITS in the near future. This paper presents an overall architecture and system of shuttle UGV for the future ITS. The hardware architecture includes sensor, actuator and computing platform, and is built on an X-by-wire chassis. The software architecture includes environment perception, decision making and dynamics control. Reliable and accurate autonomous driving algorithms are applied to the software system, which enable the shuttle UGV to drive intelligently and perform task stably. In addition, to address the large-scale deployment of shuttle UGVs in the future, this paper also introduces the concept of cloud brain system and discusses the application and prospect of the cloud brain system in ITS. The cloud brain system can store, monitor and mine the big data generated by the shuttle UGVs, which will further improve the operational safety and overall performance of the shuttle UGV group. An open road test in an ITS test zone is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed overall architecture and system for the shuttle UGV.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are exposed to several internal or external forces or moments causing roll instabilities. The coupled nonlinear dynamics of an AUV requires designing and utilizing an appropriate roll control system to operate well in various missions. In this paper, the roll dynamics and control enhancement of a REMUS AUV is studied using a Coupled-Fins-Propulsors (CFP) system by developing a six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) simulator. The results show that: 1) The roll angle deflections usually have adverse effects on coupled dynamics of the AUV in both open-loop and closed-loop systems; 2) In large roll angle deflections, the CFP system show a proper selection of 30% CRP (contra-rotating-propellers) and 70% FDF (Four-Decoupled-Fins) (49% SF (Stern Fins) and 31% RF (Rudder Fins)) can better control the roll dynamics by reducing the oscillations. 3) For phi d < 18 degrees, the FDF, CRP, and CFP, for 18 degrees <phi d < 60 degrees, the FDF and CFP, and for 60 degrees <phi d 70 degrees, the CFP system could produce the adequate roll control forces and moments. 4) A limited desired roll angle can be achieved at a given forward speed; the maximum value is phi d = 70 for ud 4 m/s.

   Employing proactive multi-access edge computing (MEC) service migration techniques helps provide offloaded computing power to highly dynamic vehicular networks while maintaining continuously low latency. This enables vehicles to take advantage of extra processing and storage, which can be used for employing deep learning algorithms for autonomous driving.
   Advanced learning algorithms for autonomous driving require lots of processing and storage power, which puts a strain on vehicles' computing resources. Using a combination of 5G network connectivity with ultra-high bandwidth and low latency together with extra computing power located at the edge of the network can help extend the capabilities of vehicular networks. However, due to the high mobility, it is essential that the offloaded services are migrated so that they are always in close proximity to the requester. Using proactive migration techniques ensures minimum latency for high service quality. However, predicting the next edge server to migrate comes with an error that can have deteriorating effects on the latency. In this paper, we examine the influence of mobility prediction errors on edge service migration performances in terms of latency penalty using a large-scale urban vehicular simulation. Our results show that the average service delay increases almost linearly with the migration prediction error, with 20% error yielding almost double service latency.

ID MODEL
AB In the era of 5G mobile communication, radio environment maps are increasingly viewed as a powerful weapon for the optimization of spectrum resources, especially in the field of autonomous vehicles. However, due to the constraint of limited resources when it comes to sensor networks, it is crucial to select a suitable scale of sensor measurements for radio environment map construction. This article proposes an adaptive ordinary Kriging algorithm based on affinity propagation clustering as a novel spatial interpolation method for the construction of the radio environment map, which can provide precise awareness of signal strength at locations where no measurements are available. Initially, a semivariogram is obtained from all the sensor measurements. Then, in order to select the minimum scale of measurements and at the same time guarantee accuracy, the affinity propagation clustering is introduced in the selection of sensors. Moreover, the sensor estimation groups are created based on the clustering result, and estimation results are obtained by ordinary Kriging. In the end, the simulation of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through comparisons with three conventional algorithms: inverse distance weighting, nearest neighbor, and ordinary Kriging. As a result, the conclusion can be drawn that the proposed algorithm is superior to others in accuracy as well as in efficiency.

AB In this paper, we consider the evaluation of the mental attention state of individuals driving in a simulated environment. We tested a pool of subjects while driving on a highway and trying to overcome various obstacles placed along the course in both manual and autonomous driving scenarios. Most systems described in the literature use cameras to evaluate features such as blink rate and gaze direction. In this study, we instead analyse the subjects' Electrodermal activity (EDA) Skin Potential Response (SPR), their Electrocardiogram (ECG), and their Electroencephalogram (EEG). From these signals we extract a number of physiological measures, including eye blink rate and beta frequency band power from EEG, heart rate from ECG, and SPR features, then investigate their capability to assess the mental state and engagement level of the test subjects. In particular, and as confirmed by statistical tests, the signals reveal that in the manual scenario the subjects experienced a more challenged mental state and paid higher attention to driving tasks compared to the autonomous scenario. A different experiment in which subjects drove in three different setups, i.e., a manual driving scenario and two autonomous driving scenarios characterized by different vehicle settings, confirmed that manual driving is more mentally demanding than autonomous driving. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed approach is an appropriate way to monitor driver attention.

AB This paper evaluates the use of low-cost global positioning system (GPS) receivers in the autonomous guidance of agricultural tractors. An autonomous guidance system was installed in a 6400 John Deere agricultural tractor. A low-cost GPS receiver was used as positioning sensor. Three different control laws were implemented in order to evaluate the autonomous guidance of the tractor with the low-cost receiver. The guidance was experimentally tested with the tracking of straight trajectories and with the step response. The total guidance error was obtained from the receiver accuracy and from the guidance error. For the evaluation of the receiver's accuracy, positioning data from several low-cost receivers were recorded and analyzed. For the evaluation of the guidance error, tests were performed with each control law at three different speeds. The conclusions obtained were that relative accuracy of low-cost receivers decreases with the time; that for an interval lower than 15 min, the error usually remains below 1 m; that all the control laws have a similar behavior and it is conditioned by the control law adjustment; that automatic guidance with low-cost receivers is possible with speeds that went up to 9 km h(-1); and finally, that the total error in the guidance is mainly determined by the receiver's accuracy.

AB Making safe and human-like decisions is an essential capability of autonomous driving systems, and learning-based behavior planning presents a promising pathway toward achieving this objective. Distinguished from existing learning-based methods that directly output decisions, this work introduces a predictive behavior planning framework that learns to predict and evaluate from human driving data. This framework consists of three components: a behavior generation module that produces a diverse set of candidate behaviors in the form of trajectory proposals, a conditional motion prediction network that predicts future trajectories of other agents based on each proposal, and a scoring module that evaluates the candidate plans using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). We validate the proposed framework on a large-scale real-world urban driving dataset through comprehensive experiments. The results show that the conditional prediction model can predict distinct and reasonable future trajectories given different trajectory proposals and the IRL-based scoring module can select plans that are close to human driving. The proposed framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of similarity to human driving trajectories. Additionally, we find that the conditional prediction model improves both prediction and planning performance compared to the non-conditional model. Lastly, we note that the learning of the scoring module is crucial for aligning the evaluations with human drivers.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are already operating on the streets of many countries around the globe. Contemporary concerns about AVs do not relate to the implementation of fundamental technologies, as they are already in use, but are rather increasingly centered on the way that such technologies will affect emerging transportation systems, our social environment, and the people living inside it. Many concerns also focus on whether such systems should be fully automated or still be partially controlled by humans. This work aims to address the new reality that is formed in autonomous shuttles mobility infrastructures as a result of the absence of the bus driver and the increased threat from terrorism in European cities. Typically, drivers are trained to handle incidents of passengers' abnormal behavior, incidents of petty crimes, and other abnormal events, according to standard procedures adopted by the transport operator. Surveillance using camera sensors as well as smart software in the bus will maximize the feeling and the actual level of security. In this paper, an online, end-to-end solution is introduced based on deep learning techniques for the timely, accurate, robust, and automatic detection of various petty crime types. The proposed system can identify abnormal passenger behavior such as vandalism and accidents but can also enhance passenger security via petty crimes detection such as aggression, bag-snatching, and vandalism. The solution achieves excellent results across different use cases and environmental conditions.

AB The development of autonomous, fast, agile small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) brings up fundamental challenges in dynamic environments with fast and agile maneuvers, unreliable state estimation, imperfect sensing, coupling action, and perception in real-time under severe resource constraints. However, autonomous drone racing is a challenging research problem at the intersection of computer vision, planning, state estimation, and control. To bridge this, we propose an approach in the context of autonomous, perception-action aware vision-based drone racing in a photorealistic environment. Our approach integrates a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with state-of-the-art path planning, state estimation, and control algorithms. The developed deep learning method is based on computer vision approaches to detecting the gates and estimating the flyable area. The planner and controller then use this information to generate a short, minimum-snap trajectory segment and send corresponding motor commands to reach the desired goal. A thorough evaluation of our proposed methodology has been carried out using the Gazebo and FlightGoggles (photorealistic sensor) environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and flies the drone more consistently than many human pilots. Moreover, we demonstrated that our proposed system successfully guided the drone through tight race courses, reaching speeds up to 7m/s of the 2019 AlphaPilot Challenge.

AB Autonomous products, which perform many functions on their own with limited user input, require users to exhibit trust at an appropriate level before use. Research in product trust has thus far focused on the product characteristics: such as manipulating the product's design-for example, anthropomorphizing an autonomous vehicle-and measuring changes in the users' trust. This study flips the usual approach and instead manipulates users' mental state through priming, and then measures users' trust to an existing autonomous product, the Amazon Echo. In this study, we used visual stimuli (images) that evoked either positive or negative emotions as affective primes to influence users' trust before interacting with the Echo. While interacting with the Echo, users evaluated its performance and how well it met their expectations. Holistically, users' perceived performance of the Echo and age had significant effects on their trust of the product, but the affective primes showed no significant effect. However, for the subgroup of participants whose expectations of the product's performance were met: those who received either positive or negative prime were more likely to trust the product than those who saw neutral images; men were more likely to trust the product than others. The study demonstrates the importance of meeting users' expectations and highlights the potential to build trust by inducing emotions contextually.

AB Lane marks on roads are among the most important items of road scene information in the process of autonomous driving, and lane-mark extraction based on visual cognitive computing is one of the most important components of advanced driving assistance systems in intelligent transportation system. Onboard cameras mounted on the front of autonomous vehicles capture road scene images from which lane marks are extracted. This paper proposes a new lane-mark extraction algorithm with four major parts. First, this paper handles the road images captured from onboard cameras by grayscale and fast median filter. Then, we exploit the characteristics of lane marks in road images as constraints to propose lane-features filter based on multi-constraints used to extract lane marks. Then, a clustering algorithm based on the double point removal of a p-least squares algorithm is proposed to cluster features, and recursive dichotomy algorithm is used to fit the candidate lane marks. Finally, we carry out verification and optimization on candidate lane marks to obtain more accurate and stable extraction results. In our experiment, we divide the common complex road scenes into four categories. The results show that the proposed method can robustly extract lane marks under various complex real conditions. This paper also proposes forward a method to evaluate the results of lane-mark extraction, and partial test results are evaluated.

AB An autonomous electrochemical system prototype for ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) measurements was efficiently done inside a 4'' x 4'' x 8'' 2U Nanoracks module at the International Space Station (ISS). This device, the Ammonia Electrooxidation Lab at the ISS (AELISS), included an autonomous electrochemical system that complied with NASA ISS nondisclosure agreements, power, safety, security, size constrain, and material compatibility established for space missions. The integrated autonomous electrochemical system was tested on-ground and deployed to the International Space Station as a "proof-of-concept" ammonia oxidation reaction testing space device. Here are discussed the results of cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements done at the ISS with a commercially available channel flow-cell with eight screen-printed electrodes, including Ag quasi-reference (Ag QRE) and carbon counter electrodes. Pt nanocubes in Carbon Vulcan XC-72R were used as the catalyst for the AOR and 2 mu L drop of Pt nanocubes/ Carbon Vulcan XC-72R, 20 wt%, ink was placed on the carbon working electrodes and allowed to dry in air. After the AELISS was prepared for launch to the ISS, a 4 days delayed (2 days in the space vehicle Antares and 2 days space transit to the ISS) cause a slight shift on the Ag QRE potential. Nevertheless, the AOR cyclic voltametric peak was observed in the ISS and showed ca. 70% current density decrease due to the buoyancy effect in agreement with previous microgravity experiments done at the zero-g aircraft.

AB Collaborative and autonomous driving vehicles combine hardware and software complex processes, also are heavily dependent on and influenced by the world of physical and cyber interactions. They have enabled many new features and advanced functionalities, such as stochastic and hybrid natures, mobile spatial topologies, and time-critical dependability. However, the existing modeling and verification techniques have not established faith in proving correctness and safety. Spatial and time collision avoidance remains crucial obstacles on the path to becoming ubiquitous and dependable. In order to ensure safety, we first design an accident prediction architecture in system design-time and run-time stages. We apply it on collaborative and autonomous overtaking systems involving spatial- and time-critical accident predictions. Then, we develop a novel and dedicated spatio-clock stochastic specification language (SCSSL) to describe safety invariants and guards in domain-specific autonomous driving systems. Next, we create the spatio-clock stochastic and hybrid automata models based on SCSSL in order to model inherently stochastic and hybrid behaviors. To illustrate the effectiveness of spatio-clock consistency stochastic specification and verification, we adopt statistical model checking natively to provide reliable predictions for the incoming collision instants and positions. Finally, we present an illustrative overtaking case study to verify spatio-clock stochastic and hybrid related properties and ensure correct modeling, and demonstrate the significance of our proposed approach.

AB Motion planning is one of the most significant technologies for autonomous driving. To make motion planning models able to learn from the environment and to deal with emergency situations, a new motion planning framework called as "parallel planning" is proposed in this paper. In order to generate sufficient and various training samples, artificial traffic scenes are firstly constructed based on the knowledge from the reality. A deep planning model which combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the Long Short-Term Memory module (LSTM) is developed to make planning decisions in an end-toend mode. This model can learn from both real and artificial traffic scenes and imitate the driving style of human drivers. Moreover, a parallel deep reinforcement learning approach is also presented to improve the robustness of planning model and reduce the error rate. To handle emergency situations, a hybrid generative model including a variational auto-encoder (VAE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN) is utilized to learn from virtual emergencies generated in artificial traffic scenes. While an autonomous vehicle is moving, the hybrid generative model generates multiple video clips in parallel, which correspond to different potential emergency scenarios. Simultaneously, the deep planning model makes planning decisions for both virtual and current real scenes. The final planning decision is determined by analysis of real observations. Leveraging the parallel planning approach, the planner is able to make rational decisions without heavy calculation burden when an emergency occurs.

AB Accurate scene understanding from multiple sensors mounted on cars is a key requirement for autonomous driving systems. Nowadays, this task is mainly performed through data-hungry deep learning techniques that need very large amounts of data to be trained. Due to the high cost of performing segmentation labeling, many synthetic datasets have been proposed. However, most of them miss the multi-sensor nature of the data, and do not capture the significant changes introduced by the variation of daytime and weather conditions. To fill these gaps, we introduce SELMA, a novel synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation that contains more than 30K unique waypoints acquired from 24 different sensors including RGB, depth, semantic cameras and LiDARs, in 27 different weather and daytime conditions, for a total of more than 20M samples. SELMA is based on CARLA, an open-source simulator for generating synthetic data in autonomous driving scenarios, that we modified to increase the variability and the diversity in the scenes and class sets, and to align it with other benchmark datasets. As shown by the experimental evaluation, SELMA allows the efficient training of standard and multi-modal deep learning architectures, and achieves remarkable results on real-world data. SELMA is free and publicly available, thus supporting open science and research.

AB Recently, the market has witnessed the emergence of intelligent vehicles equipped with diverse functionalities. Among these are connected automated vehicles (CAVs) boasting a comprehensive platooning capability, and connected vehicles (CVs), which essentially refer to human-driven vehicles (HVs) equipped with connectivity features. As a result, CAVs, CVs, and regular human-driven vehicles (RVs) will form a mixed CAV-CV-RV flow to affect stability of existing traffic flow, which is an important characteristic of traffic flow operations. This paper investigates stability of this new mixed CAV-CV-RV flow, explores effect of CVs on stability, and proposes CV management strategy aimed at achieving a stable traffic flow. We firstly establish definition of the novel mixed flow comprising CAVs, CVs, and RVs. Subsequently, we present a general analytical approach for evaluating stability of this mixed flow. Then we undertake an empirical study that incorporates car-following models, validated using real experiments involving the aforementioned vehicle types. Based on findings from our stability analysis, we proceed to propose a CV management strategy designed to guarantee stable conditions within this mixed traffic flow. Results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed general analytical method in assessing influences of various system factors on stability of this new mixed flow. Subsequent to an application of the analytical method, empirical study uncovers a noteworthy finding that CVs prove to be more effective than CAVs in ensuring stable conditions within the mixed flow. Then we can manage market proportion of CVs in order to achieve stable mixed flow, according to varying CAV penetration rates. Specifically, some interesting lessons are learned based on the empirical study: (i) to guarantee stable operations of mixed traffic flow, about one third of CVs are needed to be among HVs, before CAVs running on road (CV-RV mixed flow); (ii) management strategy for stable flow requires an increase of minimum CV proportion among HVs from 33% to 55%, as CAV penetration rates increase up to 50%; (iii) when CAV penetration rates are greater than 50%, the required minimum CV proportion for ensuring traffic flow stability decreases with the increase of CAV penetration rates.

AB There has been considerable interest in the active maneuvers made by a small number of vehicles to improve macroscopic traffic flows. Jam-absorption driving (JAD) is a single vehicle's maneuvers to remove a wide moving jam and consists of two actions. First, a vehicle upstream of the jam slows down and maintains a low velocity. Because it cuts off the supply of vehicles to the jam, the jam shrinks and finally disappears. Second, it returns to following the vehicle ahead of it. One of the critical problems of JAD is the occurrence of secondary jams. The perturbations caused by JAD actions may grow into secondary jams due to the instability of traffic flows. The occurrence of secondary jams was investigated by numerical simulations in non-periodic systems where only human-driven vehicles are placed upstream of the vehicle performing JAD. However, no theoretical condition has been proposed to restrict secondary jams in these systems. This paper presents a theoretical condition restricting secondary jams in a semi-infinite system composed of a vehicle performing JAD and the other humandriven vehicles obeying a car-following model on a non-periodic and single-lane road. In constructing this condition, we apply the linear string stability to a macroscopic spatiotemporal structure of JAD. Numerical simulations show that a finite version of this condition restricts secondary jams. Moreover, under this condition, we demonstrate that it is possible to restrict secondary jams in the semi-infinite system under wide ranges of the parameters of the system. We also extend this condition to a condition with a time lag for estimating the characteristics of the jam, and reveal the influence of the time lag on the behavior of the system. Furthermore, we construct the conditions suppressing secondary jams in other semi-infinite systems with inflows from other lanes or a bottleneck, and demonstrate that JAD can restrict secondary jams in these systems. Thus, our method theoretically guarantees that a single vehicle can improve macroscopic traffic flows. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial agents are used in autonomous systems such as autonomous vehicles, autonomous robotics, and autonomous drones to make predictions based on data generated by fusing the values from many sources such as different sensors. Malfunctioning of sensors was noticed in the robotics domain. The correct observation from sensors corresponds to the true estimate of the dimension value of the state vector in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Hence, noisy estimates from these sensors lead to dimensionality impairment in the state. DRL policies have shown to stagger its decision by the wrong choice of action in case of adversarial attack or modeling error. Hence, it is necessary to examine the effect of dimensionality perturbation on neural policy. In this regard, we analyze whether subtle dimensionality perturbation that occurs due to the noise in the source of input at the testing time distracts agent decisions. Also, we propose an RSAC (robust soft actor-critic) approach that uses a noisy state for prediction, and estimates target from nominal observation. We find that the injection of such noisy input during training will not hamper learning. We have done our simulation in the OpenAI gym MuJoCo (Walker2d-V2) environment and our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach competes for SAC's performance and makes it robust to test time dimensionality perturbation.

AB The paper explores via simulation analysis how multianticipative adaptive cruise control (M-ACC) can address traffic oscillations with respect to cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) approaches. The work is grounded on our previous findings where we suggested a functioning logic and a performance characterization of M-ACC. That activity followed a manufacturer's claim that vehicles capable of reacting to more than one leader ahead are already populating public roads. In this light, M-ACC represents an intermediate solution between the traditional ACC, which typically is capable of reacting to only one vehicle ahead, and connectivity-enhanced approaches, which in principle could track multiple leaders. Given that M-ACC is effective from small penetration rates-as it does not require the presence of other M-ACC-equipped vehicles to reach its full potential-performance comparison with CACC is not straightforward. In particular, for a fair comparison it is necessary to quantify the performance gap as a function of the penetration rate, which is exactly the objective of this paper. Three CACC topologies are investigated and both stochastic simulations and Pareto analyses are performed. The results demonstrate that, for small market penetration figures, M-ACC can still guarantee better performances than any CACC heterogenous platoons for all the metrics considered given that it does not require infrastructure or other adjacent vehicles featuring the same technology. Considering that the market adoption of connectivity-based solutions is facing challenging practical issues, M-ACC could represent a suitable as well as realistic option to harvest the benefits of automation to traffic flow in the near future.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The problems related to traffic coordination in intersections are quite common in large cities. Current solutions are based on the utilization of static priorities (i.e. yield signs), on variable signaling like traffic lights, or even on the physical modification of the road structures by transforming intersections in roundabouts. The emergence, evolution, and consolidation of technologies that enable the paradigm of connected and autonomous vehicles have allowed the development of new solutions where the vehicles' coordination follow a preset path without stopping when entering the intersections. In this work, we propose using a genetic algorithm with variable-length chromosomes to solve the vehicle coordination multipath problem in intersections. The proposed algorithm is focused on optimizing the vehicles' arrival sequencing according to preset flow rates. While other solutions assume the same flow rates in every branch of the intersection, in our proposal the traffic flows can be asymmetric. We extend one of the existent intersection models, based on fixed paths, to allow multiple paths. This means that each vehicle can go from any input point to any output branch in the intersection. Moreover, we have designed specific selection, crossover and mutation operators, and a new methodology to carry out the crossover function between different sized individuals, which are adapted to the specific peculiarities of the problem. Our proposal has been validated by carrying out tests using input data with known solutions and with random data. The results have been compared with systems based on other optimizers, obtaining improved results in the fitness outcome up to 9.1%, and up to 126% in computation time.

   Visual Evidence
AB The perception and the interpretation of the vehicle's surrounding are the core modules in any advanced driving assistance system, and the first two stages of every autonomous driving solution. The purpose of the perception stage is to assess the state of the relevant objects (objects' positions, shape, class, orientation, speed) using the primary sensorial information. The purpose of the interpretation stage is to use the objects assessment in order to achieve situation assessment, that is, identification of the instantaneous relations between the traffic environment elements as well as their evolution in time. The work presented in this article lies within the interpretation layer; our aim is to identify on which of the road's lanes is the ego-vehicle currently traveling. We refer to the own vehicle as the ego-vehicle and to its current driving lane as the ego-lane. The ego-vehicle is equipped with a stereovision perception system, and the proposed solution is to identify the ego-lane number by matching the visually detected lane landmarks with the corresponding map landmarks, available from an original extended digital map. Additionally, the visually detected vehicles are used for ego-lane number identification. The proposed solution is a probabilistic one, in the form of a Bayesian network, which uses as evidence the visual cues provided by the stereovision perception system. In order to incorporate the dynamic nature of the problem, a temporal dimension was added to the network, resulting in a dynamic Bayesian model. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method in complex situations, and the improved efficiency of the dynamic approach over the static one.

AB With the increasingly connected nature of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), new attack vectors are emerging that were previously not considered in the design process. Specifically, autonomous vehicles are one of the most at risk CPS applications, including challenges such as a large amount of legacy software, non-trusted third party applications, and remote communication interfaces. With zero day vulnerabilities constantly being discovered, an attacker can exploit such vulnerabilities to inject malicious code or even leverage existing legitimate code to take over the cyber part of a CPS. Due to the tightly coupled nature of CPS, this can lead to altering physical behavior in an undesirable or devastating manner. Therefore, it is no longer effective to reactively harden systems, but a more proactive approach must be taken. Moving target defense (MTD) techniques such as instruction set randomization (ISR), and address space randomization (ASR) have been shown to be effective against code injection and code reuse attacks. However, these MID techniques can result in control system crashing which is unacceptable in CPS applications since such crashing may cause catastrophic consequences. Therefore, it is crucial for MTD techniques to be complemented by control reconfiguration to maintain system availability in the event of a cyberattack. This paper addresses the problem of maintaining system and security properties of a CPS under attack by integrating moving target defense techniques, as well as detection, and recovery mechanisms to ensure safe, reliable, and predictable system operation. Specifically, we consider the problem of detecting code injection as well as code reuse attacks, and reconfiguring fast enough to ensure the safety and stability of autonomous vehicle controllers are maintained. By using MTD such as ISR, and ASR, our approach provides the advantage of preventing attackers from obtaining the reconnaissance knowledge necessary to perform code injection and code reuse attacks, making sure attackers can't find vulnerabilities in the first place. Our system implementation includes a combination of runtime MTD utilizing AES 256 ISR and fine grained ASR, as well as control management that utilizes attack detection, and reconfiguration capabilities. We evaluate the developed security architecture in an autonomous vehicle case study, utilizing a custom developed hardware-in-the-loop testbed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spacecraft autonomous relative navigation is widely required in the field of on-orbit services. In previous works, it has been shown that the monocular sequential images (MSIs) is a cost-effective autonomous relative navigation method. However, given the lack of size and initial orbit of noncooperative targets, the relative navigation system (RNS) with MSIs cannot ensure to estimate the entire relative motion states during the whole observation process. It is critical to perform an online observability analysis for RNS with MSIs to ensure autonomous relative motion estimation validity and accuracy. An analytical nonlinear observability analysis method is proposed in this article to improve the computational efficiency. We study the attributes of the relative orbit dynamics model and Lie algebra operations, and find that the observability matrix is only related to the limited states. The relationship among those states, rank, and the Frobenius norm of observability matrix is demonstrated, which simplify the observability criteria conditions and the degree measurements in analytical forms. In addition, based on the proposed method, we analyze the influence of the orbital manifolds on the observability degree of RNS with MSIs. Several suggestions are proposed for orbital manifolds detecting. The conclusion is a theoretical supplement to the past numerical research results. Finally, we implement the numerical simulations, and the current study's findings verified the effectiveness of the proposed observability analysis method.

AB Many Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) need to cope with hazardous underwater medium using a limited computational capacity while facing unknown kinematics and disturbances. However, most algorithms proposed for navigation in such conditions fail to fulfil all conditions at the same time. In this work, we propose an optimal control method, based on a receding horizon approach, namely MPC (Model Predictive Control). Our model also estimates the kinematics of the medium and its disturbances, using efficient tools that rely on the use of linear algebra and first-order optimization methods. We also test our ideas using an extensive set of simulations, which show that the proposed ideas are very competitive in terms of cost and computational efficiency in cases of total and partial observability.

AB We propose an integrated learning and planning framework that leverages knowledge from a human user along with prior information about the environment to generate trajectories for scientific data collection in marine environments. The proposed framework combines principles from probabilistic planning with nonparametric uncertainty modeling to refine trajectories for execution by autonomous vehicles. These trajectories are informed by a utility function learned from the human operator's implicit preferences using a modified coactive learning algorithm. The resulting techniques allow for user-specified trajectories to be modified for reduced risk of collision and increased reliability. We test our approach in two marine monitoring domains and show that the proposed framework mimics human-planned trajectories while also reducing the risk of operation. This work provides insight into the tools necessary for combining human input with vehicle navigation to provide persistent autonomy.

AB Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technology, although in the development stage, is quickly expanding throughout the vehicle market. However, full market penetration will most likely require considerable planning as key stakeholders, manufacturers, consumers and governing agencies work together to determine optimal deployment strategies. Specifically, road safety is a critical challenge to the widespread deployment and adoption of this disruptive technology. During the transition period fleets will be composed of a combination of CAVs and conventional vehicles, and therefore it is imperative to investigate the repercussions of CAVs on traffic safety at different penetration rates. Since crash severity and frequency in conjunction reflect traffic safety, this study attempts to investigate the effect of CAVs on both crash severity and frequency through a microsimulation modelling exercise. VISSM microsimulation platform is used to simulate a case study of the M1 Geelong Ring Road network (Princes Freeway) in Victoria, Australia. Network performance is evaluated using performance metrics (Total System Travel Time, Delay) and kinematic variables (Speed, acceleration, jerk rate). Surrogate safety measures (time to collision, post encroachment time, etc.) are examined to inspect the safety in the network. The results indicate that the introduction of CAVs does not achieve the expected decrease in crash severity and rates involving manual vehicles, despite the improvement in network performance, given the demand and the set of parameters used in our operational CAV algorithm are intact. Additionally, the study identifies that the safety benefits of CAVs are not proportional to CAV penetration, and full-scale benefits of CAVs can only be achieved at 100 % CAV penetration. Further, considering network efficiency as a performance metric and total crash rate involving conventional vehicles as a safety metric, a Pareto frontier is extracted, for varying CAV operational behaviour. The results presented in this study provide insights into the impacts of CAVs on traffic safety valuable for insurance companies and other industry participants, enabling safety-related services and more enterprising business models.

AB Sophisticated modeling and simulation, based on rigid and flexible multibody dynamics, are nowadays a standard procedure in the design and analysis of vehicle systems and are widely adopted for on-road driving. Off-road driving for both terrestrial wheeled and tracked vehicles, as well as wheeled and legged robots and rovers for extra-terrestrial exploration pose additional modeling and simulation challenges, a primary one being that of the vehicle-terrain interaction, modeling of deformable terrain, and terramechanics in general. Techniques for modeling deformable terrain span an entire range varying in complexity, representation accuracy, and ensuing computational effort. While formulations such as fully resolved granular dynamics, continuum representation of granular material, or finite element can provide a high level of accuracy, they do so at a significant cost, even when the implementation leverages parallel computing and/or hardware accelerators. Real-time or faster than real-time terramechanics is a highly desired capability (in applications such as training of autonomous vehicles and robotic systems) or critical capability (in applications such as human-in-the-loop or hardware-in-the-loop). We present a real-time capable deformable soil implementation, extended from the soil contact model (SCM) developed at the German Aerospace Center which in turn can be viewed as a generalization of the Bekker-Wong and Janosi-Hanamoto semi-empirical models for soil interaction with arbitrary three-dimensional shapes and arbitrary contact patches. This SCM implementation is available, alongside more computationally intensive deformable soil representations, in the open-source multiphysics package Chrono. We describe the overall implementation and the features of the Chrono SCM model, the efficient underlying data structures, the current multicore parallelization aspects, and its scalability properties for concurrent simulation of multiple vehicles on deformable terrain.

   This paper proposes a deep-learning-based vehicle detection technique that can achieve effective detection performance under extreme illumination conditions. The technique can be used in on-road driver assistance tools and autonomous vehicles.
   Abstract Most object detection models cannot achieve satisfactory performance under nighttime and other insufficient illumination conditions, which may be due to the collection of data sets and typical labeling conventions. Public data sets collected for object detection are usually photographed with sufficient ambient lighting. However, their labeling conventions typically focus on clear objects and ignore blurry and occluded objects. Consequently, the detection performance levels of traditional vehicle detection techniques are limited in nighttime environments without sufficient illumination. When objects occupy a small number of pixels and the existence of crucial features is infrequent, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) may suffer from serious information loss due to the fixed number of convolutional operations. This study presents solutions for data collection and the labeling convention of nighttime data to handle various types of situations, including in-vehicle detection. Moreover, the study proposes a specifically optimized system based on the Faster region-based CNN model. The system has a processing speed of 16 frames per second for 500 x 375-pixel images, and it achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.8497 in our validation segment involving urban nighttime and extremely inadequate lighting conditions. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed methods can achieve high detection performance in various nighttime environments, such as urban nighttime conditions with insufficient illumination, and extremely dark conditions with nearly no lighting. The proposed system outperforms original methods that have an mAP value of approximately 0.2.

AB Vehicular edge networks involve edge servers that are close to mobile devices to provide extra computation resource to complete the computation tasks of mobile devices with low latency and high reliability. Considerable efforts on computation offloading in vehicular edge networks have been developed to reduce the energy consumption and computation latency, in which roadside units (RSUs) are usually considered as the fixed edge servers (FESs). Nonetheless, the computation offloading with considering mobile vehicles as mobile edge servers (MESs) in vehicular edge networks still needs to be further investigated. To this end, in this article, we propose a Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based computation offloading with mobile vehicles in vehicular edge computing, namely, Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based computation offloading scheme (DRL-COMV), in which some vehicles (such as autonomous vehicle) are deployed and considered as the MESs that move in vehicular edge networks and cooperate with FESs to provide extra computation resource for mobile devices, in order to assist in completing the computation tasks of these mobile devices with great Quality of Experience (QoE) (i.e., low latency) for mobile devices. Particularly, the computation offloading model with considering both mobile and FESs is conducted to achieve the computation tasks offloading through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, and a collaborative route planning is considered for these MESs to move in vehicular edge networks with objective of improving efficiency of computation offloading. Then, a Deep-Reinforcement-Learning approach with designing rational reward function is proposed to determine the effective computation offloading strategies for multiple mobile devices and multiple edge servers with objective of maximizing both QoE (i.e., low latency) for mobile devices. Through performance evaluations, our results show that our proposed DRL-COMV scheme can achieve a great convergence and stability. Additionally, our results also demonstrate that our DRL-COMV scheme also can achieve better both QoE and task offloading requests hit ratio for mobile devices in comparison with existing approaches (i.e., DDPG, IMOPSOQ, and GABDOS).

AB This article considers human-autonomy teams (HATs) in which two human team members interact and collaborate with an autonomous teammate to achieve a common task while dealing with unexpected technological failures that were imposed either in automation or autonomy. A Wizard of Oz methodology is used to simulate the autonomous teammate. One of the critical aspects of HAT performance is the trust that develops over time as team members interact with each other in a dynamic task environment. For this reason, it is important to examine the dynamic nature of teammate trust through real-time measures of team interactions. This article examines team interaction and trust to understand better how they change under automation and autonomy failures. Thus, we address two research questions: 1) How does trust in HATs evolve over time?; and 2) How is the relationship between team interaction and trust impacted by the failures? We hypothesize that trust in HATs will decrease as autonomy failures increase. We also hypothesize that team interaction would be related to the development of trust and recovery from the failures. The results implicate three general trends: 1) team interaction dynamics are linked to the development of trust in HATs; 2) trust in the autonomous teammate is only associated with recovery from autonomy failures; 3) team interaction dynamics are related to both automation and autonomy failure recovery.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB It is generally accepted that systems composed of multiple aerial robots with autonomous cooperation capabilities can assist responders in many search and rescue (SAR) scenarios. In most of the previous research work, the aerial robots are mainly considered as platforms for environmental sensing and have not been used to assist victims. In this paper, outdoor field experiments of transportation and accurate deployment of loads with single/multiple autonomous aerial vehicles are presented. This is a novel feature that opens the possibility to use aerial robots to assist victims during rescue phase operations. Accuracy in the deployment location is a critical issue in SAR scenarios in which injured people may have very limited mobility. The presented system is composed of up to three small-size helicopters and features cooperative sensing, using several different sensor types. The system supports several forms of cooperative actuation as well, ranging from the cooperative deployment of small sensors/objects to the coupled transportation of slung loads. The complete system is described, outlining the hardware and software framework used, as well as the approaches for modeling and control used. Additionally, the results of several flight field experiments are presented, including a description of the worldwide first successful autonomous load transportation experiment, using three coupled small-size helicopters (conducted in December 2007). During these experiments strong, steady winds and wind gusts were present. Various solutions and lessons learned from the design and operation of the system are also provided.

DE Guidance; Navigation; Control; Underactuated system; Autonomous system;

AB An integrated guidance and feedback control scheme for steering an underactuated vehicle through desired waypoints in three-dimensional space, is developed here. The underactuated vehicle is modeled as a rigid body with four control inputs. These control inputs actuate the three degrees of freedom of rotational motion and one degree of freedom of translational motion in a vehicle body-fixed coordinate frame. This actuation model is appropriate for a wide range of underactuated vehicles including spacecraft with internal attitude actuators, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, fixed-wing multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), maneuverable robotic vehicles, etc. The guidance problem is developed on the special Euclidean group of rigid body motions, SE(3), in the framework ofgeometric mechanics, which represents the vehicle dynamics globally on this configuration manifold. The integrated guidance and control algorithm selects the desired trajectory for the translational motion that passes through the given waypoints, and the desired trajectory for the attitude based on the desired thrust direction to achieve the translational motion trajectory. A feedback control law is then obtained to steer the underactuated vehicle towards the desired trajectories in translation and rotation. This integrated guidance and control scheme takes into account known bounds on control inputs and generates a trajectory that is continuous and at least twice differentiable, which can be implemented with continuous and bounded control inputs. The integrated guidance and feedback control scheme is applied to an underactuated quadcopter UAV to autonomously generate a trajectory through a series of given waypoints in SE(3) and track the desired trajectory in finite time. The overall stability analysis of the feedback system is addressed. Discrete time models for the dynamics and control schemes of the UAV are obtained in the form of Lie group variational integrators using the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. Almost global asymptotic stability of the feedback system over its state space is shown analytically and verified through numerical simulations.

AB In recent years, Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) has attracted a lot of attention as it plays a crucial role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Accurate and efficient VMMR systems are required in real-world applications including intelligent surveillance and autonomous driving. The paper introduces a new large-scale dataset and a novel deep learning paradigm for VMMR. A new large-scale dataset dubbed Diverse large-scale VMM (DVMM) is proposed collecting image-samples with the most popular vehicle brands operating in Europe. A novel VMMR framework is proposed which follows a two-branch architecture performing make and model recognition respectively. A two-stage training procedure and a novel decision module are proposed to process the make and model predictions and compute the final model prediction. In addition, a novel metric based on the true positive rate is proposed to compare classification confusion of the proposed 2B-2S and the baseline methods. A complex experimental validation is carried out, demonstrating the generality, diversity, and practicality of the proposed DVMM dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed framework provides 93.95% accuracy over the more diverse DVMM dataset and 95.85% accuracy over traditional VMMR datasets. The proposed two-branch approach outperforms the conventional one-branch approach for VMMR over small-, medium-, and large-scale datasets by providing lower vehicle model confusion and reduced inter-make ambiguity. The paper demonstrates the advantages of the proposed two-branch VMMR paradigm in terms of robustness and lower confusion relative to single-branch designs.

AB Autonomous vehicles are becoming a reality in places with advanced infrastructure to support their operations. In crowded places, harsh environments, missions that require these vehicles to be aware of the context in which they are operating, and situations requiring continuous coordination with humans such as in disaster relief, advanced-vehicle systems (AVSs) need to be better contextually aware. The vast literature referring to "context-aware systems'' is still sparse, focusing on very limited forms of contextual awareness. It requires a structured approach to bring it together to truly realize contextual awareness in AVSs. This paper uses a human-AVSs (HAVSs) lens to polarize the literature in a coherent form suitable for designing distributed HAVSs. We group the relevant literature into two categories: contextual-awareness related to the vehicle infrastructure itself that enables AVSs to operate, and contextual-awareness related to HAVSs. The former category focuses on the communication backbone for AVSs including ad-hoc networks, services, wireless communication, radio systems, and the cyber security and privacy challenges that arise in these contexts. The latter category covers recommender systems, which are used to coordinate the actions that sit at the interface of the human and AVSs, human-machine interaction issues, and the activity recognition systems as the enabling technology for recommender systems to operate autonomously. The structured analysis of the literature has identified a number of open research questions and opportunities for further research in this area.

AB The capability of following a moving target in an environment with obstacles is required as a basic and necessary function for realizing an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Many target following scenarios involve a follower and target vehicles that may have different maneuvering capabilities. Moreover, the follower vehicle may not have prior information about the intended motion of the target boat. This paper presents a trajectory planning and tracking approach for following a differentially constrained target vehicle operating in an obstacle field. The developed approach includes a novel algorithm for computing a desired pose and surge speed in the vicinity of the target boat, jointly defined as a motion goal, and tightly integrates it with trajectory planning and tracking components of the entire system. The trajectory planner generates a dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectory to allow the USV to safely reach the computed motion goal. Trajectory planning needs to be sufficiently fast and yet produce dynamically feasible and short trajectories due to the moving target. This required speeding up the planning by searching for trajectories through a hybrid, pose-position state space using a multi-resolution control action set. The search in the velocity space is decoupled from the search for a trajectory in the pose space. Therefore, the underlying trajectory tracking controller computes desired surge speed for each segment of the trajectory and ensures that the USV maintains it. We have carried out simulation as well as experimental studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.

AB In the actual traffic, there are not only cars, but also buses, trucks and other vehicles. These vehicles with different maximum speeds or security headway or both are interspersed irregularly to form a heterogeneous traffic flow. In addition, most of the maximum speed of modern cars is hardly affected by gradients due to the fact that the car engine and brakes are rarely operated at their max while the maximum speed of trucks is affected. Considering that the performance of various types of vehicles is multifarious and the vehicles sometimes drive on the road with slopes, a novel two-lane lattice hydrodynamic model on a gradient road considering heterogeneous traffic flow is proposed in this paper. In order to verify the rationality of the model, the linear stability analysis is carried out first, that is, the linear stability conditions are derived from the linear stability theory and the stability curve is drawn accordingly. The results of the above analysis prove that the three factors studied in this paper, namely, time lane change, slope and mixing of different types of vehicles, all have a significant influence on the stability of traffic flow. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation is deduced by the nonlinear analysis method, which can describe the propagation characteristics of the traffic density waves near the critical point. Last but not least, the numerical simulation for new model is conducted and the numerical simulation results obtained are in good agreement with theoretical ones. In summary, increasing the lane changing rate or the slope on the uphill can improve the traffic flow stability. What is more, increasing the slope can lower the traffic flow stability on the downhill. Finally, in the heterogeneous traffic flow of different types of vehicles, the vehicles with larger security headway will make traffic flow difficult to stabilize, as do the vehicles with larger maximum speed.

AB In the foreseeable future, the traffic stream will be likely mixed with connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles (RVs). In the mixed traffic environment, when following a RV, due to the lack of vehicle-to-vehicle communications, it may take longer time for a CAV to sense and react than a human driver, which results in longer time headway and the loss of highway throughput. To address such a connectivity gap, this paper investigates an infrastructure-based solution, i.e., the deployment of roadside units to help CAVs in the heterogeneous traffic stream. Specifically, it is envisioned that these roadside units can sense vehicles in their coverage areas and provide the beyond-line-of-sight motion information to CAVs to empower them to react proactively, as they would do when following other CAVs. This paper is devoted to the analysis of the impacts of this type of roadside units at a strategic planning stage. In doing so, we first derive an analytical link performance function to capture their impact on the link capacity and travel time, and then develop a network equilibrium model to gauge their effect on travelers' route choices and thus the flow distribution of both RVs and CAVs across the whole network. This modeling development will allow us to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for a given deployment plan of roadside units. For fair analyses, we further develop an optimization model to determine the optimal deployment plan for a given budget, while focusing on the worst case of its impact, because the flow distribution resulting from our network equilibrium model is not unique. Such a model provides a conservative estimate of the benefit brought by roadside units. Lastly, we offer case studies to demonstrate the models and unveil the potential of such an infrastructure-based solution.

AB Driving in low visibility conditions (night time; fog or heavy precipitation) is particularly challenging task with an increased probability of traffic accidents and possible injuries. Road Nail is a solar powered intelligent road marking system of wirelessly networked signaling devices that improve driver safety in low visibility conditions along hazardous roadways. Nails or signaling devices are autonomous nodes with capability to accumulate energy; exchange wireless messages, detect approaching vehicles and emit signalization light. We have built an experimental test-bed that consists of 20 nodes and a cellular gateway. Implementation details of the above system, including extensive measurements and performance evaluations in realistic field deployments are presented. A novel distributed network topology discovery scheme is proposed which integrates both sensor and wireless communication aspects, where nodes act autonomously. Finally, integration of the Road Nail system with the cellular network and the Internet is described.

AB Basic tasks for navigation of autonomous vehicles can be performed as reactive behaviors, that directly map sensory data into control commands with no need of internal representations. Fuzzy systems can efficiently realize such a direct mapping by means of comprehensible linguistic rules. Automatic learning of rules from representative data simplifies the programming of the control system especially when dealing with dynamically changing environments. We present two methods for the automatic extraction of fuzzy rules from numerical data acquired by recording the choices of a human operator driving the vehicle in representative training situations. They are applied to build a reactive wall-follower, the first component of a more articulated control system for indoor navigation of a TRC Labmate mobile robot. The produced wall-followers are compared in terms of complexity and quality of behavior in actual navigation runs of the robot along arbitrarily shaped walls.

AB Accurate estimation of the tire slip ratio is critical for vehicle safety, as it is necessary for vehicle control purposes. In this paper, an intelligent tire system is presented to develop a novel slip ratio estimation model using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The accelerations, generated by a triaxial accelerometer installed onto the inner liner of the tire, are varied when the tire rotates to update the contact patch. Meanwhile, the reference value of slip ratio can be measured by the MTS Flat-Trac tire test platform. Then, by analyzing the variation between the accelerations and slip ratio, highly useful features are discovered, which are especially promising for assessing vertical acceleration. For these features, ML algorithms are trained to build the slip ratio estimation model, in which the ML algorithms include artificial neural networks (ANNs), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), random forests (RFs), and support vector machines (SVMs). Finally, the estimated NRMS errors are evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation (CV). The proposed estimation model is able to estimate the slip ratio continuously and stably using only the acceleration from the intelligent tire system, and the estimated slip ratio range can reach 30%. The estimation results have high robustness to vehicle velocity and load, where the best NRMS errors can reach 4.88%. In summary, the present study with the fusion of an intelligent tire system and machine learning paves the way for the accurate estimation of the tire slip ratio under different driving conditions, which creates new opportunities for autonomous vehicles, intelligent tires, and tire slip ratio estimation.

AB This article presents a string stable controller for the autonomous operation of a platoon of Heavy Commercial Road Vehicles (HCRVs) in a connected environment. This study considers factors such as brake/powertrain actuator dynamics, resistive forces, tyre model and wheel dynamics, which are crucial during on-road operation of HCRVs. A nonlinear vehicle dynamic model encompassing all these factors has been considered. The dependency between aerodynamic drag and inter-vehicular distance in the platoon has also been taken into account. The aforementioned factors motivated the use of Sliding Mode Control (SMC), which is a nonlinear and robust control technique. A lower level Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller has been successfully integrated with SMC to compensate for pneumatic brake and powertrain system delay. The designed controller was evaluated for string stable platoon operation by considering various road conditions, load conditions and operating speeds. It was observed that the string stable controller performance is highly dependent on the operating conditions. To ensure string stable operation for different operating scenarios, an adaptive time-headway based enhancement has also been integrated in the controller design. The efficacy of the proposed adaptive time-headway policy over the existing constant time-headway policy has been methodically analysed and a performance comparison between them has also been presented. The aspect of communication delay during connected vehicular operation has also been studied and the maximum tolerable communication delay magnitude for maintaining string stable operation has also been presented.

AB This study is devoted to developing a platoon-based cooperative lane-change control (PB-CLC). It coordinates the trajectories of a CAV platoon under a platoon-centered platooning control to accommodate the CAV lane-change requests from its adjacent lane, aiming to reduce the negative traffic impacts on the platoon resulting from lane-change maneuvers, on the premise of ensuring CAVs' safety and mobility. Mathematically, the PB-CLC control is established using a hybrid model predictive control (MPC) system. The hybrid MPC system involves an MPC-based mixed integer nonlinear programming optimizer (MINLP-MPC) for optimal lane-change decisions, which considers multiple objectives such as traffic smoothness, driving comfort and lane-change response promptness subject to vehicle dynamics and safety constraints. To ensure the feasible lane-change, this study investigates and provides a lower bound of the lane-change time window by analyzing the MINLP-MPC model feasibility. Apart from the optimal lane-change decision consideration, the hybrid MPC system is well designed to ensure the control continuity and smoothness. In particular, the hybrid MPC system control feasibility and stability are proved to enable the platoon's back-and-forth state switchings between car-following and lane-change accommodation states. Next, we developed a machine learning aided distributed branch and bound algorithm (ML-DBB) to solve the MINLP-MPC model within a control sampling time interval (< 1 second). Specifically, built upon computer simulation and the c-LHS sampling technique, supervised machine learning models are developed offline to predict a reduced solution space of the integer variables, which is further integrated into the distributed branch and bound method to solve the MINLP-MPC model efficiently online. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and applicability of the ML-DBB algorithm and the PB-CLC control.

AB As vehicle driving evolves from human-controlled to autonomous, human-machine interaction ensures intuitive usage as well as the feedback from vehicle occupants to the machine for optimising controls. The feedback also improves understanding of the user satisfaction with the system behaviour, which is crucial for determining user trust and, hence, the acceptance of the new functionalities that aim to improve mobility solutions and increase road safety. Trust and acceptance are potentially the crucial parameters for determining the success of autonomous driving deployment in wider society. Hence, there is a need to define appropriate and measurable parameters to be able to quantify trust and acceptance in a physically safe environment using dependable methods. This study seeks to support technical developments and data gathering with psychology to determine the degree to which humans trust automated driving functionalities. The primary aim is to define if the usage of an advanced driving simulator can improve consumer trust and acceptance of driving automation through tailor-made studies. We also seek to measure significant differences in responses from different demographic groups. The study employs tailor-made driving scenarios to gather feedback on trust, usability and user workload of 55 participants monitoring the vehicle behaviour and environment during the automated drive. Participants' subjective ratings are gathered before and after the simulator session. Results show a significant increase in trust ensuing the exposure to the driving automation functionalities. We quantify this increase resulting from the usage of the driving simulator. Those less experienced with driving automation show a higher increase in trust and, therefore, profit more from the exercise. This appears to be linked to the demanded participant workload, as we establish a link between workload and trust. The findings provide a noteworthy contribution to quantifying the method of evaluating and ensuring user acceptance of driving automation. It is only through the increase of trust and consequent improvement of user acceptance that the introduction of the driving automation into wider society will be a guaranteed success.

AB Underwater mobile sensor networks such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) or robots are envisioned to enable applications for oceanographic data collection, environmental and pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, and distributed tactical surveillance. These applications require running compute-and data-intensive algorithms that go beyond the capabilities of the individual AUVs that are involved in a mission. To execute these task-parallel algorithms in resource-and time-constrained environments, dynamic and reliable collaboration between local networked robots (e.g., AUVs) and remote public Clouds is needed. To this end, the heterogeneous sensing, computing, communication, and storage capabilities of local and remote resources are exploited to form a "loosely coupled" mobile Cloud, and a novel resource provisioning engine that dynamically takes decisions on "what" and "where" the tasks should be executed in the mobile Cloud is introduced. Comparison of benefits of collaboration between local and Cloud resources with purely local and centralized approaches are presented through exhaustive computer simulations.
   Note to Practitioners-The mission length and operations of any underwater application such as data collection, environmental monitoring, and undersea exploration are severely limited by battery capacity of AUVs. During the course of a mission, many computation-intensive tasks have to be executed, along with establishing communication with other vehicles in the team, which leads to further consumption of battery capacity. In this paper, a communication framework is introduced that expands the resources (computation and data resources) available to the team of AUVs by including public Clouds. A public Cloud consists in a set of networked computers that provide a range of computation and storage resources on demand and at a nominal price. A resource provisioning engine is designed to share the workload between local and Cloud resources based on communication cost, computation cost, and battery capacity. Such a framework enables increasing the lifetime of vehicles, execution of tasks with higher accuracy, and exploitation of any external information in the Cloud that is not available to a team of AUVs in the field.

AB Excessive steepness of grasslands, hills, or uneven terrain presents difficulties for farming with large conventional equipment. Therefore, a fleet of Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGV) is proposed to perform primary agricultural operations on high sloped hills or terrain. However, it is imperative to understand how an individual AGV functions on sloping terrain under varying load and speed. Hence, this study aims to investigate the fraction, mobility, and energy consumption characteristics ofAGV on a sloped soil bin environment. A drawbar pull performance of the prototype AGV was evaluated on a level terrain and variable slope of 10 degrees and 18 degrees, both uphill and downhill, at varying drawbar pull (P) and AGV speed. The AGV's performance metrics include power efficiency (PE), travel reduction (TR), and power number (PN) which relates to AGV's traction, mobility, and energy usage, respectively. The AGV generated drawbar pull equivalent to its weight only on downhill run for reduced PE. On a level terrain (0 degrees), the peak PE was 0.20 and was found to be 108.3% and 328.6% higher on 10 degrees and 18 degrees downhill run than uphill with 55.5% and 133% increase in drawbar pull, respectively. Both applied drawbar pull and uphill operation caused the AGV's TR. The TR, corresponding to a peak PE, increased from 10% to 30%, respectively, on 0 degrees and both 10 degrees and 18 degrees uphill. The optimum values of power number ranged from 2 to 4. The AGV delivers the optimum PE and generates enough drawbar pull with an optimum TR to perform a range of agricultural operations on a slope up to 18 degrees. This study explored the suitability and established the boundary conditions of small size ground vehicles for high-sloped farming. Besides this, the study also aims to generate an AGV's slope fraction database to optimize its control variables, design optimization, and develop a mobility model for sloped terrain.

AB For millions of years, aquatic species have utilized the principles of unsteady hydrodynamics for propulsion and maneuvering. They have evolved high-endurance swimming that can outperform current underwater vehicle technology in the areas of stealth, maneuverability and control authority. Batoid fishes, including the manta ray, Manta birostris, the cownose ray, Rhinoptera bonasus, and the Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina, have been identified as a high-performing species due to their ability to migrate long distances, maneuver in spaces the size of their tip-to-tip wing span, produce enough thrust to leap out of the water, populate many underwater regions, and attain sustained swimming speeds of 2.8 m/s with low flapping/undulating frequencies. These characteristics make batoid fishes an ideal platform to emulate in the design of a bio-inspired autonomous underwater vehicle. The enlarged pectoral fins of each ray undergoes complex motions that couple spanwise curvature with a chordwise traveling wave to produce thrust and to maneuver. Researchers are investigating these amazing species to understand the biological principles for locomotion. The continuum of swimming motions-from undulatory to oscillatory-demonstrates the range of capabilities, environments, and behaviors exhibited by these fishes. Direct comparisons between observed swimming motions and the underlying cartilage structure of the pectoral fin have been made. A simple yet powerful analytical model to describe the swimming motions of batoid fishes has been developed and is being used to quantify their hydrodynamic performance. This model is also being used as the design target for artificial pectoral fin design. Various strategies have been employed to replicate pectoral fin motion. Active tensegrity structures, electro-active polymers, and fluid muscles are three structure/actuator approaches that have successfully demonstrated pectoral-finlike motions. This paper explores these recent studies to understand the relationship between form and swimming function of batoid fishes and describes attempts to emulate their abilities in the next generation of bio-inspired underwater vehicles.

AB The yield and quality of rice are closely related to field management. The automatic identification of field abnormalities, such as diseases and pests, based on computer vision currently mainly relies on high spatial resolution (HSR) images obtained through manual field inspection. In order to achieve automatic and efficient acquisition of HSR images, based on the capability of high-throughput field inspection of UAV remote sensing and combining the advantages of high-flying efficiency and low-flying resolution, this paper proposes a method of "far-view and close-look" autonomous field inspection by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to acquire HSR images of abnormal areas in the rice canopy. First, the UAV equipped with a multispectral camera flies high to scan the whole field efficiently and obtain multispectral images. Secondly, abnormal areas (namely areas with poor growth) are identified from the multispectral images, and then the geographical locations of identified areas are positioned with a single-image method instead of the most used method of reconstruction, sacrificing part of positioning accuracy for efficiency. Finally, the optimal path for traversing abnormal areas is planned through the nearest-neighbor algorithm, and then the UAV equipped with a visible light camera flies low to capture HSR images of abnormal areas along the planned path, thereby acquiring the "close-look" features of the rice canopy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can identify abnormal areas, including diseases and pests, lack of seedlings, lodging, etc. The average absolute error (AAE) of single-image positioning is 13.2 cm, which can meet the accuracy requirements of the application in this paper. Additionally, the efficiency is greatly improved compared to reconstruction positioning. The ground sampling distance (GSD) of the acquired HSR image can reach 0.027 cm/pixel, or even smaller, which can meet the resolution requirements of even leaf-scale deep-learning classification. The HSR image can provide high-quality data for subsequent automatic identification of field abnormalities such as diseases and pests, thereby offering technical support for the realization of the UAV-based automatic rice field inspection system. The proposed method can also provide references for the automatic field management of other crops, such as wheat.

AB This paper proposes a fast model predictive control allocation (MPCA) approach to minimize the fire slip power loss on contact patches for distributed drive electric vehicles (DDEV). In this strategy, two assumptions are set up from a practical focus: (1) the vehicle acceleration and yaw rate are measurable by global position system (GPS)/ inertial navigation system (INS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU), respectively; (2) the longitudinal velocity, road adhesion factor, and vehicle yaw rate are arranged to be "already known" by advanced estimators. For the strategy design, a CarSim-embedded driver model and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based direct yaw moment controller, are respectively applied to calculate the desired longitudinal traction and yaw moment as a virtual input first. Then, a MPCA method is proposed to reasonably distribute the virtual input among four in-wheel motors in order to optimize the fire slip power loss and vehicle stability performance. To accurately characterize fire slip power loss in MPCA, a fire slip estimator is established for fire slip information acquirement. Moreover, addressing on the heavily computational challenge in MPCA, a modified continuation/generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is employed. Since the traditional C/GMRES algorithm cannot directly solve the inequality constraint problem, the barrier functions are applied for transforming the inequality constraints to equivalent cost. According to Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) conditions, the existence and uniqueness for solution of the modified C/GMRES algorithm are strictly proved. Subsequently, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition based approach is developed to fast gain the optimally initial solution in C/GMRES algorithm for extending application. Finally, numerical simulation validations are implemented and demonstrate that the proposed MPCA can ensure the compatibility between the fire slip power loss reduction and vehicle stability in a computationally efficient way.

AB If left uncontrolled, electric vehicle charging poses severe challenges to distribution grid operation. Resulting issues are expected to be mitigated by charging control. In particular, voltage-based charging control, by relying only on the local measurements of voltage at the point of connection, provides an autonomous communication-free solution. The controller, attached to the charging equipment, compares the measured voltage to a reference voltage and adapts the charging power using a droop control characteristic. We present a systematic study of the voltage-based droop control method for electric vehicles to establish the usability of the method for all the currently available residential electric vehicle charging possibilities considering a wide range of electric vehicle penetrations. Voltage limits are evaluated according to the international standard EN50160, using long-term load flow simulations based on a real distribution grid topology and real load profiles. The results achieved show that the voltage-based droop controller is able to mitigate the under voltage problems completely in distribution grids in cases either deploying low charging power levels or exhibiting low penetration rates. For high charging rates and high penetrations, the control mechanism improves the overall voltage profile, but it does not remedy the under voltage problems completely. The evaluation also shows the controller's ability to reduce the peak power at the transformer and indicates the impact it has on users due to the reduction in the average charging rates. The outcomes of the paper provide the distribution grid operators an insight on the voltage-based droop control mechanism for the future grid planning and investments.

DT Article

ID SIMULATION
AB Automated vehicles (AVs) must be thoroughly evaluated before their release and deployment. A widely used evaluation approach is the Naturalistic-Field Operational Test (N-FOT), which tests prototype vehicles directly on the public roads. Due to the low exposure to safety-critical scenarios, N-FOTs are time consuming and expensive to conduct. In this paper, we propose an accelerated evaluation approach for AVs. The results can be used to generate motions of the other primary vehicles to accelerate the verification of AVs in simulations and controlled experiments. Frontal collision due to unsafe cut-ins is the target crash type of this paper. Human-controlled vehicles making unsafe lane changes are modeled as the primary disturbance to AVs based on data collected by the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program. The cut-in scenarios are generated based on skewed statistics of collected human driver behaviors, which generate risky testing scenarios while preserving the statistical information so that the safety benefits of AVs in nonaccelerated cases can be accurately estimated. The cross-entropy method is used to recursively search for the optimal skewing parameters. The frequencies of the occurrences of conflicts, crashes, and injuries are estimated for a modeled AV, and the achieved accelerated rate is around 2000 to 20 000. In other words, in the accelerated simulations, driving for 1000 miles will expose the AV with challenging scenarios that will take about 2 to 20 million miles of real-world driving to encounter. This technique thus has the potential to greatly reduce the development and validation time for AVs.

AB This study aims to determine the influence of the hip flexion angle on the injury trends of lower limbs. An impact model was established using a hybrid human body model and an accurate vehicle model. Simulations were performed in two boundary environments of 25 and 40% overlap impacts under different hip flexion angles. The analysis of the dynamic responses indicated that the hip flexion angle significantly affected the injury trends. The maximum femur index of different overlaps was all found at the minimum hip angle, except for the left femur at 25% overlap rate. Meanwhile, the maximum acetabular stress was all found at the minimum hip angle (approximately 0.09-0.20 GPa). This study provides mechanistic insights into the lower limb injuries associated with complex human postures.

AB Alternative intersection designs are popular existing strategies that can be used for handling heavy traffic in the U.S., and research on the performance of CAVs in the alternative intersection design can complement our knowledge of the impact of CAVs. Hence, this research attempts to mitigate this research gap through a simulation-based study on a superstreet, one of the popular alternative intersection designs. A real-world superstreet is selected for the simulation-based study with collected traffic volumes and average speeds. HDVs are modeled using Wiedemann 99 with calibrated parameters while CAVs are modeled using the intelligent driver model (IDM). Platooning and trajectory planning capabilities of CAVs are modeled in the designed simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed framework for CAVs can successfully reduce fuel consumption in different market penetration rates and traffic scales.

ID PERFORMANCE; MOBILITY
AB Future vehicles will have rich computing resources to support autonomous driving and be connected by wireless technologies. Vehicular fog networks (VeFNs) have thus emerged to enable computing resource sharing via computation task offloading, providing a wide range of fog applications. However, the high mobility of vehicles makes it hard to guarantee the delay that accounts for both communication and computation throughout the whole task offloading procedure. In this article, we first review the state of the art of task offloading in VeFNs, and argue that mobility is not only an obstacle for timely computing in VeFNs, but can also benefit the delay performance. We then identify machine learning and coded computing as key enabling technologies to address and exploit mobility in VeFNs. Case studies are provided to illustrate how to adapt learning algorithms to suit the dynamic environment in VeFNs, and how to exploit the mobility with opportunistic computation offloading and task replication.

AB Deep learning is recently showing outstanding results for solving a wide variety of robotic tasks in the areas of perception, planning, localization, and control. Its excellent capabilities for learning representations from the complex data acquired in real environments make it extremely suitable for many kinds of autonomous robotic applications. In parallel, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are currently being extensively applied for several types of civilian tasks in applications going from security, surveillance, and disaster rescue to parcel delivery or warehouse management. In this paper, a thorough review has been performed on recent reported uses and applications of deep learning for UAVs, including the most relevant developments as well as their performances and limitations. In addition, a detailed explanation of the main deep learning techniques is provided. We conclude with a description of the main challenges for the application of deep learning for UAV-based solutions.

AB Automated driving is an emerging transport innovation whose future impact is increasingly studied. With this paper I want to show that such a literature misses a crucial point: which impacts automated driving will generate depends on the competition between different networks of innovators, each supporting its own approach to the integration of automated driving into the system of urban mobility.
   As technological, business and policy innovations are simultaneously at stake, a socio-technical approach is followed. In particular, socio-technical maps representing urban mobility in year 2040 are used to represent the results of three transition pathways towards automated driving, each being led by a different network of innovators. The first socio-technical map results from the ability of today incumbent automotive companies to integrate the suppliers of technologies and components for connected automated vehicles into their network, and to successfully lobby for public investments on vehicle-to-infrastructure technologies for long-haul mobility. No relevant changes in urban mobility are generated in this transition pathway, except for the diffusion and the peer-to-peer sharing of household electric automated vehicles. The second socio-technical map emerges from the cooperation between leaders of the internet and managers of shared and collective transport systems. This new network of innovators is able to gain support from multilevel policies that consider shared automated vehicles as the core element of diffused systems of integrated urban mobility. Impacts on urban mobility are positive, also because the strict regulation of household automated vehicles avoids any rebound effect. In the third socio-technical map, urban mobility is taken over by energy agents who integrate automated vehicles and smart grids. Such innovators foster a new political discourse on energy efficiency and sustainability, and eventually gain support from the public co-funding of national and international smart grids. In this scenario, unregulated pervasive rebound effects of automated driving may result from the limited attention paid by policies to the issue of urban quality and sustainable transportation.

AB In this paper, we propose a distributed model predictive control approach based on the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) to solve the formation control problem of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). First, a kinematic model with six degrees of freedom is established for underwater vehicles. This is a linear error model which can accelerate the calculation speed of the controller while still ensuring accuracy. This model also incorporates the design of a local distributed controller for each underwater robot. The formation factor is transformed into the state coupling constraint between robots, and ADMM is used for iterative calculations, thus solving the problem of robot formation control. Considering external interference, a feedforward compensation control link is added to ensure stable tracking of the reference trajectory by multiple robots under certain disturbances. Finally, results from simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB The advent of the autonomous car is paving the road to the realization of ideas that will help optimize traffic flows, increase safety and reduce fuel consumption, among other advantages. We present one proposal to bring together Virtual Traffics Lights (VTLs) and platooning in urban scenarios, leaning on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocols that turn intersections into virtual containers of data. Newly-introduced protocols for the combined management of VTLs and platoons are validated by simulation, comparing a range of routing protocols for the vehicular networks with the baseline given by common deployments of traditional traffic lights ruled by state-of-the-art policies. The simulation results show that the combination of VTLs and platoons can achieve significant reductions in travel times and fuel consumption, provided that proper algorithms are used to handle the V2V communications.

AB Road region and non-road region separation in the unstructured road intends to be an important task for safe navigation and collision avoidance for autonomous driving vehicles. The road that connects rural areas and cities to the national highways are considered as unstructured roads. Absence of clear lane marking on these unstructured roads makes them more prone to accidents in comparison to highways, which have clear lane marking for indication of road and non-road regions. However, the unstructured roads have different color information from its background that paves an easy way for design and devel-opment of an efficient road detection system for recognition and classification of road and non-road regions. Hence, in this paper, we propose an efficient road detection system for the classification of unstructured roads into road and non-road regions using multiple nearest neighbors (NN) classifier and soft voting aggregation approach. The proposed system utilized the chromatic information (i.e. *a, *b, and Hue) to train the NN classifiers and aggregated their output using soft voting (SV) approach for final output response. The output results of multiple classifiers were aggregated using SV approach based on the confidence score obtained by each individual classifier. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of precision, recall, accuracy, intersec-tion over union (IOU), true positive rate (TPR), and processing time and compared with current state of art methods reported in the literature. The proposed system achieved precision, recall, accuracy, IOU, and TPR of 96.79%, 96.92%, 97.8%, 96.08% and 96%, respectively with the processing time three times smaller than those of the existing state of art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can provide an effective guidance to the autonomous vehicles through recognition and classifica-tion of road and non-road regions in rural, urban, and city areas, wherein single unstructured roads con-nect the national highways.(c) 2021 The Authors.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) technology with storage and computing capabilities and deployed at the edge of the network, is widely used to solve the problems of high bandwidth, low latency and high mobility for the Internet of vehicles (IoV). Edge computing servers are generally deployed on road side unit (RSU). However, since the vehicles need to share data and collaborate on computations through RSUs, RSUs may be attacked by malicious vehicles which take up RSU resources or gain control of RSU. Therefore, a trust management system needs to be designed to build a secure and trustworthy MEC data-sharing envi-ronment in IoV. Most of the previous studies have centralized authen-tication of vehicle identity through certificate authority (CA), which has the risk of privacy leakage. In addition, in the previously proposed blockchain-based distributed trust management schemes, the consensus mechanism consumes huge resources. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous and controllable distributed authentication scheme based on decentralized identifier (DID) to ensure the credibility of the vehi-cle's identity, and a novel proof-of-reputation consensus mechanism based on blockchain to enhance trust management for RSU. And this paper considers the capability and reputation value of RSU and uses the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to adjust the assignment of ver-ification nodes, block size and block interval in order to maximize the transaction throughput and improve system scalability and efficiency. The experiment shows that our scheme has good results for building a trusted data sharing system for vehicular networks.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) vision encompasses a wide range of novel intelligent highway scenarios that rely on vehicles with an ever-increasing degree of autonomy and the prospect of sophisticated services like e-Horizon and cognitive driving assistance. The self-driving vehicle, on the other hand, entails a new passenger profile where sophisticated infotainment applications are expected to enhance the quality of travel. From the technical stand point, for this vision to become a reality a streamlined edge computing infrastructure, namely Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC), is required where computationally intensive workloads are offloaded to a nearby VEC infrastructure. However, the highly dynamic environment renders it difficult to efficiently operate a VEC system to yield the crisp performance required on an autonomous vehicle. In this setting, where to offload each task stands out as a crucial decision problem, and the conventional methods prove insufficient for its solution. In our work, we proposed a two-stage machine learning-based vehicular edge orchestrator which takes into account not only the task completion success but also the service time. To demonstrate how our approach performs in a realistic setting, we employed EdgeCloudSim to design extensive experiments where the characteristics of the vehicular applications, upload/download sizes, computational footprints of the tasks, the LAN, MAN and WAN network models, and the mobility are considered. Detailed performance evaluation of the proposed system via simulation is carried out where both overall and service type-specific performance scores in comparison with opponent schemes are reported.

AB Tire sensors embedded in a vehicle tire are stand-alone autonomous devices. A tire sensor reserve power strategy is crucial due to sensor energy sources limitations for long operational periods. This paper presents an innovative tire sensor powering strategy for the intelligent-tire system. The powering strategy offers a green concept, maintenance-free, and low-cost method in order to extend the tire sensor lifetime for long operating periods. The proposed strategy adopts wireless power transfer (WPT) technology to transfer power to an electrical load mounted on the rotational system without an interconnection cable. It is composed of a power transmitter designed to be mounted on the vehicle's inner fender liner, and a power receiver that provides power to recharge the tire sensor battery/energy storage. The transmitter transfers power from the vehicle battery/accumulator to a power receiver coupled with the tire sensor which is mounted on the vehicle tire inner wall. WPT devices were designed based on induction electromagnetic coupling and can provide an output current up to 1A at 5 V. The proposed powering strategy was verified using a vehicle tire simulator model to emulate rotational motion. A voltage and current sensor module as well microcontroller and data logger modules were utilized as the load for the developed WPT system. The verification experimental and preliminary test results reveal that the proposed strategy can provide constant power to the load (in this case, the voltage is around 4.3 V and the current is around 21.1 mA) although the vehicle tire model was rotated at different speeds from 0 rpm to 800 rpm. The proposed system has the potential and feasibility for implementation in tire sensor power applications in the intelligent-tire system.

AB With cooperative adaptive cruise control vehicles (CACC) development, the heterogeneous traffic flow of human-driven vehicles (HV) and CACC will appear on the same road. Although numerous studies have carefully analyzed the characteristic of the heterogeneous traffic flow, none of them considered the effect of the differences in acceptance of CACC by HV drivers on the heterogeneous traffic flow. In terms of the differences in car-following behaviors of HV drivers with diverse CACC acceptances, this paper deduces the capacity and stability of the heterogeneous traffic flow under different CACC penetration rates. Firstly, the HV driver's car-following behavior model with different CACC acceptability is calibrated through a questionnaire. Then, the analytical framework of the fundamental diagram and stability of the heterogeneous traffic flow is derived, according to the differences of HV drivers' acceptance of CACC. Finally, the paper analyzes the influence factors and effects of the heterogeneous traffic flow capacity and stability. The results indicate under different CACC penetration rates, the improvement of HV drivers' acceptance of CACC increases the capacity and stability of the heterogeneous traffic flow. When CACC penetration rate is lower than 96.35% and HV drivers' acceptance level of CACC is lower than the critical ratio, the popularity of CACC will decrease the stability of traffic flow. When the penetration rate of CACC is less than 34.76%, and HV drivers' acceptance level of CACC is lower than the critical proportion, the popularization of CACC will decrease the capacity of heterogeneous traffic.

TI Secure Crowdsensing in 5G Internet of Vehicles: When Deep Reinforcement
   Learning Meets Blockchain
SO IEEE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MAGAZINE

DT Article
AB Vehicular crowdsensing has been widely leveraged in the intelligent transportation systems to collect real-time traffic data. However, the data security and privacy preservation issues have not been well investigated for vehicular crowdsensing. This article proposes a blockchain-enabled vehicular crowdsensing system to protect user privacy and data safety in 5G Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In order to maximize the security and minimize the latency of blockchain, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-enabled algorithm is proposed to select proper active miners and transactions. Then, a two-sided matching-based algorithm is put forwarded to allocate the nonorthogonal multiple access subchannels to minimize the maximum uploading delay of all users to guarantee the freshness of messages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. Finally, system analysis demonstrates that our system can protect user privacy, guarantee data security as well as integrity, and defend against common attacks. With the development of information communication techniques, vehicular crowdsensing is widely leveraged in the Intelligent Transportation Systems(ITSs) to collect real-time traffic information (e.g., traffic accidents and jams). Recently, vehicles have begun to be regarded as the consumer electronics product, due to the advancements in the development of autonomous vehicles, and users in vehicular crowdsensing focus more and more on their privacy protection and data security. In order to guarantee the connectivity and communication of users participating in the vehicular crowdsensing, intelligent management of network traffic and offering services to vehicles has become a vital need, especially for the highly dynamic topology and untrusty communication environment in 5G Internet of Vehicles (IoV).(1) However, the vehicular crowdsensing-based data collection and transmission in 5GIoVs face the following major challenges:

AB In an effort to reach accident-free milestones or drastically reduce/eliminate road fatalities rates and traffic congestion and to create disruptive, transformational mobility systems and services, different parties (e.g., automakers, universities, governments, and road traffic regulators) have collaborated to research, develop, and test connected vehicle (CV) technologies. CVs create new data-rich environments and are considered key enablers for many applications and services that will make our roads safer, less congested, and more eco-friendly. A deeper understanding of the CV technologies will pave the way to avoid setbacks and will help in developing more innovative applications and breakthroughs. In the CV paradigm, vehicles become smarter by communicating with nearby vehicles, connected infrastructure, and the surroundings. This connectivity will be substantial to support different features and systems, such as adaptive routing, real-time navigation, and slow and near real-time infrastructure. Further examples include environmental sensing, advanced driver-assistance systems, automated driving systems, mobility on demand, and mobility as a service. This article provides a comprehensive review on CV technologies including fundamental challenges, state-of-the-art enabling technologies, innovative applications, and potential opportunities that can benefit automakers, customers, and businesses. The current standardization efforts of the forefront enabling technologies, such as Wi-Fi 6 and 5G-cellular technologies are also reviewed. Different challenges in terms of cooperative computation, privacy/security, and over-the-air updates are discussed. Safety and non-safety applications are described and possible future opportunities that CV technology brings to our life are also highlighted.

AB Collision avoidance is an important requirement for self-driving systems, particularly in high-speed scenarios, where a multi-state coupled motion makes it difficult to simultaneously reach the required accuracy, efficiency, and universal feasibility for different obstacle-avoidance behaviour. For a coupled multi-state complexity, a hierarchical collision-avoidance strategy is proposed that refines the requirements for travelling under such a scenario into two levels, general and special. At the general level, the moving elliptical contour of the subject vehicle is regularised as a settled circle through a projective transformation, which attempts to determine the subject-motion-decoupled scenario. Throughout the transformation, all positional relationships between the subject and the object vehicles are retained using invariants. At the special level, a group of relative critical collision trajectories is achieved through a feature-distance-based multi-dimensional geometric optimisation model. Under the motion-decoupled scenario, a precise collision avoidance condition is constructed by mathematically expressing the relative critical collision trajectory group using a parameterised spatio-temporal curvilinear interpolation model, which provides a reasonable safety redundancy and trajectory domain to ensure both the efficiency and accuracy of the computation. In a simulation, planning trajectories using this collision-avoidance strategy is adaptive for different collision-avoidance behaviour and are more efficient than those of other algorithms.

AB Development and testing of an adaptable vehicle health-monitoring architecture is presented. The architecture is being developed for a fleet of vehicles. It has three operational levels: one or more remote data acquisition units located throughout a vehicle, a command and control unit located within a vehicle, and a terminal collection unit to collect analysis results from all vehicles. Each level is capable of performing autonomous analysis with a trained expert system. The expert system is parameterized, which makes it adaptable to be trained to both a user's subjective reasoning and existing quantitative analytic tools. Communication between all levels is done with wireless radio frequency interfaces. The remote data acquisition unit has an eight-channel programmable digital interface that allows the user discretion for choosing type of sensors, number of sensors, sensor sampling rate, and sampling duration for each sensor. The architecture provides framework for a tributary analysis. All measurements at the lowest operational level are reduced to provide analysis results necessary to gauge changes from established baselines. These are then collected at the next level to identify any global trends or common features from the prior level. This process is repeated until the results are reduced at the highest operational level. In the framework, only analysis results are forwarded to the next level to reduce telemetry congestion. The system's remote data acquisition hardware and nonanalysis software have been flight tested on the NASA Langley Research Center's B757 main landing gear to validate the wireless radio frequency communication capabilities of the system, the hardware design, command and control, software operation, and, data acquisition, storage, and retrieval.

AB Autonomous driving is expected to strongly influence the value of travel time savings (VTTS) which is crucial for the assessment of the impact of automated vehicles (AVs). However, no consensus has been reached yet about the size and direction of the effect of AVs on VTTS. This high uncertainty around the VTTS is most likely due to high heterogeneity in preferences for travel time. Our hypothesis is that a key role in the heterogeneity of the VTTS for AVs is played by psychological factors. We focus in particular on Travel Experiences (besides individual preference for activities conducted during travelling) and Trust in travel time preferences for AVs. For this purpose, an online survey with a stated choice experiment and psychometric scales was conducted. Besides currently available transport modes, also a privately-owned AV (PAV) and a shared AV (SAV) were included in the choice sets. The data was analysed using a hybrid choice model. T-test and confidence intervals of the estimated VTTS are computed to assess if the VTTS are statistically significant and statistically different among user groups. Results confirm that both psychological factors have significant positive effect on VTTS for AVs. Gender, age, level of education and experience with similar systems were found to affect the VTTS directly and indirectly through their impact on the individual attitudes. Significant differences are found among some potential user groups, in particular in terms of trust to technology and anticipated travel experiences. For example, men are found to trust the technology more than women and also to have potentially higher technology affinity. However, our results show that they also perceive higher marginal disutility for travel time in both PAV and SAV. A comparison between a mixed logit model and the hybrid choice model reveals that capturing the indirect effect of the socioeconomic characteristics of individuals through the effect of these factors on attitudes allows differentiating between the VTTS for different user groups. Lastly, implications for policy and technology deployment strategies are discussed based on the findings.

AB Motors arise as a heart of the mobility society, and wirelessly operated motors may improve our standard of living. Wireless power transfer in the kilohertz and megahertz range has been extensively explored, finding various potential applications in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and medical implants. However, stable operation of wirelessly powered motors remains challenging due to voltage fluctuations for motors occurring in dynamic scenarios, e.g., the rotating speed of the motors is varied. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the operation of a motor, where the power is wirelessly transferred via coils, is robust against the rotating speed by employing the analogy with non-Hermitian parity-time (PT) symmetry. In addition, our system is robust for misalignment of the coils. Our results open up opportunities for the robust operation of motors via wireless power transfer in dynamic scenarios towards autonomous vehicles.

AB Semantic segmentation is an important task that helps autonomous vehicles understand their surroundings and navigate safely. However, during deployment, even the most mature segmentation models are vulnerable to various external factors that can degrade the segmentation performance with potentially catastrophic consequences for the vehicle and its surroundings. To address this issue, we propose a failure detection framework to identify pixel-level misclassification. We do so by exploiting internal features of the segmentation model and training it simultaneously with a failure detection network. During deployment, the failure detector flags areas in the image where the segmentation model has failed to segment correctly. We evaluate the proposed approach against state-of-the-art methods and achieve 12.30%, 9.46%, and 9.65% performance improvement in the AUPR-Error metric for Cityscapes, BDD100k, and Mapillary semantic segmentation datasets.

AB Underwater localization is a challenging task due to the lack of a Global Positioning System (GPS). However, the capability to match georeferenced aerial images and acoustic data can help with this task. Autonomous hybrid aerial and underwater vehicles also demand a new localization method capable of combining the perception from both environments. This study proposes a cross-domain and cross-view image matching, using a color aerial image and an underwater acoustic image to identify if these images are captured in the same place. The method is designed to match images acquired in partially structured environments with shared features, such as harbors and marinas. Our pipeline combines traditional image processing methods and deep neural network techniques. Real-world datasets from multiple regions are used to validate our work, obtaining a matching precision of up to 80%.

AB The AERObot is a special ARM microcontroller-based autopilot for small and medium size UAVs(1) developed at Obuda Universtiy for research purposes. The aim of the research was to create a generic autopilot which is capable of controlling different design, weight and structure airframes without any complex parameter or model recalculation as usual for e.g. switching between tailless or classic tail aircafts. For this purpose a simple, desired heading-based guidance method was developed which is easy to visualize and needs only a few parameters to be set while the quality remains the same as the existing ones. The paper presents a new guidance method and a few example controller types which can fit it. Test flights were made to demonstrate the real time opeartion and low compution needs of the presented methods.

AB Cold-water coral mound morphology and development are thought to be controlled primarily by current regime. This study, however, reveals a general lack of correlation between prevailing bottom current direction and mound morphology (i.e. footprint shape and orientation), as well as current strength and mound size (i.e. footprint area and height). These findings are based on quantitative analyses of a high-resolution geophysical dataset collected with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle from three cold-water coral mound sites at the toe of slope of Great Bahama Bank. The three sites (80 km2 total) have an average of 14 mounds km-2, indicating that the Great Bahama Bank slope is a major coral mound region. At all three sites living coral colonies are observed on the surface of the mounds, documenting active mound growth. Morphometric analysis shows that mounds at these sites vary significantly in height (1 to 83 m), area (81 to 6 00 000 m2), shape (mound aspect ratio 0.1 to 1) and orientation (mound longest axis 0 to 180 degrees). The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle measured bottom current data depict a northsouth flowing current that reverses approximately every six hours. The tidal nature of this current and its intermittent deviations during reversals are interpreted to contribute to the observed mound complexity. An additional factor contributing to the variability in mound morphometrics is the sediment deposition rate that varies among and within sites. At most locations sedimentation rate lags slightly behind mound growth rate, causing mounds to develop into large structures. Where sedimentation rates are higher than mound growth rates, sediment partially or completely buries mounds. The spatial distribution and alignment of mounds can also be related to gravity mass deposits, as indicated by geomorphological features (for example, slope failure and linear topographic highs) in the three-dimensional bathymetry. In summary, variability in sedimentation rates, current regime and underlying topography produce extraordinarily high variability in the distribution, development and morphology of coral mounds on the Great Bahama Bank slope.

AB Autonomous vehicles use a variety of sensors and machine-learned models to predict the behavior of surrounding road users. Most of the machine-learned models in the literature focus on quantitative error metrics like the root mean square error (RMSE) to learn and report their models' capabilities. This focus on quantitative error metrics tends to ignore the more important behavioral aspect of the models, raising the question of whether these models really predict human-like behavior. Thus, we propose to analyze the output of machine-learned models much like we would analyze human data in conventional behavioral research. We introduce quantitative metrics to demonstrate presence of three different behavioral phenomena in a naturalistic highway driving dataset: 1) The kinematics-dependence of who passes a merging point first 2) Lane change by an on-highway vehicle to accommodate an on-ramp vehicle 3) Lane changes by vehicles on the highway to avoid lead vehicle conflicts. Then, we analyze the behavior of three machine-learned models using the same metrics. Even though the models' RMSE value differed, all the models captured the kinematic-dependent merging behavior but struggled at varying degrees to capture the more nuanced courtesy lane change and highway lane change behavior. Additionally, the collision aversion analysis during lane changes showed that the models struggled to capture the physical aspect of human driving: leaving adequate gap between the vehicles. Thus, our analysis highlighted the inadequacy of simple quantitative metrics and the need to take a broader behavioral perspective when analyzing machine-learned models of human driving predictions.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) need to be trusted by cyclists and pedestrians where they will share the road. To test trust, cyclists and pedestrians, and a comparison cohort of drivers, observed trials of both a road and simulator AV undertaking three common priority-based maneuvers: a right turn into a side road, overtaking a parked car, and passing over a pedestrian priority (zebra) crossing. The AV made the maneuvers either giving way, or not giving way, to a pedestrian or cyclist. One hundred and thirty-four participants aged 18 to 79 years were recruited based on being predominantly either a pedestrian, cyclist, or driver in their regular road use. For the on-road trials, the cyclist and pedestrian participants observed the AV maneuvers from the adjacent footway, and the driver participants observed from inside the AV. In the simulation environment, all participants were inside the automated vehicle. Trust scores were higher when participants observed a maneuver where the AV had to give way to a cyclist, and this can be linked with the re-assurance provided by the behavior of the AV in such an encounter. There was no significant difference in trust by road user type (cyclist, pedestrian or driver), age or driving experience, suggesting messaging to road users about the impacts of automated vehicles need not be differentiated by road user type. There was some evidence of differences in trust, especially for more complex maneuvers, between the on-road trial and the simulator, suggesting a need for caution in reliance on simulation-only experiments.

AB New forms of transport, such as autonomous delivery robots (ADRs), have attracted considerable attention in recent years for their potential use as green last-mile delivery alternatives because of their flexibility in some areas unreachable by van. However, their low efficiency, delivering a limited number of orders each trip, limits their application in the last mile. Also, the cost and emission impact of new forms of transport on the last-mile delivery network is still not clear. To address these issues, we developed a new two-echelon delivery system that combines traditional vans and ADRs, making use of their individual advantages to overcome their drawbacks and enhance efficiency in the deliveries. The objective of this study was to develop a new approach based on a metaheuristics methodology to minimize transport and emission costs through modeling and to solve the extension of two-echelon load-dependent vehicle routing problems with mixed vehicles (2E-LDVRP-MV). The complicated 2E-LDVRP-MV problem was formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and solved efficiently with a cluster-based artificial immune algorithm (C-AIA) in which clustering was employed to allocate customers. We performed a set of numerical experiments with a solver and the proposed C-AIA heuristics. C-AIS highlights the operational implications of four parameters: ratios between load and the empty vehicle weight; vehicle types; emission levels; and customer densities. Our results provide a unique perspective on tactical planning for a sustainable urban logistics system, and this new two-echelon system could be applied in e-grocery last-mile delivery networks where vans and ADRs are combined.

AB The transport sector is one of the leading contributors of anthropogenic climate change. Particularly, internal combustion engine (ICE) dominancy coupled with heavy private motor vehicle dependency are among the main issues that need to be addressed immediately to mitigate climate change and to avoid consequential catastrophes. As a potential solution to this issue, electric vehicle (EV) technology has been put forward and is expected to replace a sizable portion of ICE vehicles in the coming decades. Provided that the source of electricity is renewable energy resources, it is expected that the wider uptake of EVs will positively contribute to the efforts in climate change mitigation. Nonetheless, wider EV uptake also comes with important issues that could challenge urban power systems. This perspective paper advocates system-level thinking to pinpoint and address the undesired externalities of EVs on our power grids. Given that it is possible to mobilize EV batteries to act as a source of mobile-energy supporting the power grid and the paper coins, and conceptualize a novel concept of Mobile-Energy-as-a-Service (MEaaS) for system-wide integration of energy, transport, and urban infrastructures for sustainable electromobility in cities. The results of this perspective include a discussion around the issues of measuring optimal real-time power grid operability for MEaaS, transport, power, and urban engineering aspects of MEaaS, flexible incentive-based price mechanisms for MEaaS, gauging the public acceptability of MEaaS based on its desired attributes, and directions for prospective research.

AB The growth in online goods delivery is causing a dramatic surge in urban vehicle traffic from last-mile deliveries. On the other hand, ride-sharing has been on the rise with the success of ride-sharing platforms and increased research on using autonomous vehicle technologies for routing and matching. The future of urban mobility for passengers and goods relies on leveraging new methods that minimize operational costs and environmental footprints of transportation systems. This article considers combining passenger transportation with goods delivery to improve vehicle-based transportation. We propose FlexPool: a distributed model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that jointly serves passengers & goods workloads by learning optimal dispatch policies from its interaction with the environment. The proposed algorithm pools passengers for a ride-sharing service and delivers goods using a multi-hop transit method. These flexibilities decrease the fleet's operational cost and environmental footprint while maintaining service levels for passengers and goods. The dispatching algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is integrated with an efficient matching algorithm for passengers and goods. Through simulations on a realistic multi-agent urban mobility platform, we demonstrate that FlexPool outperforms other model-free settings in serving the demands from passengers & goods. FlexPool achieves 30% higher fleet utilization and 35% higher fuel efficiency in comparison to (i) model-free approaches where vehicles transport a combination of passengers & goods without the use of multi-hop transit, and (ii) model-free approaches where vehicles exclusively transport either passengers or goods.

AB We introduce a problem in which demands arrive stochastically on a line segment, and upon arrival, move with a fixed velocity perpendicular to the segment. We design a receding horizon service policy for a vehicle with speed greater than that of the demands, based on the translational minimum Hamiltonian path (TMHP). We consider Poisson demand arrivals, uniformly distributed along the segment. For a fixed segment width and fixed vehicle speed, the problem is governed by two parameters; the demand speed and the arrival rate. We establish a necessary condition on the arrival rate in terms of the demand speed for the existence of any stabilizing policy. We derive a sufficient condition on the arrival rate in terms of the demand speed that ensures stability of the TMHP-based policy. When the demand speed tends to the vehicle speed, every stabilizing policy must service the demands in the first-come-first-served (FCFS) order; and the TMHP-based policy becomes equivalent to the FCFS policy which minimizes the expected time before a demand is serviced. When the demand speed tends to zero, the sufficient condition on the arrival rate for stability of the TMHP-based policy is within a constant factor of the necessary condition for stability of any policy. Finally, when the arrival rate tends to zero for a fixed demand speed, the TMHP-based policy becomes equivalent to the FCFS policy which minimizes the expected time before a demand is serviced. We numerically validate our analysis and empirically characterize the region in the parameter space for which the TMHP-based policy is stable.

AB Managing the mixed traffic involving connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs) at a signalized intersection has become a concern of researchers. However, the performances of most existing control methods are limited, especially when CAV penetration rate is low, since they fail to make a better trade-off between safety and operational efficiency for both CAVs and HVs. To this end, this study proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) powered control system for the mixed traffic at signalized intersections, which aims to optimize operational efficiency of both CAVs and HVs while assuring safety and reducing interference on HVs' driving habits. The system adopts an adaptive traffic signal control strategy and an efficient CAV control policy with a passing rule proposed as a link in between. The traffic signal control strategy allows traffic light to adaptively adjust its phase and duration based on real-time traffic information, while the CAV control policy permits the CAVs meeting certain safety constraints to form platoons and pass through the intersection in a coordinated manner regardless of traffic signals. As an efficient DRL algorithm, Deep Q-Network (DQN) is adopted to adaptively control the signals and implement CAV coordination. The proposed system is examined on Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO), given different CAV penetration rates and traffic conditions. It is found that the proposed system not only outperforms the state-of-the-art control methods on reducing travel time and fuel consumption under low CAV penetration rate, but also enlarges its advantages with the increase of CAV penetration rate. In certain traffic scenarios, the proposed system can even achieve a maximum reduction of travel time by 37.33% and fuel consumption by 15.95%, in comparison to the existing method with the best performance. Besides, to some extent, the comparisons between the performances of CAVs and HVs demonstrate certain benefits of introducing CAVs into the mixed traffic.

AB The combination of visual and inertial sensors for state estimation has recently found wide echo in the robotics community, especially in the aerial robotics field, due to the lightweight and complementary characteristics of the sensors data. However, most state estimation systems based on visual-inertial sensing suffer from severe processor requirements, which in many cases make them impractical. In this paper, we propose a simple, low-cost and high rate method for state estimation enabling autonomous flight of micro aerial vehicles, which presents a low computational burden. The proposed state estimator fuses observations from an inertial measurement unit, an optical flow smart camera and a time-of-flight range sensor. The smart camera provides optical flow measurements up to a rate of 200 Hz, avoiding the computational bottleneck to the main processor produced by all image processing requirements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of extending the use of these smart cameras from hovering-like motions to odometry estimation, producing estimates that are usable during flight times of several minutes. In order to validate and defend the simplest algorithmic solution, we investigate the performances of two Kalman filters, in the extended and error-state flavors, alongside with a large number of algorithm modifications defended in earlier literature on visual-inertial odometry, showing that their impact on filter performance is minimal. To close the control loop, a non-linear controller operating in the special Euclidean group SE(3) is able to drive, based on the estimated vehicle's state, a quadrotor platform in 3D space guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of 3D position and heading. All the estimation and control tasks are solved on board and in real time on a limited computational unit. The proposed approach is validated through simulations and experimental results, which include comparisons with ground-truth data provided by a motion capture system. For the benefit of the community, we make the source code public.

   It is essential to understand and analyze the characteristics of the tire. This paper focuses on analyzing tire characteristics using intelligent tires based on physical tire models. The flexible ring tire model has been selected as the tire model. The flexible ring tire model is analyzed and simplified based on modal analysis. Four tire dimensionless numbers have been proposed to represent tire characteristics using the Buckingham theorem. Tire dimen-sionless numbers were estimated using intelligent tire sensor signals. The estimation algo-rithm was designed based on the standing wave characteristics of the tire. The proposed estimation algorithm has been validated through experiments on various tire conditions. The physical correlation between the estimated tire dimensionless numbers and the tire state dimensionless numbers were analyzed. The experimental results verify the physical meaning and estimation performance of the proposed tire dimensionless numbers.

AB The private motor vehicles are significantly important means of transportation in modern lifestyle, however, these also contribute to a large proportion of the total air pollution and primary energy consumption. In order to develop green transportation system, it becomes imperative to use integrated technologies to achieve reduced emissions and utilize renewable energy. Electric vehicles (EVs) have been considered as one of these technologies to transform the traditional vehicle mix. However, the uptake of EV has been debated on factors like cost, performance (autonomous mileage), charging point infrastructure construction, energy saving, policy and end users' adaptation. Present study investigates the technology feasibility (which usually refer to EVs' cost, EV charging, supplier's customer services quality, EV travel performance) and users' adaptation of EV in Beijing, which is a key driver for the EV uptake into the Beijing transportation system. The relevant data have been collected and analyzed in the form of questionnaire survey around all of these factors. While considering the user perception and satisfaction, safety of charging and energy bills have also been investigated. According to the data analysis, it has been found the policy of 'No traffic restrictions for EVs' (the traffic restrictions means for certain date, from Monday to Friday the motor vehicles with the last register number of 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9, 5 and 0, are restricted to travel, respectively), the availability of the charging infrastructure and technical support are the most significant factors affecting the users' opinions on using EVs.

AB In this letter, stochastic geometry tools are utilized to compare the downlink performance of two wireless cellular network models with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in terms of coverage probability and average achievable rate. The considered models are: i) a truncated octahedron-based cellular network, referred to as regular in the following, and ii) a binomial-Voronoi cellular network. The locations of all UAV-user equipments (UAV-UEs) are modeled as a three-dimensional (3D) Poisson Point Process (PPP) in both cellular models. Analytical expressions on coverage probability and achievable average rate are derived, and numerical results are presented. The binomial-Voronoi network is also compared via Monte-Carlo simulations to a regular network with uniformly random UAV-UE receiver selection policy.

ID IMPLEMENTATION
AB Detection and tracking of moving objects is one of the most essential functions of autonomous cars. In order to estimate the dynamic information of a moving object accurately, laser scanners are widely used for their highly accurate distance data. However, these data only represent the surface of an object facing the sensor and changes the appearance of an object over time. This change produces unexpected tracking errors of estimated dynamic states. In this paper, in order to minimize the tracking error caused by appearance changes, a tracking algorithm based on L-shaped model switching is proposed. The suggested algorithm is validated in real traffic experiments where position, velocity, and heading angle error were measured by using precise GPS. The L-shape tracking algorithm successfully mitigated the effect of appearance changes and improved estimation performance.

AB External human-machine interaction (eHMI) road projections are a new feature for automotive lighting to improve vehicle communication with other road users. These modalities are used to draw users' attention and awareness to specific situations. However, such advanced capabilities are still being debated to be used on the road in the context of whether or not such road projections can provide a clear and understandable message to road users in a specific scenario or lead to anticipation and change in the driving behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate human factors aspects, such as the feeling of safety, useability, understanding, acceptability, and driver behavior. This study investigates the change in distance and luminance contrast and its effect on human driving behavior and acceptability in blind spot detection scenarios on the highway. A lab experiment with 12 participants is performed to analyze: understanding, satisfaction, usability, visibility, safety, workload, and driving behavior towards eHMI projection while varying projecting distance and luminance contrast. Video recordings and a designed questionnaire were used during the whole process. Results show that ego vehicle drivers prefer a projection distance between 5 to 10 m. However, a distance of 5 m is preferred by overtaking vehicle drivers in terms of visibility and safety. Luminance contrasts have no significant effect on the symbol's visibility in 5 m and 10 m projection distances. In contrast, participants in overtaking vehicles feel difficult to understand the situation for 15 m condition, which increases their overall workload significantly (p < 0.019). No significant effect is recorded in terms of change in driving behavior.

AB Recent advancements in automated vehicle technology and the concurrent emergence of ride-hailing services have focused increasing attention on Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD; a system of shared driverless taxis) as a potential solution for sustainable future urban mobility. However, the impacts of an unrestricted deployment of AMOD are as yet uncertain and likely to be context-specific; evidence with existing on-demand services suggests that they may lead to the cannibalization of mass-transit and increased traffic congestion. In this context, automated demand-responsive transit (also termed microtransit), which provides similar on-demand services (stop-to-stop or curbside) through higher capacity vehicles, may prove to be a promising substitute and/or complement. In this study, we evaluate the performance of such an automated demand response transit system (hereafter AMOD minibus) through agent-based simulations of the Singapore network. Towards this end, we extend SimMobility (an agent- and activity-based microsimulation laboratory) with the capability of modeling an AMOD minibus service including demand, supply and their interactions. On the demand side, we use an activity-based model system that draws on data from a stated-preferences survey conducted in Singapore. On the supply side, an insertion heuristic is applied to dynamically perform both the assignment of requests to vehicles and vehicle routing. Scenario simulations on the Singapore network (with an area-wide deployment of the AMOD services) indicate the potential benefits of an automated demand responsive transit service for local circulation, which can result in a reduction of Vehicle Kilometres Traveled of up to 50 & x0025; (compared to the AMOD shared taxis) whilst satisfying the same demand, with a modest increase in average travel times.

AB One of the important tasks of an autonomous mobile vehicle is the reliable and fast estimation of its position over time. This paper presents the development of an adaptive technique to hasten and improve the quality of correlation-based template matching for monocular visual odometry systems that estimate the relative motion of ground vehicles in low-textured environments. Moreover, the factors that can affect the maximum permissible vehicle driving speed were determined and the related equations were derived. The developed system uses a single downward-facing monocular camera installed at an optimum location to avoid the negative effect of directional sunlight and shadows which can disturb the correlation. In addition, the normalized cross-correlation method is implemented to calculate the pixel displacement between image frames. Although this method is highly effective for template matching because of its invariance to linear brightness and contrast variations, it incurs high computational cost. Thus, the optimal sizes of image template and matching search area are selected and their locations are dynamically changed according to vehicle acceleration, in order to achieve a compromise between the performance and the computational cost of correlation. The proposed technique increases the allowable vehicle driving speed and reduces the probability of template false-matching. Moreover, compared to traditional full search matching techniques, the adaptive technique demonstrates high efficiency and accuracy and improves the quality and speed of the correlation with more than 87% of reduction in computational cost.

AB The goal of this paper is to provide insight about the effect of acceleration saturation in the car-following model. In this contribution, we consider a heterogeneous, mixed-traffic scenario which contains both human-driven and autonomous vehicles subjected to time delays. Corresponding stability charts are provided from which one can tune the control parameters of the automated vehicles to achieve smooth traffic flow. By taking into account the acceleration saturation, it modifies the global behaviour of the system and reduces the range of the optimal technological parameters. On a demonstrative example, we highlight the complex dynamical phenomenon induced by the saturation and we attempt to connect these nonlinear investigations to the engineering practice and point out their relevance.

AB In this paper, we investigate the possibility and condition of exploiting wireless-powered signals as a cover for conducting covert communications in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. Specifically, we aim to design the hovering altitude of a UAV and its prior transmission probability to strike a balance between energy replenishment and covert communications. We derive the necessary condition for guaranteeing communication covertness subject to an energy replenishment constraint, under which the UAV's optimal hovering and the prior transmission probability are determined. Our simulation shows that varying the prior transmission probability can significantly improve the achievable communication covertness under the energy replenishment constraint, relative to a baseline scheme with a fixed prior transmission probability.

AB In urban areas, the problem of recurring daily congestion is constantly increasing. A possible solution is seen in the application of adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) systems for the control of signalized intersections. While available ATSC systems can achieve an increase in the Level of Service, the focus of ATSC research has shifted towards the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, which allow the controller to learn the optimal control policy by direct interaction with the environment. This paper describes the fundamentals of traffic signal control, RL algorithms and approaches and their application to ATSC, with a discussion on the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles on future traffic signal control. In conclusion, a summary of open research questions and possible directions for future research in the domain of RL-based traffic signal control is given.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING; SYSTEM
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been used extensively in many applications, such as surveillance, medical transportation and delivery tasks. These applications usually involve an attachment system to connect a payload. However, when connected to such a coupled system, the UAV exhibits lower flight performance mainly due to gust loads. Mathematical modeling is used in this paper to illustrate the comparison between an UAV with a coupled system and a conventional UAV. Proportional Derivative (PD) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) approaches are used to evaluate the vibrations of the payload, and the UAV trajectory subjected to Dryden gust. This work therefore uses these methods to investigate the dynamic response of a quadrotor-type UAV equipped with a payload and a flexible attachment system.

AB For platoons under the multiple-predecessor following (MPF) topology, communication delays can compromise both the internal stability and string stability. The mast straightforward solution to guarantee stability is by increasing the time headway. However, time headway plays a significant role in road capacity and increasing its value is in contrast with the idea of platooning. In this study, internal stability and string stability of platoons suffering from communication delays are investigated and a lower bound for the time headway is proposed. Using this hound, platoons do not need to massively increase the time headway in order to compensate for the effects of communications delays. Finally, we evaluate the proposed lower bound on the time headway and the simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB This work proposes a novel data-driven distributed formation-control approach based on multi-population evolutionary games, which is structured in a leader-follower scheme. The methodology considers a time-varying communication graph that describes how the multiple agents share information to each other. We present stability guarantees for configurations given by time-varying interaction networks, making the proposed method suitable for real-world problems where communication constraints change along the time. Additionally, the proposed formation controller allows for an agent to leave or enter the group without the need to modify the behaviors of other agents in the group. This game-theoretical approach is evaluated through numerical simulations and real outdoors experimental results using a fleet of aerial autonomous vehicles, showing the control performance.

AB Wheel loader trajectories between loading and unloading positions in a repetitive loading cycle are studied. A wheel loader model available in the literature is improved for better fuel estimation and optimal control problems are formulated and solved using it. The optimization results are analyzed in a side to side comparison with measurement data from a real world application. It is shown that the trajectory properties affect the operation productivity. However, efficient trajectories are not the only requirement for high productivity operation and all major power consuming sources such as vehicle dynamics, lifting and steering have to be included in the optimization for productivity analysis. The effect of operator steering capability is also analyzed showing that development of autonomous vehicles can be envisaged especially for repetitive cycles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The current article presents a fuzzy logic approach for creating an artificial intelligent and autonomous pilot for unmanned aerial vehicle. The article presents a new way of identifying the position of the UAV relative to a destination point, based on two angles: deflection angle and relative angle. The major advantage of the presented method (over other artificial intelligent methods like genetic programming or neural networks) is the way of taking decisions in real-time, without the need of presenting any domain specific data to the system before running the simulation.
   In this article, a professional flight simulator - Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) is used and its software development kit (SDK), and therefore, all computations are specific to this flight simulator. The aircraft that is used is a real UAV General Atomics RQ/MQ-1 Predator - an FSX add-on.

AB This letter investigates the achievable rate maximization problem of a downlink unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system aided by an intelligent omni-surface (IOS). Different from the state-of-the-art reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that only reflects incident signals, the IOS can simultaneously reflect and transmit the signals, thereby providing full-dimensional rate enhancement. We formulate this rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the IOS's phase shift and the UAV trajectory. Although it is difficult to solve it optimally due to its non-convexity, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the IOS-assisted UAV communications can achieve significant improvement in achievable rates compared to other benchmark schemes.

AB As a new type of unmanned intelligent equipment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted growing attentions in various fields, such as electronic reconnaissance in jamming environments. However, the intense confrontation and high dynamics of the hostile jamming environments require a UAV swarm to achieve flexible and autonomous deployment optimization, and enhance anti-jamming capability. In this letter, a distributed UAV swarm's deployment approach is proposed where a congestion game is formulated to model the interaction among the UAV swarm. Particularly, each UAV independently adjusts the location, and realizes the efficient, flexible and dynamic position control, thus increasing the amount of collected data and enhancing the anti-jamming performance. Moreover, the Nash equilibrium of the formulated congestion game is analyzed, and simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) commend a substantial reduction of human-caused road accidents while simultaneously lowering emissions, mitigating congestion, decreasing energy consumption and increasing overall productivity. However, achieving higher SAE levels of driving automation and complying with ISO26262 C and D Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) is a multi-disciplinary challenge that requires insights into safety-critical architectures, multi-modal perception and real-time control. This paper presents an assorted effort carried out in the European H2020 ECSEL project-PRYSTINE. In this paper, we (1) investigate Simplex, 1oo2d and hybrid fail-operational computing architectures, (2) devise a multi-modal perception system with fail-safety mechanisms, (3) present a passenger vehicle-based demonstrator for low-speed autonomy and (4) suggest a trust-based fusion approach validated on a heavy-duty truck.

AB This paper is concerned with distributed model predictive control (DMPC) for distributed linear time invariant systems with decoupled dynamics but coupling via a common cost function and common convex state constraints. In the proposed scheme, local model predictive controllers exchange state measurements and predicted input sequences with bounded uncertainty via possibly delayed communication. A robust model predictive control (RMPC) problem is solved locally under consideration of uncertain information received from other subsystems. The local RMPCs separately optimize over nominal inputs as well as feedback policies for the delayed information and can be implemented as a tractable quadratic program. Under appropriate assumptions, the proposed scheme satisfies the coupling constraints and renders the system practically stable. Simulation results for the control of a platoon of autonomous vehicles relative to a lead vehicle illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

DE DARP; Optimization problem; Metaheuristics
AB The increasing number of cars is an important issue for big cities administrations and several problems are related to this phenomenon, such as air pollution, traffic jams, drivers stress and so on. A potential solution for this problem is the use of car polling systems, which support the process of car sharing among users. However, current systems only work as a channel where providers and consumers can arrange shared cars for public transport. This work extends this idea via the use of DARP (Dial-a-Ride Problem) and metaheuristic concepts so that the allocation of rides can be carried out in an autonomous and dynamic way. The main aim of this approach is to optimize and facilitate the sharing process of personal cars, so that the number of vehicles in the roads can be reduced together with all the problems that such vehicles raise on.

AB Small private vessels are one avenue by which nuclear materials may be smuggled across international borders. While one can contemplate using the land-based approach of radiation portal monitors on the navigable waterways that lead to many ports, these systems are ill-suited to the problem. In contrast to roadways, where lanes segregate vehicles, and motion is well controlled by inspection booths; channels, inlets, and rivers present chaotic traffic patterns populated by vessels of all sizes. A unique solution to this problem is based on a portal-less portal monitor designed to handle free-flowing traffic on roadways with up to five-traffic lanes. The instrument uses a combination of visible-light and gamma-ray imaging to acquire and link radiation images to individual vehicles. This paper presents the results of a recent test of the system in a maritime setting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the facilitated development of highly automated driving functions and automated vehicles, the need for advanced testing techniques also arose. With a near-infinite number of potential traffic scenarios, vehicles have to drive an increased number of test kilometers during development, which would be very difficult to achieve with currently utilized conventional testing methods. State-of-the-Art testing technologies such as Vehicle-in-the-Loop (ViL) or Scenario-in-the-Loop (SciL) can provide a long-term solution; however, validation of these complex systems should also be addressed. ViL and SciL technologies provide real-time control and measurement with multiple participants; however, they require enormous computational capacity and low-latency communication to provide comparable results with real-world testing. 5G (fifth-generation wireless) communication and Edge computing can aid in fulfilling these needs, although appropriate implementation should also be tested. In the current paper, a realized control model based on the SciL architecture was presented that was developed with real-world testing data and validated utilizing co-simulation and digital twin techniques. The model was established in Simcenter Prescan (c) connected to MATLAB Simulink (R) and validated using IPG CarMaker (R), which was used to feed the simulation with the necessary input data to replace the real-world testing data. The aim of the current paper was to introduce steps of the development process, to present the results of the validation procedure, and to provide an outlook of potential future implementations into the state of the art in proving ground ecosystems.

AB The rapid development of automated vehicle (AV) technology and increasing deployment in the near future present novel opportunities for congestion control on highways. Collective dynamics of AVs allow for network-wide traffic management, offering more flexible centralised and decentralised control schemes. To capitalise on this technology, control strategies need to be developed to enable traffic management to take advantage of AV potential to manipulate traffic flow dynamics. This paper presents a two-level traffic control method to relieve highway congestion by controlling lateral flows of AVs. The first, a proactive lane density distribution optimisation problem to establish the optimal vehicle density in lanes upstream of bottlenecks. The second, a reactive lane change advisory system to tackle local merging manoeuvres and resolve merge conflicts. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through microsimulation experiments and comparison to ramp metering strategy. To consider the transition period and gradual uptake of AVs, the proposed control is also tested at various penetration rates of AVs. At moderate to high levels of AV penetration, the control is demonstrated to be superior to ramp metering within a range of traffic demands. The proposed traffic control reduces total travel time of all vehicles and travel time variation among vehicles on the mainline and ramps. The effectiveness is attributed to the delayed onset and severity of congestion and subsequent capacity drop. The success of the proposed strategy is illustrated on a three-lane highway with a single on-ramp and further exhibited on a road network with multiple on-ramps and off-ramps.

AB Wireless channel state information (CSI) from intelligent vehicles to the roadside unit (RSU) is a must for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications in Internet of Vehicles, but easily suffers the risks of being attacked due to the publicly known and deterministic characteristic of PHY-layer pilots that are employed for CSI acquisition. This incurs the issue of wireless pilot authentication (WPA), that is, verifying the authenticity of pilots and claimed CSIs. In this paper, we, for multiantenna V2I orthogonal frequency division multiplexed communications, develop a PHY-layer cover-free (PHY-CF) coding theory to build up a secure WPA (SWPA) protocol. Here, we encode and convey vehicle pilot signals into diversified subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) on the time-frequency domain by employing cover-free coding. We redesign the decoding procedure using the signal independence characteristic such that those encoded SAPs, though camouflaged by malicious signals and superimposed onto each other in wireless environment, could be separated, identified and decoded into the original pilots securely. For this protocol, we prove that perfect pilot conveying and separation could be both guaranteed. We formulate the pilot identification error probability (IEP) and show how PHY-CF coding could help position the location of attacker and reduce IEP to further achieve ultrasecurity. Considering 20 MHz long-term evolution bandwidth, we prove that the number of co-time co-frequency vehicles that are securely authenticated achieves up to 19 x X for X serving sectors of base station type RSU and the latency time of uplink data access is up to 1.5 ms, thus furthering the autonomous driving. Computer simulations comprehensively verify those benefits of proposed SWPA protocol.

AB In an automated car, users can fully engage in a distractor task, making it a primary task. Compared to manual driving, drivers can engage in tasks that are difficult to interrupt and of higher demand, the consequences can be a reduced perception of, and an impaired reaction to, warnings. In this study we compared three in-vehicle warnings (auditory, tactile, and auditory-tactile) which were presented during three highly attention capturing tasks (visual, auditory, and tactile) while the user was engaged in a self-driving car scenario, culminating in an emergency brake event where the warning was presented. The novel addition for this paper was that three set paced, attention capturing tasks, as well the three warnings were all designed in a pilot study to have comparable workload and noticeability. This enabled a direct comparison of human performance to be made between each of the attention capturing tasks, which are designed to occupy only one specific modality (auditory, visual or haptic), but remain similar in overall task demand. Results from the study showed reaction times to the tactile warning (for the emergency braking event) were significantly slower compared to the auditory and auditory-tactile (aka multimodal or multi sensory) warning. Despite the similar reaction times between the in-vehicle auditory warning and the multimodal warning, the multimodal warning led to a reduced number of missed warnings and fewer false responses. However, the auditory and auditorytactile warnings were rated significantly more startling than the tactile alone. Our results extend the literature regarding the performance benefits of multimodal warnings by comparing them with in-vehicle auditory warnings in an autonomous driving context. The setpace attention capturing tasks in this study would be of interest to other researchers to evaluate the interaction in an automated driving context, particularly with hard to interrupt and attention capturing tasks.

AB This work proposes a novel resource allocation strategy for anti-jamming in Cognitive Radio using Active Inference (AIn), and a cognitive-UAV is employed as a case study. An Active Generalized Dynamic Bayesian Network (Active-GDBN) is proposed to represent the external environment that jointly encodes the physical signal dynamics and the dynamic interaction between UAV and jammer in the spectrum. We cast the action and planning as a Bayesian inference problem that can be solved by avoiding surprising states (minimizing abnormality) during online learning. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed AIn approach in minimizing abnormalities (maximizing rewards) and has a high convergence speed by comparing it with the conventional Frequency Hopping and Q-learning.

ID REAL-TIME ESTIMATION; VELOCITY ESTIMATION; POSITION
AB Odometry is one of most-used techniques used in mobile robotics and autonomous vehicles, especially when the indoor navigation is required or when robot or vehicle moves inside the tunnel. The output of the odometer is usually a count of pulses corresponding to the distance run by given wheel. Due to the quantization noise, estimation of the velocity (first derivative of the distance) is challenging. This article is focused on curve-fitting filter used for the speed estimation and optimization of its parameters, considering the physical constraints of the robot, sampling frequency of the system and the quantization step. The paper proposes an empirical formula for estimating the optimal parameters of the curve fitting filter. The optimized filter has been evaluated using both simulation and real experiment and compared with several standard differentiation methods.

AB Since January 2014 more vehicles are being fitted with new active safety systems facilitating vehicle collision avoidance or mitigation by reducing the kinetic energy prior to impact, the most common being autonomous emergency braking systems. Although beneficial in reducing crash energy these safety features may influence the occupant's posture within the cabin, and require special attention for the design and development of restraints system should the occupants be out of position or unbelted. This paper reviews the current reference volunteers' physical test, proposed by Ejima, used to validate the unbelted kinematics of active human computer model and proposes a new set of generic biomechanical kinematic responses based on OM4IS sled test data, which are judged more representative to an unbelted occupant's reaction. New kinematics corridors for head and torso angular change in a typical 1 'g' frontal scenario are provided.

AB Underwater robots play an increasingly significant role in helping humans explore or accomplish various tasks in the underwater environment. Underwater walking robots are members of a large group of underwater robots. With the support of multiple legs, underwater walking robots can walk continuously on underwater ground and have good capability to resist water current disturbances. These robots are qualified to perform the tasks that autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles are unable to or cannot efficiently accomplish, particularly exploration, observation, detection, and operation on underwater ground. This paper provides a brief introduction to the development of underwater walking robots and the methods to address water current disturbances acting on underwater walking robots in underwater environments. This study also presents future directions in the methods to resist water current disturbances for underwater walking robots.

AB This study presents an adaptive logic-oriented neural control system for Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV). An autonomous fuzzy neural controller is constructed by using rudder to regulate both the tracking error and heading error. The proposed approach based on logic-oriented neural network with domain knowledge easily incorporated in advance can be easily interpreted and it can be directly translated into a series of logic expressions formed over a collection of information granules. The proposed neural controller can adapt itself on-line from a direct evaluation of the control accuracy, so there is no need for a supervised training process. The control system is implemented in a model of USV. Simulations for track-keeping control under environmental wind and waves have been investigated. Simulation results presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For efficient sensor coverage of large industrial and incident areas, fast and flexible strategies for collecting sensor data through an autonomous, wirelessly connected swarm of (Micro) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (MUAVs) are still an emerging challenge. Deploying multiple MUAVs which stably carry sensing equipment in hostile environments yields cost efficiency and reducing the risk to human life. The use of an aerial ad hoc sensor network based on MUAV agents promises more timely and accurate information by fusing measurements from different types of sensors. In this paper, we examine agent-based mobility algorithms that target high spatial coverage distribution, high total coverage, and high-quality communication links. For these key figures, the performance of the different novel mobility algorithms is evaluated. We particularly focus on channel aware mobility and on self-organizing mesh topologies of MUAV-based sensor swarms with respect to communication constraints.

We design such a simulator incorporating environmental domain randomization to enhance data generalizability and a low-cost physical test platform running the Robotic Operating System. A toolchain comprising a gamified driving simulator and low-cost vehicle platform is novel and facilitates behavior cloning and domain adaptation without specialized knowledge, supporting crowdsourced data generation. This enables small organizations to develop certain robust and resilient self-driving systems. As proof-of-concept, the simulator is used to capture lane-following data from AI-driven and human-operated agents, with these data training line following Convolutional Neural Networks that transfer without domain adaptation to work on the physical platform.

These changes create new opportunities for cybercrime, particularly acts of cyber-trespass by computer hackers. This study considers how these technical threats may be limited through the use of criminological theory, specifically a routine activities perspective. The role of various actors in the automotive supply chain, and their potential function to deter and mitigate threats are discussed. The implications of this study for theory and practice are discussed in depth.

SO JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE

LA English
DT Article
AB This paper considers the problem of planar homing guidance for a vehicle traveling to a beacon with unknown location and using a measurement of binary range-rate. The fundamental nature of binary range-rate is studied, and a guidance law requiring only this measurement is presented. Another guidance law utilizing both binary range-rate and heading angle is also presented, and stability is addressed. This guidance law consists of separated control and observation, and it does not require finding the closest points of approach for multiple headings. This guidance law's response to measurement corruption and observer gain is studied. Characteristics of good initial estimates are given, and an exploration method is presented that provides good initial estimates and leads to improved response. This approach provides a method of low-cost, autonomous homing guidance that utilizes a single, omnidirectional receiver to guide a vehicle to a single, omnidirectional transmitting beacon.

AB The use of autonomous underwater vehicles for a variety of purposes is set to increase in the future. A key issue is accurate navigation, especially for survey applications large cumulative error are introduced by the various position sensors: accelerometer; Doppler velocity log; compass; inertial navigation sensors. Algorithms such as simultaneous localisation and mapping rely on accurate landmark recognition in order to correct the vehicle position. This study proposes a solution based on broadband sonar and passive artificial coded landmarks to improve the navigation. Through resolution of the wave equation for acoustic propagation in a multilayer concentric sphere, it is shown that there is a great diversity in the echo spectrum with only small changes in internal structure. This enables the design of a set of passive landmarks, which can be identified unambiguously, since each has a characteristic signature or spectral code when insonified with a broadband sonar.

AB New technologies and innovative business models are leading to connected, shared, autonomous, and electric solutions for the tomorrow of urban transport and logistics (UTL). The efficiency and sustainability of these solutions are greatly empowered by the capability of understanding and utilizing the tremendous amount of data generated by passengers, drivers, and vehicles. In this study, we first review the innovative applications in UTL and several related research areas in the operations management (OM)/operations research (OR) literature. We then highlight the sources, types, and uses of data in different applications. We further elaborate on business analytics techniques and software developed to facilitate the planning and management of UTL systems. Finally, we conclude the paper by reflecting on the emerging trends and potential research directions in data-driven decision making for smart UTL.

AB In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relaying communication system, where the RIS is mounted on the UAV and can move at a high speed. Compared with the conventional static RIS, better performance and more flexibility can be achieved with the assistance of the mobile UAV. We maximize the average downlink throughput by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, RIS passive beamforming and source power allocation for each time slot. The formulated non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems: passive beamforming optimization, trajectory optimization and power allocation optimization. An alternating iterative optimization algorithm of the three subproblems is proposed to achieve the suboptimal solutions. The numerical results indicate that the RIS-UAV relaying communication system with trajectory optimization can get higher throughput.

AB With the world population highly increasing, efficient methods of transportation are more necessary than ever. On the other hand, the sharing economy must be explored and applied where possible, aiming to palliate the effects of human development on the environment. In this paper we explore demand-responsive shared transportation as a system with the potential to serve its users' displacement needs while being less polluting. In contrast with previous works, we focus on a distributed proposal that allows each vehicle to retain its private information. Our work describes a partially dynamic system in which the vehicles are self-interested: they decide which users to serve according to the benefit it reports them. With our modelling, the system can be adapted to mobility platforms of autonomous drivers and even simulate the competition among different companies.

Therefore several studies on both issues have been performed toward formulating beneficial driver-vehicle interactions and for future intelligent vehicles and autonomous environments. To provide an insight into these studies, this present study conducts bibliometric analyses to obtain information about when and where the research was conducted by whom and how mainstream content has evolved over the years. BibExcel and CiteSpace were utilized for the performance and co-word network analyses. A total of 2498 documents from 2000- 2019 in the field were filtered from the "Core Set" of Web of Science (WoS) for quantitative analysis. This study offers researchers a comprehensive understanding of UX and usability of driving studies in the last decades and research directions for the future.

AB The present paper is the first report of an experimental study on the energy efficiencies in the millimeter wave power transfer to an autonomously-controlled micro aerial vehicle (MAV). A tight beam of millimeter wave at 28 GHz was transmitted vertically upward, and a quad-rotor type MAV was autonomously controlled using the iterative feedback tuning method to hover over the beam and receive the millimeter wave power. The maximum value of the receiver efficiency was (1 +/- 2) x 10(-3) and its duty ratio was 0.29 +/- 0.08, for which the distance between the MAV and the millimeter wave transmitter was 800 mm. The energy loss and the low duty ratio were both due mostly to the loss in the capture efficiency due to the location scattering of the MAV.

For these modification purposes the line of sight laser beam riding (LOSLBR) system is currently being considered. To allow for UAV tracking from a ground-based tracking and guidance station (GBTGS), an optoelectronic automated tracking system that operates in the visible spectrum of light has been designed. Likewise, the parameters and capacity limits of the individual parts of these aspects are defined and verified, depending on the type of the flying object being observed and guided. In terms of monitoring, the optical path transmission parameters such as the type of optical sensor, lens parameters, throughput and speed of the interface, type of compression, and attributes of the machine vision algorithms are investigated.

AB Nowadays, vehicles of modern fleets are endowed with advanced devices that allow the operators of a control center to have global knowledge about fleet status, including existing incidents. Fleet management systems support real-time decision making at the control center so as to maximize fleet performance. In this paper, setting out from our experience in dynamic coordination of fleet management systems, we focus on fleets that are open, dynamic and highly autonomous. Furthermore, we propose how to cope with the scalability problem as the number of vehicles grows. We present our proposed architecture for open fleet management systems and use the case of taxi services as example of our approach. We carried out some experiments, which showed our proposed algorithm outperform the most common assignment method both in waiting times of clients and taxi costs.

DT Article
DE Flying qualities; Handling qualities; UAV; Modeling and simulation
AB The purpose of this work is to identify some criteria for the evaluation of flying and handling qualities of small scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (mini-UAVs). A possible solution for the evaluation of handling qualities is based on the minimization of cumulative cross track error (estimated along a sequence of waypoints) at constant altitude and speed, assuming gradual variation of the control inputs (throttle, elevator and ailerons). A complete parametric analysis of vehicle open loop dynamics is performed for a demonstrative mini-UAV. The flying and handling qualities are assessed implementing the selected platform in a full state flight simulator including a realistic autonomous navigation and control system. Different target paths are considered and a parametric study based on the minimization of the cross track error is presented. A section of conclusions summarizes the key results and presents suggestions for future work.

AB The paper deals with the design, development, test and exploitation of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) for coastal and protected waters applications, such as sampling of the sea surface microlayer and harbor survey. The unmanned catamaran Charlie, whichis fully autonomous from the point of view of both power supply and computing capabilities and is supervised by a portable human operator station, is characterized by a state-of-the art hardware, software and control architecture. A PC-compatible computing platform and a GNU/Linux based embedded real-time system support an intelligent control architecture, while advanced modeling and identification techniques, based on on-board sensors, allow the implementation of accurate navigation, guidance and control model-based algorithms. Results of experiments carried out on motion estimation and maneuvering control in the Genoa-Pra harbor are presented and discussed as well as the vessel exploitation in scientific applications and research projects.

AB In recent years, advanced technologies are used in automobiles, which make it simpler to drive on roads. However, driving is not trouble-free considering the unexpected hindrances and difficulty in recognizing traffic signs while driving at high speeds. Due to the advancement in technologies such as image recognition, several automated vehicles and techniques are developed to assist the drivers while driving. In this paper, an integrated intelligent system is designed using YOLO V3 neural architecture for recognizing the obstacles and visualizing the traffic sign through the input image from the camera of the moving vehicle. A Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) is being used with 5G connectivity to share the information to the other passing vehicles present in the vicinity. Apart from this, a notification is sent to the nearby centre for clearing any obstacle if found on roads during transportation. Real-time images of every possible obstacle such as a crack on roads along with traffic signs are trained using machine learning algorithms, thereby making the system more efficient and accurate. These techniques are developed in order to provide an pollution free environment and reduce accidents in roads with the concepts of green computing. The proposed automated system performs exemplary in recognizing the obstacle and traffic sign, making it easy for the drivers to drive more freely and reducing the pollution thereby producing a eco-friendly environment. According to the algorithms proposed in this paper, the results show that the algorithm used produces accurate results compared to the existing techniques.

AB It has always been an important and arduous task to detect the complex dynamic traffic environment, especially for unmanned driving. Although the existing advanced detection models have reached the speed requirements for detection, the detection accuracy needs to be further elevated to improve the unmanned driving's safety. How to balance the accuracy and speed of detecting the complex dynamic traffic environment is still the primary problem to be solved for unmanned vehicles. Therefore, this article proposes a detection model of the complex dynamic traffic environment for unmanned vehicles by following the framework idea of YOLOv3. Firstly, we regard MobileNetv3 as the backbone and replace the traditional convolution with the depthwise separable convolution in the whole model to reduce the number of parameters and calculations. Secondly, in enhanced feature fusion layers, we perform the multi-scale fusion of four feature maps by the compress-and-expand module, the SPP module, and the cross-layer bidirectional module of feature fusion to improve the locating accuracy and reduce false detections. Thirdly, we add an IoU loss to improve the accuracy of model regression. Then, we employ the improved clustering algorithm to re-cluster anchor boxes, reducing the time overhead while improving the clustering accuracy. Finally, we compare the proposed model with other advanced detection models in the processed BDD dataset and the KITTI dataset. We verify that the mAP of the proposed model improves notably without loss of detection speed, the number of parameters and calculations decreases dramatically, and the proposed model exhibits a more superior performance.

DT Article

   agents; Path planning; Nonholonomic vehicles
ID PURSUIT-EVASION GAMES; VEHICLE
AB This work presents a collision avoidance control strategy that solves the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation for an agent to quickly take action assuming a worst-case scenario. By doing so, the agent can develop a control strategy that is robust to the strategies of other agents with whom collision is possible. Consequently, if the governing dynamics of the agent are sufficient, then a collision can be avoided. We build on the idea of finding control solutions by using a differential game theoretic approach (Mettenheim and Breitner, 2009). This is beneficial because the opposing agent's strategy is incorporated into the control by assuming it plays the worst-case actions. The approach in this work solves the zero-sum aspects of the control on-line using a fast solution method that operates over partitions in the state space (Goode et al., ASME J Dyn Syst Meas Control, 2011). We form the solution to the Homicidal Chauffeur game which is used to provide the control for an evader attempting to avoid a pursuer, an agent that deviates from its normal path and into that of the evader. Furthermore, the evader is constrained to remain within defined boundaries of its assigned travel area, such as a road lane, water channel, etc. The control strategy consists of three parts: (1) a zero-sum approximation of collision avoidance, (2) high-level path planning, and (3) low-level vehicle control. Each component is explained, and an example is given using a real robotic vehicle control system. Here, we show how the control can be implemented using a simple processor located on a vehicle that seeks to avoid a collision with another oncoming vehicle, making a left turn.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

AB On Oct. 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma, a category 5 storm, made landfall at Cape Romano, Florida. Three days later, the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue at the University of South Florida deployed an iSENYS helicopter and a prototype unmanned water surface vehicle, AEOS-1, to survey damage in parts of Marco Island, 14 km from landfall. The effort was the first known use of unmanned sea surface vehicles (USVs) for emergency response and established their suitability for the recovery phase of disaster management by detecting damage to seawalls and piers, locating submerged debris (moorings and handrails), and determining safe lanes for sea navigation. It provides a preliminary domain theory of postdisaster port and littoral inspection with unmanned vehicles for use by the human-robot interaction community It was also the first known demonstration of the strongly heterogeneous USV-micro aerial vehicle (MAV) team for any domain. The effort identified cooperative UAV-USV strategies and open issues for autonomous operations near structures. The effort showed that the MAV provided a much-needed external view for situation awareness and provided spotting for areas to be inspected. Concepts of operations for USV damage inspection and USV-MAV cooperation emerged, including a formula for computing the human-robot ratio: N-h = (2 x N-v) + 1, where Nh is the number of humans and N-v is the number of vehicles. The outstanding research issues span three areas: challenges for USVs operating near littoral structures, general issues for USV-MAV cooperation, and new applications. It is expected that the lessons learned will be transferrable to defense and homeland safety and security applications, such as port security, and other phases of emergency response, including rescue.

AB The remoteness and isolation of hadal zone environments make this region of inner space a particularly fertile field for scientific inquiry. After the successful development of the 7,000-m class deep manned submersible Jiaolong, the Chinese government and scientists have recognized the necessity to develop deep submergence vehicles up to 11,000 m depth. In this paper, a unique Chinese journey to the Challenger Deep is described. The whole project is to construct a movable laboratory that includes a mothership, three full ocean depth landers, a hybrid autonomous and remotely operated vehicle (ARV), and a human occupied vehicle (HOV). A three-phase approach is adopted for this project. Phase I is the completion of 4,000-m class sea trials of the first lander and the ARV with a temporary ship. Phase II is the completion of 11,000-m sea trials of the three landers and the ARV with the newly built mothership. Phase III is the completion of 11,000-m sea trials of the HOV with the same permanent mothership. In order to overcome the funding issue, a multiple investment method was introduced in this project. The basic idea is that the funding for the ARV and three landers will be sought from university sources and local government, the funding for the mothership will be sought from private investors, and only the manned submersible will seek support from the central government. To the authors' knowledge, this may be the first attempt in China to carry out a project with private investment as a supplement to governmental funding. The project has progressed very well over the past 3 years and has proven that this funding strategy is working. In this paper, the progress of the whole project is briefly introduced, while the focus is on the description of the design details of the Rainbowfish ARV including the results of the first phase of sea trials. The ARV planned to perform its 11,000-m class sea trial at the end of 2016.

AB Underwater unmanned vehicle cluster cooperative area target searching is an inexpensive and efficient effort for salvaging and vigilance at sea. In order to realize the autonomous area searching of the attacking underwater unmanned vehicle (AUUV) cluster, a multiple AUUV cooperative area target searching method is put forward and simulated in this paper. The proposed method combines the AUUV with an underwater environment to create an environmental model, an AUUV motion model, a target probability and update model, and an object optimization function. Moreover, the global-best difference-mutation brain storm optimization algorithm is adopted to test the multiple AUUV cooperative area target searching path planning. The results of the simulation experiment verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and models. Hence, a new scheme is advanced to realize multiple AUUV cooperative area target searching and expand multiple AUUV applications. (C) 2022 Author(s).

AB This work outlines a practically realizable (i.e., deployable and scalable) yet novel autonomous exploration strategy for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which in our case, corresponds to multi-rotor configurations. Concretely, based on a probabilistic map, UAVs are able to modify their trajectory to localize the required target in unknown areas. This is thanks to the fact that the proposed exploration strategy uses the past and the actual perceived data in order to deduce the location of the target, and a dedicated control law allows the multi-rotor to reach the desired position. To realize the strategy, we developed a hierarchical control architecture that can be embedded in multi-rotors. We show its effectiveness by computer simulations and tests using real drones, against a forest-fire localization scenario for an unknown area.

AB The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the best-known combinatorial optimization problems. Many methods derived from TSP have been applied to study autonomous vehicle route planning with fuel constraints. Nevertheless, less attention has been paid to reinforcement learning (RL) as a potential method to solve refueling problems. This paper employs RL to solve the traveling salesman problem With refueling (TSPWR). The technique proposes a model (actions, states, reinforcements) and RL-TSPWR algorithm. Focus is given on the analysis of RL parameters and on the refueling influence in route learning optimization of fuel cost. Two RL algorithms: Q-learning and SARSA are compared. In addition, RL parameter estimation is performed by Response Surface Methodology, Analysis of Variance and Tukey Test. The proposed method achieves the best solution in 15 out of 16 case studies.

AB We introduce a new exponentially convergent trajectory tracking control law based on the fully nonlinear quadrotor model subject to unknown disturbances and modeling uncertainties. The approach takes advantage of the system's differential flatness property to relate the second time derivative of linear accelerations (snap) to the roll and pitch moments. Using these model-based relations, the closed-loop system is transformed to follow an exponentially stable error dynamics that are robust to unknown disturbances and uncertainties bounded on a compact set. It is proven that the control law exponentially stabilizes the position and yaw tracking errors, while the roll and pitch angle tracking errors are ultimately bounded. Simulations and experimental results under windy conditions and without disturbance estimation, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach.

Pathfinder is equipped with the latest industrial hardware components and employs the most recent software stacks for simultaneous localization, navigation, and mapping. As the most significant contribution to the current robotics development, powerlink interface enabling direct data transfers between robot operating system and powerlink compatible hardware was developed. This combination is in our best knowledge reported here for the first time and the results with comprehensive tutorial were made publicly available as a GitHub repository. The capabilities of Pathfinder were explored during preliminary on-site tests in local hospital. From experimental results in a hospital it was confirmed that the robot can move along its global path, and reach the goal without colliding with static and moving objects.

AB In this paper, we study attitude stabilization strategies via output sensor feedback for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), inch-size robots capable of autonomous flight. In order to compensate for the size and power limitations of MAVs, we introduce the ocelli and halteres, the body orientation and rotation sensing mechanisms used by flying insects. The analysis and simulations of these sensors show the feasibility of using such biologically inspired approaches to build biomimetic gyroscopes and angular position detectors. Finally, attitude stabilization techniques based on these sensors are proposed and successfully tested on an aerodynamic model for a micromechanical flying insect (MFI). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt in using output feedback from biomimetic devices with ocelli and halteres to achieve attitude stabilization in MAVs.

AB Automatic control systems typically incorporate legacy code and components that were originally designed to operate independently. Furthermore, they operate under stringent safety and timing constraints. Current design strategies deal with these requirements and characteristics with ad hoc approaches. In particular, when designing control laws, implementation constraints are often ignored or cursorily estimated. Indeed, costly redesigns are needed after a prototype of the control system is built because of missed timing constraints and subtle transient errors. In this paper, we use the concepts of platform-based design to develop a methodology for the design of automatic control systems that builds in modularity and correct-by-construction procedures. We illustrate our strategy by describing the (successful) application of the methodology to the design of a time-based control system for a helicopter-based uninhabited aerial vehicle.

AB This paper focuses on the development of an optimization algorithm for car motion predictive control that addresses both hybrid car dynamics and hybrid minimization criterion. Instead of solving computationally demanding nonlinear mixed-integer programming task or approximating the hybrid dynamics/criterion, the Hamiltonian-switching hybrid nonlinear predictive control algorithm developed in this paper incorporates the information about hybridity directly into the optimization routine. To decrease the time complexity, several adaptive prediction horizon approaches are proposed, and for some of them, it is shown that they preserve maneuverability-related properties of the car. All developed alternatives are verified on an example of a motion control of a racing car and compared with the approximation-based nonlinear predictive control and a commercial product. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis examining robustness of the algorithm is included as well.

AB This letter presents the design and potential impact of the developed Research Oriented Underwater Glider for Hands-on Investigative Engineering (ROUGHIE). The ROUGHIE is an open-source, highly maneuverable, and low-cost vehicle that enables rapid development and testing of new hardware and software. ROUGHIE is an internally actuated glider capable of performing steady saw tooth glides in shallow water down to 3 m, tight turns with a minimum radius of 3 m, and a minimum endurance of 60 h. The novelty of this study is twofold: 1) a rail-based design to facilitate modularity and ease of assembly and 2) an effective internal rotary mass mechanism to increase maneuverability and perform tight turns. The ROUGHIE design strategically uses 3D printed plastic parts in low stress situations, which allows extreme design flexibility and enables tightly packed modules that can be easily customized.

AB Nowadays, the surveillance and inspection of underwater installations, such as power and telecommunication cables and pipelines, is carried out by trained operators who, from the surface, control a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) with cameras mounted over it. This is a tedious, time-consuming and expensive task, prone to errors mainly because of loss of attention or fatigue of the operator and also due to the typical low quality of seabed images. In this study, the development of a vision system guiding an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) able to detect and track automatically an under-water power cable laid on the seabed has been the main concern. The system has been tested using sequences from a video tape obtained by means of a ROV during several tracking sessions of various real cables. The average success rate that has been achieved is about 90% for a frame rate higher than 25 frames/second.

AB A heterogeneous swarm of marine robots was developed with the goal of autonomous long-term monitoring of environmental phenomena in the highly relevant ecosystem of Venice, Italy. As logistics are a continuing challenge in the field of marine robotics, especially when dealing with a large number of agents to be collected and redeployed per experimental run, an approach is needed that provides the benefits of simulation while also reflecting the complexity of the real world. This paper focuses on the development of a vehicle-in-the-loop test environment in which a surface station simulates and transmits the data of any number of simulated agents, while a real marine platform operates based on the received information. Several experimental runs of a specific use-case test scenario using the developed framework and carried out in the field are described and their results are examined.

DE LIDAR; autonomous vehicle; object classification; remote sensing
AB LIDAR sensors enable object and free-space detection for intelligent transportation systems and vehicles. This paper proposes a recognition method for LIDARs based on only a few detection planes. This method is useful especially in the case when the angular resolution of the scan is sufficient, but in the vertical direction the planes are far from each other. We use Fourier descriptor to characterize a scan plane and Convolutional Neural Network for classification. Our method exploits both time varying shape information and contours from multiple scan planes if available. The method performs at least as well as the state of the art algorithms in case of near field, and it also expands the detection range. It was evaluated on tens of thousands of samples from large public datasets and we did separate evaluation for far field objects as well.

AB Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are generally underactuated systems and when load is attached for transportation purposes, the system complexity increases. Therefore, the need to appropriately control such systems becomes paramount as they usually navigate in cluttered environments. In this work, we conceptualize the problem of cooperative tracking control for a Multi-agent UAV load system (MUAVLs) whereby each UAV is divided into global position and local attitude subsystems. To ensure that formation is maintained in a desired path, Neural Network Graph-theoretic Distributed Adaptive Control (NNGDAC) is used for the position subsystem with a modified virtual force artificial potential field for obstacle avoidance. Another Adaptive Feedback Linearization (AFBL) controller is also designed for the attitude subsystem which is verified by simulation results.

Based on the requirements of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), the qualitative provision about the apparent intention of anti-collision maneuver is quantified in the algorithm. Meanwhile, the Boolean expression technology is adopted to help determine the type of encounter situation and action manner automatically, which provides theoretical basis for the application of path-planning algorithm. In addition, the modified velocity obstacle approach and artificial potential fields are combined to improve the practicality and rationality of the optimization solution. Finally, simulation examples consisting different traffic scenarios are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed scheme.

AB Motion control of vehicles under uncertain, noisy, and discontinuous positioning is essential in autonomous navigation in unknown environments. This article suggests two methods for motion control, where the initial parameters of the on-line control are physically explainable, the resulting trajectory as well as the control parameters are asymptotically converging and glitches in the localization are handled robustly. The differences to a known method based on Lyapunov functions are discussed theoretically as well as in terms of actual motion measurements. Physical experiments with landbound vehicles show the reliability and limitations of these different methods in setups employing static attractors, systematically moving targets and fast, unpredictable moving targets in highly dynamical environments. Mainly due to the physical meaning of the control parameters the adaptation to actual kinematics and dynamics is significantly simplified.

AB This letter investigates an air-ground communication system where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communicates with multiple users with the assistance of multiple intelligent omni-surfaces (IOSs). Our goal is to maximize the minimum average expectation of the achievable rate through the joint optimization of the users' scheduling, IOSs' phase shifts, and UAV's trajectory. We first show the random channel power gains follow the more tractable noncentral Chi-square distribution. Then, the resulting optimization problem is a mixed-integer non-convex problem with tightly coupled optimization variables, which is difficult to solve optimally. We propose an efficient algorithm to obtain the suboptimal solution based on block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms other benchmark schemes.

By employing two UAVs, our proposed relaying scheme performs virtual full-duplex (FD) transmission to increase the end-to-end spectral efficiency (SE) performance. To further enhance the performance, we propose a center point adjustment algorithm and a transmit power adjustment algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our proposed adjustment algorithms by comparing the relaying schemes with and without the proposed adjustment algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed relaying scheme with our proposed adjustment algorithms can achieve higher SE performance compared to conventional schemes.

AB Camera stabilization systems are employed in several types of mobile robots. The objective is to maintain the attitude of the camera constant despite the movements of the host vehicle. This paper deals with the problem of stabilizing a platform using a three-degree-of-freedom gimbal as mechanical actuator. Mechanical unbalances are considered and a multivariable version of the unit vector control (UVC) is employed. The algorithm employs a newly proposed differentiator based on higher order sliding modes that is global and exact. This differentiator can also be used for monitoring and estimation purposes in mechatronic systems. Simulation results are presented using data acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in autonomous flight.

AB Operational safety and health monitoring are critical matters for autonomous field mobile robots such as planetary rovers operating on challenging terrain. This paper describes relevant rover safety and health issues and presents an approach to maintaining vehicle safety in a mobility and navigation context. The proposed rover safety module is composed of two distinct components: safe attitude (pitch and roll) management and safe traction management. Fuzzy logic approaches to reasoning about safe attitude and traction management are presented, wherein inertial sensing of safety status and vision-based neural network perception of terrain quality are used to infer safe speeds of traversal. Results of initial field tests and laboratory experiments are also described. The approach provides an intrinsic safety cognizance and a capacity for reactive mitigation of robot mobility and navigation risks.

AB With the continuous progress and application of robotics technology, the importance of mobile robots capable of adapting to specialized work environments is gaining prominence. Among them, achieving precise and stable control of AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) stands as a paramount task propelling the advancement of mobile robotics. Consequently, this study devises a control system that enables AGVs to attain stable and accurate motion through equipment connection and debugging, kinematic modeling of the four-wheel steering AGV, and a selection and comparative analysis of motion control algorithms. The effectiveness of the Stanley-PID control algorithm in guiding the motion of a four-wheel steering AGV is validated through MATLAB 2021a simulation software. The simulation results illustrate the outstanding stability and precise control capabilities of the Stanley-PID algorithm.

AB This letter proposes a novel local path planning algorithm called Safe Artificial Potential Field (SAPF). The algorithm uses the attractive potential for goal reaching as the original one. However, the repulsive potential is replaced by a general obstacle potential, equal to repulsive potential, vortex potential, or their superposition. Moreover, the analytical tuning procedure of SAPF is described in this letter. The proposed algorithm has been compared to the original Artificial Potential Field (APF), Vortex APF (VAPF), and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA). The comparison has been provided using both, simulational and experimental validation. The SAPF allows to avoid simple local minima, keep safety distance from obstacles and move through narrow corridors. The obtained results in the form of videos are attached as supplementary files.

AB In this paper, we investigate trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance for a nonholonomic system subject to external disturbances by a nonlinear switched model predictive control (MPC) strategy. In the nonlinear switched MPC strategy, a potential field is introduced in a cost function to guarantee a smooth path for the nonholonomic system. A switched mechanism is designed to ensure switching stability by setting multiple Lyapunov functions in different areas. Different from traditional switched mechanisms, an average dwell time closely related to stability conditions is proposed to balance safety and stability in the whole process. Recursive feasibility is presented for the nonlinear switched MPC strategy in trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. Simulation results are provided to show effectiveness and superiority of the nonlinear switched MPC strategy by a two-wheeled mobile vehicle.

AB Benefits of introducing active suspension in autonomous vehicles in terms of improving the driver's work/leisure ability can be tested under laboratory conditions using a high-performance shaker rig. In this paper, five different suspension configurations, including passive, semi-active, and fully active suspensions (FAS) and related optimal controls with or without road preview information, are implemented in vehicle dynamics simulator. They are experimentally examined having the driver in the loop to obtain objective and subjective measures of ride comfort and ability to do certain tasks. In total, 44 drivers of various age, gender, and driving experience performed three different tasks while being driven on shaker-rig (reading and writing, drawing, and subjective grading). The examination results show that FAS with road preview control offers highest ride comfort improvement, which can be perceived by the driver and greatly improves his/her ability to text and particularly draw.

AB Lidar sensors are frequently used in environment perception for autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics to complement camera, radar, and ultrasonic sensors. Adverse weather conditions are significantly impacting the performance of lidar-based scene understanding by causing undesired measurement points that in turn effect missing detections and false positives. In heavy rain or dense fog, water drops could be misinterpreted as objects in front of the vehicle which brings a mobile robot to a full stop. In this letter, we present the first CNN-based approach to understand and filter out such adverse weather effects in point cloud data. Using a large data set obtained in controlled weather environments, we demonstrate a significant performance improvement of our method over state-of-the-art involving geometric filtering.

AB A Reflectance Transformation Imaging technique (RTI) realized by multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on deployment in difficult to access buildings is presented in this letter. RTI is a computational photographic method that captures a surface shape and color of a subject and enables its interactive re-lighting from any direction in a software viewer, revealing details that are not visible with the naked eye. The input of RTI is a set of images captured by a static camera, each one under illumination from a different known direction. We present an innovative approach applying two multi-rotor UAVs to perform this scanning procedure in locations that are hardly accessible or even inaccessible for people. The proposed system is designed for its safe deployment within real-world scenarios in historical buildings with priceless historical value.

TI Multivehicle path planning for nonline-of-sight communication
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHEME
AB This paper presents a mathematical programming approach to online connectivity-constrained trajectory planning for autonomous helicopters through cluttered environments. A lead vehicle must execute a certain mission whereby wireless line-of-sight communication to its ground station is lost. Relay helicopters are therefore introduced that must position themselves in such a way that indirect line-of-sight connectivity between the leader and the ground station is always maintained. This requires coordinated multivehicle trajectory optimization which is tackled online using centralized and distributed receding horizon planning strategies. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that accounts for the vehicle dynamics, obstacle and collision avoidance, and connectivity constraints. A centralized two-helicopter mission is described for which simulation, hardware in the loop, and real-time flight-test results that show the online adaptability of the approach are presented. Simulations of distributed scenarios are given as well. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Probability modeling of autonomous Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles

LA English
DT Article
AB Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) are advanced weapon systems that can loiter autonomously in a pack over a target area, detect and acquire the targets, and then engage them. Modeling these capabilities in a specific hostile operational setting is necessary for addressing weapons' design and operational issues. In this paper we develop several analytic probability models, which range from a simple regenerative formula to a large-scale continuous-time Markov chain, with the objective to address the aforementioned issues. While these models capture key individual aspects of the weapon such as detection, recognition, memory and survivability, special attention is given to pack related aspects such as simultaneous targeting, multiple kills due to imperfect battle damage assessment, and the effect of attack coordination. From implementing the models we gain some insights on design and operational considerations regarding the employment of a pack of UCAVs in a strike scenario.

AB Bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (BSLAM) technique could provide long-term underwater navigation results for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and produce a self-consistent bathymetric map simultaneously. However, the inter-frame motion inside BSLAM is still difficult to estimate, and BSLAM might fail catastrophically with invalid loop closures caused by the measurement errors of vehicle states and bathymetric data. To deal with these problems, an AUV robust BSLAM algorithm is proposed based on graph SLAM. In this algorithm, weak data association is constructed via sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) regression to predict inter-frame motion, and a multi-window consistency method (MCM) is introduced to identify invalid loop closures. Various simulation experiments are conducted under different environments. Comparisons are made between more standard approaches, and our proposed algorithm is shown to be viable, accurate, and could robustly handle invalid loop closures.

AB A simple automatic path tracking system is developed to satisfy the typical requirements of an unmanned agricultural tractor application based on two look-ahead reference points (2-LARP) on the desired path. The main objective of the proposed control system is to track a desired path within reasonable tolerances of a typical farming process including considerable slippage. The employed look-ahead reference points provide compensation for the centrifugal forces and reduction of the peak lateral deviation due to curvature transition, using only simple arithmetic operations. Extensive numerical tests were carried out on the computer simulation of the system dynamics driven by the proposed control method. Simulation results indicate enhancements in vehicle manoeuvrability. Tests indicated that the peak lateral displacement error at the curvature transitions is reduced to one fifth of single LARP error. (C) 2012 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE; SAFETY BENEFITS; SYSTEMS; CRASHES
AB Achieving remote and rural road safety is a global challenge, exacerbated in Australia and New Zealand by expansive geographical variations and inconsistent population density. Consequently, there exists a rural-urban differential in road crash involvement in Australasia. New vehicle technologies are expected to minimise road trauma globally by performing optimally on high quality roads with predictable infrastructure. Anecdotally, however, Australasia's regional and remote areas do not fit this profile. The aim of this study was to determine if new vehicle technologies are likely to reduce road trauma, particularly in regional and remote Australia and New Zealand. An extensive review was performed using publicly available data. Road trauma in regional and remote Australasia was found to be double that of urban regions, despite the population being approximately one third of that in urban areas. Fatalities in 100 km/h + speed zones were overrepresented, suggestive of poor speed limit settings. Despite new vehicle ownership in regional and remote Australasia being comparable to major cities, road infrastructure supportive of new vehicle technologies appear lacking, with only 1.3-42% of all Australian roads, and 67% of all New Zealand roads being fully sealed. With road quality in regional and remote areas being poorly mapped, the benefits of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) technologies cannot be realised despite the fact new vehicles with these technologies are penetrating the fleet. Investments should be made into sealing and separating roads but more importantly, for mapping the road network to create a unified tracking system which quantifies readiness at a national level.

AB The seamless data delivery is essential in VANET for application such as autonomous vehicle, intelligent traffic management and for the road safety and emergency applications. The incorporation of named data networking (NDN) with VANET, intended to frame intelligent traffic flow and seamless data delivery. Such integration of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) with NDN is termed as vehicular named data networks (VNDN). Because of the continuous node/vehicle mobility, it is a tedious process to build constant and consistent communication between vehicles. With that concern, for enhancing the performance of VNDN and solving the issues such as frequent cluster formation on heavy loaded data transmissions, position-based adaptive clustering model (PACM) is developed. The major intention of PACM is to form clusters based on trajectory. Besides, PACM performs efficient data caching by collecting significant data from vehicles to establish consistent data communication with all nodes in the network. Efficient data caching is done with the elected cluster heads among the framed clusters based on its positions and mobility models. For handling the vehicles at higher mobility speed, mutual data caching process is also designed that makes vehicles to perform on-demand data gathering from cluster heads. Further, the model is simulated and the obtained results are compared with the existing models based on the metrics such as packet delivery ratio, mean delay, cache hit rate and mean hop distance. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed model outperforms the available techniques.

AB We integrate data-driven ocean modeling with the stochastic Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) level-set optimization methodology to compute and study energy-optimal paths, speeds, and headings for ocean vehicles in the Middle-Atlantic Bight (MAB) region. We hindcast the energy-optimal paths from among exact time-optimal paths for the period 28 August 2006 to 9 September 2006. To do so, we first obtain a data-assimilative multiscale reanalysis, combining ocean observations with implicit two-way nested multiresolution primitive-equation simulations of the tidal-to-mesoscale dynamics in the region. Second, we solve the reduced-order stochastic DO level-set partial differential equations (PDEs) to compute the joint probability of minimum arrival time, vehicle-speed time series, and total energy utilized. Third, for each arrival time, we select the vehicle-speed time series that minimize the total energy utilization from the marginal probability of vehicle-speed and total energy. The corresponding energy-optimal path and headings are obtained through the exact particle-backtracking equation. Theoretically, the present methodology is PDE-based and provides fundamental energy-optimal predictions without heuristics. Computationally, it is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than direct Monte Carlo methods. For the missions considered, we analyze the effects of the regional tidal currents, strong wind events, coastal jets, shelfbreak front, and other local circulations on the energy-optimal paths. Results showcase the opportunities for vehicles that intelligently utilize the ocean environment to minimize energy usage, rigorously integrating ocean forecasting with optimal control of autonomous vehicles.

AB Purpose
   This paper aims to propose a composite form of the robust disturbance fuzzy control scheme. The proposed method uses the bene?ts of fuzzy system modeling and Lyapunov direct methods.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The effciency of the control technique was demonstrated with assistance of numerical simulation in control problems of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) simulation.
   Findings
   To evaluate the control performance, the comparison of the proposed controller was made with conventional control techniques. The Lyapunov stability theorem has been used to testify for asymptotic stability and convergence of the closed loop system.
   Practical implications
   Implementation of the control law in the real world environment can be easier due to signi?cant reduction in the fuzzy rules, tuning parameters and computation stages.
   Originality/value
   Simulation results con?rm that the proposed control scheme performs remarkably well in terms of the robustness and disturbance attenuation.

AB The emerging services and analytics advocate the service delivery in a polymorphic view that successfully serves a variety of audience. The amalgamation of numerous modern technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data is the potential support behind the emerging services Systems. Today, IoT, also dubbed as ubiquitous sensing is taking the center stage over the traditional paradigm. The evolution of IoT necessitates the expansion of cloud horizon to deal with emerging challenges. In this paper, we study the cloud-based emerging services, useful in IoT paradigm, that support the effective data analytics. Also, we conceive a new classification called CNNC {Clouda, NNClouda} for cloud data models; further, some important case studies are also discussed to further strengthen the classification. An emerging service, data analytics in autonomous vehicles, is then described in details. Challenges and recommendations related to privacy, security and ethical concerns have been discussed.

AB This paper presents a high-gain boost converter (three-level converter and transformerless converter) for fuel cell (FC) vehicle applications. An original nonlinear control law based on the flatness principle for distributed dc generation is studied. Utilizing the flatness property, we propose simple solutions to the system performance and stabilization problems. The design controller parameters are straightforward and autonomous at the operating point. To validate the proposed method, a prototype FC power converter (1.2-kW three-level boost converter) is developed in the laboratory. The proposed control law is implemented with a digital estimate in a dSPACE 1104 controller card. The experimental results from the laboratory using a 1200-W and 46-A polymer electrolyte membrane FC (PEMFC) verify that this is a good control scheme.

AB At the current time, the U. S. Army Research Laboratory's (ARL's) Vehicle Technology Directorate is interested in expanding its Unmanned Vehicles Division to include rotary wing and micro-systems control. The intent is to research unmanned aircraft systems not only for reconnaissance missions but also for targeting and lethal attacks. This project documents ongoing work expanding ARL's program in research and simulation of autonomous control systems. A proportional integral derivative control algorithm was modeled in Simulink (Simulink is a trademark of The MathWorks) and communicates to a flight simulator modeling a physical radio-controlled helicopter. Waypoint navigation and flight envelope testing were then systematically evaluated to the final goal of a feasible autopilot design. Conclusions are made on how to perhaps make this environment more dynamic in the future.

AB In this letter, a sub-connected hybrid precoding system was designed to realize energy-efficient millimeter-Wave (mmWave) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Considering the limited capacity of the UAV battery, the system was jointly optimized with a UAV trajectory to increase the energy efficiency of the UAV under quality-of-service (QoS) and power budget constraints. The dynamic motion of the UAV changes the channel condition between the UAV and terrestrial users over time. Hence, a joint optimization problem was formulated as a non-convex and time-sequential domain, solved using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The performances of the proposed scheme and a fully-connected hybrid precoding scheme were compared in terms of energy efficiency and show higher results.

AB The control strategy for Internet of Connected Vehicles (IOCV) with unidentified actuator faults and saturation is examined in this study. The IOCV system is represented by a third-order nonlinear model that takes into account the unknown nonlinear dynamics with time-varying faults and saturation. A fuzzy adaptive sliding mode (FASM) controller with a nonlinear disturbance observer has been developed based on the new model, and it can concurrently achieve the control goals of string stability and individual vehicle stability with zero initial spacing error. In addition, a novel modified constant time headway (MCTH) is proposed to address string instability caused by nonzero starting conditions. In order to confirm the superiority, numerical simulation and experiment are tested on Matlab and the IOCV made of four Ackermann cars.

AB A PI-D based control system is developed for over-actuated, hover-capable AUVs which enables a smooth transition from hover-style to flight-style operation with system stability and convergence proven using a Lyapunov approach. The performance of the controller is demonstrated by simulation and is verified through experiments. The approach is able to operate over a range of vehicle ballasting configurations, and to imposed external disturbances. The proposed system is computationally inexpensive and does not require a detailed hydrodynamic model to implement. By monitoring the energy consumption on board, the cost of maintaining depth at a range of forward speeds with different buoyancy conditions can be quantified, and their impact on the cost of transport is highlighted for future optimisation of energy consumption.

AB A three-dimensional (3-D) neural network model based on bio-inspired neurodynamics is proposed for the path planning of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in underwater environments. The model is topologically organized according to the 3-D underwater workspace of the AUV. Each neuron in the neural network uniquely represents a discretized subspace in the workspace. The excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the neural network come from the mission of the AUV and obstacles in the workspace respectively. The AUV is globally attracted through excitatory neural activity and the propagation among the network for its mission. Meanwhile, it is locally pushed away by the inhibitory neural activities to avoid collisions. Simulation results show that the proposed 3-D bio-inspired neural network model is suitable for an AUV to plan various paths in a 3-D underwater workspace.

AB Distributed-observer-based distributed control law for interconnected systems has become the research focus in recent years, owing to its broad prospects. This paper extends the objectives of this study from linear systems to a class of affine nonlinear systems. Before this, distributed observer for nonlinear systems with controlled inputs has not been studied, as well as the distributed-observer-based distributed control law. To fill this gap, we overcome the difficulty of proving the joint observability of distributed observer for nonlinear systems by an original analysis method based on maximum invariant distribution. Furthermore, to deal with the dissatisfaction of the separation principle, a high-gain parameter is introduced in the distributed observer. In addition, the influence of model mismatch on the distributed observer and distributed controller is also investigated and analyzed in detail. By analyzing the complex coupling relationship between observer dynamics, control input, high-gain parameter, and model mismatch, we successfully prove the asymptotic omniscience of distributed observer and the stability of closed-loop systems. The results show that both the error dynamics of the distributed observer and the system states of the closed-loop system formed by the observer-based distributed control law can converge to an arbitrarily small invariant set around the origin. In addition to the original work in distributed-observer-based distributed control law, this paper also has innovation in the design of distributed observer. Firstly, the proposed design method is also applicable to the distributed observer of autonomous systems. Compared to existing results on autonomous systems, our method admits weaker assumptions. Specifically, one could find an approximate system to meet the assumptions required by designing distributed observer when the underlying system fails to meet the requirements. At last, the interconnected cruise control of intelligent vehicles is employed to be verified the developed results.

AB Taking fast action, and effectively utilizing the available resources, are important when conducting time-critical surveillance missions. In addition, the potential complexity of the search, such as the ruggedness of the terrain or large size of the search region, should be considered. Such issues can be tackled by using a heterogeneous fleet of manned and unmanned vehicles equipped with different sensors by considering speed, coverage and flexibility. This article centres on designing a fast solution approach for planning coverage missions through zoning and routing. The challenge is to cover an area where targets can be potentially found with a variable likelihood. The search area is modelled using a scoring map to support the choice of search in sub-areas, where the scores represent the importance of tasks. Heuristic approaches are proposed to automate search processes and plan missions, given a small time budget.

AB The paper demonstrates the validity of sensors and the model in the algorithm for a lane change controller. The paper presents the systematic derivation of the chosen model from the ground up and the important role played by the sensors used in this system. The whole concept of the system on which the tests were carried out is presented step by step. Simulations were realised in the Matlab and Simulink environments. Preliminary tests were performed to confirm the need for the controller in a closed-loop system. On the other hand, sensitivity (the influence of noise and offset) studies showed the advantages and disadvantages of the developed algorithm. This allowed us to create a research path for future work with the aim of improving the operation of the proposed system.

AB This article addresses the design of a path following controller for a payload tethered to a quadrotor. Specifically, the goal is to design a smooth dynamic feedback controller that forces the suspended payload to converge and follow a large class of embedded curves. The given curve is treated as a smooth manifold, and set stabilization is used to find the maximal control invariant manifold. The controller design guarantees that once the aerial robot approaches the path, the payload never leaves the path. The performance of the proposed controller is verified through simulations with practical sensor noise and parametric uncertainties. Moreover, experimental implementation and verification of the proposed control scheme are performed on a Quanser UAV platform in an indoor flying arena.

AB Envisioned use cases of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) impose new service requirements in terms of data rate, latency, and sensing accuracy, to name a few. Meeting such requirements enable highly reliable and harmonized integration of UAVs in the 6G ecosystem. Toward this, terahertz (THz) bands are perceived as a prospective technological enabler for various improved functionalities, such as ultra-high throughput communication, accurate localization, and enhanced sensing capabilities. In this article, we provide the potential opportunities and use cases of THz-empowered UAVs, corresponding novel design challenges, and resulting trade-offs. Furthermore, we overview recent advances in UAV deployment regulations, THz standardization, and health aspects related to THz bands. Finally, we take UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication as a case study to provide numerical insights into the impact of various system design parameters and environment factors.

AB An increment in the number of User Equipment (UE) demands network replanning or introducing incipient devices which can provide dynamic support to the subsisting networks. One of these devices can be the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, being prodigiously dynamic and autonomous in some scenarios, these vehicles require an efficient mechanism for their deployment in currently operating wireless networks. In this paper, an efficient approach is proposed which utilizes the properties of the self-healing neural model and the concept of matrix-coloring in order to maximize the UAVs positioning likelihood for optimized throughput coverage and maximum UE to UAV mapping. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated in terms of amelioration in the throughput coverage and mapping of the UAV to subdivisions at low consumption of energy and memory by using numerical simulations.

AB Poor road conditions like cracks and potholes can cause inconvenience to passengers, damage to vehicles, and accidents. Detecting those obstacles has become relevant due to the rise of the autonomous vehicle. Although previous studies used various sensors and applied different image processing techniques, performance is still significantly lacking, especially when compared to the tremendous leaps in performance with computer vision and deep learning. This research addresses this issue with the help of deep learning-based techniques. We applied the You Only Look Once version 2 (YOLOv2) detector and propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on YOLOv2 with a different architecture and two models. Despite a limited amount of learning data and the challenging nature of pothole images, our proposed architecture is able to obtain a significant increase in performance over YOLOv2 (from 60.14% to 82.43% average precision).

AB This paper analyses the environmental impacts of electric automated minibuses operated in public transportation systems. The results are based on an environmental life cycle assessment study, which uses data from a minibus producer and field data from several European cities. It is shown that electric automated minibuses promise a reduction in environmental impacts within specific conditions and in several future settings. Their environmental performance largely depends on their average utilisation, lifetime and total mileage, the electricity mix used, and the substituted means of transport. Automated components affect environmental performance but are not its most important driver. The minibus's contribution to climate change in near-future use cases is expected at 78 g carbon dioxide equivalents per passenger kilometre on average and only 39 g at peak operation.

ID INERTIAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM; CONTROL THEORETIC APPROACH
AB Underwater navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is a challenging task that requires the fusion of multiple sensors used as aiding to the vehicle inertial navigation system. In this paper, we focus on the problem of fusing heading measurements under different maneuvering conditions. We analyze the observability of the heading measurement fusion problem and derive the observable and unobservable subspaces as a function of the AUV's maneuver. Using this analysis, we are able to predict the convergence of the error states for different maneuvers and thus identify the quality of the navigation solution at different mobility patterns. As expected, the results show that the down misalignment error and gyro z-axis bias are always observable. In addition, our results showed that for some maneuvers, the rest of the gyro biases also become observable. Our numerical simulation and sea experiments verify our analytic solutions.

This paper provides an in-detail description of a state-of-the-art air-bearing testbed used to develop guidance, navigation, and control methods for close-proximity operations. Test vehicles, representing spacecraft, float via air bearings over a horizontally leveled granite monolith and move with two translational degrees of freedom and one rotational degree of freedom under the effect of thrusters and reaction wheel actuators. This setup achieves a quasi-frictionless and low residual acceleration dynamic environment. The testbed experimental setup as well as the vehicle hardware and software architectures are discussed in detail. Characterization of different testbed elements is provided. Finally, a test campaign is used to showcase its capabilities and to illustrate the testbed operations.

AB This paper proposes the design, analysis, and validation of a globally exponentially stable (GES) filter for tridimensional (3-D) range-only simultaneous localization and mapping. For observability analysis purposes, a nonlinear sensor-based dynamical system is formulated resorting only to exact linear and angular kinematics and a state augmentation is exploited that allows the proposed formulation to be considered as linear time-varying without linearizing the original nonlinear system. Constructive observability results can then be established, leading naturally to the design of a Kalman Filter with GES error dynamics. These results also provide valuable insight on the motion planning of the vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the algorithm and help validate the theoretical results presented. For completeness and to illustrate the necessity of a proper trajectory, simulation data are included as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) applications of long duration, there is a need to accurately determine the AUV's position in an effective way, in terms of both cost and energy consumption. Such situations may occur in reconnaissance operations, mine counter measure operations, and when an AUV is sampling the characteristics of the environment along a track. Since underwater maps are rare, there also is a need for navigational methods that can accommodate very infrequent sampling in terms of time and space. This paper describes a new method to solve the above problem by using a multibeam sonar for three-dimensional sampling of the bottom topography and a linear Kalman filter in a nearly optimal way. The proposed method is very accurate, robust, and computationally efficient compared to other methods that are used for terrain navigation. This method is also suitable for continuous navigation.

AB We propose a hybrid decision framework (HDF) based on Mamdani fuzzy inference system (MFIS) and reinforcement learning (RL). We aim to enhance energy efficiency for non-orthogonal multiple access-unmanned aerial (NOMA-UAV) network. Downlink (DL) power, bandwidth allocation and UAV flying profile is managed, in face of time varying quality of service (QoS) requirements. Energy efficiency, sum-rate, spectral efficiency and successful DL attempts are ascertained. Comparative analysis is carried out between proposed HDF, conventional RL on single DQN (SDQN), and fixed power and bandwidth (FPB) allocation regime. Simulations reveal that HDF surpasses SDQN by margin of 23% and FPB by a margin of 96% in energy efficiency (EE). HDF also surpasses counterparts in DL attempts.

AB The effective integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in future wireless communication systems depends on the conscious use of their limited energy, which constrains their flight time. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be used in combination with UAVs with the aim to improve the communication performance without increasing complexity at the UAVs' side. In this letter, we propose a synergetic UAV-RIS communication system, utilizing a UAV with a highly directional antenna aiming to the RIS. The proposed scenario can be applied in all air-to-ground RIS-assisted networks and numerical results illustrate that it is superior from the cases where the UAV utilizes either an omnidirectional antenna or a highly directional antenna aiming towards the ground node.

AB This paper focuses mainly on the analysis of observable modes and absolute navigation capability of the landmark-based IMU/Vision Navigation System (IMU/VNS) for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Firstly, the mathematical model of the IMU/VNS is established. Secondly, the observability matrix of the landmark-based IMU/VNS is obtained based on Lie derivative. And the observable modes with different number of landmarks are derived by solving the null space of the observability matrix. Finally, by deriving the navigation parameters of UAV from the observable modes, analysis is made on the absolute navigation capability of the landmark-based IMU/VNS when the absolute positions of the landmarks are available. And simulation results verify the correctness of all the above analysis methods.

AB This paper analyzes the trajectory tracking problem in decoupled planes for X-rudder AUVs under time-varying, unknown environmental interferences. The proposed scheme consists of the kinematic control law based on the compound line-of-sight guidance law and the dynamic control law based on a non-singular adaptive integral terminal sliding mode control (NAITSMC) to avoid the chattering problems, parameter perturbation, and time-varying disturbances. Meanwhile, we introduce a reduced-order extended state observer (RESO) to compensate for unknown ocean currents by the first-order Gauss-Markov process. We verify the whole system of the proposed scheme through global asymptotic stability, then present a set of numerical simulations revealing robustness and adaptability performances in decoupled planes.

   trailer auto-parking; trailer control
AB Driving a trailer is not difficult when driving forward; however, it is challenging when driving in reverse because the trailer turns opposite to the steering direction of the vehicle and the parking characteristics vary depending on the trailer length. The shorter the trailer is, the higher is the steering response sensitivity; this results in reverse parking complexities. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved method to reverse-drive a trailer into a parking space autonomously. Specifically, an optimal steering angle is obtained for auto-parking trailers of all sizes. The trailer is autonomously parked using a simple pure pursuit tracking algorithm without establishing an infrastructure. Therefore, the proposed method enables the trailer to detect the parking location and auto-park without any input from the driver.

AB In this paper we present a multiphysics simulation model of Halcyon, an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The simulation model presented in this paper has been developed to rapidly progress the design, development and validation of Halcyon's autonomy management system, particularly in challenging sea conditions. Using simulation for this purpose enables extensive testing across the full environmental operating envelope of the vessel, hence greatly reducing the need for real-world sea-trials. The simulator is comprised of a novel and comprehensive sea-surface wave environment model, a six degree of freedom nonlinear unified seakeeping and manoeuvring boat dynamics model, an actuation dynamics model, an autopilot and an interface with an autonomy management system. Results are presented that show good agreement between real-world and simulated sea-trials data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Vehicular ad-Hoc Network (VANET) is envisioned to ensure wireless transmission with ultra-high reliability. In the presence of fading and mobility of vehicles, error-free information between Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) requires extensive investigation. The current literature lacks in designing an ultra-reliable comprehensive tractable model for VANET using millimeter wave. Ultra-reliable communication is needed to support autonomous vehicular communication. This article aims to provide a comprehensive tractable model for VANET over millimeter waves using Space-Time-Block-Coding (STBC) concatenated with Reed Solomon (RS) coding. The designed model provides the fastest way of designing and analyzing VANET networks on 60 GHz. By using the derived BER expressions and Reed Solomon coded doppler expression ultra-reliable vehicular networks can be build meeting the demands of massive growing volume of traffic. The performance of the model is compared with previous BER computational techniques and existing VANET communication systems, i.e., IEEE 802.11bd and 3rd generation partnership project vehicle to everything (3GPP V2X). The findings show that our proposed approach outperforms IEEE 802.11bd and the results are comparable with V2X NR. Packet Error Rate (PER), Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) and throughput are used as performance metrics. We have also evaluated the model on higher velocities of vehicles. Further, the simulation and numerical findings show that the proposed system surpass the existing BER results comprising of various modulation and coding techniques. The simulation results are verified by the numerical results there-by, showing the accuracy of our derived expressions.

AB Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADASs) are currently gaining particular attention in the automotive field, as enablers for vehicle energy consumption, safety, and comfort enhancement. Compelling evidence is in fact provided by the variety of related studies that are to be found in the literature. Moreover, considering the actual technology readiness, larger opportunities might stem from the combination of ADASs and vehicle connectivity. Nevertheless, the definition of a suitable control system is not often trivial, especially when dealing with multiple-objective problems and dynamics complexity. In this scenario, even though diverse strategies are possible (e.g., Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy, Rule-based strategy, etc.), the Model Predictive Control (MPC) turned out to be among the most effective ones in fulfilling the aforementioned tasks. Hence, the proposed study is meant to produce a comprehensive review of MPCs applied to scenarios where ADASs are exploited and aims at providing the guidelines to select the appropriate strategy. More precisely, particular attention is paid to the prediction phase, the objective function formulation and the constraints. Subsequently, the interest is shifted to the combination of ADASs and vehicle connectivity to assess for how such information is handled by the MPC. The main results from the literature are presented and discussed, along with the integration of MPC in the optimal management of higher level connection and automation.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) are one critical application area of artificial intelligence (AI). However, a lack of appropriate trust can be a major barrier to successfully introducing AVs into the market. The objective of this study is to summarize and synthesize the existing literature to gain a greater understanding of factors that will potentially influence the development of pedestrians' trust in AVs over time. Since AVs will become part of a larger infrastructure system that influences more than just AV users, they should also be accepted by pedestrians and other road users. There is a need for pedestrians to form appropriate levels of trust toward AVs to achieve safe interaction with such vehicles in circumstances characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability. Consequently, factors relevant to the building of this appropriate trust must be understood. By integrating the reviewed empirical studies and related theories, a theoretical model has been proposed and developed, comprising three layers of variability in pedestrian-AV trust (dispositional trust, situational trust, and learned trust). Given that this is an emerging field of research, much still remains unknown, and this review identifies several gaps in current knowledge for each layer of trust, as well as providing suggestions for consideration in future studies. Additionally, the proposed model of pedestrian-AV trust can be useful to transportation researchers, practitioners, designers, and AV manufacturers for designing AVs and related transportation systems for the purposes of successfully integrating AVs into society, and calibrating pedestrians' trust to the appropriate level.

AB Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) exclusive lanes are an important application of intelligent transportation technologies on highways. However, current research on CAV exclusive lanes mainly focuses on basic road segments rather than on on-ramp junctions. This paper analyzed the impact of CAV exclusive lanes on the traffic capacity of on-ramp junctions through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. This paper established a capacity model for heterogeneous traffic consisting of CAVs and manual vehicles (MVs) considering the CAV degradation mechanism. Three key parameters, namely the CAV penetration rate, the proportion of CAVs on regular lanes, and a CAV platoon coefficient, were introduced into the heterogeneous traffic capacity model. Based on this input, the relationship between traffic capacity and the three parameters was analyzed on regular lanes. The critical CAV penetration rate at which a CAV exclusive lane reaches saturation was expressed mathematically. An on-ramp junction scenario with a CAV exclusive lane was simulated numerically with microscopic heterogeneous traffic flow models. Experimental results showed that congestion at the junction area no longer spread upstream after the CAV penetration rate exceeded 70% without CAV exclusive lanes. However, for the case in which a CAV exclusive lane was used, CAVs on the exclusive lane traveled quickly through the junction and effectively relieved traffic congestion when the CAV penetration rate reached 40%. The results also showed that a long acceleration lane slightly reduced the CAV platoon coefficient. In addition, a CAV exclusive lane improved traffic capacity when the CAV penetration rate was higher than 30%, regardless of the length of the acceleration lane.

AB Partially automated vehicles present interface design challenges in ensuring the driver remains alert should the vehicle need to hand back control at short notice, but without exposing the driver to cognitive overload. To date, little is known about driver expectations of partial driving automation and whether this affects the information they require inside the vehicle. Twenty-five participants were presented with five partially automated driving events in a driving simulator. After each event, a semi-structured interview was conducted. The interview data was coded and analysed using grounded theory. From the results, two groupings of driver expectations were identified: High Information Preference (HIP) and Low Information Preference (LIP) drivers; between these two groups the information preferences differed. LIP drivers did not want detailed information about the vehicle presented to them, but the definition of partial automation means that this kind of information is required for safe use. Hence, the results suggest careful thought as to how information is presented to them is required in order for LIP drivers to safely using partial driving automation. Conversely, HIP drivers wanted detailed information about the system's status and driving and were found to be more willing to work with the partial automation and its current limitations. It was evident that the drivers' expectations of the partial automation capability differed, and this affected their information preferences. Hence this study suggests that HMI designers must account for these differing expectations and preferences to create a safe, usable system that works for everyone.

DE Travel behavior; Self-driving vehicles; Naturalistic experiment;
   Chauffeur; VMT
AB Automated driving technologies are currently penetrating the market, and the coming fully autonomous cars will have far-reaching, yet largely unknown, implications. A critical unknown is the impact on traveler behavior, which in turn impacts sustainability, the economy, and wellbeing. Most behavioral studies, to date, either focus on safety and human factors (driving simulators; test beds), assume travel behavior implications (microsimulators; network analysis), or ask about hypothetical scenarios that are unfamiliar to the subjects (stated preference studies). Here we present a different approach, which is to use a naturalistic experiment to project people into a world of self-driving cars. We mimic potential life with a privately-owned self-driving vehicle by providing 60 h of free chauffeur service for each participating household for use within a 7-day period. We seek to understand the changes in travel behavior as the subjects adjust their travel and activities during the chauffeur week when, as in a self-driving vehicle, they are explicitly relieved of the driving task. In this first pilot application, our sample consisted of 13 subjects from the San Francisco Bay area, drawn from three cohorts: millennials, families, and retirees. We tracked each subject's travel for 3 weeks (the chauffeur week, 1 week before and 1 week after) and conducted surveys and interviews. During the chauffeur week, we observed sizable increases in vehicle-miles traveled and number of trips, with a more pronounced increase in trips made in the evening and for longer distances and a substantial proportion of "zero-occupancy" vehicle-miles traveled.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous estimation of a vehicle's ego motion and motions of multiple moving objects in the scene-called eoru motions-through a monocular vehicle-mounted camera. Localization of multiple moving objects and estimation of their motions is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Conventional localization and mapping techniques (e.g., visual odometry and simultaneous localization and mapping) can only estimate the ego motion of the vehicle. The capability of a robot localization pipeline to deal with multiple motions has not been widely investigated in the literature. We present a theoretical framework for robust estimation of multiple relative motions in addition to the camera ego motion. First, the framework for general unconstrained motion is introduced and then it is adapted to exploit the vehicle kinematic constraints to increase efficiency. The method is based on projective factorization of the multiple-trajectory matrix. First, the ego motion is segmented and then several hypotheses are generated for the eoru motions. All the hypotheses are evaluated and the one with the smallest reprojection error is selected. The proposed framework does not need any a priori knowledge of the number of motions and is robust to noisy image measurements. The method with a constrained motion model is evaluated on a popular street-level image dataset collected in urban environments (the KITTI dataset), including several relative ego-motion and eorumotion scenarios. A benchmark dataset (Hopkins 155) is used to evaluate this method with a general motion model. The results are compared with those of the state-of-the-art methods considering a similar problem, referred to as multibody structure from motion in the computer vision community.

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS

AB Autonomous and mobile cyber-physical machines are becoming an inevitable part of our future. In particular, Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have seen a resurgence in activity. With multiple use cases, such as surveillance, search and rescue, package delivery, and more, these unmanned aerial systems are on the cusp of demonstrating their full potential. Despite such promises, these systems face many challenges, one of the most prominent of which is their low endurance caused by their limited onboard energy. Since the success of a mission depends on whether the drone can finish it within such duration and before it runs out of battery, improving both the time and energy associated with the mission are of high importance. Such improvements have traditionally been arrived at through the use of better algorithms. But our premise is that more powerful and efficient onboard compute can also address the problem. In this article, we investigate how the compute subsystem, in a cyber-physical mobile machine such as a Micro Aerial Vehicle, can impact mission time (time to complete a mission) and energy. Specifically, we pose the question as what is the role of computing for cyber-physical mobile robots? We show that compute and motion are tightly intertwined, and as such a close examination of cyber and physical processes and their impact on one another is necessary. We show different "impact paths" through which compute impacts mission metrics and examine them using a combination of analytical models, simulation, and micro and end-to-end benchmarking. To enable similar studies, we open sourced MAVBench, our tool-set, which consists of (1) a closed-loop real-time feedback simulator and (2) an end-to-end benchmark suite composed of state-of-the-art kernels. By combining MAVBench, analytical modeling, and an understanding of various compute impacts, we show up to 2X and 1.8X improvements for mission time and mission energy for two optimization case studies, respectively. Our investigations, as well as our optimizations, show that cyber-physical co-design, a methodology with which both the cyber and physical processes/quantities of the robot are developed with consideration of one another, similar to hardware-software co-design, is necessary for arriving at the design of the optimal robot.

AB Moving on paths or trails present in natural environments makes autonomous navigation of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) simpler and safer. In this sense, aerial photographs provide a lot of information of wide areas that can be employed to detect paths for UGV usage. This paper proposes the extraction of paths from a geo-referenced satellite image centered at the current UGV position. Its pixels are individually classified as being part of a path or not using a convolutional neural network (CNN) which has been trained using synthetic data. Then, successive distant waypoints inside the detected paths are generated to achieve a given goal. This processing has been successfully tested on the Andabata mobile robot, which follows the list of waypoints in a reactive way based on a three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor.

AB This paper presents a bimodal control strategy for transitioning between different topologies of flocking and dynamic structures. The work is motivated by applications where agents must pursue and close in on a target prior to carrying out more sophisticated tasks. Specifically, it builds on previous work in consensus-based flocking to define a new type of dynamic target pursuit and capturing method called dynamic enspherement. The problem is formulated in terms of the canonical Reynolds rules and overlapping planes of encirclement using quaternions of arbitrary orientation. A new method for transitioning between flocking and enspherement is presented, the smoothness of which is demonstrated mathematically. The proposed approach is validated in a series of simulations on swarms of particles with double-integrator dynamics.

AB In last decades, great technology advances have been done related to the automotive sector, especially in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) developed to improve mobility in terms of comfort and safety during driving process; hence, automated driving is presented as an evolution of those systems in the present and upcoming years. The aim of this work is to present a complete framework of motion planning for automated vehicles, considering different constraints with parametric curves for lateral and longitudinal planners. Parametric Bezier curves are used as the core approach for trajectory design in intersections, roundabouts, and lane change maneuvers. Additionally, a speed planner algorithm is presented using the same parametric curve approach, considering comfort and safety. A simulation environment is used for testing the planning method in urban conditions. Finally, tests with the real platform in automated mode have been performed showing goods results.

Moreover, it will be proved that all modules related to the navigation can coexist and work together to achieve the goal point without any collision. The study is done by analyzing the trajectory generated from global and local planners. The software prototyping tool is Robot Operating System (ROS) from Open Source Robotics Foundation and the research platform is the iCab (Intelligent Campus Automobile) from University Carlos III. This work has been validated from a test inside the campus where the iCab has performed the navigation between the starting point and the goal point without any collision. During the experiment, we proved the low sensitivity of the TEB method to variations of the vehicle model configuration and constraints.

AB In this paper we consider the problem of maneuvering an autonomous robot in complex unknown environments using vision. The goal is to accurately servo a wheeled vehicle to a desired posture using only feedback from an on-board camera, taking into account the non-holonomic nature of the vehicle kinematics and the limited field-of-view of the camera. With respect to existing visual servoing schemes, which achieve similar goals locally (i.e. when the desired and actual camera views are sufficiently similar), we propose a method to visually navigate the robot through an extended visual map before eventually reaching the desired goal. The map comprises a set of images, previously stored in an exploratory phase, that convey both topological and metric information regarding the connectivity through feasible robot paths and the geometry of the environment, respectively. Experimental results on a laboratory setup are reported showing the practicality of the proposed approach.

AB Electric vehicle carsharing (EV-carsharing) systems not only change how people travel, but also provide economic and environmental benefits. However, EV-carsharing systems also create a series of new service operation issues resulting from the characteristics of EVs. From the EVcarsharing system supply side, these issues include an insufficient number of charging stations, high vehicle relocation costs and untimely charge scheduling. From the EV-carsharing system demand side, they include an insufficient understanding of the factors affecting EV-carsharing demand and inaccurate demand forecasts. These issues have hindered the rapid spread of EVcarsharing systems and must be resolved if the development of this industry is to accelerate. We review the most recent EV-carsharing system literature based on different methodologies from the perspectives of supply and demand. According to the research themes, first, we describe the literature on the supply side of EV-carsharing systems as strategic planning (charging station location, number, capacity and fleet size), daily operations (vehicle relocation and vehicle charging) and integrated modelling for strategic planning and daily operations. Optimization models and algorithms are surveyed in each theme. Then, we describe the literature on the demand side of EV-carsharing systems according to the factors affecting EV-carsharing demand and demand forecasting methods. Finally, we propose future research directions for EV-carsharing systems from the perspectives of supply and demand and highlight future research opportunities for EV-carsharing systems given the influence of autonomous driving technologies.

AB Autonomous driving and intelligent transportation demand ultra-low latency and high reliability communication in future vehicular networks. Proactive wireless communication can facilitate minimal latency by open-loop communication, which discards traditional feedback control mechanisms. However, appropriate radio resource allocation in such proactive mobile networks has not been fully studied due to lacking channel state information (CSI) and the alleviation of multiple access interference (MAI) in multiple virtual cells. This paper aims to ensure the reliability of downlink communication by a novel radio resource allocation scheme in proactive vehicular networks with ultra-low latency. We regard data transmission success rate as the reliability indicator and propose a joint radio resource allocation model based on the "generalized closed-loop", where anchor node (AN) uses the radio resource utilization information (RRUI) from the vehicle in the immediate past uplink as a guide to assist resource allocation. Subsequently, we study the radio resource allocation model solution on the vehicle side and the network side respectively. On the vehicle side, vehicles use the local or global data transmission experience to select the radio resource with the best quality as the RRUI. On the network side, according to the latest RRUI of vehicle and resource occupancy information, deep reinforcement learning is proposed to make appropriate radio resource allocation decisions. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the intelligent joint radio resource allocation scheme under the cooperation between vehicles and AN. When the resource load rate reaches 40%, the joint radio resource allocation scheme can achieve a data transmission success rate of more than 98%.

AB The longitudinal and lateral coordinated control for autonomous vehicles is fundamental to achieve safe and comfortable driving performance. Aiming at this for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) during the car-following (CF) and lane-change (LC) process while accelerating, a hierarchical control strategy for vehicle stability control is proposed. This new approach is different from the conventional hierarchical control. On the basis of model predictive control (MPC) theory, a two-layer MPC controller is designed at the top level of the control structure. The upper layer is a linear time-varying MPC (LTV-MPC), while the lower layer is a hybrid MPC (HMPC). For the LTV-MPC controller, a control-oriented linear discrete model for HEV is established, which integrates the dynamic model with three degrees of freedom (DOF) and the car-following model. The lower-layer HMPC controller is designed on the basis of the analysis for HEV hybrid characteristics and the modelling for the mixed logic dynamic (MLD) model of the HEV powertrain. As for the bottom level, a control plant including the HEV powertrain model and the 7 DOF nonlinear dynamics of the vehicle body is established. In addition, the system stability is proven. A deep fusion of vehicle dynamics control and energy management is achieved. Compared with LC-ACC control and conventional ACC control, the simulation and the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test results under different driving scenarios show that the proposed hierarchical control strategy can effectively maintain lateral stability and safety under severe driving conditions. Additionally, the HEV powertrain output torque and the gear-shift point are coordinated and controlled by the HMPC controller.

AB Mixed traffic-roadway shared by automated (AV) and conventional vehicles-is anticipated to take place in the next few decades as the production and acceptance of automated vehicles increases. However, interactions between AVs and drivers in conventional vehicles are projected to be problematic. The current study aimed to examine the relationship among intentionality attributions, emotional reactions, and intended driver behaviors in response to hypothetical traffic scenarios when the actions were performed by human-drivers vs. self-driving cars. Three studies were conducted: Pilot Study 1: modifications of the Propensity for Angry Driving Scale (PADS), Pilot Study 2: verification of the instructions of the modified PADS using a college student sample, and Main Study: collection of ratings of intentionality, emotions, intended responses, trait aggression, and demographics upon reading human-driver and self-driving car PADS using a heterogeneous online sample. Intended responses were more severe in the self-driving car conditions, even though the self-driving car's actions were attributed as less intentional. Self-driving cars portrayed as having a heart and a mind led to similar behavioral responses but different affective ratings. Individuals who attributed the actions intentionally and rated their emotions more negatively had more aggressive intended responses. The results suggest that people perceive and interpret the capacities and responsibilities of the actors-human-driver and self-driving car-differently due to differential mind attributions. As technology in transportation matures, examining people's behaviors and intentions in mixed traffic can lead to better preparation for the future roads and maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles.

AB Hydrodynamic design of an underwater glider is an act of balancing the requirement for a streamlined hydrodynamically effective shape and the consideration of the practical aspects of the intended operational envelope of the vehicle, such as its ability to deploy a wide range of sensors across the water column. Key challenges in arriving at a successful glider design are discussed and put in the context of existing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) of this type. The design cycle of a new vehicle shape is then described. The discussed AUV will operate both as a buoyancy-propelled glider and a flight-style propeller-driven submersible, utilizing its large size to deliver substantial scientific payloads to remote locations to perform environmental monitoring, seabed survey, and exploration for subsea oil, gas, and material deposits. Emphasis is put on using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods capable of predicting laminar-turbulent transition of the flow to estimate the performance of candidate designs and thus inform and guide the evolution of the vehicle. A range of considered shapes is therefore described and their hydrodynamic characteristics predicted using CFD are summarized. A final shape for the new glider is then proposed. This is then subject to an in-depth flow-field analysis, which points out how natural laminar flow may be used as a means of drag reduction without compromising the practical aspects of the design, such as its ability to carry sufficient payload. Finally, the obtained data are used to project the expected glide paths, as well as give preliminary estimates of its range. These show the benefits of minimizing the vehicle drag, as well as highlight the possible tradeoffs between maximizing speed and endurance of the AUV.

ID MODEL
AB After decades of research on traffic conflicts and other crash surrogate events, defining these events and conclusively connecting them with crashes continue to be the most important tasks. This paper aims to help establish a consensus on these two fundamental matters by discussing the underlying concepts by which they can be connected in a consistent construct justified with theory and empirical evidence. The importance of insight into a safety-relevant event beyond what is externally observable is emphasized by considering two distributions of crash nearness: (1) values observed by external observers and (2) driver-preferred values that are usually unobservable. Traffic encounters and traffic conflicts are discussed here in the context of crash possibility illustrated with these two distributions. The difference between the preferred and observed crash nearness values is introduced as the delay of response to an error that violates the crash nearness preference. Traffic conflicts caused by driver errors that violate the driver populace's minimum crash nearness are recommended for safety analysis if only external observations are available. The conditions of properly detecting such traffic conflicts and estimating the probability of crash are identified and their validity is emphasized based on the past SHRP2 study. The mentioned study identified two additional conditions for proper identification of traffic conflicts: (1) speeds sufficiently high to induce driver responses consistent with the theory and with Lomax distribution and (2) elimination of self-clearing encounters such as a preceding vehicle exiting a lane in rear-end interactions. The most encouraging finding of this study is the mentioned sufficiently high speeds that tend to coincide with collision outcomes sufficiently serious to be reportable to the authorities. Another encouraging element is the insight about preferred crash nearness values that may be brought by autonomous vehicles. The biggest challenge in applying EV modeling today is using proper safety-relevant events to ensure that the tail of a distribution estimated based on observed events is consistent with the distribution tail that represents a crash. Autonomous vehicles may help eliminate this challenge since their preferred crash nearness values should be known.

AB This paper aims to quantitatively assess the geometric design of road and roadside infrastructure for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) using point cloud data while addressing the limitations and recommendations of previous studies. This research utilizes an ultra-dense point cloud to represent a digital twin of existing roads and simulates a set of AV sensors and phantom targets on both the road and roadside areas within this environment. A quadratic surface model, convex polyhedra/hulls with an octree/voxel data structure, a semantic segmentation variant of PointNet++, and YCbCr colour spaces were used by us to map road/roadside design readiness measures. Using the developed method, several case studies are presented to identify locations with substandard design conditions for AVs. This work can help infrastructure operators, and AV professionals make data-driven decisions regarding smart physical and digital infrastructure investments.

AB In this paper, we propose a robust tensor-based strategy to jointly estimate channel state information (CSI) and detect information symbols for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) communication systems. First, a superimposed signal transmission scheme is designed for each IoT device, and the superimposed signals are transmitted to UAVs simultaneously. Then, UAVs amplify and forward the received signals to the base station (BS), where a combined nested parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensor model is constructed. Finally, a robust tensor-based algorithm is derived to estimate full knowledge of CSI and detect information symbols. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm offers superior performance compared with the competitive methods.

AB Deep learning has accomplished huge success in computer vision applications such as self-driving vehicles, facial recognition, and controlling robots. A growing need for deploying systems on resource-limited or resource-constrained environments such as smart cameras, autonomous vehicles, robots, smartphones, and smart wearable devices drives one of the current mainstream developments of convolutional neural networks: reducing model complexity but maintaining fine accuracy. In this study, the proposed efficient light convolutional neural network (ELNet) comprises three convolutional modules which perform ELNet using fewer computations, which is able to be implemented in resource-constrained hardware equipment. The classification task using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets was used to verify the model performance. According to the experimental results, ELNet reached 92.3% and 69%, respectively, in CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets; moreover, ELNet effectively lowered the computational complexity and parameters required in comparison with other CNN architectures.

AB Inspired by the behaviour of pigeon flocks, an improved method of path planning and autonomous formation for unmanned aerial vehicles based on the pigeon-inspired optimisation and differential evolution is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the mathematical model for UAV path planning is devised as a multi-objective optimisation with three indices, i.e., the length of a path, the sinuosity of a path, and the risk of a path. Then, the method integrated by pigeon-inspired optimisation and mutation strategies of differential evolution is developed to optimise feasible paths. Besides, Pareto dominance is applied to select the global best position of a pigeon. Finally, a series of simulation results compared with standard particle swarm optimisation algorithm and standard differential evolution algorithm show the effectiveness of our method.

Then, we outline several optimization techniques and paradigms used to enhance the routing process. Moreover, in order to promote the deployment of robust IoV routing protocols at large scale, we provide some directions for future research work.

AB This paper presents a practical scheme to control heave motion for hover and automatic landing of a Rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (RUAV) in the presence of strong horizontal gusts. A heave motion model is constructed for the purpose of capturing dynamic variations of thrust due to horizontal gusts. Through the construction of an effective gust estimator, a feedback-feedforward controller is developed which uses available measurements from onboard sensors. The proposed controller dynamically and synchronously compensates for aerodynamic variations of heave motion, enhancing disturbance-attenuation capability of the RUAV. Simulation results justify the reliability and efficiency of the suggested gust estimator. Moreover, flight tests conducted on our Eagle helicopter verify suitability of the proposed control strategy for small RUAVs operating in a gusty environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper we describe the design and control algorithms of AMOUR, a low-cost autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of missions of marine survey and monitoring. AMOUR is a highly maneuverable robot capable of hovering and carrying dynamic payloads during a single mission. The robot can carry a variety of payloads. It uses internal buoyancy and balance control mechanisms to achieve power efficient motions regardless of the payload size. AMOUR is designed to operate in synergy with a wireless underwater sensor network (WUSN) of static nodes. The robot's payload was designed in order to deploy, relocate and recover the static sensor nodes. It communicates with the network acoustically for signaling and localization and optically for data muling. We present control algorithms, navigation algorithms, and experimental data from pool and ocean trials with AMOUR that demonstrate its basic navigation capabilities, power efficiency, and ability to carry dynamic payloads.

ID AVOIDANCE; SYSTEMS; ORDER
AB The problem of controlling an autonomous wheeled vehicle which must move in its operative space and reach a prescribed goal point avoiding the collision with the obstacles is dealt with. To comply with the nonholonomic nature of the system, a gradient-tracking approach is followed, so that a reference velocity and orientation are suitably generated during the vehicle motion. To track such references, two control laws are designed by suitably transforming the system model into a couple of auxiliary second-order uncertain systems, relying on which second-order sliding modes can be enforced. As a result, the control objective is attained by means of a continuous control law, so that the problems due to the so-called chattering effect, such as the possible actuators wear or the induction of vibrations, typically associated with the use of sliding-mode control, are circumvented.

AB The fusion between an inertial navigation system and global navigation satellite systems is regularly used in many platforms, such as drones, land vehicles, and marine vessels. The fusion is commonly carried out in a model-based extended Kalman filter framework. One of the critical parameters of the filter is the process noise covariance. It is responsible for the real-time solution accuracy, as it considers both vehicle dynamics uncertainty and the inertial sensors quality. In most situations, the process noise covariance is assumed to be constant. Yet, due to vehicle dynamics and sensor measurement variations throughout the trajectory, the process noise covariance is subject to change. To cope with such situations, several adaptive model-based Kalman filters were suggested in the literature. In this article, we propose a hybrid model and learning-based adaptive navigation filter. We rely on the model-based Kalman filter and design a deep neural network (DNN) model to tune the momentary system noise covariance, based only on the inertial sensor readings. Once the process noise covariance is learned, it is plugged into the well-established model-based Kalman filter. After deriving the proposed hybrid framework, field experiment results using a quadrotor are presented and a comparison to model-based adaptive approaches is given. We show that the proposed method obtained an improvement of 25% in the position error. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid learning method can be used in any navigation filter and also in any relevant estimation problem.

AB In recent years, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication brings more and more attention from industry (e.g., Google and Uber) and government (e.g., United States Department of Transportation). These Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies are widely adopted in future autonomous vehicles. However, security issues have not been fully addressed in V2V and V2I systems, especially in key distribution and key management. The physical layer key generation, which exploits wireless channel reciprocity and randomness to generate secure keys, provides a feasible solution for secure V2V/V2I communication. It is lightweight, flexible, and dynamic. In this paper, the physical layer key generation is brought to the V2I and V2V scenarios. A LoRa-based physical key generation scheme is designed for securing V2V/V2I communications. The communication is based on Long Range (LoRa) protocol, which is able to measure Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) in long-distance as consensus information to generate secure keys. The multi-bit quantization algorithm, with an improved Cascade key agreement protocol, generates secure binary bit keys. The proposed schemes improved the key generation rate, as well as to avoid information leakage during transmission. The proposed physical layer key generation scheme was implemented in a V2V/V2I network system prototype. The extensive experiments in V2I and V2V environments evaluate the efficiency of the proposed key generation scheme. The experiments in real outdoor environments have been conducted. Its key generation rate could exceed 10 bit/s on our V2V/V2I network system prototype and achieve 20 bit/s in some of our experiments. For binary key sequences, all of them pass the suite of statistical tests from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

AB aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted visible light communication (VLC) constitutes a promising approach for providing illumination and communication simultaneously. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint UAV deployment, cell association, and power allocation, to meet the illumination and data rate demands of a set of users in a geographical area. Towards this goal, we develop SOUVLC, a multi-objective sequentially optimized UAV-assisted VLC framework that aims at minimizing the required number of UAVs first and minimizing the total transmitted power second. SOUVLC mitigates inter-cell interference and accounts for illumination interference. We derive a mixed-integer linear formulation of SOUVLC, numerically evaluate it under different user demands and distributions, and demonstrate its superiority over several benchmarks.

AB Lane-level map matching is essential for autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for matching a trajectory of noisy GPS measurements to the road lanes in which the vehicle records its positions. To our knowledge, this is the first time that HMM is used for lane-level map matching. Apart from GPS values, the model is further assisted by yaw rate data (converted to a lane change indicator signal) and visual cues in the form of the left and right lane marking types (dashed, solid, etc.). Having defined expressions for the HMM emission and transition probabilities, we evaluate our model to demonstrate that it achieves 95.1% recall and 3.3% median path length error for motorway trajectories.

AB A cooperative integrity monitoring (CIM) algorithm is proposed in this work. Under the CIM architecture, the algorithm can fully exploit the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data and inter-vehicle measurements data to improve the detection and isolation of faulty measurements due to multipath or non line of sight (NLOS). Taking the advantages of cooperative scheme, a residual decomposition method is used to model the measurement errors into common and specific parts, a greedy search strategy is used to exclude the faulty measurements based on its sub-statistics. Simulation results show that CIM has better detection of GNSS fault than traditional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM). Also, CIM is capable of detecting the faulty outliers in inter-vehicle measurements. The results indicate that CIM can be applied to many existing multi-sensor cooperative positioning algorithms.

AB Battery thermal management is necessary for electric vehicles (EVs), especially for Li-ion batteries, due to the heat dissipation effects on those batteries. Usually, air or coolant circuits are employed as thermal management systems in Li-ion batteries. However, those systems are expensive in terms of investment and operating costs. Phase change materials (PCMs) may represent an alternative which could be cheaper and easier to operate. In fact, PCMs can be used as passive or semi-passive systems, enabling the global system to sustain near-autonomous operations. This article presents the previous developments introducing PCMs for EVs battery cooling. Different systems are reviewed and solutions are proposed to enhance PCMs efficiency in those systems.

ID WILDERNESS SEARCH
AB Wilderness search and rescue entails performing a wide-range of work in complex environments and large regions. Given the concerns inherent in large regions due to limited rescue distribution, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based frameworks are a promising platform for providing aerial imaging. In recent years, technological advances in areas such as micro-technology, sensors and navigation have influenced the various applications of UAVs. In this study, an all-in-one camera-based target detection and positioning system is developed and integrated into a fully autonomous fixed-wing UAV. The system presented in this paper is capable of on-board, real-time target identification, post-target identification and location and aerial image collection for further mapping applications. Its performance is examined using several simulated search and rescue missions, and the test results demonstrate its reliability and efficiency.

AB A highly detailed sensing of a vehicle's surrounding environment is a key requirement for the advancement of autonomous driving technology. While conventional automotive radar sensors remain robust under challenging weather conditions, poor cross-range resolution and high sidelobe levels present significant challenges. In this article, we propose an approach that combines multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming with Doppler beam sharpening. We demonstrate a significant improvement in terms of cross-range resolution and, importantly, nearly 20-dB sidelobe suppression compared to conventional MIMO processing. This approach is investigated in detail and validated through theoretical analysis, simulation, and experiment using data recorded on a moving vehicle. We demonstrate performance that is comparable to a high-resolution mechanically scanned radar using a commercially available MIMO sensor.

AB In this letter, we consider a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based uplink cellular system assisted by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) through dual connectivity. To balance efficiency and fairness, we aim to maximize the sum weighted bit rate by jointly optimizing the three-dimensional UAV placement and power allocation. Considering the non-convexity of the original problem, we propose a hybrid offline-online algorithm: In the offline training, when the UAV placement is given, the property of fractional programming is utilized to obtain a sub-optimal power allocation solution; Based on the results of power allocation, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is leveraged to learn the optimal UAV trajectory policy that can be deployed in an online fashion. Finally, simulations are conducted to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB The tractor-trailer wheeled robot is an articulated nonholonomic vehicle. This paper presents a novel PID-based tracking control law for the tractor-trailer wheeled robot. Theoretical anticipations do not always match the behavior of real systems. This is as a result of the existence of various uncertainties and disturbances. Consequently, controllers that are less dependent on systems' theoretical models are more desirable that is aimed at this research. Therefore, a PID-based kinematic controller is proposed as a non-model based controller to navigate the tractor-trailer wheeled robot follows desired trajectories. Subsequently, a computed torque dynamic controller is investigated to produce kinetic control inputs. The proposed method is implemented on a real-time experimental testbed and obtained results are discussed. These results present the merits of the proposed algorithm.

TI Nonlinear model predictive control technique for unmanned air vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB A nonlinear model predictive control strategy is developed and subsequently specialized to autonomous aircraft that can be adequately modeled with a rigid 6-degrees-of-freedom representation. Whereas the general air vehicle dynamic equations are nonlinear and nonaffine in control, a closed-form solution for the optimal control input is enabled by expanding both the output and control in a truncated Taylor series. The closed-form solution for control is relatively simple to calculate and well suited to the real time embedded computing environment. An interesting feature of this control law is that the number of Taylor series expansion terms can be used to indirectly penalize control action. Also, ill conditioning in the optimal control gain equation limits practical selection of the number of Taylor series expansion terms. These claims are substantiated through simulation by application of the method to a parafoil and payload aircraft as well as a glider.

AB The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) works to understand ocean and Great Lakes' environments and their resources, and develop the capability to predict environmental changes. This mission requires a comprehensive oceanographic research program,, including the use of undersea technologies. The in situ undersea approach to ocean science allows acquisition of otherwise unobtainable observations, samples, and experimentation. NOAA's National Undersea Research Program (NURP) places scientists underwater directly through the use of submersibles, underwater laboratories, and wet diving, or indirectly using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and ocean observatories. Scientific diving is an integral part of NURP's research efforts. The program seeks to safely maximize the capabilities of the nation's scientific diving community through direct assistance from program experts, and development of new and improved technologies. NURP is also the only federal program with the legislative mandate to improve the safety and performance of divers.

ID PERFORMANCE; GPS
AB A map-matching algorithm employs data from Global Positioning System (GPS), a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based road map and other sensors to first identify the correct link on which a vehicle travels and then to determine the physical location of the vehicle on the link. Due to uncertainties associated with the raw measurements from GPS/other sensors, the road map and the related methods, it is essential to monitor the integrity of map-matching results, especially for safety and mission-critical intelligent transport systems such as positioning and navigation of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Current integrity methods for map-matching are inadequate and unreliable as they fail to satisfy the integrity requirement due mainly to incorrect treatment of all the related uncertainties simultaneously. The aim of this paper is therefore to develop a new tightly-coupled integrity monitoring method for map-matching by properly treating the uncertainties from all sources concurrently. In this method, the raw measurements from GPS, low-cost Dead-Reckoning (DR) sensors and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are first integrated using an extended Kalman Filter to continuously obtain better position fixes. A weight-based topological map-matching process is then developed to map-match position fixes onto the road map. The accuracy of the map-matching process is enhanced by employing a range of network features such as grade separation, traffic flow directions and the geometry of road link. The Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) technique, which has been successfully applied to monitor the integrity of aircraft navigation, is modified and enhanced so as to apply it to monitor the quality of map-matching. In the enhanced RAIM method, two modifications are made: (1) a variable false alarm rate (as opposed to a constant false alarm rate) is considered to improve the fault detection performance in selecting the links, especially near junctions. (2) a sigma inflation for a non-Gaussian distribution of measurement noises is applied for the purpose of satisfying the integrity risk requirement.
   The implementation and validation of the enhanced RAIM method is accomplished by utilising the required navigation performance parameters (in terms of accuracy, integrity and availability) of safety and mission-critical intelligent transport systems. The required data were collected from Nottingham and central London. In terms of map-matching, the results suggest that the developed map-matching method is capable of identifying at least 97.7% of the links correctly in the case of frequent GPS outages. In terms of integrity, the enhanced RAIM method provides better the fault detection performance relative to the traditional RAIM.

ID OBSERVABILITY; NAVIGATION; LINEARIZATION
AB This paper addresses the problem of range-based autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) localization in the presence of unknown ocean currents. In the setup adopted, the AUV is equipped with an attitude and heading reference system, a depth sensor, and an acoustic device that provides measurements of its distance to a set of stationary beacons. We consider the situation where the number of active beacons is not known in advance and may vary with time. The objective is to simultaneously localize the AUV and beacons, that is, to find their positions underwater. We start by deriving conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct the initial condition of the system under study. We consider the design model where the states evolve continuously with time, but the range measurements are only available at discrete instants of time, possibly in a nonuniform manner. For trimming maneuvers that correspond to AUV trajectories with constant linear and angular velocities expressed in the body frame, we show that if either the position of one of the beacons or the initial position of the AUV is known, then even without depth information the system is weakly observable (i.e., the set of states that are indistinguishable from a given initial configuration contains only a set of finite isolated points). If depth measurements are also available, then the system is observable even in the presence of unknown constant ocean currents. Equipped with these results, we then propose a novel observer for simultaneous AUV and beacon localization. The mathematical setup exploited borrows from minimum-energy estimation theory applied to continuous-time processes with discrete measurements, projection filters, and multiple-model estimation techniques. Convergence analysis of the resulting observer system yields conditions under which the estimation errors converge to a small neighborhood of the origin (whose size depends on the magnitude of the process and measurement noise). The results of field experiments with a robotic marine vehicle show the efficacy of the simultaneous AUV/multiple beacon localization system proposed.

AB An agent-based transport simulation model is used to examine the impacts of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on the mobility of certain groups of people. In the state of the art, it has been found that the researchers primarily have simulation studies focusing on the impacts of AVs on people regardless of certain groups. However, this study focuses on assessing the impacts of AVs on different groups of users, where each group is affected variously by the introduction of different penetration levels of AVs into the market. The Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim) software, which applies the co-evolutionary algorithm and provides a framework to carry out large-scale agent-based transport simulations, is used as a tool for conducting the simulations. In addition to the simulation of all travellers, 3 groups of users are selected as potential users of AVs, as follow: (1) long commuters with high-income, (2) elderly people who are retired, and (3) part-time workers. Budapest (Hungary) is examined in a case study, where the daily activity plans of the households are provided. Initially, the existing daily activity plans (i.e., the existing condition) of each group are simulated and assessed before the introduction of AVs into the market. After that, the AVs are inserted into the road network, where different fleet sizes of AVs are applied based on the demand of each group. The marginal utility of the travel time spent in case of a transport mode, the AV fleet size, and the cost of the travel are the key variables that determine the use of a transport mode. The key variables are set based on the characteristics of the case study (i.e., demand) and the AVs. The results of the simulations suggest that the AVs have different degrees of influences on certain groups as demonstrated in the occurred changes on the modal share. The value of changes depends on the Value of Travel Time (VOT) of people and the used fleet size of AVs. Moreover, the influence of the traveller's characteristics on the AVs is manifested, such as different values of fleet utilization. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that an increase in the fleet size of AVs beyond 10% of the demand does not significantly raise the modal share of AVs. The outcome of this paper might be used by decision-makers to define the shape of the AVs' use and those groups who are interested in using AVs.

AB This article is concerned with the problem of adaptive prescribed performance trajectory tracking control for a six-degree-of-freedom Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. Firstly, a novel sliding mode surface with pre-specified performance settings is introduced, which possesses the capability to set the closed-loop system performance in advance. Secondly, the adaptive laws are constructed to estimate the upper bound of the concentrated disturbance terms composed of parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, and input deviations. On this basis, a sliding mode controller with predetermined performance specifications is constructed to ensure that the trajectory tracking errors converge to a predefined small neighborhood of the origin. Ultimately, simulation results are supplied to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in ensuring the AUV's trajectory tracking control.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB This paper addresses the problem of composite curve path following for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle by utilizing an adaptive integral line-of-sight (AILOS) guidance and nonlinear iterative sliding mode (NISM) controller. First, the composite curve path is parametrized by a common scalar variable in a continuous way. Then, the kinematics error of an underactuated vehicle is described based on the nonprojection Frenet-Serret frame with a virtual point, which can be eliminated by the virtual point control and AILOS guidance. Meanwhile, the subpath switching algorithm is studied to realize the global path following for the composite curve path. Besides, the NISM controller is cascaded with the AILOS guidance law, and the cascade structure proved to be globally kappa-exponentially stable under the influence of slow time-varying currents. Finally, simulations are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed composite curve path following control scheme.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; IMPACT; LANES
AB To study the guidance method of driverless travel mode choice from the perspective of traffic supply-demand, we assume that all vehicles are driverless and establish a multimodal travel market model to depict the supply-demand relationship of multimodal driverless transportation network. To regulate the disequilibrium multimodal travel market, an optimal price regulation law is proposed, which aims to minimize the supply-demand deviation and the amplitude of price regulation. Then, the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the optimal price regulation law are confirmed. In the calculation process of a numerical example, the travel prices of driverless car and driverless subway are realized by congestion fee and subway fare, respectively. The results indicate that the optimal price regulation law can reduce the supply-demand deviation of the multimodal travel market and guide travelers to choose a reasonable travel mode to travel in the driverless transportation network.

AB Fine-grained vehicle classification from images, also known as Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR), has become an important research topic in the last years, with a growing number of scientific contributions in multiple application areas, such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, traffic monitoring and management, among others. Recent techniques based on deep learning have proven to be very effective in addressing this problem. So effective that, based on the state-of-the-art results (above 95% accuracy), it would seem that the problem is practically solved. However, our main hypothesis is that the existing datasets to date have limited variability, which precludes good and unbiased generalisation of the models trained with them. In particular, it is observed that the test datasets are very similar in nature to those used for training and validation which makes these benchmarks prone to dataset bias and to overfitting. When these systems are tested with more challenging data or data from different datasets performance degrades considerably. In this paper, on the one hand, we evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models to perform fine-grained vehicle classification and explore multiple training techniques, such as curriculum learning or weighted losses, to mitigate the bias between different makes and models and to assess the limits of current approaches. On the other hand, we analyse the existing datasets, present an additional dataset from a challenging scenario, and merge all the data into a cross-dataset that includes common samples and classes from the existing datasets. In this way, we can evaluate geographical, make and model biases, and performance and generalisation capabilities from a more realistic perspective. The obtained results suggest that we are still far from accurate and unbiased vehicle make and model recognition in realistic traffic and driving scenarios.

AB Integrity monitoring (IM) for navigation systems is critical to ensure the safety of auto-driving vehicles. It refers to accurately raising alarms to a user when navigation positioning errors exceed the performance limitation. Although receiver autonomous IM (RAIM) methods have been widely applied for global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations via a consistency checking algorithm, the integrity performance for auto-driving would suffer from a large degradation due to the low satellite visibility with signal occlusions and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) receptions in urban environments. To alleviate this problem, the fifth-generation (5G) communication signals are used as an auxiliary urban navigation source to increase the number of observations, and then, an IM method for the integration of GNSS/5G (G5GIM) is proposed to improve the integrity performance. Specifically, the positioning reference signals (PRSs) of the 5G system in urban canyons are modeled to enrich the observations of the vehicle navigation, followed by the horizontal protection level (HPL) estimation method and the fault detection algorithm for the integration of GNSS and 5G observations. Experimental results on the simulation and UrbanNav datasets show that the proposed G5GIM method significantly outperforms the existing GNSS RAIM method in terms of HPL reduction, fault detection rate, and positioning accuracy improvement.

AB This study uses a Bezier curve-based shaping (BCBS) approach based on the dynamic model to quickly generate 3D cooperative trajectories for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It can facilitate the solution of the flight trajectory problem that occurs after the reallocation of mission points. Trajectory coordinates are expanded based on the Bezier curves that naturally satisfy boundary conditions (BCs); trajectories with the minimum flight time and those satisfying the dynamic constraints and collision-free conditions can be obtained by adjusting the Bezier coefficients. A three-UAV flight simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further, the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM). The simulation results of the BCBS method are used as the initial values for GPM optimization. It is demonstrated that the BCBS method requires a lower computation time than the direct solver, which is only 0.07% of the latter, and obtains similar optimization results (3.34% difference). This is considerably important for the rapid generation of optimized trajectories with the limited computing power of onboard computers. Furthermore, this method is expected to achieve online collaborative trajectory generation for multiple UAVs in view of its high computational efficiency.

AB The technology of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is developing in two main directions focusingon improving autonomy and improving construction, especially driving and power supply systems. The new Biomimetic Underwater Vehicles (BU Vs) are equipped with the innovative, energy efficient driving system consisting of artificial fins. Because these driving systems are not well developed yet, there are great possibilities to optimize them, e.g. in the field of materials. The article provides an analysis of the propulsion force of the fin as a function of the characteristics of the material from which it is made. The parameters of different materials were used for the fin design and their comparison. The material used in our research was tested in a laboratory to determine the Young's modulus. For simplicity, the same fin geometry (the length and the height) was used for each type of fin. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory was applied for estimation of the fluid-structure interaction. This article presents the laboratory test stand and the results of the experiments. The laboratory water tunnel was equipped with specialized sensors for force measurements and fluid-structure interaction analysis. The fin deflection is mathematically described, and the relationship between fin flexibility and the generated driving force is discussed.

AB Vehicular networks provide means to distribute data among intelligent vehicles, increasing their efficiency and the safety of their occupants. While connected to these networks, vehicles have access to various kinds of information shared by other vehicles and road-side units (RSUs). This information includes helpful resources, such as traffic state or remote sensors. An efficient and fast system to get access to this information is important but unproductive if the data are not appropriately structured, accessible, and easy to process. This paper proposes the creation of a semantic distributed network using content-addressed networking and peer-to-peer (P2P) connections. In this open and collaborative network, RSUs and vehicles use ontologies to semantically represent information and facilitate the development of intelligent autonomous agents capable of navigating and processing the shared data. In order to create this P2P network, this paper makes use of the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), an open source solution that provides secure, reliable, and efficient content-addressed distributed storage over standard IP networks using the new QUIC protocol. This paper highlights the feasibility of this proposal and compares it with the state-of-the-art. Results show that IPFS is a promising technology that offers a great balance between functionality, performance, and security.

AB There is a growing interest in new sensing technologies and processing algorithms to increase the level of driving automation towards self-driving vehicles. The challenge for autonomy is especially difficult for the negotiation of uncharted scenarios, including natural terrain.
   This paper proposes a method for terrain unevenness estimation that is based on the power spectral density (PSD) of the surface profile as measured by exteroceptive sensing, that is, by using a common onboard range sensor such as a stereoscopic camera. Using these components, the proposed estimator can evaluate terrain on-line during normal operations. PSD-based analysis provides insight not only on the magnitude of irregularities, but also on how these irregularities are distributed at various wavelengths. A feature vector can be defined to classify roughness that is proved a powerful statistical tool for the characterization of a given terrain fingerprint showing a limited sensitivity to vehicle tilt rotations. First, the theoretical foundations behind the PSD-based estimator are presented. Then, the system is validated in the field using an all-terrain rover that operates on various natural surfaces. It is shown its potential for automatic ground harshness estimation and, in general, for the development of driving assistance systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Single-Lane Roundabout Manager under Fully Automated Vehicle Environment
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB In the advent of new automation and communication technologies, the introduction of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can make efficient use of the space on our road networks. Since roundabouts suffer from lower efficiencies when traffic flows are unbalanced and unfamiliar drivers are present, CAVs have the potential to improve traffic operations, reducing lost time and inefficiency in gap-usage. The aim of this research is to take advantage of those recently available technologies to design a traffic management system for roundabouts. Such a system can provide CAVs with optimal trajectories to negotiate the roundabout, maximizing throughput and minimizing control delay. The rule-based Roundabout Manager algorithm developed considers the roundabout as a whole system, assessing the priority of incoming vehicles on a first-come-first-served scheduling to solve conflicts. The management system takes into consideration the geometry of the roundabout, including the flared entries and exits and the location of conflict sections based on merging trajectories of vehicles in negotiating the roundabout. To illustrate the operation of the algorithm, a total of 15 undersaturated demand scenarios with 10 replications per scenario were simulated. From the results, it can be concluded that the system can reduce control delay for medium demand scenarios, maximizing the throughput for all demand scenarios. The Roundabout Manager can work in real time providing optimized trajectories in less than 0.02 s at any traffic flow rate simulated.

AB Motion planning, decision making, and control are vital functions in autonomous driving for accomplishing the desired driving task while considering passenger comfort, road infrastructure, and surrounding traffic participants. Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising method for simultaneously realizing these functions. However, formulating a single MPC that can run through all driving scenarios is difficult, and previous research has often been conducted to design an MPC for a specific driving task. To extend the availability of MPC for all driving tasks, smooth switching between different MPCs designed for each driving task must be addressed. One of the difficulties in switching between MPCs is guiding the state to a feasible set of optimization problems after switching. In this paper, we present a new framework to realize the smooth connection of MPCs, that is, to reduce the optimization infeasibility at the time of MPC switching. In our proposed method, two general nonlinear MPCs with different state spaces, cost functions, constraints, and formulations can be systematically switched via automatically generated intermediate-MPCs without requiring any particular alterations. This can help reduce the system complexity of the hybrid MPC system.

AB In the past, there has been a tremendous amount of progress in the area of autonomous robot navigation, and a large variety of robots have been developed that demonstrated robust navigation capabilities indoors, in nonurban outdoor environments, or on roads; relatively few approaches have focused on navigation in urban environments such as city centers. Urban areas, however, introduce numerous challenges for autonomous robots as they are rather unstructured and dynamic. In this paper, we present a navigation system for mobile robots designed to operate in crowded city environments and pedestrian zones. We describe the different components of this system, including a simultaneous localization and mapping module for dealing with huge maps of city centers, a planning component for inferring feasible paths, taking into account the traversability and type of terrain, a module for accurate localization in dynamic environments, and the means for calibrating and monitoring the platform. Our navigation system has been implemented and tested in several large-scale field tests, in which a real robot autonomously navigated over several kilometers in a complex urban environment. This also included a public demonstration, during which the robot autonomously traveled along a more than 3-km-long route through the city center of Freiburg, Germany.

AB This paper comprehensively investigates the feasibility of a modified cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategy to support car platooning in freeway weaving segments. Firstly, to improve the system response to cut-out and cut-in disturbance, the control structure of the typical original CACC system was modified and a synthesis control structure was designed that integrates the feedforward control module to the conventional feedback CACC system. Based on the modified control structure, a variable acceleration limited (VAL) control algorithm is proposed, which is specifically applied in the feedforward control model to suppress the propagation of the cut-in and cut-out disturbances in the CACC platoon. To investigate the performance of the VAL-CACC strategy, a series of comparative simulation experiments were carried out under simulated freeway weaving areas. In these tested scenarios, the occurance of frequent lane changing is considered, and the cut-out and cut-in disturbance of the CACC platoon are investigated, respectively. The obtained experimental results revealed that, compared with the original CACC system, the proposed VAL-CACC strategy can ameliorate the acceleration fluctuation amplitude, reducing it by 12.5% in the tested cut-out scenario. On the other hand, in the cut-in comparative experiments, it is found out that the VAL-CACC strategy can more significantly reduce by about 48.33% the jitter amplitude caused by the merging-in behavior of the non-platooned vehicle. These results demonstrate that the proposed synthesis VAL-CACC strategy can dramatically improve the CACC platoon's ability to resist cut-in and cut-out disturbances.

AB The vehicle platoon will be the most dominant driving mode on future roads. To the best of our knowledge, few reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been applied in vehicle platoon control, which has large-scale action and state spaces. Some RL-based methods were applied to solve single-agent problems. If we need to tackle multiagent problems, we will use multiagent RL algorithms since the parameters space grows exponentially with the increasing number of agents involved. Previous multiagent RL algorithms generally may provide redundant information to agents, indicating a large amount of useless or unrelated information, which may cause to be difficult for convergence training and pattern extractions from shared information. Also, random actions usually contribute to crashes, especially at the beginning of training. In this study, a communication proximal policy optimization (CommPPO) algorithm was proposed to tackle the above issues. In specific, the CommPPO model adopts a parameter-sharing structure to allow the dynamic variation of agent numbers, which can well handle various platoon dynamics, including splitting and merging. The communication protocol of the CommPPO consists of two parts. In the state part, the widely used predecessor-leader follower typology in the platoon is adopted to transmit global and local state information to agents. In the reward part, a new reward communication channel is proposed to solve the spurious reward and "lazy agent" problems in some existing multiagent RLs. Moreover, a curriculum learning approach is adopted to reduce crashes and speed up training. To validate the proposed strategy for platoon control, two existing multiagent RLs and a traditional platoon control strategy were applied in the same scenarios for comparison. Results showed that the CommPPO algorithm gained more rewards and achieved the largest fuel consumption reduction (11.6%).

AB Combining cooperative vehicle driving behavior of Connected and Automated Vehicles with supporting infor-mation infrastructure, is expected to increase the capacity of roadway infrastructure, which in turn results in travel time savings and user benefits. Automated driving also relieves the driver from steering the car, allowing to conduct other activities during the trip, which is likely to generate further user benefits. In order to assess the magnitude of automated driving on travel time-related user benefits, a typical commuting relation is analyzed, considering three route options as well as level 4 and 5 vehicle automation. The impacts on travel times are estimated by microscopic traffic flow simulations. The simulations reveal that around 27% of the travel time can be saved on a commuting relation due to road automation according to level 5. For level 4 vehicles the travel time savings amount to up to 20%. User benefits that accrue from time savings and the passenger's option of using travelling time for activities other than conducting the car, are expected at a relevant magnitude. Even under consideration of higher operating costs of an automated car, significant user benefits accrue: 1,310-2,240 Euro p.a. for level 4 and 2,770-3,440 Euro p.a. for level 5 vehicles during a passenger car's typical depreciation period. Thus, automated driving will decrease the commuters' generalized user costs for individual motorized mobility, which is likely to enhance the urban hinterland's attractiveness as residential area. This pattern and inherent second-order effects pose challenges for transport, land use and urban planners. Furthermore, it represents a challenge for transport research: to elaborate appropriate concepts that allow for exploiting the benefits of use of automated vehicles while countervailing undesirable socio-economic effects, as well as strains on the transport system and land use.

AB Autonomy and autonomous systems are occupying central stage in the research community, as autonomous vehicles are proliferating and their utility in all aspects of the military and civilian domains are increasing exponentially from one year to the next. The development and application of resiliency and safety technologies to autonomous systems is, unfortunately, not keeping pace with their growth rate. Several factors impede the deployment and adoption of autonomous systems. Among them is the absence of an adequately high level of autonomy that can be relied upon, significant challenges in the area of human-machine interface requiring significant human intervention to operate and interpret sensor data, the need for emerging machine learning technologies and, most importantly, the resilient design and operation of complex systems to assure their safety, reliability and availability when executing missions in unstructured and cluttered environments. Recent advances in resiliency and safety of complex engineered systems have focused on methods/tools to tradeoff system performance for increased time to failure aiming at mission completion or trial and error methods to arrive at a suboptimal policy for system self-organization in the presence of a failure mode. This paper introduces a novel framework for the resilient design and operation of such complex systems via self-organization and control reconfiguration strategies that avoid empirical trial and error techniques and may be implemented and perform in real time on-platform. The main theme is summarized as: "a healthy and resilient system is a safe system". To accomplish this objective, we introduce an integrated and rigorous approach to resilient design while safety considerations ascertain that the targeted system is contained within a safe envelope. A resilient system is robustly and flexibly monitoring its internal and external environment, it can detect and anticipate disturbances that may affect its operational integrity and take appropriate action to compensate for the disturbance. Resilience enhances safety while improving risk factors and assures that vehicles subjected to extreme disturbances remain within their safe envelope. The enabling technologies begin with graph spectral and epidemic spreading modeling tools to represent the system behaviors under normal and faulty conditions; a Markov Decision Process is the basic self-organization module. We are introducing a novel approach to fault-tolerance by considering the impacts of severe fault modes on system performance as inputs to a Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy that trades off system performance with control activity in order to extend the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the unmanned system. Performance metrics are defined and assist in the algorithmic developments and their validation. We pursue an integrated and verifiable methodology to safety assurance that enables the evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management strategies. Several unmanned autonomous systems are used for demonstration purposes.

AB First-person view (FPV) drone racing is a televised sport in which professional competitors pilot high-speed aircraft through a 3D circuit. Each pilot sees the environment from the perspective of their drone by means of video streamed from an onboard camera. Reaching the level of professional pilots with an autonomous drone is challenging because the robot needs to fly at its physical limits while estimating its speed and location in the circuit exclusively from onboard sensors1. Here we introduce Swift, an autonomous system that can race physical vehicles at the level of the human world champions. The system combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation with data collected in the physical world. Swift competed against three human champions, including the world champions of two international leagues, in real-world head-to-head races. Swift won several races against each of the human champions and demonstrated the fastest recorded race time. This work represents a milestone for mobile robotics and machine intelligence2, which may inspire the deployment of hybrid learning-based solutions in other physical systems.
   An autonomous system is described that combines deep reinforcement learning with onboard sensors collecting data from the physical world, enabling it to fly faster than human world champion drone pilots around a race track.

AB Autonomous vehicles aim to improve driving safety and comfort. In autonomous car SAE level-3 operations, it is necessary to determine whether the driving authority can be transferred from the computer to the driver. The driver must be awake and sufficiently alert to switch to manual driving operation. Physiological measurement methods require sensors that are in contact with the human body. These sensors are annoying, frustrating, and inconvenient for the driver. The purpose of this study is to determine a driver's condition using eye-closing time and yawning frequency by a visible-light camera and a thermal camera. Eye-closings and yawns were detected using an appropriate non-contact detector with a visible camera and thermal camera. When a visible-light camera was used, the driver state recognition rate was 90 % or higher when the driver's surroundings were brightly lit, but the recognition rate decreased significantly to approximately 4 % when the surroundings were dark. Using a thermal camera, the face recognition rate was 74 % under bright and dark conditions. For the thermal images, DLib and OpenCV could be performed well. Therefore, the DLib and thermal image combination could be used for a reliable driver drowsiness detection task.

ID COMPOSITES
AB Polymers are susceptible to small damage which is difficult to detect and repair and may lead to catastrophic failure if left unattended at the early stage. How to autonomously warn and repair the damage simultaneously is a promising yet challenging task, owing to the difficulty in integrating different functional elements for packaging and lack of suitable vehicles to carry a multirole trigger with high reactivity. Herein, inspired by human skin in the damage-healing process, we report a genuinely fully autonomous smart material that is capable of warning of and healing damage via simply incorporating dual microcapsules containing polyamine as a multirole trigger and epoxy monomer dyed with a pH indicator, respectively. Both microscopic "subcutaneous" damage and macroscopic surface damage can be warned of by a conspicuous red color, not only rapidly upon occurrence but also permanently after being repaired. Accompanied with the comprehensive warning, the smart material shows high healing performance upon dynamic impact damage with efficiency up to 100% without external interventions. This facile and ready strategy with fully autonomous warning and healing functions independent of the host matrix provides a new avenue to enhance the reliability and longevity of a wide variety of polymeric materials ranging from functional coatings to structural composites.

AB The rising frequency of ocean activities, such as ocean transportation and marine resources development, inevitably leads to a higher incidence of sudden accidents at sea. Maritime search and rescue (MSAR) plays a crucial role in marine transportation. Specifically, maritime search serves as a preparatory mission before executing the actual rescue operations. In 2018, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) made significant legal amendments to the international convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), emphasizing the critical importance of MSAR operations. Nevertheless, the conventional maritime search systems, such as independent surface ships, underwater vehicles, or aerial platforms, fall short of meeting the demands of modern shipping and can impose significant energy and economic burdens. Meanwhile, unmanned systems are gaining prominence in maritime search due to their notable advantages, including high efficiency, costeffectiveness, and rapid deployment. One observes that the research of unmanned maritime search is still in an early stage. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art of maritime unmanned search system development with four dimensions, including the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), unmanned surface vessel (USV) and underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) and its cooperative heterogeneous vehicles. Firstly, the search types, the superiorities and the application scenarios of the unmanned search system are summarized. Then, the theoretical progress, engineering applications and limitations for the unmanned search system are investigated. To further discuss the advantages of the unmanned search system, a novel cooperative platform is established that uses an USV and two UAVs. In the proposed platform, the sensor, communication, guidance and control subsystems are described to illustrate the convenience and the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative system. Finally, the future research directions are examined to expedite the practical implementation of theoretical advancements in the field of maritime unmanned search.

AB We have found that phase transitions occurring between three traffic phases [free flow (F), synchronized flow (S), and wide moving jam (J)] determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of traffic consisting of 100% automateddriving vehicles moving on a two-lane road with an on-ramp bottleneck. This means that three-phase traffic theory is a common framework for the description of traffic states independent of whether human-driving or automated-driving vehicles move in vehicular traffic. To prove this, we have studied automated-driving vehicular traffic with the use of classical Helly's model [Proceedings of the Symposium on Theory of Traffic Flow (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1959), pp. 207-238] widely applied for automated vehicle motion. Although dynamic rules of the motion of automated-driving vehicles in a road lane are qualitatively different from those of human-driving vehicles, we have revealed that traffic breakdown (F S transition) at the bottleneck exhibits the nucleation nature, which was observed in empirical field data measured in traffic consisting of 100% human-driving vehicles. The physics of the nucleation nature of the F S transition in automated-driving traffic is associated with a discontinuity in the rate of lane-changing that causes the discontinuity in the rate of over-acceleration. This discontinuous character of over-acceleration leads to both the existence and self-maintaining of synchronized flow at the bottleneck in automated-driving vehicular traffic as well as to the existence at any time instant of a range of highway capacities between some minimum and maximum capacities. Within the capacity range, an F S transition can be induced; however, when the maximum capacity is exceeded, then after some time-delay a spontaneous F S transition occurs at the bottleneck. The phases F, S, and J can coexist each other in space and time.

AB Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing a vital and sustainable role in many verticals touching different aspects of our lives including civil, public, and military applications. WSNs majorly consist of a few to several sensor nodes, that are connected to each other via wireless communication links and require real-time or delayed data transfer. In this paper, we propose an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled data gathering mechanism for delay-tolerant WSN applications. The objective is to employ a self-trained UAV as a flying mobile unit collecting data from ground sensor nodes spatially distributed in a given geographical area during a predefined period of time. In this approach, two Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches, specifically Deep Deterministic Gradient Decent (DDPG) and Q-learning (QL) algorithms, are jointly employed to train the UAV to understand the environment and provide effective scheduling to accomplish its data collection mission. The DDPG is used to autonomously decide the best trajectory to adopt in an obstacle-constrained environment, while the QL is developed to determine the order of nodes to visit such that the data collection time is minimized. The schedule is obtained while considering the limited battery capacity of the flying unit, its need to return the charging station, the time windows of data acquisition, and the priority of certain sensor nodes. Customized reward functions are designed for each RL model and, through numerical simulations, we investigate their training performances. We also analyze the behavior of the autonomous UAV for different selected scenarios and corroborate the ability of the proposed approach in performing effective data collection. A comparison with the deterministic optimal solution is provided to validate the performance of the learning-based approach.

AB There is an increased interest for battery electric vehicles in multiple sectors, including agriculture. The potential for lowered environmental impact is one of the key factors, but there exists a knowledge gap between the environmental impact of on-road vehicles and agricultural work machinery. In this study, a life cycle assessment was performed on two smaller, self-driving battery electric tractors, and the results were compared to those of a conventional tractor for eleven midpoint characterisation factors, three damage categories and one weighted single score. The results showed that compared to the conventional tractor, the battery electric tractor had a higher impact in all categories during the production phase, with battery production being a majority contributor. However, over the entire life cycle, it had a lower impact in the weighted single score (-72%) and all three damage categories; human health (-74%), ecosystem impact (-47%) and resource scarcity (-67%). The global warming potential over the life cycle of the battery electric tractor was 102 kg CO(2)eq.ha(-1) y(-1) compared to 293 kg CO(2)eq.ha(-1) y(-1) for the conventional system. For the global warming potential category, the use phase was the most influential and the fuel used was the single most important factor.

AB Background: Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles are autonomous or remotely controlled multipurpose aerial vehicles driven by aerodynamic forces and capable of carrying a payload. Whereas initially used exclusively for military purposes, the use of drones has gradually spread into other areas. Given their great flexibility and favourable costs, the use of drones has also been piloted in various healthcare settings.
   Objectives: We briefly summarize current knowledge regarding the use of drones in healthcare, focusing on infectious diseases and/or microbiology when applicable.
   Sources: Information was sought through PubMed and extracted from peer-reviewed literature published between January 2010 and August 2019 and from reliable online news sources. The search terms 'drones', 'unmanned aerial vehicles', 'microbiology' and 'medicine' were used.
   Content: Peer-reviewed literature on the use of drones in healthcare has steadily increased in recent years. Drones have been successfully evaluated in various pilot programmes and are already implemented in some settings for transporting samples and delivering blood, vaccines, medicines, organs, life-saving medical supplies and equipment. In addition, a promising proof-of-concept 'lab-on-a-drone' was recently presented, as well as several pilot studies showing the benefits of drone use in surveillance and epidemiology of infectious diseases.

AB In underwater robotic interaction tasks (e.g., sampling of sea organisms, underwater welding, panel handling, etc) various issues regarding the uncertainties and complexity of the robot dynamic model, the external disturbances (e.g., sea currents), the steady state performance as well as the overshooting/undershooting of the interaction force error, should be addressed during the control design. Motivated by the aforementioned considerations, this paper presents a force/position tracking control protocol for an Underwater Vehicle Manipulator System (UVMS) in compliant contact with a planar surface, without incorporating any knowledge of the UVMS dynamic model, the exogenous disturbances or the contact stiffness model. Moreover, the proposed control framework guarantees: (i) certain predefined minimum speed of response, maximum steady state error as well as overshoot/undershoot concerning the force/position tracking errors, (ii) contact maintenance and (iii) bounded closed loop signals. Additionally, the achieved transient and steady state performance is solely determined by certain designer-specified performance functions/parameters and is fully decoupled from the control gain selection and the initial conditions. Finally, both simulation and experimental studies clarify the proposed method and verify its efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As the approaching of Agriculture 4.0 era and advancements of new technologies of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and particularly quadcopter UAVs, plant protection quadcopters are becoming increasingly popular and practical in pesticide spraying, fertilization, pollination, seeding, and other agricultural activities. One of the main problems for plant protection quadcopters is completing planning tasks efficiently and quickly. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous task assignment and decision-making method for coverage path planning by multiple cooperative quadcopters. The Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method is adopted to acquire the optimal solution for the proposed problem. Then, a simulation platform by MATLAB Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) is established using the Stateflow technique, and multiple ZY-UAV-680 quadrotor UAVs are employed to carry out the actual flight tests. Finally, simulations and actual flight tests are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the autonomous optimal task assignment and decision-making method. The final results show that: the proposed method can divide multiple UAVs reasonably to several blocks; the time differences between the simulation test and real flight test are only 39.8 sec and 20.6 sec, and accounts for 6.6% and 3.9% of the spraying time spent on real flight test by three cooperative quadrotors, respectively; the optimal scheme can save 60.8 sec and 80.0 sec in the simulation tests and the real flight tests, which accounts for 10.8% and 13.2% of the time spent on average scheme, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the simulation results can match the real flight test results quite well regardless of average scheme or optimal scheme, and the optimal scheme is more efficient and timesaving than the average scheme.

AB A model used for velocity control during car following is proposed based on reinforcement learning (RL). To optimize driving performance, a reward function is developed by referencing human driving data and combining driving features related to safety, efficiency, and comfort. With the developed reward function, the RL agent learns to control vehicle speed in a fashion that maximizes cumulative rewards, through trials and errors in the simulation environment. To avoid potential unsafe actions, the proposed RL model is incorporated with a collision avoidance strategy for safety checks. The safety check strategy is used during both model training and testing phases, which results in faster convergence and zero collisions. A total of 1,341 car-following events extracted from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset are used to train and test the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by the comparison with empirical NGSIM data and with adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithm implemented through model predictive control (MPC). The experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrates the capability of safe, efficient, and comfortable velocity control and outperforms human drivers in that it 1) has larger TTC values than those of human drivers, 2) can maintain efficient and safe headways around 1.2s, and 3) can follow the lead vehicle comfortably with smooth acceleration (jerk value is only a third of that of human drivers). Compared with the MPC-based ACC algorithm, the proposed model has better performance in terms of safety, comfort, and especially running speed during testing (more than 200 times faster). The results indicate that the proposed approach could contribute to the development of better autonomous driving systems.

AB An Autonomous Microbial Sampler (AMS) is described that will obtain uncontaminated and exogenous DNA-free microbial samples from most marine, freshwater and hydrothermal ecosystems. Sampling with the AMS may be conducted using manned submersibles, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), or when tethered to a hydrowire during hydrocast operations on research vessels. The modular device consists of a titanium nozzle for sampling in potentially hot environments (> 350 degrees C) and fluid-handling components for the collection of six independent filtered or unfiltered samples. An onboard microcomputer permits sampling to be controlled by the investigator, by external devices (e.g., AUV computer), or by internal programming. Temperature, volume pumped and other parameters are recorded during sampling. Complete protection of samples from microbial contamination was observed in tests simulating deployment of the AMS in coastal seawater, where the sampling nozzle was exposed to seawater containing 1 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) of a red pigmented tracer organism, Serratia marinorubra. Field testing of the AMS at a hydrothermal vent field was successfully undertaken in 2000. Results of DNA destruction studies have revealed that exposure of samples of the Eukaryote Euglena and the bacterium S. marinorubra to 0.5 N sulfuric acid at 23 degrees C for 1 h was sufficient to remove polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifiable DNA. Studies assessing the suitability of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilizing and DNA-destroying agent showed that 20% or 30% hydrogen peroxide sterilized samples of Serratia in 1 h and destroyed the DNA of Serratia in 3 h, but not 1 or 2 h. DNA AWAY (TM) killed Serratia and destroyed the DNA of both Serratia and the vent microbe (GB-D) of the genus Pyrococcus in 1 h. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FUTURE
AB Objective To understand which users' characteristics influence their preferences in the selection of vehicle seating configurations and positions across different traveling scenarios involving a fully automated vehicle (FAV). Methods Participants (n = 730) completed an online survey in which they were asked to imagine traveling in a FAV across three hypothetical scenarios. Participants were asked to select between five different seating configurations and four positions for each scenario and about their anthropometry and their driving/riding experience. Multinomial regression analyses were conducted to identify the factors that influenced users' preferences. Results FAV Configuration #3 (traditional light vehicle seating configuration) was the preferred seating configuration for 74% of the participants, followed by FAV #2 (in which the two seating rows face each other, 13%) in Scenario 1 (riding by oneself). Similar numbers were observed in Scenario 3 (riding with an unknown person). In Scenario 2 (riding with their partner), participants preferred FAV #2 (12.5%) and FAV #5 (in which the front seat passengers point toward a common point in the front, conventional rear seat configuration, 17.5%). Having close family was significant to choose the traditional vehicle configuration over other vehicle configurations, but only when the participants were driving by themselves. Having previously experienced motion sickness was significant to prefer a forward seating configuration when the trip was shared with partners. Belonging to a particular height or weight group was significantly associated with the preferred seat within the preferred FAV configuration (the driver's position in FAV #3; a rear-facing seat in FAV #2), although there was not a clear trend between increasing weight and/or height and preferring one seating position over the others. Conclusions Previous work had shown differences in participants' preferences for seating configurations and positions depending on age, sex and country. While increasing the sample size, the current study analyses other factors that were associated with choosing one vehicle configuration and seating position over others. As these factors are directly related to the likelihood of sustaining injuries in the event of a crash, the current study provides important insights regarding the potential risk factors for FAV occupants.

AB The services of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and the ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) enabled by 5G new radio (NR) are considered as the essential prerequisites of the future intelligent transportation systems. Particularly, the eMBB service is designed to provide extremely high data rate for content delivery and thereby can significantly enhance the quality of experience (QoE) of the bandwidth-hungry in-vehicle entertainment applications. On the other hand, the URLLC is designed to tackle the stringent requirements on the latency and reliability of the critical packets transmissions, and thereby can facilitate the autonomous driving of the connected vehicles. In this paper, under the scenario of a one-way highway vehicular network, we address the issue of joint resource allocations of the eMBB and URLLC traffics for the enhancement of the network performance. The eMBB traffic is assumed to be full-buffered and scheduled at the boundary of each time slot for multimedia transmissions. During each eMBB transmission interval, random arrivals of URLLC traffics are assumed. To satisfy the latency constraint of the URLLC transmissions, the eMBB time slot is divided into minislots and the newly arrived URLLC traffic is promptly scheduled in the next minislot by puncturing the on-going eMBB traffics. Further, to guarantee the reliability of the URLLC traffic, guard zones are deployed around the vehicle receivers as protections and the eMBB transmissions inside the guard zones are prohibited. Under this context, we first derive the transmission probability of the RSU nodes. Then, based on the obtained results, we capture association probabilities of the vehicle receivers for URLLC and eMBB traffics, respectively. Finally, the coverage performance of the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links and the rate coverage performance of the vehicle-toinfrastructure (V2I) links are analyzed.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; FRAMEWORK; NETWORKS
AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have made remarkable developments and are anticipated to replace human drivers. In transitioning from human-driven vehicles to fully AVs, one crucial task is to predict the trajectories of the subject vehicle and its surrounding vehicles in real time. Most existing methods of vehicle trajectory prediction on highways are based on physical models or purely data-driven models. However, they either yield unsatisfactory prediction performance or lack model interpretability and physical implications. This paper proposes a Physics-Informed Deep Learning framework that fully leverages the advantages of data-driven and physics-based models to go beyond the existing models. We use the Transformer neural network architecture with self-attention as Physics-Uninformed Neural Network (PUNN) and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as physical model to construct of Physics-Informed Transformer-Intelligent Driver Model (PIT-IDM). Extensive experiments have been conducted on two datasets with different traffic environments, i.e., Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) data in the US and the Ubiquitous Traffic Eyes (UTE) data in China, to verify model accuracy and efficiency. Compared with the three kinds of baselines by relative and absolute measures of effectiveness, the best performing PIT-IDM reduces longitudinal trajectory prediction errors for long horizons by 5%-50%, some even reduced up to 70%. Extensive empirical analyses have been carried out to verify its excellent spatio-temporal transferability and explore the physics-informed mechanism underlying this deep learning method. The training and inference time analysis indicates that although it takes longer to train PIT-IDM, it requires fewer calls and accumulates fewer errors with less computation time in real-world applications. The overall results further validate the efficacy of this PhysicsInformed Deep Learning framework in enhancing model accuracy, interpretability, and transferability.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB As the planetary exploration programme matures, the objectives for robotic missions become more complex, and place greater demands upon the reliability and robustness of the autonomous systems created for these tasks. Consequently, a situation has arisen where the design of mechanical architectures may be insufficiently flexible to take advantage of the latest developments in control techniques. In particular, mechanical systems with sufficient functionality to tackle advanced autonomous operations, frequently exhibit inadequate robustness in the face of inevitable system faults to meet the requisite mission goals. This paper considers ways in which the kinematic structure of planetary exploration vehicles can be partly characterised using Graph Theory techniques. These include interchange graphs, their spanning trees, and their fundamental cycles and cutsets; adjacency matrices; degree sequences, and characteristic polynomials. It goes on to assess how such a characterisation may be used to define those kinematic features which make for successful, robust systems, well fitted to the complex mission goals required. Consideration is given to whether theoretical kinematic classification could provide a worthwhile building block in the development of novel design tools for future autonomous system development. A valid methodology for analysing and representing system characteristics is derived and discussed, and potential for further enhancement of the approach is identified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB To lessen the spread of COVID-19 and other dangerous bacteria and viruses, contactless distribution of different items has gained widespread popularity. In order to complete delivery tasks at a catering facility, this paper explores the development of an autonomous mobile robot. The robot, in particular, plans its path and maintains smooth and flexible mobility using a Time Elastic Band (TEB) motion control method and an upgraded Dijkstra algorithm. On the open-source AI platform of iFLYTEK, a voice recognition module was trained to recognize voice signals of different tones and loudness, and an image recognition capability was attained using YOLOv4 and SIFT. The UCAR intelligent vehicle platform, made available by iFLYTEK, served as the foundation for the development of the mobile robot system. The robot took part in China's 16th National University Student Intelligent Car Race, an experimental demonstration test of the developed mobile robotics. The results of the experiments and task tests demonstrated that the proposed robot architecture was workable. In addition, we designed and put together a mobile robot utilizing components from the Taobao website. Compared to UCAR, this robot is less expensive and has the flexibility to be used in a variety of real-world settings.

AB Motivated by real-world applications of unmanned aerial vehicles, this paper introduces a decentralized control mechanism to guide steering control of autonomous agents manoeuvring in the vicinity of multiple moving entities (e.g. other autonomous agents) and stationary entities (e.g. fixed beacons or points of reference) in a three-dimensional environment. The proposed control law, which can be perceived as a modification of the three-dimensional constant bearing (CB) pursuit law, provides a means to allocate simultaneous attention to multiple entities. We investigate the behaviour of the closed-loop dynamics for a system with one agent referencing two beacons, as well as a two-agent mutual pursuit system wherein each agent employs the beacon-referenced CB pursuit law with regards to the other agent and a stationary beacon. Under certain assumptions on the associated control parameters, we demonstrate that this problem admits circling equilibria with agents moving on circular orbits with a common radius, in planes perpendicular to a common axis passing through the beacons. As the common radius and distances from the beacon are determined by the choice of parameters in the pursuit law, this approach provides a means to engineer desired formations in a three-dimensional setting.

AB In-motion alignment of strapdown inertial navigation systems (SINS) without any geodetic-frame observations is one of the toughest challenges for autonomous vehicles. Considering the characteristics of SINS, this paper presents a dual-model-based in-motion alignment method for the odometer-aided SINS. Two inertial navigation calculation loops are established for an inertial measurement unit (IMU), one of which executes the in-motion gyrocompass horizontal alignment algorithm to decompose the body velocity measured by odometer to navigation frame and attenuate the disturbance. And the other is the attitude determination-based alignment loop, where the vector observation-based SINS alignment is executed. The contributions of the work presented here are twofold. First, the dual-model initial alignment (DMIA) algorithm for SINS is proposed, which introduces the idea of constructing multiple calculation loops for an IMU to maximize the advantages of SINS. Second, depending on the body-frame speed-aided attitude determination and navigation-frame speed-aided attitude determination, the body-frame velocity observation with disturbance is accurately decomposed to navigation frame with the noise attenuated by gyrocompass horizontal alignment. The experimental results show that the proposed DMIA algorithm can achieve a rapid and accurate in-motion alignment.

AB In response to the low-carbon development strategy, the new energy vehicle has become one crucial and recognized tool to satisfy the emission reduction requirements, the representative advance of the new energy vehicle is its intelligent drive technique. This paper introduces the driver's subjective guidance to further improve the intelligent drive technique. To do this, the hesitant convolutional neural networks (HCNN) are proposed to deal with the above issue, in which the hesitant fuzzy set is used to fully describe the subjective guidance information. Thus, the different driver's personalized needs can be considered and fused into the intelligent drive algorithm to achieve the intelligent drive technique of new energy vehicles. Note that the innovation and difference of the proposed method are the subjective guidance fusion and its generalized presentation but not the intelligent drive calculation. After that, the data downward partition model and weight secondary matching calculation are developed based on the HCNN to fully describe and process the hesitant fuzzy subjective guidance information. Furthermore, the intelligent drive algorithm considering the driver's subjective guidance is provided according to the above methods. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the given drive scenario. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Shared automated vehicles (SAVs) have the potential to promote transit ridership by providing efficient first-mile last-mile (FMLM) connections through reduced operational costs to fleet providers and lower out-of-pocket costs to riders. To help plan for a future of integrated mobility, this paper investigates the impacts of SAVs serving FMLM connections, as a mode that provides flexibility in access/egress decisions and is well coordinated with train station schedules. To achieve this objective, a novel dynamic pooling algorithm was introduced to match SAVs with riders while coordinating the riders' arrival times at the light-rail station to a known train schedule. Microsimulations of SAVs and travelers throughout two central Austin neighborhoods show how larger service areas, higher levels of SAV demand, and longer arrival times between successive trains require larger SAV fleet sizes and higher SAV utilization rates to deliver close traveler wait times. Four-person SAVs appear to perform similar to 6-seat SAVs but will cost less to provide. Using a dynamic pooling algorithm tightly coordinated with train arrivals (every 15 min) delivers 87% of travelers to their stations in time to catch the next train, while uncoordinated assignments deliver just 58% of travelers in time.

AB Formation control and cooperative motion planning are two major research areas currently being used in multi robot motion planning and coordination. The current study proposes a hybrid framework for guidance and navigation of swarm of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) by combining the key characteristics of formation control and cooperative motion planning. In this framework, two layers of offline planning and online planning are integrated and applied on a practical marine environment. In offline planning, an optimal path is generated from a constrained A* path planning approach, which is later smoothed using a spline. This optimal trajectory is fed as an input for the online planning where virtual target (VT) based multi-agent guidance framework is used to navigate the swarm of USVs. This VT approach combined with a potential theory based swarm aggregation technique provides a robust methodology of global and local collision avoidance based on known positions of the USVs. The combined approach is evaluated with the different number of USVs to understand the effectiveness of the approach from the perspective of practicality, safety and robustness.

AB While automated vehicle (AV) development continues to progress rapidly, how the public will accept and adopt automated vehicles remains an open question. Using extensive survey data, we apply cluster analysis to better understand consumer perceptions toward potential benefits and concerns related to AVs with regard to factors influencing their AV adoption likelihood. Four market segments are identified - 'benefits-dominated,' 'concerns-dominated,' 'uncertain,' and 'well-informed.' A random parameters multinomial logit model is then estimated to identify factors influencing the probability of respondents belonging to one of these four market segments. Among other influences (such as socio-economic and current travel characteristics), it is found that 'Millennials' have a higher probability of belonging to the well-informed market segment, 'Gen-Xers' with a lower probability to the uncertain market segment, and 'Baby Boomers' with a higher probability to the concerns-dominated market (relative to the 'Great Generation'). We also study the individuals' expressed likelihood of AV adoption using separate random parameters ordered probit estimations for each of the four market segments. The substantial and statistically significant differences across each AV consumer market segment underscore the potentially large impact that different consumer demographics may have on AV adoption and the need for targeted marketing to achieve better market-penetration outcomes.

AB In order to trace the research trends and hotspots related to the field of driver behavior research both in China and worldwide, a bibliometric analysis was performed to systematically analyze 7208 scientific papers about driver behavior in the Web of Science database from 1957 to 2018, and the results were discussed from the 6 perspectives of growth trends of publications, geographical distribution, subject categories, institutions, authors and keywords distribution. The results show that research on driver behavior has been increasing rapidly since the 1990 s, but research in Europe and the United States started more than 20 years earlier than in China. Currently, transportation, engineering, computer science and behavioral science have replaced the traditional subject categories, becoming the most important domains in this field. Research on driver behavior focuses on safety and systems using simulation models which is interacted with almost everything concerning traffic operation and safety. The current trend is that more researchers are working on understand the driver-vehicle-system interactions under the environment of connected and autonomous vehicle. Further research is needed to focus on unsafe driving behavior based on driver-vehicle-system interactions. This study will provide scholars in related academia and industry with panoramic knowledge of driver behavior research, as well as research hotspots and future research directions.

TI Role of context in determining transfer of risk knowledge in roundabouts
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS

DT Article

   intelligence; Knowledge transfers
AB The ability to predict the risk patterns of vehicles in a roundabout shows potential to improve the safety and efficiency of roundabout crossings by connected vehicles. Namely, exit patterns are relevant for vehicles seeking to enter a roundabout in the presence of incoming vehicles. Entering vehicles may take educated decisions on whether to enter the roundabout based on the likelihood of the incoming vehicles not to exit and cause a merging conflict. In previous work, a machine learning model was trained to assess the probability of a vehicle to exit a roundabout based on its observed position relatively to the next exit. Yet, the transferability of the knowledge of exit probability models was not investigated, i.e., whether the knowledge of an existing exit probability model can be accurately transferred in unseen roundabouts, both for model usage and training. In this paper, we compute a metric of similarity of exit probability models trained from eight real roundabouts. In turn, we identify the contextual features of two roundabouts which impact the similarity of their resulting exit probability models, and define three levels of context similarity, i.e., strict, moderate, and low. Lastly, significant accuracy improvements are obtained by constraining the knowledge transfer of exit probability models to roundabouts which feature a similar context. On the one hand, applying exit probability models on distinct roundabouts with a moderately similar context yielded an average accuracy of 80.4 +/- 4.6%, which is equivalent to the most accurate non-similar models.

AB The rapid development of intelligent and connected technologies is conducive to the efficient energy utilization of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). However, most energy management strategies (EMSs) with optimized, intelligent, and connected functions have not been directly applied to such vehicles because existing technical conditions cannot meet the theoretical requirements of complex EMSs. Therefore, based on the mapping rela-tionship between the information decision-making ability and the energy management effect, this study is the first to propose four development stages of HEV energy management practical application as follows: energy management based on instantaneous driving cycles (Stage 1 or S1); energy management based on forward driving cycle prediction (Stage 2 or S2); energy management based on global driving cycle prediction (Stage 3 or S3); and energy management based on autonomous velocity planning (Stage 4 or S4). The key technologies of each development stage are not independent, i.e., they complement each other in the process of practical application development. Furthermore, realizing energy management practical applications not only requires novel algorithm models but also involves several challenges such as acquiring and processing multi-source in-formation, predicting the vehicle power demand in the spatial-temporal domain during travel, and determining the vehicle control characteristics and ability. Finally, according to the development goals of energy manage-ment, this study proposes an implementation framework for HEV energy management in higher development stages, namely cooperative vehicle-edge-cloud for intelligent energy management, i.e., CVEC-IEM, which ex-ecutes information decision tasks on different computing platforms and realizes interconnection and interaction to provide development directions and goals for the efficient utilization of energy and successful deployment of HEV practical applications.

ID DISTRESS DETECTION
AB The pavement surface will inevitably develop cracks, subsidence, pits, ruts, and other defects due to the effects of traffic and the environment. In road engineering, vibration-based pavement condition monitoring has been widely adopted. Due to differences in vehicle dynamics, acquisition equipment, and road quality, the application of these techniques to the identification of minor pavement damage is limited. With the widespread adoption of the inertial navigation system (INS) in autonomous vehicles, INS-based pavement evaluation has emerged as a promising new technique. In this paper, the acceleration sensor, gyroscope, GPS, and other INS-integrated devices were used to collect data on vehicle attitude changes. For the detection of pavement apparent millimetre disease, a new method utilising INS data and machine learning was proposed. The method analyses the original vibration signal in time domain, determines the degree of sensing parameter influence, and extracts the index that can characterise the signal change. Multiple machine learning recognition models have been built to effectively classify road conditions, with the best-performing model achieving an F1 score of 99.61% and precision of 99.33%. The recall rate, accuracy rate, and F1 score of disease height classification were all above 0.7 on a macro and micro scale.

AB With the global energy crisis, increasing demand, and a national-level emphasis on electric vehicles (EVs), numerous innovations are being witnessed throughout the EV industry. EVs are equipped with sensors that maintain a sustainable environment for the betterment of society and enhance human sustainability. However, at the same time, as is the case for any new digital technology, they are susceptible to threats to security and privacy. Recent incidents demonstrate that these sensors have been misused for car and energy theft, financial fraud, data compromise, and have caused severe health and safety problems, amongst other things. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides a first systematic analysis of EV sustainability, digital technologies that enhance sustainability, their potential cybersecurity threats, and corresponding defense. Firstly, three robust taxonomies have been presented to identify the dangers that can affect long-term sustainability domains, including (1) life and well-being, (2) safe environment, and (3) innovation and development. Second, this research measures the impact of cybersecurity threats on EVs and correspondingly to their sustainability goals. Third, it details the extent to which specific security controls can mitigate these threats, thereby allowing for a smooth transition toward secure and sustainable future smart cities.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are a hot topic for safe mobility, which inevitably requires sensors to achieve autonomy, but relying too heavily on sensors will be a risk factor. A high-definition map (HD map) reduces the risk by giving geographical information if it covers dynamic information from moving entities on the road. Cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) are a prominent approach to solving the issue and local dynamic maps (LDMs) are expected to realize the ideal C-ITS. An actual LDM implementation requires a fine database design to be able to update the information to represent potential risks based on future interactions of vehicles. In the present study, we proposed an advanced method for embedding the geographical future occupancy of vehicles into the database by using a binary decision diagram (BDD). In our method, the geographical future occupancy of vehicles was formulated with Kamm's circle. In computer experiments, sharing BDD-based occupancy data was successfully demonstrated in the ROS-based simulator with the linked list-based BDD. Algebraic operations in exchanged BDDs effectively managed future interactions such as data insertion and timing of collision avoidance in the LDM. This result opened a new door for the realization of the ideal LDM for safety in AVs.

AB To ensure that a work-class remotely operated vehicle (ROV) has the ability to complete trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties, this paper proposes a double-loop sliding mode controller (DSMC) that replaces the conventional switching term with a novel switching term. The inverse tangent function is proposed as a novel switching term for conventional sliding mode controller (CSMC), and the simulation proves that this function can effectively reduce the chattering phenomenon of the CSMC. To further reduce the occurrence of chattering, this paper proposes applying the DSMC to work-class ROV trajectory tracking. The singular perturbation theory and the variable change speed concept illustrate how to divide the cascaded system into two subsystems: the inner-loop control system (velocity loop) and outer-loop control system (position loop). The stability of the full closed-loop cascaded system is proven. Simulation results compare the expected performances of the proposed DSMC with the performance of the CSMC and fuzzy SMC. In the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties and considering the sensor measurement noise, the DSMC errors converge to a small neighbourhood of zero. The chattering of the DSMC is also obviously reduced compared with that of the CSMC.

AB This paper presents a decision-making framework for automated driving in highway environments. The framework is capable of reliably, robustly assessing a given highway situation (with respect to the possibility of collision) and of automatically determining an appropriate maneuver for the situation. It consists of two main components: situation assessment and strategy decision. The situation assessment component utilizes multiple complementary "threat measures" and Bayesian networks in its calculations of "threat levels" at the car and lane level to evaluate the possibility of collisions for a given highway traffic situation. The strategy decision component, designed to generate goal-directed and collision-free behaviors, automatically determines an appropriate maneuver in a given highway situation via a hierarchical state machine-such a machine both reduces the complexity of and extends a strategy model. The types of maneuver determined by the component include both simple maneuvers, such as slowing down to avoid collision with a vehicle in front, and complex maneuvers, such as lane changes and overtaking. The presented decision-making framework is tested and evaluated-both on a closed high-speed test track in simulated traffic with various driving scenarios and on public highways in real traffic through in-vehicle testing-to verify that it can provide sufficiently reliable performance for automated driving in highway environments in terms of safety, reliability, and robustness.

AB Thanks to their road safety potential, automated vehicles are rapidly becoming a reality. In the last decade, automated driving has been the focus of intensive automotive engineering research, with the support of industry and governmental organisations. In automated driving systems, the path tracking layer defines the actuator commands to follow the reference path and speed profile. Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used for trajectory tracking because of its capability of managing multi-variable problems, and systematically considering constraints on states and control actions, as well as accounting for the expected future behaviour of the system. Despite the very large number of publications of the last few years, the literature lacks a comprehensive and updated survey on MPC for path tracking. To cover the gap, this literature review deals with the research conducted from 2015 until 2021 on model predictive path tracking control. Firstly, the survey highlights the significance of MPC in the recent path tracking control literature, with respect to alternative control structures. After classifying the different typologies of MPC for path tracking control, the adopted prediction models are critically analysed, together with typical optimal control problem formulations. This is followed by a summary of the most relevant results, which provides practical design indications, e.g., in terms of selection of prediction and control horizons. Finally, the most recent development trends are analysed, together with likely areas of further investigations, and the main conclusions are drawn.

ID DYNAMICS
AB The well-known single-track linearized model for four-wheel-steering vehicle dynamics is used to design a second-order dynamic decoupling controller. Yaw rate and lateral speed are the outputs to be decoupled, while the rear steering angle and an additive steering angle with respect to the driver command are the control inputs. It is shown that the lateral speed dynamics and the yaw rate dynamics can be decoupled by feeding back longitudinal speed, yaw rate, and lateral acceleration measurements, while the effect of sensor disturbances on yaw rate is attenuated. Lateral speed measurements or observers are not required. The yaw rate controlled dynamics are independent from lateral speed and are described by a third-order input-output model, depending on the driver steering wheel command and sensor disturbances; the lateral speed dynamics are autonomous and tend exponentially to zero with a vehicle-dependent time constant while the lateral acceleration tends to be proportional to the yaw rate. The nonlinear analysis on a single-track model shows the suppression of the unstable equilibrium points of the uncontrolled system, the generation of new stable equilibrium points as the critical driver step input increases, and the enlargement of the stability regions. Simulations of typical maneuvers and disturbances on a nonlinear third-order single-track model and on a higher order model provided by CarSim show robustness with respect to unmodeled dynamics, vehicle parameter uncertainty, and sensor disturbances; moreover, significant dynamic decoupling, larger bandwidth, overshoot suppression, and improved maneuverability even at high speed are confirmed.

AB Drivers occasionally need to resume vehicle control when an automated driving system (ADS) cannot handle a situation. However, a lack of driver readiness can prevent a smooth transition. For example, in an obstacle avoidance situation, a method to transfer the vehicle control based on the driver's input of the steering angle can be adopted where rapid steering operation by the driver is required immediately after resuming control. It was observed from the previous studies based on a fixed-based driving simulator that the discontinuity in control due to a sudden disengagement of the control torque of the ADS resulted in steering instability. In addition, the previous studies had proposed a shared mode, in which haptic shared control (HSC) was placed between the automated and manual driving. It was demonstrated that steering stability could be improved through the shared mode. However, in the previous studies, the observation of steering instability and verification of HSC effectiveness of the shared mode were limited to fixed-based driving simulator experiments, in which there was no vehicle motion. In addition, for practical applications, a method using a torque sensor in the previous method is expected to be replaced by a more robust method, because it may introduce noise and the use of a lowpass filter leads to some time lag. Therefore, in this study, we developed a new control transition method that uses only the steering angle. We conducted experiments using a real car, in which the participants were instructed to resume steering control from the automated driving mode. The results demonstrate that the discontinuity in control during the control transition deteriorates the steering stability and vehicle motion, and the shared mode can improve them.

AB As important services of the future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, vehicular communication and mobile edge computing (MEC) have received considerable interest in recent years for their significant potential applications in intelligent transportation systems. However, MEC-enabled vehicular networks depend heavily on network access and communication infrastructure, often unavailable in remote areas, making computation offloading susceptible to breaking down. To address this issue, we propose an MEC-enabled vehicular network assisted through aerial-terrestrial connectivity to provide network access and high data-rate entertainment services to a vehicular network. We present a time-varying, dynamic system model where high altitude platforms (HAPs) equipped with MEC servers, connected to a backhaul system of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites, are used to provide computation offloading capability to the vehicles, as well as to provide network access for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Our main objective is to minimize the total computation and communication overhead of the joint computation offloading and resource allocation strategies for the system of vehicles. Since our formulated optimization problem is a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which is NP-hard, we propose a decentralized value-iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach as a solution. In our Q-learning-assisted analysis, each vehicle acts as an intelligent agent to form optimal strategies for offloading and resource allocation. We further extend our solution to deep Q-learning (DQL) and double deep Q-learning to overcome the issues of dimensionality and the over-estimation of the value functions, as in Q-learning. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of our solution in successfully reducing system costs compared to baseline schemes.

ID ROLLOVER PREVENTION; POLICY
AB Electric-vehicle technology is an emerging area offering several benefits such as economy due to low running costs. Electric vehicles can also help to significantly reduce CO2 emission, which is a vital factor for environmental pollution. Modern vehicles are equipped with driver-assistance systems that facilitate drivers by offloading some of the tasks a driver does while driving. Human beings are prone to errors. Therefore, accidents and fatalities can happen if the driver fails to perform a particular task within the deadline. In electric vehicles, the focus has always been to optimize the power and battery life, and thus, any additional hardware can affect their battery life significantly. In this paper, the design of driver-assistance systems has been introduced to automate and assist in some of the vital tasks, such as a braking system, in an optimized manner. We revamp the idea of the traditional driver-assistance system and propose a generic lightweight system based on the leading factors and their impact on accidents. We model tasks for these factors and simulate a low-cost driver-assistance system in a real-time context, where these scenarios are investigated and tasks schedulability is formally proved before deploying them in electric vehicles. The proposed driver-assistance system offers many advantages. It decreases the risk of accidents and monitors the safety of driving. If, at some point, the risk index is above a certain threshold, an automated control algorithm is triggered to reduce it by activating different actuators. At the same time, it is lightweight and does not require any dedicated hardware, which in turn has a significant advantage in terms of battery life. Results show that the proposed system not only is accurate but also has a very negligible effect on energy consumption and battery life.

AB Current vehicles include electronic features that provide ease and convenience to drivers. These electronic features or nodes rely on in-vehicle communication protocols to ensure functionality. One of the most-widely adopted in-vehicle protocols on the market today is the Controller Area Network, popularly referred to as the CAN bus. The CAN bus is utilized in various modern, sophisticated vehicles. However, as the sophistication levels of vehicles continue to increase, we now see a high rise in attacks against them. These attacks range from simple to more-complex variants, which could have detrimental effects when carried out successfully. Therefore, there is a need to carry out an assessment of the security vulnerabilities that could be exploited within the CAN bus. In this research, we conducted a security vulnerability analysis on the CAN bus protocol by proposing an attack scenario on a CAN bus simulation that exploits the arbitration feature extensively. This feature determines which message is sent via the bus in the event that two or more nodes attempt to send a message at the same time. It achieves this by prioritizing messages with lower identifiers. Our analysis revealed that an attacker can spoof a message ID to gain high priority, continuously injecting messages with the spoofed ID. As a result, this prevents the transmission of legitimate messages, impacting the vehicle's operations. We identified significant risks in the CAN protocol, including spoofing, injection, and Denial of Service. Furthermore, we examined the latency of the CAN-enabled system under attack, finding that the compromised node (the attacker's device) consistently achieved the lowest latency due to message arbitration. This demonstrates the potential for an attacker to take control of the bus, injecting messages without contention, thereby disrupting the normal operations of the vehicle, which could potentially compromise safety.

AB A model predictive control (MPC) approach based on direct yaw moment control (DYC) was proposed to realize the self-steering drive for a newly autonomous four-wheel independent-drive (4WID) agricultural electric vehicle. The front axle and rear axle of the vehicle chassis could rotate simultaneously around their respective center points and cut the turning radius in half at most through specific mechanical chassis structure design and four-wheel electrical drive. It had great potential to reduce wheel traffic damage to field crops if two rear electrical drive wheels can be controlled to follow wheel tracks of two front wheels during self-steering operation. Therefore, firstly, a two-degree-freedom dynamics model presenting this agricultural electric vehicle was constructed. Then, an MPC controller combined with DYC was applied to arrange torques from four wheels to match desired turning angles, direct yaw moments and travel speeds. The simulation results existed small steady error of steering angles below 0.22% as they were set at 5 degrees, followed with yaw moment under 0.17% and velocity less than 1%. Finally, according to experiment results, the vehicle successfully made a working turning radius of 9.1 m with maximum error of 0.55% when desired steering angles were 5 degrees at the speed of 1 m/s and a minimum turning radius of 1.51 m with maximum error of 6.6% when steering angles were 30 degrees at the speed of 0.5 m/s. It verified that the 4WID agricultural electric vehicle could drive autonomously and steady with small self-steering angle error under the proposed control system and has a feasibility to reduce wheel traffic damage during driving and operation.

AB This paper investigates the problem of a nonlinear platoon controller design for a group of autonomous tractor-trailers with limited communication ranges in order to increase the load transportation capacity. The main control objective is to force each consecutive pair of tractor-trailers to follow each other in a convoy-like formation based on their posture and velocity measurements in the presence of unmodelled dynamics and external disturbances. The prescribed performance strategy is effectively applied to the relative range and angle between each successive pair in the group to preserve their connectivity without any possible collision by defining some preassigned performance characteristics on the transient and steady-state responses. A high-gain observer, an adaptive robust controller and a three-layer neural network are heuristically utilised to develop an efficient robust output-feedback platoon controller as well. The stability of the entire state-feedback and output-feedback control system is investigated by the Lyapunov stability method and some numerical simulations are presented to validate the controller efficiency in an autonomous transportation application.

AB Autonomous driving vehicle is a kind of unmanned vehicle on the ground. Navigation and positioning technology is becoming an indispensable part of practical applications, especially in intelligent transportation systems and military fields. In this study, multisource information fusion technology plays a necessary role in enhancing the quality and reliability of navigation and positioning. In the actual complex environment, the accuracy requirements of vehicle navigation and positioning in the case of nonlinear systems and non-Gaussian distribution are fully considered. In this article, a new adaptive sharing factor integrated navigation information fusion technology scheme is designed. From a geometric point of view, the VDM is studied, and new VDM observation information that fully considers the turning process of the vehicle is established. It combines strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and VDM multisource sensors, and a VDM and GNSS measurement model based on nonintegrity constraints is developed. The performance of the local filter is adaptively reflected by the F-norm adaptive information sharing factor algorithm established based on the variance. At the same time, the development process of a federated filter fault diagnosis algorithm based on unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is reported, which has fault diagnosis and information recovery functions. The independent characteristics of the subfilters are considered, and a fault-tolerant mechanism for state chi-square detection is established. Both GNSS and VDM are used as observation sources to improve the accuracy of low-cost SINS. This strategy is implemented on the basis of Carsim professional vehicle dynamics software. The evaluation test indicated that the algorithm has high navigation accuracy, high fault tolerance, and guaranteed system reliability, which is verified in this article.

ID AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING; TECHNOLOGIES; AVOIDANCE; SYSTEMS
AB Objective: To evaluate the effects of lane departure warning (LDW) on single-vehicle, sideswipe, and head-on crashes. Method: Police-reported data for the relevant crash types were obtained from 25 U.S. states for the years 2009-2015. Observed counts of crashes with fatalities, injuries, and of all severities for vehicles with LDW were compared with expected counts based on crash involvement rates for the same passenger vehicles without LDW, with exposure by vehicle series, model year, and lighting system standardized between groups. For relevant crashes of all seventies and those with injuries, Poisson regression was used to estimate the benefits of LDW while also controlling for demographic variables; fatal crashes were too infrequent to be modeled. Results: Without accounting for driver demographics, vehicles with LDW had significantly lower involvement rates in crashes of all seventies (18%), in those with injuries (24%), and in those with fatalities (86%). Adding controls for driver demographics in the Poisson regression reduced the estimated benefit of LDW only modestly in crashes of all seventies (11%, p < 0.05) and in crashes with injuries (21%, p < 0.07). Conclusions: Lane departure warning is preventing the crash types it is designed to address, even after controlling for driver demographics. Results suggest that thousands of lives each year could be saved if every passenger vehicle in the United States were equipped with a lane departure warning system that performed like the study systems. Practical applications: Purchase of LDW should be encouraged, and, because drivers do not always keep the systems turned on, future efforts should focus on designing systems to encourage greater use and educating consumers about the benefits of using the systems.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) classification and identification have many applications in a variety of fields, including UAV tracking systems, antidrone systems, intrusion detection systems, military, space research, product delivery, agriculture, search and rescue, and internet carrier. It is challenging to identify a specific drone and/or type in critical scenarios, such as intrusion. In this article, a UAV classification method that utilizes fixed boundary empirical wavelet sub-bands of radio frequency (RF) fingerprints and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. In the proposed method, RF fingerprints collected from UAV receivers are decomposed into 16 fixed boundary empirical wavelet sub-band signals. Then, these sub-band signals are then fed into a lightweight deep CNN model to classify various types of UAVs. Using the proposed method, we classify a total of 15 different commercially available UAVs with an average testing accuracy of 97.25%. The proposed model is also tested with various sampling points in the signal. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared with recently reported works for classifying UAVs utilizing remote controller RF signals.

AB Wildfires represent a significant natural risk causing economic losses, human death and environmental damage. In recent years, the world has seen an increase in fire intensity and frequency. Research has been conducted towards the development of dedicated solutions for wildland fire assistance and fighting. Systems were proposed for the remote detection and tracking of fires. These systems have shown improvements in the area of efficient data collection and fire characterization within small-scale environments. However, wildland fires cover large areas making some of the proposed ground-based systems unsuitable for optimal coverage. To tackle this limitation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) were proposed. UAVs have proven to be useful due to their maneuverability, allowing for the implementation of remote sensing, allocation strategies and task planning. They can provide a low-cost alternative for the prevention, detection and real-time support of firefighting. In this paper, previous works related to the use of UAV in wildland fires are reviewed. Onboard sensor instruments, fire perception algorithms and coordination strategies are considered. In addition, some of the recent frameworks proposing the use of both aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) for a more efficient wildland firefighting strategy at a larger scale are presented.

AB Car ownership is one of the key factors affecting travel behaviour and thus also essential in terms of sustainable mobility. This study examines car ownership and how people's willingness to own a car may change in the future, when considering the effects of public transport, Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and automated vehicles (AVs). Results of two citizen surveys conducted with representative samples (NAV-survey = 2036; NMaaS-survey = 1176) of Finns aged 18-64 are presented. The results show that 39% of respondents would not want or need to own a car if public transport connections were good enough, 58% if the described mobility service was available and 65% if all vehicles in traffic were automated. Hence, car ownership can decrease as a result of the implementation of AVs and MaaS, and higher public transport quality of service. Current mobility behaviour has a strong correlation to car ownership, as respondents who use public transport frequently feel less of a will or need to own a car than others. Generally, women and younger people feel less of a will or need to own a car, but factors such as educational level and residential location seem to have a relatively low effect.

AB Owing to the significantly installed capacity of solar energy during the past decades, the operation and maintenance of the large photovoltaic power station is a big challenge, as the manual inspection is labour-intensive and expensive. This Letter presents a solution for the intelligent inspection of the hotspot with the unmanned aerial vehicle in the large-scale photovoltaic plant. First, a traditional image processing method is presented to eliminate the noise and crop the infrared image, which can make the defected feature more obvious. Then, the module is extracted by the line segments detection. Finally, considering the great advance in the realm of the computer vision, a deep-learning-based method for automatic hotspot detection is proposed for locating the hotspot with the data augmentation. The deep-learning-based model can extract the hotspot feature by the training process in the data set. In the end, the performance of the method proposed is extensively evaluated and the numerical results prove the accuracy and precision of the model.

AB The development of automated vehicles continues unabated. The human factor challenges of designing safe automated driving systems are critical as the first several generations of automated vehicles are expected to be semi-autonomous, requiring frequent transfers of control between the driver and vehicle. Conditional automation raises particular concerns about drivers being out of the loop. A driving simulator study was performed with 20 participants to study driving with conditional automation. We observed driver performance and measured comfort as an indicator of the development of trust in the system. One scenario used a more capable automation system that was able to respond to most events by slowing or changing lanes on its own. The other scenario used a less capable automation system that issued takeover requests for all events. Participants drove both scenarios in counterbalanced order and experienced the different capabilities as changes in reliability. The automation would behave one way in the first work zone and a different way in the second. We observed three types of comfort profiles over the course of the drives. Several behavioral measures, notably gaze, showed effects of reliability variations. Trust calibrated during the first-driven scenario was seen to affect behavior during the second one, and this effect was more pronounced in the older age group, and most pronounced for women in that group.

AB Efficient path planning is a critical issue for the navigation of modem unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) characterized by a complex operating environment having dynamic obstacles with a spatially variable ocean current. The current work explores an A* approach with an USV enclosed by a circular boundary as a safety distance constraint on generation of optimal waypoints to resolve the problem of motion planning for an USV moving in a maritime environment. Unlike existing work on USV navigation using graph based methods, this study extends the implementation of the proposed A* approach in an environment cluttered with static and moving obstacles and different current intensities. The study also examines the effect of headwind and tailwind currents moving in clockwise and anti clockwise direction respectively of different intensities on optimal waypoints in a partially dynamic environment. The performance of the proposed approach is verified in simulations for different environmental conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is measured using two parameters, namely, path length and computational time as considered in other research works. The results show that the proposed approach is effective for global path planning of USVs.

AB Collision-avoidance algorithms for maritime autonomous surface vessels are increasingly being analyzed for challenging scenarios. However, the trade-off between the computation's effectiveness and efficiency is always an intractable problem, especially in complex, multi-object-encountering cases. This paper proposes an improved Hybrid A* algorithm that searches a node map with discrete control behaviors as 'movement options'. The real-time performance in maritime, multi-object-encountering scenarios is improved by narrowing the search space with the proposed pre-processing method, i.e., the collision velocity check (CVC). The following is incorporated within the mentioned approach: the compliance of the relevant rules in International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and the dynamics of the ship. A comparative study with various multi-target scenarios is conducted with a baseline method. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The use of the CVC significantly reduces the time of the computation with little reduction in the solution's accuracy. Additionally, the proposed method is applied within a real-time simulation environment, which is fed by logged data collected during an actual sea trial.

ID GUIDANCE
AB In recent years, Chinese Long March (LM) launchers have experienced several launch failures, most of which occurred in their propulsion systems, and this paper studies Autonomous Mission Reconstruction (AMRC) technology to alleviate losses due to these failures. The status of the techniques related to AMRC, including trajectory and mission planning, guidance methods, and fault tolerant technologies, are reviewed, and their features are compared, which reflect the challenges faced by AMRC technology. After a brief introduction about the failure modes of engines that can occur during flight, and the fundamentals of trajectory planning and joint optimization of the target orbit and flight path, an AMRC algorithm is proposed for geostationary transfer orbit launch missions. The algorithm evaluates the residual performance onboard, and plans new objectives and corresponding flight path by iterative guidance mode or segmented state triggered optimization methods in real-time. Three failure scenarios that have occurred during previous LM missions are simulated to check the robustness of the algorithm: imminent explosion risk of the boosters' engines, thrust drop during the first stage of flight, and being unable to start the engine during the second stage. The payloads would fall from space according to the current design under these conditions, but they were saved with the AMRC algorithm in the simulations, which allowed the rocket to get into the target orbit as intended or the payloads were deployed in other orbits without crashing. Although spaceflight can be very unforgiving, the AMRC algorithm has the potential to avoid the total loss of a launch mission when faced with these kinds of typical failures.(c) 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

AB Collaborative traffic-monitoring (CTM) systems exploit the location information continuously collected from vehicles. Location data are very sensitive information that made privacy a major obstacle for the widespread usage of CTM systems. The way how this data are generated and used is very important for users' privacy and data quality as well. Recently, two CTM approaches have been proposed, the first relies on a dedicated infrastructure that is called vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), and the second utilises the existing underlying infrastructure such as cellular and wireless networks. In this study, the authors propose a privacy aware collaborative traffic monitoring system (PA-CTM) that considers the privacy and security properties of VANETs and existing infrastructures. PA-CTM provides a client server architecture that relies on existing infrastructures and enhances privacy by: (i) Using a robust pseudonym providing system for anonymous access. Pseudonyms enable users to be authenticated anonymously by the traffic server without having their identities revealed. It also allows revealing identities for law enforcement purposes when necessary. Users are able to change their pseudonyms and hence hide their complete trajectory information form traffic server. (ii) Utilising a novel autonomous location update mechanism (ALUM) that does not rely on a trusted third party and uses only local parameters (speed and direction) for triggering a location update or pseudonym change. These performance results showed that ALUM is effective for traffic monitoring in terms of both privacy and utility.

AB As the main component of an autonomous driving system, the motion planner plays an essential role for safe and efficient driving. However, traditional motion planners cannot make full use of the on-board sensing information and lack the ability to efficiently adapt to different driving scenes and behaviors of different drivers. To overcome this limitation, a personalized behavior learning system (PBLS) is proposed in this paper to improve the performance of the traditional motion planner. This system is based on the neural reinforcement learning (NRL) technique, which can learn from human drivers online based on the on-board sensing information and realize human-like longitudinal speed control (LSC) through the learning from demonstration (LFD) paradigm. Under the LFD framework, the desired speed of human drivers can be learned by PBLS and converted to the low-level control commands by a proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller. Experiments using driving simulator and real driving data show that PBLS can adapt to different drivers by reproducing their driving behaviors for LSC in different scenes. Moreover, through a comparative experiment with the traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC) system, the proposed PBLS demonstrates a superior performance in maintaining driving comfort and smoothness.

AB This paper presents a novel control strategy, which we call optiPilot, for autonomous flight in the vicinity of obstacles. Most existing autopilots rely on a complete 6-degree-of-freedom state estimation using a GPS and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and are unable to detect and avoid obstacles. This is a limitation for missions such as surveillance and environment monitoring that may require near-obstacle flight in urban areas or mountainous environments. OptiPilot instead uses optic flow to estimate proximity of obstacles and avoid them.
   Our approach takes advantage of the fact that, for most platforms in translational flight (as opposed to near-hover flight), the translatory motion is essentially aligned with the aircraft main axis. This property allows us to directly interpret optic flow measurements as proximity indications. We take inspiration from neural and behavioural strategies of flying insects to propose a simple mapping of optic flow measurements into control signals that requires only a lightweight and power-efficient sensor suite and minimal processing power.
   In this paper, we first describe results obtained in simulation before presenting the implementation of optiPilot on a real flying platform equipped only with lightweight and inexpensive optic computer mouse sensors, MEMS rate gyroscopes and a pressure-based airspeed sensor. We show that the proposed control strategy not only allows collision-free flight in the vicinity of obstacles, but is also able to stabilise both attitude and altitude over flat terrain. These results shed new light on flight control by suggesting that the complex sensors and processing required for 6 degree-of-freedom state estimation may not be necessary for autonomous flight and pave the way toward the integration of autonomy into current and upcoming gram-scale flying platforms.

AB Autonomous maneuver decision by an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) is a critical part of air combat that requires both flight safety and tactical maneuvering. In this paper, an unmanned combat air vehicle air combat maneuver decision method based on a proximal policy optimization algorithm (PPO) is proposed. Firstly, a motion model of the unmanned combat air vehicle and a situation assessment model of air combat was established to describe the motion situation of the unmanned combat air vehicle. An enemy maneuver policy based on a situation assessment with a greedy algorithm was also proposed for air combat confrontation, which aimed to verify the performance of the proximal policy optimization algorithm. Then, an action space based on a basic maneuver library and a state observation space of the proximal policy optimization algorithm were constructed, and a reward function with situation reward shaping was designed for accelerating the convergence rate. Finally, a simulation of air combat confrontation was carried out, which showed that the agent using the proximal policy optimization algorithm learned to combine a series of basic maneuvers, such as diving, climb and circling, into tactical maneuvers and eventually defeated the enemy. The winning rate of the proximal policy optimization algorithm reached 62%, and the corresponding losing rate was only 11%.

AB Applications for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) are progressing from more fundamental ones like those for traffic efficiency, road safety, and information services to more sophisticated ones like autonomous driving and intelligent mobility that have a variety of connectivity requirements. Therefore, IoV communication systems must overcome various obstacles in order to enable a variety of IoV applications. Attacks on TSP servers are the major target of telematics attack threat events. This article analyses data security monitoring from the vehicle end to the TSP platform, as well as gathering and analysing the status and intelligence of linked vehicles, in order to develop a Telematics TSP server attack monitoring system. Experiments show that the error detection rate of the benchmark algorithms decreases significantly as the error rate of vehicle speed data increases, with the exponential smoothing algorithm showing the largest decrease in the error detection rate. However, the proposed combined model is very close to the error detection rate of the benchmark algorithm at the later stages when the error rate is high, with an error detection rate of more than 80%.It provides great assistance for anomaly detection and data recovery, especially in researching key technologies for remote information processing data security and reliability, greatly improving their performance.

AB The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is emerging in the car-sharing business due to the high potential of reducing operational costs as well as greenhouse gas emissions. In this early stage of the EV-sharing business, it is still unclear which battery-charging technology and insurance contract would be more competitive for EV-sharing operators in the context of future business. We have developed a stylized model with which to analyze the impact of different charging technologies, insurance contracts and other related factors on the EV-sharing operator's profit. The operator's demand is derived from customers' utility of driving under a membership scheme. Various operational costs such as electricity and parking place costs are considered. Different battery-charging technologies and insurance contracts are incorporated into the model and then compared. The results show that membership and driving time are strategic complements, and that the operator's profit is sensitive to policy interventions. Fixed-premium insurance leads to lower prices for the EV-sharing service than per-hour-premium insurance. The per-hour premium fees decrease more significantly than the fixed premium fees as autonomous vehicles reduce accident costs. The conditions for different battery-charging technologies to be price competitive are identified and meaningful policy implications are derived.

AB Target capture and station keeping problems for an autonomous vehicle agent have been studied in the literature for the cases where the position of the agent can be measured. Station keeping refers to moving the agent to a target whose distances are predefined from a set of beacons that can be stations or other agents. Here we study the target capture and station keeping problems for a nonholonomic vehicle agent that does not know its location and can measure only distances to the target (to the beacons for station keeping). This sensing limitation corresponds to consideration of unavailability of GPS and odometry in practical UAV settings. For each of the target capture and station keeping problems, we propose a control algorithm that uses only agent-target (agent-beacon for station keeping) range and range rate information. We show the stability and convergence properties of our control algorithms. We verified the performance of our control algorithms by simulations and real time experiments on a ground robot. Our algorithms captured the target in finite time in the experiments. Therefore, our algorithms are efficient in scenarios where GPS is unavailable or target identification by vision algorithms is unreliable but continuous agent-target range measurements are available.

AB Accurate detection and tracking of vulnerable road users and traffic objects represent vital tasks for autonomous driving and driving assistance systems. The recent developments in the field rely heavily on deep learning techniques, which require large computational resources. Thus, optimizing software components alongside appropriate hardware choices is imperative for the development of a system that can perform real-time inference. In this paper, we propose a solution for object detection and tracking in an autonomous driving scenario. Specifically, we compare and explore the applicability of various state-of-the-art object detectors trained on the BDD100K dataset, including YOLOv8, YOLOv7, YOLOv5, Scaled-YOLOv4, and YOLOR. Moreover, we investigate the deployment of these algorithms on edge devices, such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of DeepStream technology for real-time inference, comparing different object trackers, such as NvDCF and DeepSORT, using the KITTI tracking dataset. The suggested approach entails utilizing a YOLOR-CSP architecture in conjunction with a DeepSORT tracker, to achieve a real-time inference rate of 33.3 frames per second (FPS) with a detection interval of one, and a 17 FPS rate with an interval of zero.

ID GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; ENTROPY
AB Ground penetrating radars (GPRs) carried by mobile platforms, such as vehicles and drones, have been applied in various applications, for instance, subsurface utility detection, structural health inspection, and autonomous driving. However, existing GPR systems are not able to operate autonomously and adaptively due to several challenges, including the lack of intelligence, uncertain and dynamic nature of sensing environments, and huge state and action spaces. To overcome these challenges, in this article, we propose an autonomous cognitive GPR (AC-GPR) enabled by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. Specifically, the operation of the proposed AC-GPR is first formulated as a sequential decision process. A novel reward function is developed for the DRL model by defining and combining two different types of entropy-based rewards resulting from object detection and recognition, respectively. A deep Q-learning network (DQN) is developed to address the extreme curse of dimensionality in the state space and learn a policy directing the actions of the AC-GPR. The AC-GPR is evaluated using software called GprMax by combining DRL with GPR modeling and simulation. Results show that our proposed DRL-based AC-GPR outperforms other GPR systems using different approaches in terms of detection accuracy and operating time.

AB Autonomously driving delivery robots are developed all around the world, and the first prototypes are tested already in last-mile deliveries of packages. Estonia plays a leading role in this field with its, start-up Starship Technologies, which operates not only in Estonia but also in foreign countries like Germany, Great Britain, and the United States of America (USA), where it seems to provide a promising solution of the last-mile problem. But the more and more frequent appearance of delivery robots in public traffic reveals shortcomings in the regulatory framework of the usage of these autonomous vehicles-despite the maturity of the underlying technology. The related regulatory questions are reaching from data protection over liability for torts performance to such mundane fields as traffic law, which a logistic service provider has to take into account. This paper analyses and further develops the regulatory framework of autonomous delivery robots for packages by highlighting legal implications. Since delivery robots can be understood as cyber-physical systems in the context of Industry 4.0, the research contributes to the related regulatory framework of Industry 4.0 in international terms. Finally, the paper discusses future perspectives and proposes specific modes of compliance.

ID VISION SYSTEM
AB The research of unmanned aerial vehicles' (UAVs') autonomy navigation and landing guidance with computer vision has important significance. However, because of the image blurring, the position of the cooperative points cannot be obtained accurately, and the pose estimation algorithms based on the feature points have low precision. In this research, the pose estimation algorithm of UAV is proposed based on feature lines of the cooperative object for autonomous landing. This method uses the actual shape of the cooperative-target on ground and the principle of vanishing line. Roll angle is calculated from the vanishing line. Yaw angle is calculated from the location of the target in the image. Finally, the remaining extrinsic parameters are calculated by the coordinates transformation. Experimental results show that the pose estimation algorithm based on line feature has a higher precision and is more reliable than the pose estimation algorithm based on points feature. Moreover, the error of the algorithm we proposed is small enough when the UAV is near to the landing strip, and it can meet the basic requirements of UAV's autonomous landing.

   Task analysis; Autonomous vehicles
AB Enabling autonomous driving (AD) can be considered one of the biggest challenges in today?s technology. AD is a complex task accomplished by several functionalities, with environment perception being one of its core functions. Environment perception is usually performed by combining the semantic information captured by several sensors, i.e., lidar or camera. The semantic information from the respective sensor can be extracted by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for dense prediction. In the past, CNNs constantly showed stateof-the-art performance on several vision-related tasks, such as semantic segmentation of traffic scenes using nothing but the red-green-blue (RGB) images provided by a camera. Although CNNs obtain state-of-the-art performance on clean images, almost imperceptible changes to the input, referred to as adversarial perturbations, may lead to fatal deception. The goal of this article is to illuminate the vulnerability aspects of CNNs used for semantic segmentation with respect to adversarial attacks, and share insights into some of the existing known adversarial defense strategies. We aim to clarify the advantages and disadvantages associated with applying CNNs for environment perception in AD to serve as a motivation for future research in this field.

AB Monocular image-based local collision-free path planning for autonomous robots is presented in this paper. According to a pre-set pair of parallel lines, transformation equations from the image domain to the real world domain are easily defined. Moreover; the distances to obstacles in the robot's visual domain can be estimated. Our proposed method can not only easily identify obstacles and wall edges, but also estimate the distances and plan a collision-free path. Besides, this paper successfully integrates an image processing module with a local collision-free path planning, and also applies them to the collision-free and path planning of a mobile robot. For the proposed local collision-free path planning,. the webcam can be located at two different situations: one is setting a webcam located on the ceiling and the other is setting a webcam on a mobile robot. In addition, the measurement method only uses a webcam and four laser projectors. Thus, we do not need to purchase expensive equipment to accomplish the desired results. From the experimental results, it shows that our proposed method can be effectively applied to the local collision-free path planning.

ID MODEL
AB Forecasting the trajectory of pedestrians in shared urban traffic environments from non-invasive sensor modalities is still considered one of the challenging problems facing the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In the literature, this problem is often tackled using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Despite the powerful capabilities of RNNs in capturing the temporal dependency in the pedestrians' motion trajectories, they were argued to be challenged when dealing with longer sequential data. Additionally, whilst the accommodation for contextual information (such as scene semantics and agents interactions) was shown to be effective for robust trajectory prediction, they can also impact the overall real-time performance of prediction system. Thus, in this work, we are introducing a framework based on the transformer networks that were demonstrated recently to be more efficient and outperformed RNNs in many sequential-based tasks. We relied on a fusion of sensor modalities, namely the past positional information, agent interactions information and scene physical semantics information as an input to our framework in order to not only provide a robust trajectory prediction of pedestrians, but also achieve real-time performance for multi-pedestrians' trajectory prediction. We have evaluated our framework on three real-life datasets of pedestrians in shared urban traffic environments and it has outperformed the compared baseline approaches in both short-term and long-term prediction horizons. For the short-term prediction horizon, our approach has achieved lower scores according to the average displacement error and the root-mean squared error (ADE/RMSE) of predictions over the state-of-the art (SOTA) approach by more than 11 cm and 23 cm, respectively. While for the long-term prediction horizon, our approach has achieved lower ADE and FDE over the SOTA approach by more than 62 cm and 165 cm, respectively. Additionally, our approach has achieved superior real time performance by scoring only 0.025 s (i.e., it can provide 40 individual trajectory predictions per second).

AB This study investigates the containment problem of networked underactuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) guided by multiple virtual leaders using an event-triggering control mechanism. Each USV is subject to external disturbance and internal model uncertainties. First, a finite-time observer is introduced to identify the model uncertainties and the unmeasured USV velocities. Then, a guidance law is designed to generate a series of virtual reference points for each USV so that these points are contained within the convex hull spanned by the virtual leaders. Meanwhile, the path update law for each virtual leader is proposed. Next, to steer the USVs towards the corresponding reference points, an event-triggered-based control law is developed for each USV using the observed data, in which the event-triggering technique is applied in the channel of sensor-to-controller to reduce communication burden while ensuring the similar control performance with the continuous mechanism. Besides, a first-order filter is introduced to provide the derivatives of the virtual control laws. Finally, stability analysis shows that the closed-loop system is finite-time stable and all error signals converge to a small bound within finite time. Comparative simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered containment control method.

AB Vehicle positioning is becoming an important issue related to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). Novel vehicles and autonomous vehicles need to be localized under different weather conditions and it is important to have a reliable positioning system to track vehicles. Satellite navigation systems can be a key technology in providing global coverage and providing localization services through many satellite constellations such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and so forth. However, the modeling of positioning and localization systems under different weather conditions is not a trivial objective especially considering different factors such as receiver sensitivity, dynamic weather conditions, propagation delay and so forth. This paper focuses on the use of simulators for performing different kinds of tests on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) systems in order to reduce the cost of the positioning testing under different techniques or models. Simulation driven approach, combined with some specific hardware equipment such as receivers and transmitters can characterize a more realistic scenario and the simulation can consider other aspects that could be complex to really test. In this work, the main contribution is the introduction of the Troposphere Collins model in a GNSS simulator for VANET applications, the GPS-SDR-SIM software. The use of the Collins model in the simulator allows to improve the accuracy of the simulation experiments throughout the reduction of the receiver errors.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been envisaged as a promising technique in fifth generation (5G) and beyond wireless networks. In order to alleviate the explosive growth of computation and spectrum demand, cognitive radio (CR) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are studied in MEC-aware networks. In this study, considering a local computation and partial offloading scheme, a UAV-enabled CR-MEC framework is proposed and the authors' aim is to maximise the energy efficiency (EE) of the wireless devices (WDs). The formulated optimisation problem is not convex and challenging to be solved. To deal with it, an equivalent reformulation of this EE maximisation problem is introduced, and the authors decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, wherein the sub-problems become tractable and can be solved by jointly optimising sensing time, offloading power and WD-UAV scheduling. Numerical results highlight the EE enhancement with various system parameters and reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm than other schemes with low computational complexity.

AB Two party authentication schemes can be good candidates for deployment in Internet of Things (IoT)-based systems, especially in systems involving fast moving vehicles. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) requires fast and secure device-to-device communication without interference of any third party during communication, and this task can be carried out after registration of vehicles with a trusted certificate issuing party. Recently, several authentication protocols were proposed to enable key agreement in two party settings. In this study, we analyze two recent protocols and show that both protocols are insecure against key compromise impersonation attack (KCIA) as well as both lack of user anonymity. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved protocol that does not only resist KCIA and related attacks, but also offers comparable computation and communication. The security of proposed protocol is tested under formal model as well as using well known Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic along with a discussion on security features. While resisting the KCIA and related attacks, proposed protocol also provides comparable trade-of between security features and efficiency and completes a round of key agreement in just 13.42 ms, which makes it a promising candidate to be deployed in IoT environments.

AB Within the context of more and more autonomous vehicles, an automatic lateral control device (AS: Automatic Steering) was used to steer the vehicle along the road without drivers' intervention. The device was not able to detect and avoid obstacles. The experiment aimed to analyse unexpected obstacle avoidance manoeuvres when lateral control was delegated to automation. It was hypothesized that drivers skirting behaviours and eye movement patterns would be modified with automated steering compared with a control situation without automation. Eighteen participants took part in a driving simulator study. Steering behaviours and eye movements were analysed during obstacle avoidance episodes. Compared with driving without automation, skirting around obstacles was found to be less effective when drivers had to return from automatic steering to manual control. Eye movements were modified in the presence of automatic steering, revealing further ahead visual scanning of the driving environment. Resuming manual control is not only a problem of action performance but is also related to the reorganisation of drivers' visual strategies linked to drivers' disengagement from the steering task. Assistance designers should pay particular attention to potential changes in drivers' activity when carrying out development work on highly automated vehicles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Autonomous vehicles necessitate prediction of future motions of surrounding traffic participants for safe navigation. However, prediction is challenging due to complex road structures and the multimodality of driving behaviors. Recent approaches usually output a fixed number of predicted trajectories, thus can hardly generalize to situations with more options and match modalities in different situations. They also rely on complex loss design and time-consuming training. This work proposes a novel map-adaptive multimodal trajectory predictor that links driving modalities, driver's intentions, and a vehicle's candidate centerlines (CCLs) together, rendering the predictor map-adaptive and the multimodality explainable. The predictor is derived by training an intention-aware unimodal trajectory predictor, which consists of a CCL-based goal predictor and a goal-directed trajectory completer, and a CCL scorer for estimating the possibilities of a target vehicle (TV) choosing a CCL to follow. This decomposed approach simplifies the training process and reduces the computational resources required, thereby rendering it a faster and more cost-effective alternative. Additionally, the proposed predictor has demonstrated comparable or even superior performance to traditional multimodal predictors in specific applications. Overall, the unimodal predictor presents a promising approach for practical machine learning applications, particularly when computational resources are limited.

AB One of the current challenges of automation is to have highly automated vehicles (HAVs) that communicate effectively with pedestrians and react to changes in pedestrian behaviour, to promote more trustable HAVs. However, the details of how human drivers and pedestrians interact at unsignalised crossings remain poorly understood. We addressed some aspects of this challenge by replicating vehicle-pedestrian interactions in a safe and controlled virtual environment by connecting a high fidelity motion-based driving simulator to a CAVE -based pedestrian lab in which 64 participants (32 pairs of one driver and one pedestrian) interacted with each other under different scenarios. The controlled setting helped us study the causal role of kinematics and priority rules on interaction outcome and behaviour, something that is not possible in naturalistic studies. We also found that kinematic cues played a stronger role than psychological traits like sensation seeking and social value orientation in determining whether the pedestrian or driver passed first at unmarked crossings. One main contribution of this study is our experimental paradigm, which permitted repeated observation of crossing in-teractions by each driver-pedestrian participant pair, yielding behaviours which were qualitatively in line with observations from naturalistic studies.

AB Accurate vehicle detection plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems. Various day conditions, for instance, dawn, morning, noon, or non-uniform illuminations put restrictions on camera's visibility. Such scenarios impact the performance of detection and recognition algorithms that are used in surveillance systems and autonomous driving. This paper aims to solve the aforementioned issues using machine learning methods, such as face detection and recognition. The core theme of this paper is the development of a vehicle detection and driver recognition system, which also focuses the situation where an input image is degraded by non-uniform illuminations. The proposed system is composed of four main processing modules: (i) image acquisition, (ii) image enhancement, (iii) object detection that locates vehicles' and drivers' faces, and (iv) the Pool of Face Recognition Algorithms (PoFRA), which uses four face recognition algorithms to conclude the driver's identity. We implement suitable algorithms for each of the above-described modules to appraise its practicability. The system can be adjusted to work in different types of extreme weather conditions, such as strong or dim light. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system has significant potential to take the research on automated car parking systems to the next level.

AB In this research, a novel navigation algorithm for self-driving vehicles that avoids collisions with pedestrians and ad hoc obstacles is described. The proposed algorithm predicts the locations of ad hoc obstacles and wandering pedestrians by using an RGB-D depth sensor. Unique ad hoc-obstacle-aware mobility rules are presented considering those environmental uncertainties. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed as a decision-making technique (to steer the self-driving vehicle to reach the target without incident). The deep Q-network (DQN), double deep Q-network (DDQN), and dueling double deep Q-network (D3DQN) algorithms were compared, and the D3DQN had the fewest negative rewards. We tested the algorithms using the Carla simulation environment to examine the input values from the RGB-D and RGB-Lidar. The series of algorithms that make up the convoluted neural network D3DQN was consequently selected as the optimum DRL algorithm. In the modeling of slow-moving urban traffic, RGB-D and RGB-Lidar generated essentially the same results. A self-driving version of an updated child-ride-on-car was modified to demonstrate the real-time effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Eco-driving algorithms optimize the speed profile to reduce the energy consumption of a vehicle. This paper presents an eco-driving algorithm for battery electric powertrains that applies a split loss integration approach to incorporate the component losses. The algorithm consistently uses loss models to overcome the drawbacks of efficiency maps, which cannot represent no-load losses at zero torque. The use of loss models is crucial since the optimal solution includes gliding, during which there are no-load losses. An analysis shows, that state-of-the-art nonlinear programming algorithms cannot represent these no-load losses at zero torque with a small modeling error. To effectively compute the powertrain losses with only a small error in comparison to the measurement data, we introduce a tailored combination of nonlinear inequality constraints that interleave two polynomial fits. This approach can properly represent reality. We parameterize the algorithm and validate the vehicle model used with real-world measurement data. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the proposed interleaved fits by comparing them to a single continuous high-order polynomial fit and to the state of the art. The algorithm is published open source.

DE Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGV); AI-driven analytics; Data clustering;
   Pattern searching
AB Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) have become an indispensable component of Flexible Manufacturing Systems. AGVs are also a huge source of information that can be utilised by the data mining algorithms that support the new generation of manufacturing. This paper focuses on data preprocessing, aggregation, and clustering in the new generation of manufacturing systems that use the agile manufacturing paradigm and utilise AGVs. This paper presents a method by which it is possible to automatically detect the types of work performed by an AGV based on streaming information. The paper presents a comparison of results obtained with two different classical clustering algorithms: K-Means and DBScan. As the results show, using at least one of the proposed algorithms, it is possible to automatically detect the types of work performed by AGVs and to detect new, previously unknown types. Additionally, to a limited extent, it is possible to identify anomalies using this method. The proposed methodology can be used as the initial step for production optimisation, predictive maintenance activities, production technology verification, or as a source of models for the simulation tools that are used in virtual factories. This is an extended version of the 'Data preprocessing, aggregation and clustering for agile manufacturing based on Automated Guided Vehicles' paper [43].

ID DESIGN
AB The quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system is considered a good platform for control scheme design as it is highly nonlinear with coupled dynamics and an under-actuated system. Considering these challenges, this manuscript aimed to propose a control algorithm to control the quadcopter system in the presence of uncertainty and disturbance influences. The integral adaptive sliding mode control scheme has been proposed to control the system. The proposed control scheme is composed of the outer loop controller to control the position of the quadcopter, while the inner loop controls the attitude of the quadcopter. The proposed control law has three major terms, firstly the equivalent control which is developed based on the Lyapunov approach to handle most of the uncertainty and disturbance, secondly the adaptive switching gain, which is achieving fast adaptation against uncertainty, finally the switching function which has been approximated by a tangent hyperbolic function to reduce the unwanted chattering phenomena. The proposed control scheme and its performance have been investigated via a MATLAB/Simulink. The results prove that the implemented control scheme is robust even in the presence of uncertainties and disturbance and the quadcopter tracks the predefined trajectories with limited chattering influence.

AB Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) have been a conventional solution and choice made by many manufacturing enterprises as means for Flexible Material Handling Systems (FMHS). In recent years, a considerable number of these vehicles have been installed on shop floors worldwide, effectively proving the usefulness of material handling systems. However, the increasing complexity of demand as well as a need for "make to order" rather than "make to stock" policy implies usage of more intelligent material handling solutions. This paper discusses the usage of an intelligent AGV as means for FMHS which should have Intelligent Material Handling System (IMHS) as the final outcome. This paper presents the experimental results of hybrid robotic control architecture. To evaluate the performance of the architecture, a mobile robot built on LEGO (R) Mindstorms NXT technology was used. Some of the architectural modules are based on the implementation of Artificial Neural Networks in order to achieve the needed robustness in exploitation. Then, through simulation using AnyLogic (R) software, the performance in terms of manufacturing system effectiveness and workstation utilization is analyzed. Based on the experimental results, the proposed IMHS can have significant advantages over conventional Material handling systems.

AB Identification of osteoblast progenitors, with defined developmental capacity, would facilitate studies on a variety of parameters of bone development. We used expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor (PTH1R) as osteoblast markers in dual-color fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to fractionate rat calvaria (RC) cells into ALP(-)PTH1R(-), ALP(+)PTH1R(-), ALP(-)PTH1R(+), and ALP(+)PTH1R(+) populations. These fractionated populations were seeded clonally (n = 96) or over a range of cell densities (similar to150-8,500 cell/cm(2); n = 3). Our results indicate that colony forming Unit-osteoblast (CFU-O)/bone nodule-forming cells are found in all fractions, but the frequency of CFU-O and total mineralized area is different across fractions. Analysis of these differences suggests that ALP(-)PTH1R(-), ALP(-)PTH1R(+), ALP(+)PTH1R(-), and ALP(+)PTH1R(+) cell populations are separated in order of increasing bone formation capacity. Dexamethasone (dex) differentially increased the CFU-O number in the four fractions, with the largest stimulation in the ALP(-) cell populations. However, there was no significant difference in the number or size distribution of CFU-F (fibroblast) colonies that formed in vehicle versus dex. Finally, both cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous (i.e., inhibitory/stimulatory effects of cell neighbors) differentiation of osteoprogenitors was seen. Only the ALP(-)PTH1R(-) population was capable of forming nodules at the clonal level, at approximately 3- or 12-times the predicted frequency of unfractionated populations in dex or vehicle, respectively. These data suggest that osteoprogenitors can be significantly enriched by fractionation of RC populations, that assay conditions modify the osteoprogenitor frequencies observed and that fractionation of osteogenic populations is useful for interrogation of their developmental status and osteogenic capacity.

AB The concept of intelligent tires has drawn the attention of researchers in the areas of autonomous driving, advanced vehicle control, and artificial intelligence. The focus of this paper is on intelligent tires and the application of machine learning techniques to tire force estimation. We present an intelligent tire system with a tri-axial acceleration sensor, which is installed onto the inner liner of the tire. Neural Network techniques are used for real-time processing of the sensor data. The accelerometer is capable of measuring the acceleration in x,y, and z directions. When the accelerometer enters the tire contact patch, it starts generating signals until it fully leaves it. Simultaneously, by using MTS Flat-Trac test platform, tire actual forces are measured. Signals generated by the accelerometer and MTS Flat-Trac testing system are used for training three different machine learning techniques with the purpose of online prediction of tire forces. It is shown that the developed intelligent tire in conjunction with machine learning is effective in accurate prediction of tire forces under different driving conditions. The results presented in this work will open a new avenue of research in the area of intelligent tires, vehicle systems, and tire force estimation.

AB This paper aims to provide an overview of the capabilities of unmanned systems to monitor and manage aquaculture farms that support precision aquaculture using the Internet of Things. The locations of aquaculture farms are diverse, which is a big challenge on accessibility. For offshore fish cages, there is a difficulty and risk in the continuous monitoring considering the presence of waves, water currents, and other underwater environmental factors. Aquaculture farm management and surveillance operations require collecting data on water quality, water pollutants, water temperature, fish behavior, and current/wave velocity, which requires tremendous labor cost, and effort. Unmanned vehicle technologies provide greater efficiency and accuracy to execute these functions. They are even capable of cage detection and illegal fishing surveillance when equipped with sensors and other technologies. Additionally, to provide a more large-scale scope, this document explores the capacity of unmanned vehicles as a communication gateway to facilitate offshore cages equipped with robust, low-cost sensors capable of underwater and in-air wireless connectivity. The capabilities of existing commercial systems, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence combined with drones are also presented to provide a precise aquaculture framework.

AB This paper proposes a cooperative strategy of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) longitudinal control for a mixed connected and automated traffic environment based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which enhances the string stability of mixed traffic, car following efficiency, and energy efficiency. Since the sequences of mixed traffic are combinatory, to reduce the training dimension and alleviate communication burdens, we decomposed mixed traffic into multiple subsystems where each subsystem is comprised of human-driven vehicles (HDV) followed by cooperative CAVs. Based on that, a cooperative CAV control strategy is developed based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, enabling CAVs to learn the leading HDV's characteristics and make longitudinal control decisions cooperatively to improve the performance of each subsystem locally and consequently enhance performance for the whole mixed traffic flow. For training, a distributed proximal policy optimization is applied to ensure the training convergence of the proposed DRL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulated experiments are conducted, which shows the performance of our proposed model has a great generalization capability of dampening oscillations, fulfilling the car following and energy-saving tasks efficiently under different penetration rates and various leading HDVs behaviors.

AB Environment awareness technology is one of the most critical technologies for autonomous vehicles, and traffic sign recognition is an important branch of environment awareness system, which has important research significance for ensuring traffic safety. To solve the problems of easy omission and inaccurate positioning for traffic sign detection under complex illumination conditions, there are two main innovations in this paper: firstly, an adaptive image enhancement algorithm was proposed to improve the image quality under complex illumination conditions; Secondly, a novel and lightweight attention block named Feature difference (FD) model was proposed to detect and recognize traffic signs. Unlike state-of-the-art attention models, which utilizes the difference between two feature maps to generate the attention mask. In this work, the single-stage target detection algorithm SSD was selected as the basic network, the backbone network was set as ResNet and VGG respectively and FD module was added. A large number of experiments were carried out to evaluate the optimization effect of FD module. The following conclusions can be drawn: image enhancement algorithms can provide better image samples; The FD model can be integrated into most of CNNs just by adding some shortcut connections, which does not introduce any additional parameters and layers; The average detection accuracy with FD module is 1.80% higher and the average recall rate was 1.51% higher than that without FD module, which has no great influence on the running speed. The FD module has better enhancement effect for dark image detection; The detection accuracy of the FD module is slightly better than other attention modules including BAM, CBAM and SE; The FD model can be used to evaluate the effect of the convolutional operation on features, which could help to find convolutional layers that have little effect on the accuracy of recognition for the network pruning.

AB In recent years, we have witnessed a growing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a variety of civil, commercial and military applications. Among these applications, many require the UAVs to scan or survey one or more regions, such as land monitoring, disaster assessment, search and rescue. To realize such applications, path planning is a key step. Although the coverage path planning (CPP) problem for a single region has been extensively studied in the literature, CPP for multiple regions has gained much less attention. This multi-regional CPP problem can be considered as a variant of the (multiple) traveling salesman problem (TSP) enhanced with CPP. Previously, we have studied the case of a single UAV. In this paper, we extend our previous studies to further consider multiple UAVs with energy constraints. To solve this new path planning problem, we develop two approaches: 1) a branch-and-bound (BnB) based approach that can find (near) optimal tours and 2) a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach that can solve large-scale problems efficiently under different objectives. Comprehensive theoretical analyses and computational experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed approaches in terms of optimality and efficiency.

AB An electric vehicle power battery simulation system simulating different power battery packs for the field test of the off-board charger is designed, which can be used to test the performance of an off-board charger. Specifically, the improved power battery model is combined with the improved lightweight charging load and the online estimation of the state of charge as well as the electromotive force of the battery model are used to adjust charging load parameters in real time to simulate the charging response. An acceleration coefficient is introduced into the traditional battery model to improve test efficiency, and the type, specification, temperature and voltage parameters of the battery can be set online according to the test requirements. An improved charging load scheme is proposed, in which a DC converter cascaded power battery pack of the mobile test vehicle is used to form a lightweight charging load with the mode of constant voltage, constant current, constant power and constant resistance and the ability to be adjusted continuously within the rated range. As a result, the size and weight of the charging load are reduced and the autonomous test of the off-board charger is realized. The performances of the proposed battery simulation system are validated through the various experimental results.

AB In robotics, mechanized and computer simulation for accurate and fast crash detection between general geometric models is a fundamental problem. The explanation of this problem will gravely improve driver safety and traffic efficiency, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have been employed in many scenarios to provide road safety and for convenient travel of the people. They offer self-organizing decentralized environments to disseminate traffic data, vehicle information and hazardous events. In order to avoid accidents during roadway travels, which are a major burden to the society, the data, such as traffic data, vehicle data and the road condition, play a critical role. VANET is employed for disseminating the data. Still the scalability issues occur when the communication happens under high-traffic regime where the vehicle density is high. The data redundancy and packet collisions may be high which cause broadcast storm problems. Here the traffic regime in the current state is obtained from the speed of the vehicle. Thus the data reduction is obtained. In order to suppress the redundant broadcast D-SAC data, dissemination protocol is presented in this paper. Here the data are classified according to its criticality and the probability is determined. The performance of the D-SAC protocol is verified through conventional methods with simulation.

AB To cope with the challenges of autonomous driving in complex road environments, the need for collaborative multi-tasking has been proposed. This research direction explores new solutions at the application level and has become a hot topic of great interest. In the field of natural language processing and recommendation algorithms, the use of multi-task learning networks has been proven to reduce time, computing power, and storage usage in various task coupling cases. Due to the characteristics of the multi-task learning network, it has also been applied to visual road feature extraction in recent years. This article proposes a multi-task road feature extraction network that combines group convolution with transformer and squeeze excitation attention mechanisms. The network can simultaneously perform drivable area segmentation, lane line segmentation, and traffic object detection tasks. The experimental results of the BDD-100K dataset show that the proposed method performs well for different tasks and has a higher accuracy than similar algorithms. The proposed method provides new ideas and methods for the autonomous road perception of vehicles and the generation of highly accurate maps in visual-based autonomous driving processes.

AB This letter presents an online trajectory planning algorithm for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to autonomously scan warehouse racks for inventory management. Our main motivation is to make small-sized UAVs with limited computing and sensing hardware capable of reliably performing the scanning task in cluttered environments. To this end, we propose a cooperative system where an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) guides the UAV using the novel template of visibility-aware cooperative navigation (VACNA). We propose a Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) based approach for solving the trajectory optimization underpinning VACNA. In particular, our CEM projects sampled vehicle trajectories onto the constraint sets before evaluating the cost functions. We further learn a deep generative model in the form of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) from expert demonstrations to warm-start our optimizer. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we present a detailed analysis of the role of our proposed cost and constraint functions for cooperative occlusion-free navigation. Second, we compare our custom CEM optimizer with conventional variants and show significantly reduced collision and occlusion rates. Finally, our CVAE initialization allows our optimizer to operate with smaller batch sizes and achieve real-time performance even on embedded hardware devices like NVIDIA Jetson Xavier.

AB Automated driving is the development trend of vehicle driving, and laser LiDAR is the high-precision positioning sensor that automated driving relies on most. Laser positioning mainly depends on the relative orientation from the detected environment features to the self-vehicle. However, when there are multiple detected features that carry different orientation information, all the data are redundant. In order to improve the vehicle's positioning accuracy, two laser point evaluation models were put forward. First, based on the plane area analysis method, a spot error model was proposed, and the error distribution with the incidence angle and scanning distance was obtained. Second, the laser point's position approximately obeys the Gaussian distribution, the laser's stereo error ellipsoid model was established, and the laser point's probability volume was calculated through the probability integration. Third, the point cloud features were extracted by a proposed roughness method, the point accuracy was evaluated by the proposed spot and stereo error models, and the points' relative weights were recalculated in the laser signal's positioning process. Finally, in order to verify the laser point's evaluation positioning method, the simulation and experimental verifications were conducted. The results show that the evaluation method based on the error ellipse models can improve the laser positioning accuracy effectively.

AB This article addresses the subject for bottom-following control of underactuated unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) with input saturation in the presence of unknown model uncertainties and unknown external disturbances. A robust adaptive dynamic surface bottom-following control scheme is developed based on the recursive sliding mode with nonlinear gains and neural networks, which can steer an underactuated UUV to precisely follow the bottom profile at a constant altitude as a basic feature. The bottom-following guidance law is derived based on the Serret-Frenet frame, the line of sight (LOS) and Lyapunov & x2019;s direct technique. Then, the bottom-following controller is designed based on the recursive sliding mode and dynamic surface control (DSC), to stabilize the bottom-following errors. The radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) are employed to online approximate the uncertain dynamics of underactuated UUVs, while the adaptive laws are introduced to estimate the bounds of the RBF NN approximation errors and unknown environmental disturbances. Additionally, an auxiliary dynamic system (ADS) is presented to handle the effect of input saturation. The uniform boundedness of all the closed-loop signals is guaranteed via Lyapunov analysis. The simulation results are presented to verify and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

TI Fast approximate clearance evaluation for rovers with articulated

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

AB We present a light-weight body-terrain clearance evaluation algorithm for the automated path planning of NASA's Mars 2020 rover. Extraterrestrial path planning is challenging due to the combination of terrain roughness and severe limitation in computational resources. Path planning on cluttered and/or uneven terrains requires repeated safety checks on all the candidate paths at a small interval. Predicting the future rover state requires simulating the vehicle settling on the terrain, which involves an inverse-kinematics problem with iterative nonlinear optimization under geometric constraints. However, such expensive computation is intractable for slow spacecraft computers, such as RAD750, which is used by the Curiosity Mars rover and upcoming Mars 2020 rover. We propose the approximate clearance evaluation (ACE) algorithm, which obtains conservative bounds on vehicle clearance, attitude, and suspension angles without iterative computation. It obtains those bounds by estimating the lowest and highest heights that each wheel may reach given the underlying terrain, and calculating the worst-case vehicle configuration associated with those extreme wheel heights. The bounds are guaranteed to be conservative, hence ensuring vehicle safety during autonomous navigation. ACE is planned to be used as part of the new onboard path planner of the Mars 2020 rover. This paper describes the algorithm in detail and validates our claim of conservatism and fast computation through experiments.

AB Autonomous-rail rapid transit (ART) is a new medium-capacity rapid transportation system with punctuality, comfort and convenience, but low-cost construction. Combined velocity planning is a critical approach to meet the requirements of energy-saving and punctuality. An ART velocity pre-planning and re-planning strategy based on the combination of punctuality dynamic programming (PDP) and pseudospectral (PS) method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the longitudinal dynamics model of ART is established by a multi-particle model. Secondly, the PDP algorithm with global optimal characteristics is adopted as the pre-planning strategy. A model for determining the number of collocation points of the real-time PS method is proposed to improve the energy-saving effect while ensuring computation efficiency. Then the enhanced PS method is utilized to design the velocity re-planning strategy. Finally, simulations are conducted in the typical scenario with sloping roads, traffic lights, and intrusion of the pedestrian. The simulation results indicate that the ART with the proposed velocity trajectory optimization strategy can meet the punctuality requirement, and obtain better economy efficiency compared with the punctuality green light optimal speed advisory (PGLOSA).

AB In order to improve the autonomous ability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to implement air combat mission, many artificial intelligence-based autonomous air combat maneuver decision-making studies have been carried out, but these studies are often aimed at individual decision-making in 1v1 scenarios which rarely happen in actual air combat. Based on the research of the 1v1 autonomous air combat maneuver decision, this paper builds a multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Firstly, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) is used to achieve communication between UAV individuals, and the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model under the actor-critic architecture is established. Secondly, through combining with target allocation and air combat situation assessment, the tactical goal of the formation is merged with the reinforcement learning goal of every UAV, and a cooperative tactical maneuver policy is generated. The simulation results prove that the multi-UAV cooperative air combat maneuver decision model established in this paper can obtain the cooperative maneuver policy through reinforcement learning, the cooperative maneuver policy can guide UAVs to obtain the overall situational advantage and defeat the opponents under tactical cooperation.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an integral part of numerous commercial and military applications. In many of these applications, the UAV is required to self-navigate in highly dynamic urban environments. This means that the UAV must have the ability to determine its location in an autonomous and real time manner. Existing localization techniques rely mainly on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and do not provide a reliable real time localization solution, particularly in dense urban environments. Our objective is to propose an effective alternative solution to enable the UAV to autonomously determine its location independent of the GPS and without message exchanges. We therefore propose utilizing the existing 5G cellular infrastructure to enable the UAV to determine its 3-D location without the need to interact with the cellular network. We formulate the UAV localization problem to minimize the error of the RSSI measurements from the surrounding cellular base stations. While exact optimization techniques can be applied to accurately solve such a problem, they cannot provide the real time calculation that is needed in such dynamic applications. Machine learning based techniques are strong candidates to provide an attractive alternative to provide a near-optimal localization solution with the needed practical real-time calculation. Accordingly, we propose two machine learning-based approaches, namely, deep neural network and reinforcement learning based approaches, to solve the formulated UAV localization problem in real time. We then provide a detailed comparative analysis for each of the proposed localization techniques along with a comparison with the optimization-based techniques as well as other techniques from the literature.

AB We use symmetric cryptography for secure communications with resource-limited smart grid control devices. We propose the novel idea of using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a physical courier to carry secret key bits generated at the control center to remote control devices. While distributing secret keys, the UAV may be attacked in an attempt to sabotage secure communications. The UAV may fly a longer route to avoid attackers but it has a limited onboard battery capacity and must visit each device within a time limit to prevent a secret key deficit. We formulate an optimization to find the lowest attack risk flight route for secret key distribution while taking into consideration key deficiency and battery capacity. Such optimization is NP-hard. We further propose an efficient algorithm to find a low-risk flight route in less than a second, even for a large power grid system with more than a hundred nodes. For large systems, we modify the proposed algorithm to find a low-risk flight route as well as to determine the required UAV flight duration and battery size. Extensive simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm against a baseline scheme that is ignorant of attackers.

AB This paper proposes a novel control scheme with a three-layer hierarchical structure to improve the cornering stability of the dual-motor rear-wheel drive (RWD) vehicles with the electronic differential system (EDS). The proposed hierarchical structure for the control system includes the observing layer, control layer, and actuation layer. In the observing layer, the driver model is designed to obtain the nominal steering angle, and the state observer is designed to obtain the yaw angle which cannot be easily measured. Then, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and second order sliding mode control (SOSMC) are employed in the control layer. The SOSMC part is used to design the control law to eliminate the chattering problem in the sliding mode algorithm, and the PSO part is used to obtain the optimal weights in the sliding mode surface to meet the minimum sideslip angle error and yaw rate error. The actuation layer allocates the corrected yaw moment by distributing the driving force to each independent driving wheel. Finally, the numerical tests are carried out under the double line change (DLC) maneuver. The results show that the proposed control system can effectively improve the cornering stability of the dual-motor RWD vehicles and reduce their motor power consumption.

AB A soft robot is presented which replicates the ability of cephalopods to travel in the aquatic environment by means of pulsed jet propulsion. In this mode of propulsion, a discontinuous stream of fluid is ejected through a nozzle and rolls into a vortex ring. The occurrence of the vortex ring at the nozzle-exit plane has been proven to provide an additional thrust to the one generated by a continuous jet. A number of authors have experimented with vortex thrusting devices in the form of piston-cylinder chambers and oscillating diaphragms. Here, the focus is placed on designing a faithful biomimesis of the structural and functional characteristics of the Octopus vulgaris. To do so, the overall shape of this swimming robot is achieved by moulding a silicone cast of an actual octopus, hence offering a credible replica of both the exterior and interior of an octopus mantle chamber. The activation cycle relies on the cable-driven contraction/release of the elastic chamber, which drives the fluid through a siphon-like nozzle and eventually provides the suitable thrust for propelling the robot. The prototype presented herein demonstrates the fitness of vortex enhanced propulsion in designing soft unmanned underwater vehicles.

AB Complete coverage planning (CCP) is a task to cover the entire area on the map, according to the job description of the autonomous mobile robot. The most widely used method for CCP in the literature is the grid-based coverage method. In this method, the problem is processing the partially filled cell as completely filled, which reduces the coverage performance. The ability to use the clustering method, which will be created by considering the characteristics of the environment, was determined as a research question to solve this problem. In this direction, it is aimed to use K-means++ algorithm, which is a widely used clustering algorithm and segmentation technique. In this context, an offline K-means++ complete coverage planning (Km++CCP) method, in which the navigable area on the map of the indoor where a mobile robot will navigate is clustered using the K-means++ algorithm and the centroids can be used as waypoints, is proposed. To test the proposed method, 2 simulations and 36 real-world experiments were conducted. The indoor coverage ratio of Km++CCP was calculated higher than the grid-based method in all experiments.

   In this article, we focus on the development of a quadruped locomotion controller able to generate omnidirectional locomotion and a path planning controller for heading direction. The heading direction controller is able to adapt to sensory-motor visual feedback, and online adapt its trajectory according to visual information that modifies the control parameters. This allows for integration of sensory-motor feedback and closed-loop control. This issue is crucial for autonomous and adaptive control, and has received little attention so far. This modeling is based on the concept of dynamical systems.
   We present experiments performed on a real AIBO platform. The obtained results demonstrate both the adequacy of the proposed locomotor controller to generate the required trajectories and to generate the desired movement in terms of the walking velocity, orientation and angular velocity. Further, the controller is demonstrated on a simulated quadruped robot which walks towards a visually acquired target while avoiding online-visually detected obstacles in its path.

AB This paper presents a beehive-inspired multi-agent drone system for autonomous information collection to support the needs of first responders and emergency teams. The proposed system is designed to be simple, cost-efficient, yet robust and scalable at the same time. It includes several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can be tasked with data collection, and a single control station that acts as a data accumulation and visualization unit. The system also provides a local communication access point for the UAVs to exchange information and coordinate the data collection routes. By avoiding peer-to-peer communication and using proactive collision avoidance and path-planning, the payload weight and per-drone costs can be significantly reduced; the whole concept can be implemented using inexpensive off-the-shelf components. Moreover, the proposed concept can be used with different sensors and types of UAVs. As such, it is suited for local-area operations, but also for large-scale information-gathering scenarios. The paper outlines the details of the system hardware and software design, and discusses experimental results for collecting image information with a set of 4 multirotor UAVs at a small experimental area. The obtained results validate the concept and demonstrate robustness and scalability of the system.

AB Automotive radar is the most promising and fastest-growing civilian application of radar technology. Vehicular radars provide the key enabling technology for the autonomous driving revolution that will have a dramatic impact on everyone's day-to-day lives. They play a central role in the autonomous sensing suit because of the significant progress in the radio-frequency (RF) CMOS technology that enables high-level radar-on-chip integration and thus reduces the automotive radar cost to the level of consumer mass production. However, this would not be sufficient without high spatial resolution performance, which can be obtained by multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) and cognitive approaches at a lower cost.
   The uniqueness of automotive radar scenarios mandates the formulation and derivation of new signal processing approaches beyond classical military radar concepts. The reformulation of vehicular radar tasks, along with new performance requirements, provides an opportunity to develop innovative signal processing methods. In this article, we first revise conventional techniques for signal processing in automotive radar. Then, we emphasize the limitations of the historically driven conventional processing approaches in practical roadway scenarios and present alternative signal processing solutions. Finally, we propose several future research directions to enhance vehicular radar performance.

AB Large scale, duty-cycled, wireless sensor networks provide support for applications ranging from anomaly detection to vehicle tracking. In order meet the requirements of these applications an autonomous configuration and maintenance method that is efficient and effective is required. When selecting a management solution it is important to consider both the direct and indirect costs associated with the different solution. For example, the overhead associated with communication synchronization and scheduling is an example of an indirect cost that can significantly impact the network lifetime. Further, an effective solution needs to recognize that in-network data aggregation and analysis presents significant benefits and should configure the network with a structure that benefits application layer functions. NOA, the proposed network management protocol, utilizes a multi-parent hierarchical logical structure. The multi-parent structure provides application layer functions with significant inherent benefits such as, but not limited to: elimination of the single parent network divisions, data resolution guarantees when comparisons are performed at data aggregation points, and redundancies for communication as well as in-network data aggregation, analysis and storage.

ID VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; LOGISTICS; LOCATION
AB In this study, Autonomous Mobile Lockers (AMLs) are introduced into current city logistics networks to reduce traffic congestion and save cost. The proposed system consists of couriers working with AMLs that visit the couriers in the field and transfer parcels between the couriers and the depot. Couriers can continue their tours without having to make repeated returns to the depot. At the same time, the AMLs can enlarge the coverage of each depot and allow a reduction in the number of depots, saving on rent. We propose a mixed integer programming model to solve the AML-Courier 2-Echelon Location Routing Problem in order to determine the tours of AMLs and couriers. We adapt and modify a hybrid Clark and Wright heuristic, the performance of which is examined for larger problem sizes, and introduce an enhanced version to improve the routes constructed. The results show the efficiency of the proposed heuristics for large problem sizes in terms of solution quality and execution time. Finally, the sensitivity of the best found solutions to some important parameters is analysed and a comparison with a single-echelon model made to establish the benefit of AML use.

DE Millimeter-wave communications; mobile relay; compressive sensing
AB Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is the rising technology for next-generation wireless transmission. Benefited by its abundant bandwidth and short wavelength, mmWave is advanced in multi-gigabit transmittability and beamforming. In contrast, the short wavelength also makes mmWave easily blocked by obstacles. In order to bypass these obstacles, relays are widely needed in mmWave communications. Unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), such as drones and self-driving robots, enable the mobile relays in real applications. Nevertheless, it is challenging for a UAV to find its optimal relay location automatically. On the one hand, it is difficult to find the location accurately due to the complex and dynamic wireless environment; on the other hand, most applications require the relay to forward data immediately, so the autonomous process should be fast. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel method AutoRelay specialized for mmWave communications. In AutoRelay, the UAV samples the link qualities of mmWave beams while moving. Based on the real-time sampling, the UAV gradually adjusts its path to approach the optimal location by leveraging compressive sensing theory to estimate the link qualities in candidate space, which increases the accuracy and save the time. Performance results demonstrate that AutoRelay outperforms existing methods in achieving an accurate and efficient relay strategy.

AB The complexity inherent in navigating intricate traffic environments poses substantial hurdles for intelligent driving technology. The continual progress in mapping and sensor technologies has equipped vehicles with the capability to intricately perceive their exact position and the intricate interplay among surrounding traffic elements. Building upon this foundation, this paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning method to solve the decision-making and trajectory planning problem of intelligent vehicles. The method employs a deep learning framework for feature extraction, utilizing a grid map generated from a blend of static environmental markers such as road centerlines and lane demarcations, in addition to dynamic environmental cues including vehicle positions across varied lanes, all harmonized within the Frenet coordinate system. The grid map serves as the input for the state space, and the input for the action space comprises a vector encompassing lane change timing, velocity, and vertical displacement at the lane change endpoint. To optimize the action strategy, a reinforcement learning approach is employed. The feasibility, stability, and efficiency of the proposed method are substantiated via experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator across diverse driving scenarios, and the proposed method can increase the average success rate of lane change by 6.8% and 13.1% compared with the traditional planning control algorithm and the simple reinforcement learning method.

AB Deploying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for traffic monitoring has been a hotspot given their flexibility and broader view. However, a UAV is usually constrained by battery capacity due to limited payload. On the other hand, the development of wireless charging technology has allowed UAVs to replenish energy from charging stations.In this paper, we study a UAV routing problem in the presence of multiple charging stations (URPMCS) with the objective of minimizing the total distance traveled by the UAV during traffic monitoring. We present a deep reinforcement learning based method, where a multi-head heterogeneous attention mechanism is designed to facilitate learning a policy that automatically and sequentially constructs the route, while taking the energy consumption into account. In our method, two types of attentions are leveraged to learn the relations between monitoring targets and charging station nodes, adopting an encoder-decoder-like policy network. Moreover, we also employ a curriculum learning strategy to enhance generalization to different numbers of charging stations. Computational results show that our method outperforms conventional algorithms with higher solution quality (except for exact methods such as Gurobi) and shorter runtime in general, and also exhibits strong generalized performance on problem instances with different distributions and sizes.

AB This article proposes A-tolling, a simple adaptive pricing scheme which only requires travel time observations and two tuning parameters. These tolls are applied throughout a road network, and can be updated as frequently as travel time observations are made. Notably, A-tolling does not require any details of the traffic flow or travel demand models other than travel time observations, rendering it easy to apply in real-time. The flexibility of this tolling scheme is demonstrated in three specific traffic modeling contexts with varying traffic flow and user behavior assumptions: a day-to-day pricing model using static network equilibrium with link delay functions; a within-day adaptive pricing model using the cell transmission model and dynamic routing of vehicles; and a microsimulation of reservation-based intersection control for connected and autonomous vehicles with myopic routing. In all cases, A-tolling produces significant benefits over the no-toll case, measured in terms of average travel time and social welfare, while only requiring two parameters to be tuned. Some optimality results are also given for the special case of the static network equilibrium model with BPR-style delay functions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We design persistent surveillance strategies for the quickest detection of anomalies taking place in an environment of interest. From a set of predefined regions in the environment, a team of autonomous vehicles collects noisy observations, which a control center processes. The overall objective is to minimize detection delay while maintaining the false-alarm rate below a desired threshold. We present joint (i) anomaly detection algorithms for the control center and (ii) vehicle routing policies. For the control center, we propose parallel cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithms (one for each region) to detect anomalies from noisy observations. For the vehicles, we propose a stochastic routing policy, in which the regions to be visited are chosen according to a probability vector. We study stationary routing policy (the probability vector is constant) as well as adaptive routing policies (the probability vector varies in time as a function of the likelihood of regional anomalies). In the context of stationary policies, we design a performance metric and minimize it to design an efficient stationary routing policy. Our adaptive policy improves upon the stationary counterpart by adaptively increasing the selection probability of regions with high likelihood of anomaly. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical simulations and a persistent surveillance experiment.

AB Most unmanned aerial vehicles nowadays engage in coverage missions using simple patterns, such as back-and-forth and spiral. However, there is no general agreement about which one is more appropriate. This letter proposes an E-Spiral algorithm for accurate photogrammetry that considers the camera sensor and the flight altitude to apply the overlapping necessary to guarantee the mission success. The algorithm uses an energy model to set different optimal speeds for straight segments of the path, reducing the energy consumption. We also propose an improvement for the energy model to predict the overall energy of the paths. We compare E-Spiral and E-BE algorithms in simulations over more than 3500 polygonal areas with different characteristics, such as vertices, irregularity, and size. Results showed that E-Spiral outperforms E-BF in all the cases, providing an effective energy saving even in the worst scenario with a percentage improvement of 10.37% up to the hest case with 16.1% of improvement. Real flights performed with a quadrotor state the effectiveness of the E-Spiral over E-BF in two areas, presenting an improvement of 9% in the time and 7.7% in the energy. The improved energy model increases the time and the energy estimation precision of 13.24% and 13.41%, respectively.

AB Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is an important autonomous marine vehicle. The safe navigation of USV is directly determined by the local obstacle avoidance because it must avoid real-time local obstacle in the global path planning in a three-dimensional environment. Therefore, efficient algorithms of real-time local obstacle avoidance for USV are a critical issue. In this study, a new three layered architecture for local obstacle avoidance algorithm was proposed to solve the local obstacle avoidance problem. First, real environment and obstacle models were established in the polar coordinate. The known static path-planning method was conducted based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). Second, the method was integrated with marine rules based on PSO. Third, an obstacle avoidance method under unknown environment was created based on rolling windows. Finally, a simulation experimental platform was developed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the aforementioned measure. Result shows that the proposed algorithm can effectively avoid local obstacles of USV at a computation time of less than 2 s. The USV avoids the obstacles smoothly and reaches the desired destination with complex requirements. The simulation results also demonstrate the promising application of the proposed method in studying the path planning of USV. This method can address the issues of real-time local obstacle avoidance of USV.

AB Driven by ever-increasing vehicular intelligent computation-intensive and delay-sensitive services, this paper in-vestigates the computing offloading in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular networks. Due to the limited onboard energy and computational resources of the mobile entities (i.e., the vehicles and the UAV), it is significant to explore the collab-orative computation among the vehicles, the UAV, and the ter-restrial computing servers for improving energy efficiency (EE) while trading off the service delay. Unlike existing work in the literature that is based on offline settings with a global view, an online distributed mechanism is proposed to cope with the spatial and temporal variations of the networks. Specifically, upon the arriving tasks and the real-time channel conditions, mobile entities adaptively decide about the task offloading and computational resources allocation in parallel. Moreover, the UAV also designs its trajectory with the residual battery capacity taken into account. Theoretical analysis shows that the developed approach can achieve the EE-delay tradeoff as [O(1/V ), O (V )] with V being a control parameter, and can strike a flexible balance between them by tuning V. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and reveal that the performance gain can be obtained over conventional methods in the EE performance.

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB Sidescan sonar is a small and low-cost sensor that can be mounted on most unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). It has the advantages of high resolution and wide coverage, which could be valuable in providing an efficient and cost-effective solution for obtaining the bathymetry when bathymetric data are unavailable. This work proposes a method of reconstructing bathymetry using only sidescan data from large-scale surveys by formulating the problem as a global optimization, where a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) is used to represent the bathymetry and the albedo and the beam profile are jointly estimated based on a Lambertian scattering model. The assessment of the proposed method is conducted by comparing the reconstructed bathymetry with the bathymetric data collected with a high-resolution multi-beam echo sounder (MBES). An error of 20 cm on the bathymetry is achieved from a large-scale survey. The proposed method proved to be an effective way to reconstruct bathymetry from sidescan sonar data when high-accuracy positioning is available. This could be of great use for applications such as surface vehicles with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to obtain high-quality bathymetry in shallow water or small autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) if simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can be applied to correct the navigation estimate.

AB The real-time recognition of absolute (or relative) position and orientation on a network of roads is a core technology for fully automated or driving-assisted vehicles. This paper presents an empirical investigation of the design, implementation, and evaluation of a self-positioning system based on a magnetic marker reference sensing method for an autonomous vehicle. Specifically, the estimation accuracy of the magnetic sensing ruler (MSR) in the up-to-date estimation of the actual position was successfully enhanced by compensating for time delays in signal processing when detecting the vertical magnetic field (VMF) in an array of signals. In this study, the signal processing scheme was developed to minimize the effects of the distortion of measured signals when estimating the relative positional information based on magnetic signals obtained using the MSR. In other words, the center point in a 2D magnetic field contour plot corresponding to the actual position of magnetic markers was estimated by tracking the errors between pre-defined reference models and measured magnetic signals. The algorithm proposed in this study was validated by experimental measurements using a test vehicle on a pilot network of roads. From the results, the positioning error was found to be less than 0.04 m on average in an operational test.

One of the factors affecting durability is the battery. Battery weight, energy capacity and discharge rate are important design parameters of the battery. In this study, proper autopilot gain coefficients and battery weight are obtained by using a stochastic optimization method named as simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). Because there is no direct correlation between battery weight and battery energy density, artificial neural network (ANN) is benefited to obtain battery energy density corresponding to resulted battery weight found from SPSA algorithm. By using the SPSA algorithm optimum performance index is obtained, then obtained data is used for longitudinal and lateral autonomous flight simulations. Findings With SPSA, the best proportional integrator and derivative (PID) coefficients and battery weight, energy efficiency and endurance were obtained in case of morphing. Research limitations/implications It takes a long time to find the most suitable battery values depending on quadrotor endurance. However, this situation can be overcome with the proposed SPSA. Practical implications It is very useful to determine quadrotor endurance, PID coefficients and morphing rate using the optimization method. Social implications Determining quadrotor endurance, PID coefficients and morphing rate using the optimization method provides advantages in terms of time, cost and practicality. Originality/value The proposed method improves quadrotor endurance. In addition, with the SPSA optimization method and ANN, the parameters required for endurance will be obtained faster and more securely. In addition, the energy density according to the battery weight also contributes to the clean environment and energy efficiency.

AB Accurate positioning is an essential requirement of autonomous vehicular navigation system (AVNS) for safe driving. Although the vehicle position can be obtained in global position system friendly environments, in GPS denied environments (such as suburb, tunnel, forest, or underground scenarios) the positioning accuracy of AVNS is easily reduced by the trajectory error of the vehicle. In order to solve this problem, the plane, sphere, cylinder and cone are often selected as the ground control targets to eliminate the trajectory error for AVNS. However, these targets usually suffer from the limitations of incidence angle, measuring range, scanning resolution, and point cloud density, etc. To bridge this research gap, an adaptive continuum shape constraint analysis (ACSCA) method is presented in this article to design a new target with optimized identifiable specific shape to eliminate the trajectory error for AVNS. First of all, according to the proposed ACSCA method, we conduct extensive numerical simulations to explore the optimal ranges of the vertexes and the faces for target shape design, and based on these trials, the optimal target shape is found as icosahedron, which composes of ten vertexes, 20 faces and combines the properties of plane and volume target. Moreover, the algorithm of automatic detection and coordinate calculation is developed to recognize the icosahedron target and calculate its coordinates information for AVNS. Finally, a series of experimental investigation were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed icosahedron target in GPS denied environments. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the plane, sphere, cylinder and cone targets, the developed icosahedron target can produce better performances than the above targets in terms of the clustered minimum registration error, ambiguity and range of field-of-view; also can significantly improve the positioning accuracy of AVNS in GPS denied environments.

AB In spite of a growing number of studies regarding collision algorithms of autonomous vehicles (AVs), little attention has been paid to how AV types influence the effects of collision algorithms on individuals' attitudes toward AVs. The current study investigated whether police AVs with selfish or utilitarian collision algorithms, compared with personal AVs with the identical type of collision algorithms, induce different attitudes toward AVs. An online experiment was conducted to explore how the AV types (personal vs police) and collision algorithms (selfish vs utilitarian) can jointly influence individuals' attitudes, such as trust, perceived benefit, ethical evaluation of AVs, and public acceptance of AVs. According to our findings, there was a moderating effect of AV types on how individuals respond to AVs with selfish or utilitarian collision algorithms. Police AVs with selfish algorithms had a negative impact on individuals' overall attitudes toward AVs. In contrast, personal AVs with selfish collision algorithms did not lead to such negative attitudes. Furthermore, selfish algorithms embedded in personal AVs were not found to increase in-dividuals' perceived benefit or approval for the mass adoption of AVs. The findings suggest that deciding collision algorithms for AVs should involve a careful consideration of the AVs' roles and purposes.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Vehicular networks are envisioned to deliver data transmission services ubiquitously, especially in the upcoming autonomous driving era. Accordingly, the high data traffic load poses a heavy burden to the terrestrial network infrastructure. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) show enormous potential to assist vehicular networks in providing services. In a dense UAV-assisted vehicular network with a large number of users, spectrum sharing is leveraged for alleviating the spectrum scarcity. However, the increasing data traffic still leads to the UAV energy consumption problem. This paper considers a specific network scenario where a UAV transmits its cached content files to vehicular users over UAV-to-vehicle (U2V) links while vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links reuse the U2V spectrum for safety-critical message exchanges. To improve the UAV's energy efficiency while guaranteeing users quality of service (QoS), we jointly optimize content placement, spectrum allocation, co-channel link pairing, and power control, which are the key factors affecting energy efficiency and QoS. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is solved by combining Hungarian and DDQN. We perform system performance evaluations, demonstrating that our approach can not only improve the UAV's energy efficiency while satisfying the users QoS requirements but also increase the timeliness of making decisions.

AB A non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enabled double-layer airborne access vehicular ad hoc networks (DLAA-VANETs) architecture is designed in this paper, which consists of a high-altitude platform (HAP), multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vehicles. For the designed DLAA-VANETs, we investigate the UAV deployment and network optimization problems. In particular, a UAV deployment scheme based on particle swarm optimization is presented. Then, the NOMA technique is introduced into the designed architecture, which can improve the transmission rate. Afterward, we take the information security into account and formulate a downlink total transmission rate maximization problem by optimizing UAV height and subcarrier allocation. For tackling this non-convex problem, we decouple this downlink total transmission rate maximization problem as two subproblems, where UAV height and subcarrier allocation problems are solved in turn. Moreover, the transmission performance of the designed DLAA-VANETs is analyzed, based on which the security outage probability (SOP) is derived. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the presented UAV deployment scheme can maximize the relay coverage ratio. In addition, the proposed can achieve a higher downlink total transmission rate in comparison with the current works.

AB This paper focuses on the adaptive trajectory tracking control for a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with an unknown dynamic model and the unmeasured states. Unlike most previous trajectory tracking control approaches, in this paper, the velocity states and the angular velocity states in the body-fixed frame are unmeasured, and the thrust model is inaccurate. Obviously, it is more in line with the actual ROV systems. Since the dynamic model is unknown, a new local recurrent neural network (local RNN) structure with fast learning speed is proposed for online identification. To estimate the unmeasured states, an adaptive terminal sliding-mode state observer based on the local RNN is proposed, so that the finite-time convergence of the trajectory tracking error can be guaranteed. Considering the problem of inaccurate thrust model, an adaptive scale factor is introduced into thrust model, and the thruster control signal is considered as the input of the trajectory tracking system directly. Based on the local RNN output, the adaptive scale factor, and the state estimation values, an adaptive trajectory tracking control law is constructed. The stability of the trajectory tracking control system is analyzed by the Lyapunov theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is illustrated by simulations.

AB A steer-by-wire (SbW) system, also known as a next-generation steering system, is one of the core elements of autonomous driving technology. Navigating a SbW system road vehicle in varying driving conditions requires an adaptive and robust control scheme to effectively compensate for the uncertain parameter variations and external disturbances. Therefore, this article proposed an adaptive global fast sliding mode control (AGFSMC) for SbW system vehicles with unknown steering parameters. First, the cooperative adaptive sliding mode observer (ASMO) and Kalman filter (KF) are established to simultaneously estimate the vehicle states and cornering stiffness coefficients. Second, based on the best set of estimated dynamics, the AGFSMC is designed to stabilize the impact of nonlinear tire-road disturbance forces and at the same time to estimate the uncertain SbW system parameters. Due to the robust nature of the proposed scheme, it can not only handle the tire-road variation, but also intelligently adapts to the different driving conditions and ensures that the tracking error and the sliding surface converge asymptotically to zero in a finite time. Finally, simulation results and comparative study with other control techniques validate the excellent performance of the proposed scheme.

AB This paper describes a vision-based control system for a tracked mobile robot (an excavator). The system includes several controllers that collaborate to move the mobile vehicle from a starting position to a goal position. First, the path planner designs an optimum path using a predefined elevation map of the work space. Second, a fuzzy logic path-tracking controller estimates the rotational and translational velocities for the vehicle to move along the predesigned path. Third, a cross coupling controller corrects the possible orientation error that may occur when moving along the path. A motor controller then converts the track velocities to the corresponding rotational wheel velocities. Fourth, a vision-based motion tracking system is implemented to find the three-dimensional (3-D) motion of the vehicle as it moves in the work space. Finally, a specially-designed slippage controller detects slippage by comparing the motion through reading of flowmeters and the vision system. If slippage has occurred, the remaining path is corrected within the path tracking controller to stop at the goal position. Experiments are conducted to test and verify the presented control system. An analysis of the results shows that improvement is achieved in both path-tracking accuracy and slippage control problems.

AB Nowadays, more frequently, it is necessary to perform underwater operations such as surveying an area or inspecting and intervening on industrial infrastructures such as offshore oil and gas rigs or pipeline networks. Recently, the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) has grown as a way to automate these tasks, reducing risks and execution time. One of the used sensing modalities is vision, providing RGB high-quality information in the mid to low range, making it appropriate for manipulation or detail inspection tasks. This work presents the use of a deep neural network to perform pixel-wise 3D segmentation of pipes and valves on underwater point clouds generated using a stereo pair of cameras. In addition, two novel algorithms are built to extract information from the detected instances, providing pipe vectors, gripping points, the position of structural elements such as elbows or connections, and valve type and orientation. The information extracted on spatially referenced point clouds can be unified to form an information map of an inspected area. Results show outstanding performance on the network segmentation task, achieving a mean F1-score value of 88.0% at a pixel-wise level and of 95.3% at an instance level. The information extraction algorithm also showcased excellent metrics when extracting information from pipe instances and their structural elements and good enough metrics when extracting data from valves. Finally, the neural network and information algorithms are implemented on an AUV and executed in real-time, validating that the output information stream frame rate of 0.72 fps is high enough to perform manipulation tasks and to ensure full seabed coverage during inspection tasks. The used dataset, along with a trained model and the information algorithms, are provided to the scientific community.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Autonomous path planning along riverbanks is crucial for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to execute specific tasks such as levee safety detection and underwater pipe inspections, which are vital for riverbank safety and water environment protection. Given the intricate shapes of riverbanks, the dynamic nature of tidal influences, and constraints in real-time cartographic updates, there is a heightened susceptibility to inaccuracies during manual waypoint designation. These factors collectively impact the efficiency of USVs in following riverbank paths. We introduce a riverbank following planner (RBFP) for USVs to tackle this challenge. This planner, utilizing 2D LiDAR, autonomously selects the following point to follow riverbank shapes. Additionally, a PID controller is integrated to compensate for position and yaw errors. Our proposed method reduces the deviation between the USV's planned path and the actual riverbank shape. We simulated straight, convex, and concave riverbanks in the Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulator while considering the impacts of wind, waves, and USV dynamics. The experimental result indicates the following performance of 96.92%, 67.30%, and 61.15% for straight, convex, and concave banks, respectively. The proposed RBFP can support a novel autonomous navigation scenario for autonomous paths following along the riverbank without any preplanned paths or destinations.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to change the way we travel. Before both the vehicles and infrastructures are fully automated, users of CAVs are required to respond appropriately to any adverse on-road conditions or malfunction that may prevent the autonomous driving system from reliably sustaining the dynamic driving task performance. The objective of this study is to construct spatiotemporal driving volatility profiles to help CAVs or drivers identify the potential hazards in the existing transportation network and make proactive driving decisions. The volatility profiles are constructed based on the historical traffic dynamics, varying spatially and temporally in the network. For demonstration, this study exploited the Basic Safety Messages datasets from Safety Pilot Model Development program in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The driving volatility is a measure to reflect the variability of driving performance, which is often used to show a vehicle or driver's performance on road. This study extends the concept to capture the driving dynamics as a performance of the transportation network. This study also matched the driving volatility to the spatial and temporal occurrence of historical traffic crashes. Modeling results showed the volatility is significantly related to safety outcomes; therefore, the driving volatility profiles can be compiled into the high definition (HD) maps to inform CAVs and drivers of potential on-road hazards and assisting in making proactive driving decisions. Further, the results offer implications for potential upgrades of the transportation infrastructure for full automation in the future.

AB The level set methodology for time-optimal path planning is employed to predict collision-free and fastest-time trajectories for swarms of underwater vehicles deployed in the Philippine Archipelago region. To simulate the multiscale ocean flows in this complex region, a data-assimilative primitive-equation ocean modeling system is employed with telescoping domains that are interconnected by implicit two-way nesting. These data-driven multiresolution simulations provide a realistic flow environment, including variable large-scale currents, strong jets, eddies, wind-driven currents, and tides. The properties and capabilities of the rigorous level set methodology are illustrated and assessed quantitatively for several vehicle types and mission scenarios. Feasibility studies of all-to-all broadcast missions, leading to minimal time transmission between source and receiver locations, are performed using a large number of vehicles. The results with gliders and faster propelled vehicles are compared. Reachability studies, i.e., determining the boundaries of regions that can be reached by vehicles for exploratory missions, are then exemplified and analyzed. Finally, the methodology is used to determine the optimal strategies for fastest-time pick up of deployed gliders by means of underway surface vessels or stationary platforms. The results highlight the complex effects of multiscale flows on the optimal paths, the need to utilize the ocean environment for more efficient autonomous missions, and the benefits of including ocean forecasts in the planning of time-optimal paths.

AB Modern vehicles have evolved to support connected and self-driving capabilities. The concepts such as connected driving, cooperative driving, and intelligent transportation systems have resulted in an increase in the connectivity of vehicles and subsequently created new information security risks. The original vehicular ad-hoc network term is now emerged to a new term, Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which is a typical application of symmetry of Internet of Things (IoT). Vehicle manufacturers address some critical issues such as software bugs or security issues through remote updates, and this gives rise to concerns regarding the security of updated components. Moreover, aftermarket units such as those imposed by transportation authorities or insurance companies expose vehicles to high risk. Software testing aims to ensure that software products are reliable and behave as expected. Many commercial and open-source software products undergo formal certifications to increase users' confidence in their accuracy, reliability, and security. There are different techniques for software certification, including test-based certification. Testcase repositories are available to support software testing and certification, such as the Linux Test Project for Linux kernel testing. Previous studies performed various testing and experimental evaluation of different parts of modern vehicles to assess the security risks. Due to the lack of trusted testcase repositories and a common approach for testing, testing efforts are performed individually. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach for a testcase repository to support test-based software and security testing and overcome the lack of trusted testcase repositories. The novel concept Proof-of-Validation to manage global state is proposed to manage updates to the repository. The initial work in this study considers the LTP test suite as a use case for the testcase repository. This research work is expected to contribute to the further development in including evidence generation for testing verification.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Pedestrian detection has wide applications in intelligent transportation. It is essential to understand pedestrian's position and action instantaneously for autonomous driving. Most algorithms divide these tasks into sequential procedures where pedestrians are detected from shape-based features in video frames, and their behaviors are analyzed with frame tracking. Different from those, this work introduces a deep learning-based pedestrian detection method that only uses motion cues. The pedestrian motion, which is much different from that of static background and dynamic vehicles, is investigated in the spatial-temporal domain. The pedestrian leg movement forms a chain-type trace in the motion profile images even if the ego-vehicle moves. Instead of modeling walking actions based on kinematics, the chain structure is directly learned from a large pedestrian dataset in driving videos. This method works for the more challenging scenes observed on moving vehicles than those scenes from static cameras. The aim is to detect not only pedestrians promptly but also predict their walking direction in the driving space. Since a video is reduced to temporal images, real-time performance is achieved with a high mean average precision and a low false-positive rate on a publicly available dataset.

AB Estimating the state of surrounding vehicles is crucial to either prevent or avoid collisions with other road users. However, due to insufficient historical data and the unpredictability of future driving tactics, estimating the safety status is a difficult undertaking. To address this problem, an intelligent and autonomous traffic management system based on V2V technology is proposed. The main contribution of this work is to design a new system that uses a real-time control system and a fuzzy logic algorithm to estimate safety. The robot operating system (ROS) is the foundation of the control architechture, which connects all the various system nodes and generates the decision in the form of a speech and graphical message. The safe path is determined by a safety evaluation system that combines sensor data with a fuzzy classifier. Moreover, the suitable information processed by each vehicle unit is shared in the group to avoid unexpected problems related to speed, sudden braking, unplanned deviation, street holes, road bumps, and any kind of street issues. The connection is provided through a network based on the ZigBee protocol. The results of vehicle tests show that the proposed method provides a more reliable estimate of safety as compared to other methods.

AB In this article, we analyze an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with multiple antennas and operating in full-duplex (FD) mode to assist the communication of two source-destination pairs in a power-domain nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. The UAV acts as a relay to forward data from sources to destinations. For practical purposes, the velocity of the UAV in a horizontal plane is taken into consideration. The impacts of imperfect successive interference cancelation, imperfect channel state information, residual self-interference, and the power allocation coefficient for the users to the system performance are also investigated. We evaluate the performance of the considered mobile multiantenna UAV-assisted FD-NOMA relay system by deriving the outage probability and the throughput's closed-form expressions for each communication pair in different communication urban environments. Monte Carlo simulation results verify the accuracy of these derived expressions. Numerical results show that the best outage performance can be achieved when the location of the UAV and transmission power of the source and the UAV are properly chosen. Furthermore, increasing the number of antennas at the UAV helps to improve the system performance remarkably.

AB Reliable estimation of vehicle lateral position plays an essential role in enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles. However, it remains a challenging problem due to the frequently occurred road occlusion and the unreliability of employed reference objects (e.g., lane markings, curbs, etc.). Most existing works can only solve part of the problem, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a novel deep inference network (DINet) to estimate vehicle lateral position, which can adequately address the challenges. DINet integrates three deep neural network (DNN)-based components in a human-like manner. A road area detection and occluding object segmentation (RADOOS) model focuses on detecting road areas and segmenting occluding objects on the road. A road area reconstruction (RAR) model tries to reconstruct the corrupted road area to a complete one as realistic as possible, by inferring missing road regions conditioned on the occluding objects segmented before. A lateral position estimator (LPE) model estimates the position from the reconstructed road area. To verify the effectiveness of DINet, road-test experiments were carried out in the scenarios with different degrees of occlusion. The experimental results demonstrate that DINet can obtain reliable and accurate (centimeter-level) lateral position even in severe road occlusion.

AB Motion planning plays an essential role in designing self-driving functions for connected and autonomous vehicles. The methods need to provide a feasible trajectory for the vehicle to follow, fulfilling different requirements, such as safety, efficiency, and passenger comfort. In this area, algorithms must also meet strict real-time expectations, since, especially in an emergency, the decision time is limited, which raises a trade-off for the feasibility requirements. This article proposes a hierarchical path planning solution for evasive maneuvering, where a Twin Delayed DDPG reinforcement learning agent generates the parameters of a geometric path consisting of chlotoids and straight sections, and an underlying model predictive control loop fulfills the trajectory following tasks. The method is applied to the automotive double lane-change test, a common emergency situation, comparing its results with human drivers' performance using a dynamic simulation environment. Besides the test's standardized parameters, a broader range of topological layouts is chosen, both for the training and performance evaluation. The results show that the proposed method highly outperforms human drivers, especially in challenging situations, while meeting the computational requirements, as the pre-trained neural network and path generation algorithm can provide a solution in an instant, based on the experience gained during the training process.

AB Artificial perception, in the context of autonomous driving, is the process by which an intelligent system translates sensory data into an effective model of the environment surrounding a vehicle. In this paper, and considering data from a 3D-LIDAR mounted onboard an intelligent vehicle, a 3D perception system based on voxels and planes is proposed for ground modeling and obstacle detection in urban environments. The system, which incorporates time-dependent data, is composed of two main modules: (i) an effective ground surface estimation using a piecewise plane fitting algorithm and RANSAC-method, and (ii) a voxel-grid model for static and moving obstacles detection using discriminative analysis and ego-motion information. This perception system has direct application in safety systems for intelligent vehicles, particularly in collision avoidance and vulnerable road users detection, namely pedestrians and cyclists. Experiments, using point-cloud data from a Velodyne LIDAR and localization data from an Inertial Navigation System were conducted for both a quantitative and a qualitative assessment of the static/moving obstacle detection module and for the surface estimation approach. Reported results, from experiments using the KITTI database, demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach in urban scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The implementation of many Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications (e.g., fire detection, surveillance, and package delivery) requires extensive computing resources to achieve reliable performance. Existing solutions that offload computation tasks to the ground may suffer from long communication delays. To address this issue, the Networked Airborne Computing (NAC) is a promising technique, which offers advanced onboard airborne computing capabilities by sharing resources among the UAVs via direct flight-to-flight links. However, NAC does not exist yet and enabling it requires overcoming many technical challenges, such as the high UAV mobility, and the uncertain, heterogeneous, and dynamic airspace. This paper addresses these challenges by 1) developing a Dynamic Batch-Processing based Coded Computation (D-BPCC) framework for achieving robust and adaptable cooperative airborne computing, and 2) designing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based load allocation and UAV mobility control strategies for optimizing the system performance. As the first study to systematically investigate NAC, to the best of our knowledge, we evaluate the proposed methods through designing a NAC simulator and conducting comparative studies with four state-of-the-art distributed computing schemes. The results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed methods.

AB In the Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS), where material processing is carried out in the form of tasks from one department to another, the use of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) is significant. The application of multiple-load AGVs can be understood to boost FMS throughput by multiple orders of magnitude. For the transportation of materials and items inside a warehouse or manufacturing plant, an AGV, a mobile robot, offers extraordinary industrial capabilities. The technique of allocating AGVs to tasks while taking into account the cost and time of operations is known as AGV scheduling. Most research has exclusively addressed single-objective optimization, whereas multi-objective scheduling of AGVs is a complex combinatorial process without a single solution, in contrast to single-objective scheduling. This paper presents the integrated Local Search Probability-based Memetic Water Cycle (LSPM-WC) algorithm using a spinning mill as a case study. The scheduling model's goal is to maximize machine efficiency. The scheduling of the statistical tests demonstrated the applicability of the proposed model in lowering the makespan and fitness values. The mean AGV operating efficiency was higher than the other estimated models, and the LSPM-WC surpassed the different algorithms to produce the best result.

AB O The sea current state affects the energy consumption of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) significantly and the path planning approach plays an important role in determining how long the USV can travel. To improve the endurance of the USV, an energy efficient path planning approach for computing feasible paths for USVs that takes the energy consumption into account based on sea current data is proposed. The approach also ensures that the USV remains at a user-configurable safety distance away from all islands and coastlines. In the proposed approach, Voronoi diagram, Visibility graph, Dijkstra's search and energy consumption function are combined, which allows USVs to avoid obstacles while at the same time using minimum amount of energy. The Voronoi-Visibility (VV) energy-efficient path and the corresponding shortest path were simulated and compared for ten missions in Singapore Strait and five missions for islands off the coast of Croatia. Impact of parameters such as mission time, the USV speed and sea current state on the results were analysed. It is shown that the proposed VV algorithm improves the quality of the Voronoi energy efficient path while keeping the same level of computational efficiency as that of the Voronoi energy efficient path planning algorithm.

AB A biomimetic robot inspired by Cyanea capillata, termed as 'Cyro', was developed to meet the functional demands of underwater surveillance in defense and civilian applications. The vehicle was designed to mimic the morphology and swimming mechanism of the natural counterpart. The body of the vehicle consists of a rigid support structure with linear DC motors which actuate eight mechanical arms. The mechanical arms in conjunction with artificial mesoglea create the hydrodynamic force required for propulsion. The full vehicle measures 170 cm in diameter and has a total mass of 76 kg. An analytical model of the mechanical arm kinematics was developed. The analytical and experimental bell kinematics were analyzed and compared to the C. capillata. Cyro was found to reach the water surface untethered and autonomously from a depth of 182 cm in five actuation cycles. It achieved an average velocity of 8.47 cm s(-1) while consuming an average power of 70 W. A two-axis thrust stand was developed to calculate the thrust directly from a single bell segment yielding an average thrust of 27.9 N for the whole vehicle. Steady state velocity during Cyro's swimming test was not reached but the measured performance during its last swim cycle resulted in a cost of transport of 10.9 J (kg . m)(-1) and total efficiency of 0.03.

AB Microwave Power Transfer (MPT) is a promising technology to charge sensor devices (SDs) wirelessly in wireless sensor networks, and Cloud Computing (CC) can significantly promote task processing capacity of SDs. However, the propagation loss can dramatically influence the harvested energy and computation performance. So, for wireless sensor networks, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted cloud wireless charging system with the cooperation of the cloud server and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). First, the UAV acts as the energy transmitter, and we design a quantitative charging scheme according to the energy-aware of SDs' battery capacity. Second, the cloud server processes the tasks uploaded by SDs with the cooperation of the UAV, and we consider the communication connection between the cloud server and the UAV. Third, we propose the joint resource-trajectory optimization to reduce the energy consumption of UAVs. We put forward the Chaotically Adaptive Beetle Swarm Optimization Based on Cauchy Mutation (CABSOC) assisted block coordinate descent algorithm for addressing this non-convex problem. Numerical results indicate that the proposed solution can significantly improve the energy performance of the UAV. And the energy consumption is reduced by 11% compared with the solution with network function virtualization (NFV).

AB This paper investigates the local and global performance of the platoon where multiple identical vehicles move in a closed roadway and cooperate based on nearest-neighbour interactions. The information from the front neighbour, namely position, speed, and acceleration, is weighted non-equally component-wise to that from the back neighbour, which is quantified by the asymmetry level on each component. The local performance refers to the locally propagating attenuation for the bidirectional control, which captures whether the disturbance is amplified when propagating from a vehicle to its immediate neighbours. The global performance refers to the system transfer scalability, which characterises the scalability of system transfer matrix. Based on forward and backward wave transfer functions, several analytical necessary conditions of the locally propagating attenuation are obtained. Furthermore, two of these necessary conditions happen to be the same with the conditions for scalably asymptotic stability. Under mild assumptions, the locally propagating attenuation is sufficient for scalably asymptotic stability, the latter of which in turn implies the system transfer scalability. Numerical calculations further show that it is favourable for both performance measures to select the asymmetry levels on speed and acceleration with small magnitudes and located around the centre line of the band-like region of scalably asymptotic stability.

AB This paper presents a legged-wheeled hybrid robotic vehicle that uses a combination of rigid and non-rigid joints, allowing it to be more impact-tolerant. The robot has four legs, each one with three degrees of freedom. Each leg has two non-rigid rotational joints with completely passive components for damping and accumulation of kinetic energy, one rigid rotational joint, and a driving wheel. Each leg uses three independent DC motors-one for each joint, as well as a fourth one for driving the wheel. The four legs have the same position configuration, except for the upper hip joint. The vehicle was designed to be modular, low-cost, and its parts to be interchangeable. Beyond this, the vehicle has multiple operation modes, including a low-power mode. Across this article, the design, modeling, and control stages are presented, as well as the communication strategy. A prototype platform was built to serve as a test bed, which is described throughout the article. The mechanical design and applied hardware for each leg have been improved, and these changes are described. The mechanical and hardware structure of the complete robot is also presented, as well as the software and communication approaches. Moreover, a realistic simulation is introduced, along with the obtained results.

AB Human and social factors are essential to transportation systems, yet top-down management fails to consider them sufficiently. Consequently, management strategies are not tailored to human needs and are inadequate in providing transportation intelligence. This article investigates a management architecture based on decentralized/distributed autonomous operations/organizations (DAOs) that considers both the technical and societal aspects in our transportation metaverse, TransVerse. This design maps people's transportation needs in physical space to their digital counterparts in cyberspace, utilizing blockchain technology to guarantee the secure exchange of information and ultimately bring about the Internet of Minds (IoM). With the federated intelligence that emerged in IoM, we can devise reliable and prompt traffic decisions by incorporating consensus, community voting, and smart contracts into the organizational, coordination, and execution structure. Details on operational procedures and key technologies are also covered. To demonstrate the efficacy of DAOs-based management, a case study of world model-driven cooperative signal control is provided, indicating its promising application in future transportation management.

AB This paper proposes a tracking controller for the formation construction of multiple autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances with output constraints. To design a formation control system, the leader-following strategy is adopted for each ASV. A symmetric barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), which advances to infinity when its arguments reach a finite limit, is applied to prevent the state variables from violating constraints. An adaptive-neural technique is employed to compensate uncertain parameters and unmodeled dynamics. To overcome the explosion of differentiation term problem, a first-order filter is proposed to realize the derivative of virtual variables in the dynamic surface control (DSC). To estimate the leader velocity in finite time, a high-gain observer is effectively employed. This approach is adopted to reveal all signals of the closed-loop system which are bounded, and the formation tracking errors are semi-globally finite-time uniformly bounded. The computer simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of this newly proposed formation controller for the autonomous surface vessels.

AB In this paper, we present a novel parametric iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm to deal with trajectory tracking problems for a class of nonlinear autonomous agents that are subject to actuator faults. Unlike most of the ILC literature, the desired trajectories in this work can be iteration dependent, and the initial position of the agent in each iteration can be random. Both parametric and nonparametric system unknowns and uncertainties, in particular the control input gain functions that are not fully known, are considered. A new type of universal barrier functions is proposed to guarantee the satisfaction of asymmetric constraint requirements, feasibility of the controller, and prescribed tracking performance. We show that under the proposed algorithm, the distance and angle tracking errors can uniformly converge to an arbitrarily small positive number and zero, respectively, over the iteration domain, beyond a small user-prescribed initial time interval in each iteration. A numerical simulation is presented in the end to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

AB Human drivers and machine drivers (i.e., automated vehicles or AVs) will share roads and interact with each other, creating mixed traffic. In this perspective, we develop two mental models about them and their social interactions, aiming to understand the risk implications of AVs and mixed traffic. Based on Mental Model I (i.e., machine drivers are superior drivers without human weaknesses), many simulation-based safety assessments, which often overlook or oversimplify human-AV social interactions, have predicted significant safety benefits when machine drivers interact with or replace human drivers. In contrast, Mental Model II considers human and machine drivers as heterogeneous and incompatible, suggesting that their interactions may lead to unexpected and occasionally negative outcomes, particularly in imminent mixed traffic. This perspective gains support from recent comparative empirical studies that employ various methods such as survey experiments, driving simulators, test-tracks, on-road observations, and AV accident analysis. These studies provide initial evidence of emerging traffic risks arising from human-AV social interactions, including human drivers' aggression and road rage toward AVs, human drivers exploiting AVs, AVs exerting negative peer influences on human drivers, and their incompatibility increasing human drivers' challenges in joining mixed traffic and thus risky behaviors. We propose specific suggestions to mitigate problematic human-AV social interactions and the associated emerging risks.

AB Recently, there has been extensive research and development in the field of smart cars, including technologies related to autonomous driving. Various industries are actively working towards creating efficient and safe self-driving cars. Sensor technologies are emerging to prevent traffic accidents and support safe driving in complex environments where human perception may be limited. One of the representative technologies being researched is the use of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar. Automobile manufacturers are improving driving safety by equipping cars with Blind Spot Detection (BSD) radar systems that use FMCW technology. As the complexity of driving environments continues to grow, ongoing research is aimed at enhancing the accuracy and reliability of BSD radar technology for detecting blind spots in vehicles. This paper presents the signal processing and tracking algorithms that are the core technologies of the BSD radar, and the design for a BSD radar system. The designed radar system was installed on a vehicle to verify its performance in real-world road environments. The ultimate objective of this research is to design a BSD radar system with high accuracy and reliability in BSD detection using AI technology. In pursuit of this goal, this paper presents the hardware design of the BSD radar system, including antenna and modem designs.

AB The safety of vulnerable road users is paramount, particularly as we move towards the widespread adoption of autonomous and self-driving vehicles. In this study, we investigate the use of a six-element distributed antenna system (DAS), operating at 5.8 GHz and mounted on the exterior (i.e., roof and wing mirrors) of an automobile, to enhance signal reliability for pedestrian-to-vehicle (P2V) communications. Due to its low complexity and ease of implementation, we consider the use of a switch-and-examine combining with post-examining selection (SECps) scheme to combine the signal received by the DAS. During our experiments, a pedestrian wearing a wireless device on their chest either stood stationary or walked by the side of a road. It was found that the overall signal reliability depends on not only the number, but also different groupings of the antennas which are selected. The goodness-of-fit results have shown that the temporal behavior of the diversity gain was adequately described by the Gaussian distribution. Building upon this, we also provide some useful insights into the antenna selection through the comparison of three different antenna selection mechanisms, namely per-sample random antenna selection, one-shot antenna selection and per-sample optimal antenna selection.

AB In this proposed method, which is based on combination of the nonlinear Hybrid Extended Kalman Filter (HEKF) observer, Analytical and Semi-Empirical (ASE) formulas, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, all of the hydrodynamic coefficients of a REMUS AUV are estimated to simulate its motions in 6 Degrees of Freedom (6-DoF). First, Using ASE formulas along with necessary static simulations of the AUV using commercial CFD code of ANSYS CFX software, some hydrodynamic derivatives like drag, lift, and fin coefficients are obtained. Then, utilizing the dynamic simulation of the Straight-Line Test (SLT), the longitudinal added mass coefficient is derived. Finally, benefiting from the HEKF code based on the parameter identification, other unknown coefficients like added mass and damping are estimated in the MATLAB software environment. In HEKF, positions and velocities of the vehicle, which are the system output vector, are obtained from a 6-DoF dynamic maneuver in CFX. It is worth mentioning that, in the present study, the remeshing algorithm in the dynamic mesh approach is used to simulate the dynamic maneuvers of the vehicle. Results, obtained from the proposed combined method, indicate a good agreement for estimated coefficients in comparison with the available analytical and experimental values.

In the last few years, IoV technology has emerged as a global revolution, demonstrating considerable impact upon the transportation and automation industry, hence, the interest of the researchers bends towards the utility of the IoV technology which motivated us to present a comprehensive review. This paper, thus, collates recent findings along with some anticipated applications of IoV technologies for transportation. It brings to light the evolution of the IoV studies referred as models for transportation since its birth and aims to present a deep insightful review of various IoV technologies with their strengths and weaknesses. The reviewed literature is organized systematically to give a categorical overview of recent developments. This article also discusses the outstanding potentialities and challenges that exist in transportation from IoV perspective with the belief that these will have the capacity to be addressed in the near future. As there is no review literature on IoV technology available for transportation. Hence, we strongly believe that this study will be useful and enable the researchers to utilize IoV technologies to solve complex outstanding problems in transportation and automation.

AB A model-free approach is presented, based on the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm, for the control of mixed traffic flow of human-driven vehicles (HDV) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV), named MCTS-MTF, on a one-lane roadway with signalized intersection control. Previous research has often simplified the problem with certain assumptions to reduce computational burden, such as dividing a vehicle trajectory into several segments with constant speed or linear acceleration/deceleration, which was rather unrealistic. This study departs from the existing research in that minimum constraints on CAV trajectory control were required, as long as the basic rules such as safety considerations and vehicular performance limits were followed. Modeling efforts were made to improve the algorithm solution quality and the run time efficiency over the naive MCTS algorithm. This was achieved by an exploration-exploitation balance calibration module, and a tree expansion determination module to expand the tree more effectively along the desired direction. Results of a case study found that the proposed algorithm was able to achieve a travel time saving of 3.5% and a fuel consumption saving of 6.5%. It was also demonstrated to run at eight times the speed of a naive MCTS model, suggesting a promising potential for real-time or near real-time applications.

AB This study considers the tracking control problem of an uncertain quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle with model uncertainties and wind gust disturbances, and a novel robust dynamic surface control based multiple state variables constrained control scheme is proposed. Under the presented control framework, the overall quadrotor system is decoupled into a translational subsystem and a rotational subsystem. These two subsystems are connected to each other through common attitude extraction algorithms. For the translational subsystem, the novel robust multiple state variables constrained control inputs are designed to ensure the state variables within the prescribed constraints. For the rotational subsystem, the dynamic surface control based tracking controllers are proposed to track the desired attitudes. In the end, the resulting closed-loop system is proved to be stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundness, and numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed control scheme.

AB Nowadays plant monitoring and control of renewable energy sources can take advantage of the use of unmanned aerial technologies. This manuscript aims to develop an image post-processing tool for remote aerial images able to help operation and maintenance operators in photovoltaic (PV) defects detection using light unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In particular, PV systems deployed in the field in the last ten years show often critical behaviour with a range of failures able to compromise the performance and energy yield of the power plants, thus they can greatly benefit of such novel technologies and tools. The described procedures are here tested on real plant data, with different kind of sensors, in order to find out potential advantages in fast fault detection tasks, using an automatic system for PV plants' mapping. The results of this research will be reported in order to provide an understanding of potential impact of image processing techniques based on UAV in the renewable energy sector.

AB This paper presents Multi-Step A* (MSA*), a search algorithm based on A* for multi-objective 4-D vehicle motion planning (three spatial and one time dimensions). The research is principally motivated by the need for offline and online motion planning for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For UAVs operating in large dynamic uncertain 4-D environments, the motion plan consists of a sequence of connected linear tracks (or trajectory segments). The track angle and velocity are important parameters that are often restricted by assumptions and a grid geometry in conventional motion planners. Many existing planners also fail to incorporate multiple decision criteria and constraints such as wind, fuel, dynamic obstacles, and the rules of the air. It is shown that MSA* finds a cost optimal solution using variable length, angle, and velocity trajectory segments. These segments are approximated with a grid-based cell sequence that provides an inherent tolerance to uncertainty. The computational efficiency is achieved by using variable successor operators to create a multiresolution memory-efficient lattice sampling structure. The simulation studies on the UAV flight planning problem show that MSA* meets the time constraints of online replanning and finds paths of equivalent cost but in a quarter of the time (on average) of a vector neighborhood-based A*.

AB An Autonomous Surface Manipulator System (ASMS) is a versatile system with a robotic manipulator installed onto an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), which can bring important technological innovations and efficiency improvements to various ocean applications. To develop a high-performance ASMS, an accurate model of the ASMS is required. However, existing models have limitations, such as neglecting the dynamic coupling between manipulators and USVs and not being suitable for stability analysis of ASMS. Hence, this paper proposed a modeling method for ASMS considering the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and the USV and performed stability analysis of the ASMS with the proposed model. Firstly, a six-degree-of-freedom ASMS model is introduced using the Newton-Euler equations. Then, an ASMS prototype is developed to validate the model, with its parameters identified through experiments. Subsequently, the motions of the USV are measured and compared with the calculated values under various motions of the manipulator. The accuracy of the proposed ASMS model is validated by the calculated errors of maximum roll angles and stable roll angles of the USV, which are less than 2deg and 1.1deg, respectively. Finally, a stability indicator is proposed, and the stability of the ASMS is analyzed.

AB In this paper, in order to avoid the cascading failure by increasing the number of links in the physical network in D2D-based SNS, we propose an autonomous device placement algorithm. In this method, some relay devices are placed so as to increase the number of links in the physical network. Here, relay devices can be used only for relaying data and those are not SNS users. For example, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with D2D communication capability and base stations with D2D communication capability are used as the relay devices. In the proposed method, at first, an optimization problem for minimizing node resilience which is a performance metric in order to place relay devices. Then, we investigate how relay devices should be placed based on some approximate optimal solutions. From this investigation, we propose an autonomous relay device placement in the physical network. In our proposed algorithm, relay devices can be placed without the complete information on network topology. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method with simulation, and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. From numerical examples, we show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

AB Given the rise of autonomous systems in transportation, medical, and manufacturing industries, there is an increasing need to understand how such systems should be designed to promote effective interactions between one or more humans working in and around these systems. Practitioners often have difficulties in conducting costly and time-consuming human-in-the-loop studies, so an analytical strategy that helps them determine whether their designs are capturing their planned intent is needed. A traditional top-down, hypothesis-driven experiment that examined whether external displays mounted on autonomous cars could effectively communicate with pedestrians led to the conclusion that the displays had no effect on safety. However, by first taking a bottom-up, data-driven machine learning approach, those segments of the population that were most affected by the external displays were identified. Then, a hypothesis-driven, within-subjects analysis of variance revealed that an external display mounted on an autonomous car that provided the vehicle's speed as opposed to commanding a go/no-go decision provided an additional 4 feet of safety for early adopters. One caveat to this approach is that the selection of a specific algorithm can significantly influence the results and more work is needed to determine the sensitivity of this approach with seemingly similar machine learning classification approaches.

AB When it comes to the accuracy of autonomous motion, it is necessary to consider object detection and recognition, especially for the robot application of the complex environment. This paper investigates novel dual-view 3D object detection networks combined with the Lidar point cloud and RGB image in engineering scenarios. The developed system is applied for autonomous vehicles that the detected objects are cars, cyclists, and pedestrians. Firstly, a feature extraction network based on the residual module is presented, and the specific features are from the RGB image. The point cloud is transformed into Bird's Eye View (BEV), and the BEV feature extraction network is built based on sparse convolution. Besides, the feature maps are input into the region proposal network (RPN) to obtain the optimal proposal so that the object classification and the bounding box regression are obtained. Finally, to evaluate the flexibility of the developed framework, extensive data sets are generated through the CARLA simulator and verified on the KITTI data set and unmanned motion platform (BIT-NAZA robot), indicating that the proposed networks can achieve satisfactory performance in the real-world scenario.

AB Autonomous Forklifts (AFs) play a vital role in smart factories, particularly in the transportation of heavy loads. However, their energy consumption poses a significant challenge as they need to operate for extended periods on a single battery charge. Therefore, energy-efficient motion is necessary to raise their availability. The AF's movement is dynamically determined by a motion planning algorithm within its navigation system. In light of this, this article introduces a strategy to improve energy efficiency during the motion planning phase. This strategy involves a cooperative approach, utilizing the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and AF's kinetic model to achieve this energy-saving goal. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on the vehicle's kinematic model, our approach considers an additional factor, incorporating the influence of the vehicle's kinetic model for a more comprehensive and accurate energy consumption analysis. First, the kinetic model of an AF is developed by considering the effect of the front-powered wheel. Second, the kinetic model is employed within a time-energy optimization technique, aiming to find the AF's ideal acceleration. This optimization process generates a dataset that covers a range of AF maneuvers and dynamic parameters. Third, a DNNs model is trained using this dataset to predict the optimal acceleration for the AF. Finally, the trained model is integrated into a motion planning algorithm to determine the optimal and acceptable limits for both linear and angular acceleration. Experiments illustrate that the suggested motion planning method can generate trajectories that are both feasible and optimized for energy consumption. This differs significantly from the typical algorithms which generally results in higher energy use by the AF, occasionally leading to the generation of infeasible trajectories.

AB Computer vision technologies are at the core of different advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and will play a key role in oncoming autonomous vehicles too. One of the main challenges for such technologies is to perceive the driving environment, i.e. to detect and track relevant driving information in a reliable manner (e.g. pedestrians in the vehicle route, free space to drive through). Nowadays it is clear that machine learning techniques are essential for developing such a visual perception for driving. In particular, the standard working pipeline consists of collecting data (i.e. on-board images), manually annotating the data (e.g. drawing bounding boxes around pedestrians), learning a discriminative data representation taking advantage of such annotations (e.g. a deformable part-based model, a deep convolutional neural network), and then assessing the reliability of such representation with the acquired data. In the last two decades most of the research efforts focused on representation learning (first, designing descriptors and learning classifiers; later doing it end-to-end). Hence, collecting data and, especially, annotating it, is essential for learning good representations. While this has been the case from the very beginning, only after the disruptive appearance of deep convolutional neural networks that it became a serious issue due to their data hungry nature. In this context, the problem is that manual data annotation is a tiresome work prone to errors. Accordingly, in the late 00's we initiated a research line consisting of training visual models using photo-realistic computer graphics, especially focusing on assisted and autonomous driving. In this paper, we summarize such a work and show how it has become a new tendency with increasing acceptance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Network fusion has been recently explored as an approach for improving pedestrian detection performance. However, most existing fusion methods suffer from runtime efficiency, modularity, scalability, and maintainability due to the complex structure of the entire fused models, their end-to-end training requirements, and sequential fusion process. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fusion framework that combines asymmetric inferences from object detectors and semantic segmentation networks for jointly detecting multiple pedestrians. This is achieved by introducing a consensus-based scoring method that fuses pair-wise pixel-relevant information from the object detector and the semantic segmentation network to boost the final confidence scores. The parallel implementation of the object detection and semantic segmentation networks in the proposed framework entails a low runtime overhead. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed fusion framework are extensively evaluated by fusing different state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors and semantic segmentation networks on a public dataset. The generalization of fused models is also examined on new cross pedestrian data collected through an autonomous car. Results show that the proposed fusion method significantly improves detection performance while achieving competitive runtime efficiency.

AB More efficient agricultural machinery is needed as agricultural areas become more limited and energy and labor costs increase. To increase their efficiency, trajectory tracking problem of an autonomous tractor, as an agricultural production machine, has been investigated in this study. As a widely used model-based approach, model predictive control is preferred in this paper to control the yaw dynamics of the tractor which can deal with the constraints on the states and the actuators in a system. The yaw dynamics is identified by using nonlinear least squares frequency domain system identification. The speed is controlled by a proportional integral derivative controller and a kinematic trajectory controller is used to calculate the desired speed and the desired yaw rate signals for the subsystems in order to minimize the tracking errors in both the longitudinal and transversal directions. The experimental results show the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed control scheme in which the euclidean error is below 40 cm for time-based straight line trajectories and 60 cm for time-based curved line trajectories, respectively.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has to solve two essential problems in underwater environment, namely, localization and mapping. SLAM is one novel solution to estimate locations and maps simultaneously based on motion models and sensor measurements. Sparse extended information filter (SEIF) is an effective algorithm to reduce storage and computational costs of large-scale maps in the SLAM problem. However, there exists the inconsistency in the SEIF since the rank of the observability matrix of linearized error-state model in SLAM system is higher than that of the nonlinear SLAM system. By analyzing the consistency of the SEIF-based SLAM from the perspective of observability, a SLAM based on SEIF with consistency constraint (SEIF-CC SLAM) is developed to improve the estimator's consistency. The proposed algorithm uses the first-ever available estimates to calculate SEIF Jacobians for each of the state variables, called the First Estimates Jacobian (FEJ). Then, the linearized error-state model can keep the same observability as the underlying nonlinear SLAM system. The capability of autonomous navigation with the proposed algorithm is validated through simulations experiments and sea trials for a C-Ranger AUV. Experimental results show that the proposed SEIF-CC SLAM algorithm yields more consistent and accurate estimates compared with the SEIF-based SLAM.

AB Two general-purpose mooring designs have been developed to support autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operations in autonomous ocean sampling networks (AOSNs). These moorings provide two-way communications between investigators and AUVs docked on the moorings or conducting survey operations some distance from the moorings. A deep-water design that incorporates an AUV dock and recharging station was built for use In the Labrador Sea during the winter of 1997/1998. This severe winter environment required a robust design that could operate unattended for six months while isolating the dock from surface wave motion. A much lighter, easier-to-deploy design was developed for use in coastal waters to extend the nearshore AOSN operating area by extending the communications network. This coastal design has been deployed without the dock component and has typically been configured for use in a small network of moorings maintained with a small research vessel. The deep-water mooring has been deployed successfully on two occasions, for short periods of time. The coastal moorings have been deployed a number of times and have proven to be quite effective. This paper describes the two moorings in detail and provides information on their performance so that interested investigators can utilize the technology where it meets their needs.

AB Global warming requires a changeover from fossil fuel based to renewable energy sources on the electrical supply side and electrification of the demand side. Due to the transient nature of renewables and fluctuating demand, buffer capacities are necessary to compensate for supply/demand imbalances. Battery energy storage systems are promising. However, the initial costs are high. Repurposing electric vehicle batteries can reduce initial costs. Further, storage design optimization could significantly improve costs. Therefore, a battery control algorithm was developed, and a simulation study was performed to identify the optimal storage design and its economic potential. The algorithm used is based on autonomous (on-site) optimization, which relies on an incentive determining the operation mode (charge, discharge, or idle). The incentive used was the historic day-ahead stock market price for electricity, and the resulting potential economic gains for different European countries were compared for the years 2015-2019. This showed that there is a correlation between economic gain, optimal storage design (capacity-to-power ratio), and the mean standard deviation, as well as the mean relative change of the different day-ahead prices. Low yearly mean standard deviations of about 0.5 Euro Cents per kWh battery capacity lead to yearly earnings of about 1 euro/kWh, deviations of 1 Euro Cent to 10 euro/kWh, and deviations of 2 Euro Cents to 20 euro/kWh. Small yearly mean relative changes, lower than 5%, lead to capacity-to-power ratios greater than 3, relative changes around 10% to an optimal capacity-to-power between 1.5 and 3, and for relative changes greater than 10% to an optimal capacity-to-power ratios of 1. While in countries like the United Kingdom, high potential earnings are expected, the economic prospective in countries like Norway is low due to limited day-ahead price performance.

AB Transportation plays a significant role in the global economy and society and takes part in a lot of different processes such as mass transportation and the supply chain. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce modern technologies in this area of the economy in the context of Industry 4.0. The main scope of this study is to develop a model that supports analyzing last-mile logistics modern solutions using the latest technologies such as road autonomous delivery robots (RADRs), civil drones, or smart bikes, and compare them to conventional solutions (delivery vehicles). Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was applied to build a formal comparison model that scores the solutions and weights different criteria according to decision-makers and placeholders, to rank the solutions from the most crucial option to the weakest in a predetermined scenario with set parameters and conditions (three varied scenarios were included in the present investigation). The results of the model were in favor of using civil drones or smart bicycles to perform light deliveries in small urban areas (these key findings support the assumptions that are often manifested in speech in the context of the use of new technologies). The modern solutions scored almost 40-80% higher in total in the conglomeration of assessment criteria (such as safety, economy, laws and regulations, operation time for the delivery, environment, and payload) than the conventional solution, which indicates the importance of studying the implementation of such technologies. An interesting result of the study is the operational cost reduction by ca. 60-74% in favor of autonomous delivery robots, 89-93% in favor of civil delivery drones, and 87-90% in favor of smart bikes vs. conventional delivery trucks/vans. Yet, it should be underlined that the results may vary with different assumptions within the MCDA method.

AB Construction signs alert drivers to the dangers of abnormally blocked roads. In the case of autonomous vehicles, construction signs should be detected automatically to prevent accidents. One might think that we can accomplish the goal easily using the popular deep-learning-based detectors, but it is not the case. To train the deep learning detectors to detect construction signs, we need a large amount of training images which contain construction signs. However, collecting training images including construction signs is very difficult in the real world because construction events do not occur frequently. To make matters worse, the construction signs might have dozens of different construction signs (i.e., contents). To address this problem, we propose a new method named content swapping. Our content swapping divides a construction sign into two parts: the board and the frame. Content swapping generates numerous synthetic construction signs by combining the board images (i.e., contents) taken from the in-domain images and the frames (i.e., geometric shapes) taken from the out-domain images. The generated synthetic construction signs are then added to the background road images via the cut-and-paste mechanism, increasing the number of training images. Furthermore, three fine-tuning methods regarding the region, size, and color of the construction signs are developed to make the generated training images look more realistic. To validate our approach, we applied our method to real-world images captured in South Korea. Finally, we achieve an average precision (AP(50)) score of 84.98%, which surpasses that of the off-the-shelf method by 9.15%. Full experimental results are available online as a supplemental video. The images used in the experiments are also released as a new dataset CSS138 for the benefit of the autonomous driving community.

AB As one of the important enabling techniques for 6G, wireless caching network (WCN) attracts significant attentions. In this paper, we jointly apply unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in WCN. Our aim is to minimize the user delay, which is decomposed into three sub-problems, i.e., UAV deployment, hybrid beamforming and power allocation. Firstly, to improve the user rate, we apply K-means to reduce the distance between UAVs and users and propose a user pairing method to maintain the channel gain gap in each pair. Then, for increasing UAV hit probability, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and zero forcing are used for analog beamforming and digital beamforming, respectively. Finally, to further improve the user data rate, the genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to calculate the optimal NOMA power allocation factors. Simulation results confirm that the proposed schemes can achieve lower user delay compared with baseline schemes.

AB This paper presents an inverted ultra-short baseline (iUSBL) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) with current compensation. The complexity of the underwater environment prevents using a Global Positioning System (GPS) or visible-light cameras. Therefore, we rely on an acoustic positioning system to achieve autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation relative to the beacons. Our system uses an AUV equipped with a time-synchronized iUSBL array to measure the range and angle between the vehicle and acoustic beacons via one-way travel-time. Then, we propose UKF-based online SLAM to filter these acoustic measurements, and add the compensation for inherent underwater current. Compared to traditional SLAM applications usually involving many landmarks, this iUSBL acoustic system requires only sparse beacons to estimate the vehicle pose. Consequently, it does not cause UKF to have an excessive computational burden. Numerical results confirm the validity of the proposed method. In particular, the proposed algorithm prevents cumulative errors from proliferating quite well when using double beacons.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Terrain-aided navigation (TAN) is a promising technique to determine the location of underwater vehicle by matching terrain measurement against a known map. The particle filter (PF) is a natural choice for TAN because of its ability to handle non-linear, multimodal problems. However, the terrain measurements are vulnerable to outliers, which will cause the PF to degrade or even diverge. Modification of the Gaussian likelihood function by using robust cost functions is a way to reduce the effect of outliers on an estimate. The authors propose to use the Huber function to modify the measurement model used to set importance weights in a PF. They verify their method in simulations of multi-beam sonar in a real underwater digital map. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust to outliers than the standard PF (SPF).

AB This paper shows that automated driving can lead both, to growth and decline of cities. We simulate spatial effects of automated driving for the Netherlands using LUCA, the Dutch spatial general equilibrium model. Two components of automation are accounted for: (i) more productive time use during car trips; (ii) fast and comfortable door-to-door automated public transit. We find that the car component results in population flight from cities, while the public transit component leads to population clustering in urban areas. A combination of the two may result in the population concentrating in the largest, most attractive cities, at the expense of smaller cities and non-urban regions. The simulations suggest that welfare benefits of automation are considerable, with up to 10% coming from population relocation and changes in land use. Our results are particularly relevant for countries where public transit claims a considerable share of urban mobility. Neglecting the impact of vehicle automation on public transit could result in biased policy recommendations.

AB In smart ocean Internet of Things (IoT) systems, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are responsible for underwater information collection. Due to the nature of the medium, the acoustic communications for AUVs are of low bandwidth and adverse environmental conditions causing severe transmission problems. In order to realize cross-media transmission from AUVs to the offshore platform, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have been suggested to forward the collected information in a coordinated manner. Against this backdrop, this contribution develops a cooperative USV-to-USV (U2U) cross-media cooperative communications scheme. Then, we formulate a rate maximization problem with the objective of optimizing the reputation-aware USV selection strategy. Furthermore, to characterize the impact of the mobility of AUVs/USVs, a long-term dynamic process is constructed. Meanwhile, we also develop an efficient algorithm which transforms the reputation-aided dynamic USVs selection problem into the infinite-time horizon average one restricted by time average rate constraints in the collection of penalty processes with the help of the Lyapunov optimization framework and drift-plus-penalty method. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the convergence behavior and the performance for the designed dynamic USVs selection algorithm.

AB Electromobility and autonomous driving has started a transformation in the automotive industry, resulting in new requirements for vehicle systems. Due to its functions, the electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture is one of the essential systems. Zonal E/E architecture is a promising approach to tackle this issue. The research presented in this paper describes a methodology for determining the optimal number of zones, the position of the zone control units (ZCU), and the assignment of electric components to these zones and ZCUs. Therefore, the design of the power supply and the wiring harness is essential. This approach aims to identify the most suitable system architecture for a given vehicle geometry and a set of electric components. For this purpose, the assignment of electric components is accomplished by k-means clustering, and Dijkstra's algorithm is used to optimize the cable routing. As ZCUs will be the hubs for the in-vehicle data and information transport in zonal architectures, their position and their number are crucial for the architecture and wiring harness development. Simulations show a suitable zonal architecture reduces wiring harness length as well as weight and brings functional benefits. However, the number of zones must be chosen with care, as there may also be functional limitations.

AB Compared with traditional vehicle transportation methods, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have many advantages in transporting cargo because they are not limited by factors such as road traffic. To address practical applications, this paper presents a local obstacle avoidance control scheme for the quadrotor with suspended payload, which is suitable for complex environments with dense obstacles and external disturbances. Firstly, the overall dynamic model of the quadrotor-payload system is established using Euler-Lagrange equations. Secondly, considering the envelope circle radius switching problem caused by changes in the amplitude of the swing angles of the payload, an obstacle avoidance constraint of the quadrotor-payload system is presented, and an R-function is introduced to improve the traditional artificial potential field method, so as to achieve a less conservative obstacle avoidance. Thirdly, a cascade control scheme based on sliding mode algorithm is designed for the quadrotor-payload system trajectory tracking under external disturbances. Moreover, to avoid payload oscillations during flight, a feed-forward controller is designed to suppress the swing of the payload. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed local obstacle avoidance strategy and control scheme.

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in different areas of applications such as rescue operations, surveillance, agriculture, aerial mapping, engineering applications and research, among others, in order to perform tasks with greater efficiency. This work focuses on the use of UAVs in the fishing sector in order to optimise the detection process of a shoal of fish. In this sense, the main idea is to perform images recognition using the images acquired through videos captured by UAV in the open sea; to achieve the objective the convolutional neural networks were used, a new dataset with different images captured through UAV videos in the open sea were taken into account, these classes correspond to dolphin, dolphin_pod, open_sea, and seabirds. The training tests were by transfer of learning using the following models: Inception V3, MobileNet V2, and NASNet-A (large) trained on TensorFlow platform. The experimental results show the detection performance with high-precision values in reasonable processing time. This study ends with a critical discussion of the experimental results.

AB As vehicles of the future take on more of the driving responsibility and the role of the driver transitions into more of a monitoring capacity, the traditional notions of interruption and attention management needs to be reconsidered for automated vehicles. We argue that the transfer of control between the automated vehicle and the human driver can be considered as an interruption handling process, and that this process goes through a series of ten explicit stages. Each stage has its own characteristics and implications for practice and future research. Therefore, in this paper we identify for each stage what is known from theory, together with important implications for safety, design, and future research, especially for human-machine interaction. More generally, the framework makes explicit that it is not appropriate to think of transfer of control as a single event or even small set of events. The framework also highlights that it might not be realistic to expect human drivers to immediately respond correctly to a system initiated request to transfer control, given that humans interleave their attention between non-driving and driving tasks, and given that a transition constitutes of multiple stages. These nuances are accounted for in the framework.

AB Autonomous bridge inspection operations using unmanned aerial vehicles take multiple task assignments and constraints into account. To efficiently execute the operations, a schedule is required. Generating a cost optimum schedule of multiple-unmanned aerial vehicle operations is known to be Non-deterministic Polynomial-time (NP)-hard. This study approaches such a problem with heuristic-based algorithms to get a high-quality feasible solution in a short computation time. A constructive heuristic called Retractable Chain Task Assignment algorithm is presented to build an evaluable schedule from a task sequence. The task sequence representation is used during the search to perform seamless operations. Retractable Chain Task Assignment algorithm calculates and incorporates slack time to the schedule according to the properties of the task. The slack time acts as a cushion which makes the schedule delay-tolerant. This algorithm is incorporated with a metaheuristic algorithm called Multi-strategy Coevolution to search the solution space. The proposed algorithm is verified through numerical simulations, which take inputs from real flight test data. The obtained solutions are evaluated based on the makespan, battery consumption, computation time, and the robustness level of the schedules. The performance of Multi-strategy Coevolution is compared to Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Differential Evolution-Fused Particle Swarm Optimization. The simulation results show that Multistrategy Coevolution gives better objective values than the other algorithms.

AB Bird roadkill occurences in Aragon, Spain. The increase in road networks and vehicular traffic has posed a major threat to vertebrates over the last century. Although it is difficult to determine the annual number of avian-vehicle collisions, 2 to 9 million roadkills have been estimated for Europe, with numbers varying from country to country. Few studies have been conducted at a national or regional level in Spain. In this study we used data from La Alfranca Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre database to determine location, season and incidence of avian-vehicle collisions in the autonomous county of Aragon (Spain). A total of 643 wild birds representing 71 species were killed on roads between 2012 and 2014. Nine of these species have a high incidence of avian-vehicle collisions, four a moderate incidence, and 57 a low incidence. The species with the highest incidence was the griffon vulture (120 individuals). Spatial distribution of avian-vehicle collisions was heterogeneous, and the incidence was highest in July, August and September. We identified 41 reas of high roadkill occurrence, using a number of roadkills per km index (RI): 28 in the province of Zaragoza, nine in Huesca and four in Teruel. Management strategies are proposed to reduce this threat on wild birds.

AB Based on an integral backstepping approach, a trajectory-tracking control algorithm is proposed for an underactuated unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) sailing in the presence of ocean-current disturbance. Taking into consideration the UMV model's fore/aft asymmetry, a nonlinear three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) underactuated dynamic model is established for the horizontal plane. First, trajectory-tracking differences between controllers designed based on symmetric and asymmetric models of the UMV are discussed. In order to explicitly study the effect of ocean-current interference on the trajectory-tracking controller, the ocean current is integrated into the kinematic and dynamic models of the UMV. Detailed descriptions of distinct trajectory-tracking control performances in the presence of different ocean-current velocities and direction angles are presented. The well-known persistent exciting (PE) condition is completely released in the designed trajectory-tracking controller. A mild integral item of trajectory tracking error is merged into the control law, and global stability analysis of the UMV system is carried out using Lyapunov theory and Barbalat's Lemma. Simulation experiments in the semi-physical simulation platform are implemented to confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the excogitated control algorithm.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) have been around for more than a hundred years. Nevertheless, their deployment has not been a sustainable success up until now. Many scientists, engineers and policymakers argue that EVs are a promising, maybe even indispensable option to achieve ambitious decarbonization goals, if powered by electricity from renewable energy sources. At the moment, the EVs market is gaining a lot of momentum and we may be near the point of no return for a sustained mass market deployment of electric vehicles. Many papers exist that describe future prospects of EVs. In our commentary we try to provide a bigger picture view and look at market and societal aspects. We analyze why previous generations of EVs were not successful and how current electric vehicles could become a sustainable success. We perform a semi-quantitative Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) analysis and find that current electric vehicle designs are technologically on par with or better than conventional alternatives. Car buyers go electric when the economics make sense to them. We conclude that incentives are needed for electric vehicles until battery costs lower as much as to allow EVs to become cheaper from a total cost of ownership (TCO) perspective, than other alternatives. Other policy measures are needed to overcome remaining barriers, especially in supporting the setup and operation of publicly accessible recharging points to overcome range anxiety. EVs in isolation may not be the next mobility killer app. The real next mobility killer app may emerge as an autonomous shared EV in a world where the border between public and private transport will cease to exist. The findings of our commentary are relevant for scientists, policymakers and industry.

AB In this study, we aim to design, simulate and build an autonomous underwater robot with constrained number of control input. A one degree-of-freedom (DOF) input robot whose control output come in three-DOF underwater position is created and tested through simulation and experiment. The robot has a tube-like shape with a vertical pathway inside for pushing water through using a motorized propeller as its only actuator, making '1-DOF input'. Despite constraining to one actuator, three different patterns of input by the difference of motor actuation are used to get various output underwater. When the motor rotates forward, the water is pushed upward and the robot moves downward. With backward rotation, the robot rotates around the vertical axis to change orientation. Lastly, when the motor stops, the robot floats with strong buoyancy. In addition, some weights are placed on its body for asymmetrical trajectory. Following a formation of design and mechanism, a model is derived. A simulation is carried out to verify the ability of the proposed model. Then, a test robot is built and tested in a real water tank. Both the simulation and experiment results support the proposal, showing that the robot can travel in 3-DOF with the limited inputs.

AB Sonar sensors are universally applied in autonomous vehicles such as robots and driverless cars as they are inexpensive, energy-efficient, and provide accurate range measurements; however, they have some limitations. Their measurements can lead to ambiguous estimates and echo clutter can hamper target detection. In nature, echolocating bats experience similar problems when searching for food, especially if their food source is close to vegetation, as is the case for gleaning bats and nectar-feeding bats. However, nature has come up with solutions to overcome clutter problems and acoustically guide bats. Several bat-pollinated plants have evolved specially shaped floral parts that act as sonar reflectors, making the plants acoustically conspicuous. Here we show that artificial sonar beacons inspired by floral shapes streamline the navigation efficacy of sonar-guided robot systems. We developed floral-inspired reflector forms and demonstrate their functionality in 2 proof-of-principle experiments. First we show that the reflectors are easily recognized among dense clutter, and second we show that it is possible to discern different reflector shapes and use this identification to guide a robot through an unfamiliar environment. Bioinspired sonar reflectors could have a wide range of applications that could significantly advance sonar-guided systems.

ID ACCEPTANCE; UTAUT
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a new, growing segment of transportation research. While there have been prior studies and deployments of AVs worldwide, full autonomy in bus transit has gained interest among researchers and practitioners within the last decade, which presents an opportunity to synthesize early trends. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide a review of the latest research on fully autonomous buses to summarize findings and identify gaps needing future research. Forty studies were reviewed in detail, and five main themes were identified, which are (1) technology deployment; (2) user acceptance; (3) safety; (4) social and economic aspects; and (5) regulations, policies, and legal issues. The results reveal that most prior studies have focused on technology development, and the area of regulation and policy would benefit from additional study. Noteworthy differences between research in Europe and the United States were also identified. In Europe, large funded projects involving real-world deployments have focused on user acceptance, security and safety, costs, and related legal issues, whereas in the United States, research has primarily concentrated on simulation modelling with limited real-world deployments. The results of this review are important for policy-makers and researchers as AV technology continues to evolve and become more widely available.

AB This paper presents the results and subsequent analysis of full-scale excavation experiments aimed at developing a practical understanding of how actuator forces evolve during excavation and how they relate to the interactions that occur between an excavator's end-effector and its environment. Our focus is on the excavation problem for fragmented rock, as is common in mining and construction applications. Based on an analysis of the experimental data, an example admittance-type autonomous excavation controller is postulated.
   Note to Practitioners - This paper was motivated by the problem of autonomously excavating a pile of fragmented rock using a load-haul-dump (LHD) machine, as is common in underground hard-rock mining. In this case, automation serves to remove human operators from hazardous environments underground, as well as to increase productivity by improving utilization and reducing wear on the excavator. In this paper, we take a first step toward the development of a system for autonomous excavation by performing experiments using a ten-tonne capacity machine to excavate fragmented rock taken from an underground mine in Canada. By measuring the status of various vehicle parameters during the excavation process, we reveal a useful characterization of this process based on hydraulic cylinder pressures.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; IMPACT
AB An increasing number of companies develop innovative vehicle solutions to further sustainable transportation. One promising direction is the combination of automated, connected, electric and shared (ACES) vehicles. Due to the multitude of stakeholders involved in such an undertaking and their diverging interests, capabilities and roles, a shared vision is essential to foster productive collaboration. This study takes a brand development perspective and evaluates the degree to which stakeholders align regarding the ambition, potential and strategic pathway of the ACES brand. An expert survey involving 28 ACES stakeholders identifies numerous themes on which stakeholders agree, for example, the potential social and environmental benefits of ACES, but also a number where they disagree, for example, the legitimacy of different stakeholders in managing the stakeholder network or the degree to which all four technologies are necessary to create more sustainable mobility solutions. Consequently, the research proposes a shared brand understanding for ACES to help align the often conflicting expectations of different stakeholders. The key recommendation is to ask consumers and cities to play a central role in fostering stronger co-creation and cooperation within the stakeholder network. While the former group is essential to motivate technology providers to continue research efforts, the latter plays a decisive role in creating a regulatory framework that enhances the appeal of ACES in comparison to alternative modes of transport. Further research is necessary to understand the most appealing incentives (whether economic, social or moral) to leverage joint efforts in shaping the ACES brand.

ID HEURISTIC ALGORITHMS; CHALLENGES
AB The needs-oriented expansion and maintenance of vehicle functions through software updates will increase drastically due to current megatrends such as autonomous driving or connected car services. Both, shorter innovation cycles and increasing software volumes resulting from these megatrends, increase update frequency and duration equally. Consequently, a reduction of update duration will become even more important in the future. Popular literature has shown that in a vehicle-internal network of up to 100 electronic control units (ECUs), the parallelization of individual ECU updates has great potential to reduce the total update duration. However, the methods presented so far do not show an optimal parallel scheduling algorithm that uses the full potential of the vehicle-internal network. In addition, some of the approaches are also limited to certain bus systems or do not have an automated parallelization strategy based on ECU requirements. The approach introduced here uses a high abstraction model for optimal parallel ECU software update scheduling. For this purpose, we developed two scheduling algorithms, one as a mixed-integer linear program and the other as a hybrid algorithm. We verified our approach in a real testing environment with up to 20 ECUs regarding update duration and computation time. Evaluation shows that the reprogramming time can be reduced by up to 77% compared to sequential update processing through optimal parallelization. Furthermore, the model is very easy to adapt to different and new vehicle generations due to its high abstraction.

AB In automatic guidance of agriculture vehicles, lateral control is not the only requirement. Much research work has been focused on trajectory tracking control which can provide high longitudinal-lateral control accuracy. Satisfactory results have been reported as soon as vehicles move without sliding. But unfortunately pure rolling constraints are not always satisfied especially in agriculture applications where working conditions are rough and not predictable. In this paper the problem of trajectory tracking control of autonomous farm vehicles in the presence of sliding is addressed. To take sliding effects into account, three variables which characterize sliding effects are introduced into the kinematic model based on geometric and velocity constraints. With a linearized approximation, a refined kinematic model is obtained in which sliding effects appear as additive unknown parameters to the ideal kinematic model. By an integrating parameter adaptation technique with a backstepping method, a stepwise procedure is proposed to design a robust adaptive controller in which time-invariant sliding is compensated for by parameter adaptation and time-varying sliding is corrected by a Variable Structure Controller (VSC). It is theoretically proven that for farm vehicles subjected to sliding, the longitudinal-lateral deviations can be stabilized near zero and the orientation errors converge into a neighborhood near the origin. To be more realistic for agriculture applications, an adaptive controller with projection mapping is also proposed. Both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed (robust) adaptive controllers can guarantee high trajectory tracking accuracy regardless of sliding. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB A new intelligent adaptive control scheme was proposed that combines the control based on interference observer and fuzzy adaptive s-curve for flight path tracking control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The most important contribution is that the control configurations don't need to know the uncertainty limit of the vehicle and the influence of interference is removed. The proposed control law is an integration of fuzzy control estimator and adaptive proportional integral (PI) compensator with input. The rated feedback drive specifies the desired dynamic properties of the closed control loop based on the known properties of the preferred acceleration vector. At the same time, the adaptive PI control compensate for the unknown of perturbation. Additional terms such as s-surface control can ensure rapid convergence due to the non-linear representation on the surface and also improve the stability. In addition, the observer improves the robustness of the adaptive fuzzy system. It has been proven that the stability of the regulatory system can be ensured according to linear matrix equality based Lyapunov's theory. In summary, the numerical simulation results show the efficiency and the feasibility by the use of the robust control methodology.

AB Over the past 10 years there has been a growing body of research into modeling and describing driving behavior, particularly for situations that occur on motorways. This interest has arisen from the need to assess safety and capacity benefits that could be produced by changes to road design, operation, signage, and in-vehicle advanced transport telematics, such as collision warning (CW) or autonomous cruise control. For the most part these investigations have focused on "close" or "car" following, which describes the maintenance of a time- or distance-based following headway. However, often overlooked, and of equal importance, is the "approach" process, describing how a driver decelerates when approaching a slower vehicle. There are several competing theories of the behavioral basis underlying this process, including, for example, those based on time-to-collision or optic flow. There are, however, very few data against which such models can be assessed and systems designed. Presented are the results from an exploratory, instrumented vehicle study designed to assess approach mechanisms. The two key features of the process are explored: the circumstances under which driver deceleration is instigated, and the process governing the control of the deceleration itself. Finally, there is a brief assessment of the implications of these findings for the design of CW systems, in which realistic warnings may prove vital to their acceptance by the driving public.

AB In recent years, many studies have used poor cognitive functions to explain risk safety differences among drivers. Working memory is a cognitive function with information storage and attentional control that plays a crucial role in driver information processing. Furthermore, it is inextricably linked to parameters such as driving perfor-mance, driving eye movements and driving neurophysiology, which have a significant impact on drivers' risky behavior and crash risk. In particular, crash risk is a serious risk to social safety and economic development. For this reason, it is necessary to understand how risk-related working memory affects driving so that pre-driving safety pre-training programs and in-vehicle safety assistance systems for driving can be developed accord-ingly, contributing to the development of semi-autonomous vehicles and even autonomous vehicles. In this paper, a systematic search of the literature over the past 23 years resulted in 78 articles that met the eligibility criteria and quality assessment. The results show that higher working memory capacity, as measured neuro-psychologically, is associated with more consistent and safer driving-related parameters for drivers (e.g., lane keeping) and may be related to pupil dilation during risk perception while driving, which is associated with driving outcomes (tickets, pull-overs, penalty points and fines,and driving accidents) is closely related to the perceived usefulness of the human-machine interface, reaction time, standard deviation of steering wheel cor-ners, etc. when the autonomous driving takes over. In addition, higher working memory load interference was associated with more inconsistent and unsafe driving-related parameters (including but not limited to eye movements, electrophysiology, etc.), with higher working memory load being associated with easier driver concentration on the road, faster heart rate, lower heart rate variability, and lower oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (DeoxyHb). Only a limited number of studies have simultaneously investigated the relation-ship between working memory capacity, working memory load and driving, showing an interaction between working memory capacity and working memory load on lane change initiation and lane change correctness, with working memory capacity acting as a covariate that mediated the effect of working memory load on braking reaction time. In addition, working memory-related cognitive training had a transfer effect on improving driving ability. Overall, working memory capacity determines the upper limit of the number of working memory attention resources, while working memory load occupies part of the working memory attention resources, thus influencing information perception, decision judgment, operational response, and collision avoidance in driving. Future effective interventions for safe driving can be combined with capacity training and load alerting. These findings contribute to our understanding of the role of working memory in driving and provide new insights into the design of driver safety training programs and automated driving personalized in-vehicle safety systems and roadside devices such as signage.

AB Based on the characteristics of the 5 G standard defined in Release 17 by 3GPP and that of the emerging Beyond 5 G (or the so-called 6 G) network, cyber-physical systems (CPSs) used in smart transport network infrastructures, such as connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), will significantly depend on the cellular networks. The 5 G and Beyond 5 G (or 6 G) will operate over millimetre-wave (mmWave) bands. These network standards require suitable path loss (PL) models to guarantee effective communication over the network standards of CAV. The existing PL models suffer heavy signal losses and interferences at mmWave bands and may not be suitable for cyber-physical (CP) signal propagation. This paper develops an Agile Gravitational Search Algorithm (AGSA) that mitigates the PL and signal interference problems in the 5G-NR network for CAV. On top of that, a modified Okumura-Hata model (OHM) suitable for deployment in CP terrestrial mobile networks is derived for the CAVCPS application. These models are tested on the real-world 5 G infrastructure. Results from the simulated models are compared with measured data for the modified, enhanced model and four other existing models. The comparative evaluation shows that the modified OHM and AGSA performed better than existing OHM, COST, and ECC-33 models by 90%. Also, the modified OHM demonstrated reduced signal interference compared to the existing models. In terms of optimisation validation, the AGSA scheme outperforms the Genetic algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimisation, and OHM models by at least 57.43%. On top of that, the enhanced AGSA outperformed existing PL (i.e., Okumura, Egli, Ericson 999, and ECC-33 models) by at least 67%, thus presenting the potential for efficient service provisioning in 5G-NR driverless car applications.

AB Monitoring provides important information for the planning and execution of marine environment preservation operations. Posidonia oceanica is one of the principal bioindicators in Mediterranean coastal areas and regular monitoring activities play a crucial role in its conservation. However, an efficient observation of vast areas colonised with P. oceanica is extremely challenging and it currently requires tedious and time consuming diving activities. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) endowed with optical sensors could represent a viable solution in carrying out visual inspection surveys. Nevertheless, AUVs are usually programmed to perform pre-defined trajectories, which are not effective for seagrass monitoring applications, as meadows may be fragmented and their contours may be irregular. This work proposes a framework based on machine learning and computer vision that enables an AUV equipped with a down-looking camera to autonomously inspect the boundary of P. oceanica meadows to obtain an initial estimate of the meadow size. The proposed boundary inspection solution is composed of three main modules: (1) an image segmentation relying on a Mask R CNN model to recognise P. oceanica in underwater images, (2) a boundary tracking strategy that generates guidance references to track P. oceanica contours, (3) a loop closure detector fusing visual and navigation information to identify when a meadow boundary has been completely explored. The image segmentation model and the visual part of the loop closure detection module were validated on real underwater images. The overall inspection framework was tested in a realistic simulation environment, using mosaics obtained from real images to replicate the actual monitoring scenarios. The results show that the proposed solution enables the AUV to autonomously accomplish the boundary inspection task of P. oceanica meadows, therefore representing an effective tool towards the conservation and protection of marine environments.

AB Maritime transportation is vital to the global economy. With the increased operating and labor costs of maritime transportation, autonomous shipping has attracted much attention in both industry and academia. Autonomous shipping can not only reduce the marine accidents caused by human factors but also save labor costs. Path planning is one of the key technologies to enable the autonomy of ships. However, mainstream ship path planning focuses on searching for the shortest path and controlling the vehicle in order to track it. Such path planning methods may lead to a dynamically infeasible trajectory that fails to avoid obstacles or reduces fuel efficiency. This paper presents a data-driven, efficient, and safe path planning (ESP) method that considers ship dynamics to provide a real-time optimal trajectory generation. The optimization objectives include fuel consumption and trajectory smoothness. Furthermore, ESP is capable of fast replanning when encountering obstacles. ESP consists of three components: (1) A path search method that finds an optimal search path with the minimum number of sharp turns from the geographic data collected by the geographic information system (GIS); (2) a minimum-snap trajectory optimization formulation with dynamic ship constraints to provide a smooth and collision-free trajectory with minimal fuel consumption; (3) a local trajectory replanner based on B-spline to avoid unexpected obstacles in real time. We evaluate the performance of ESP by data-driven simulations. The geographical data have been collected and updated from GIS. The results show that ESP can plan a global trajectory with safety, minimal turning points, and minimal fuel consumption based on the maritime information provided by nautical charts. With the long-range perception of onboard radars, the ship can avoid unexpected obstacles in real time on the planned global course.

AB Objective
   The objective of this study is to estimate the potential safety benefits of Emergency Lane Keeping (ELK) and Autonomous Emergency Steering (AES) systems with precise and reliable lateral positioning.
   Methods
   The material comprised in-depth studies of fatal road crashes in Sweden in 2017. Crashes resulting in passenger car occupant fatality (n = 114) were included; single vehicle (n = 60) and head-on (n = 31), intersection (n = 9), rear-end (n = 5), overtaking (n = 5), animal (n = 1), other (n = 1, U-turn), and train (n = 2). Additionally, fatal collisions between motor vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRUs) were included; pedestrians (n = 36), cyclists/moped users (n = 15), and motorcyclists (n = 17). A case-by-case analysis was conducted to identify crashes potentially prevented by ELK and AES with precise (within 0.1 m accuracy) and reliable lateral positioning. The identified crashes potentially avoided by ELK systems involved unintentional drift-out-of-lane on roads with posted speed limits of >= 70 km/h (43 mph). For comparison, the same material was used to identify the potential safety benefits of the more traditional lane departure warning (LDW) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) systems without enhanced lateral positioning. Crashes potentially avoided by LDW/LKA occurred on roads with visible lane markings and without rumble strips on the departure side while ELK with enhanced lateral positioning is not reliant on lane markings. Collisions potentially avoided by AES occurred on roads with sufficient escape zones and road friction.
   Results
   The study shows that ELK systems with enhanced lateral positioning could potentially avoid 33 - 45 (36 - 49%) out of 91 head-on and single car crashes resulting in passenger car occupant fatality, which corresponds to a further 18% (5/28) compared to traditional lane support (LDW/LKA) without enhanced lateral positioning. The improved lane keeping addresses crashes involving absent or nonvisible lane markings that are covered by snow. Furthermore, the study shows that the evasive steering features of AES systems with enhanced lateral positioning could potentially prevent 28 (54%) out of 52 collisions resulting in passenger car occupant fatalities (i.e., head-on, intersection, rear-end, overtaking, and animal collision). Additionally, AES with enhanced lateral positioning could potentially prevent 16 (31%) out of 51 collisions between motor vehicles and vulnerable road users resulting in fatally injured pedestrians, cyclists or moped users. The total potential safety benefits of AES include both lane keeping and evasive steering features including lane escaping. The study identified that the total number of crashes potentially avoided by AES corresponds to 42% out of all crashes resulting in passenger car occupant fatalities (n = 48/114).
   Conclusions
   This is a first attempt to identify and quantify the increase in potential safety benefits, based on the assumption that robust lateral vehicle positioning has been applied to lane keeping as well as lane escaping. In addition to the potentially increased number of prevented crashes compared to traditional lane support, a robust lateral positioning system may have the potential to improve the redundancy in positioning systems. Previous research suggests several techniques to improve lateral vehicle positioning.
   However, further research is required, including testing for implementation of adequately improved lateral vehicle awareness to establish which techniques are appropriate.

AB Speed planning system is generally equipped for intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs). Under the circumstances of autonomous driving, an energy-optimal speed trajectory is usually desired, particularly on urban arterial roads with complex traffic conditions involved. However, the existing speed planning solutions in the literature have not dealt with the problem of time consuming. Also, the ego vehicle could not perfectly track a precalculated speed reference because of the dynamically varying traffic. Thus, optimal speed planning cannot always be guaranteed. In this article, a fast optimal speed planning system for complex urban driving situations is established through an adaptive hierarchical control framework. In the planning layer, dynamic programming (DP) and the interior-point optimizer are jointly used to compute the global speed trajectory with access to signal phase and timing (SPaT) information. The computational burden is greatly alleviated based on a weighted orientation graph assumption and problem decomposition. The following layer utilizes the Informer, which is a transformer-based model, to predict preceding vehicle speed. Then, a target-switching model-predictive controller (MPC) is adopted for global speed trajectory following and adaption. The proposed approach significantly reduces speed planning computation time compared to previous solutions. Simulation results based on real road traffic scenes manifest that 22.0% of energy is saved compared with human driving.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) have potential to impact transportation, mobility, and society considerably in the future. Many beliefs surrounding this technology are criticized as "misconceptions" by transport experts, developers, journalists, and communicators. Understanding how the public views these beliefs offers insights for improving public communication and policymaking. We conducted the first study on views of 24 of these beliefs, including 21 arguable misconceptions (seven optimistic beliefs, 10 pessimistic beliefs, two beliefs of low requirements for AVs, two beliefs of high requirements for AVs) and three factual misconceptions about current AVs (e.g., "AVs are already available in the market"). During June 2020, Chinese participants (N = 1209) rated their agreement with these beliefs. They reached consensus on 16 beliefs. More than 50% of participants rejected nine beliefs and supported seven beliefs. They had some misconceptions about AVs. Nearly one third believed that AVs are already available in the market. Four classes of participants emerged through latent class analysis, labeled as "don't know" (19.2%), "neutral to positive" (32.6%), "naive enthusiasts" (28.3%), and "sober skeptics" (19.9%). Comparison of the latter two classes demonstrated the irony that those holding more misconceptions about AVs were more receptive to AVs, whereas those holding fewer misconceptions about AVs were more skeptical about AVs. Knowing more about AVs was associated viewing AVs more negatively. Effective public communication is urgent to dispel myths about AVs and prevent AV technology from becoming controversial.

AB This paper describes the design, development, and implementation of a high-precision autonomous docking control system for a container truck based on a digital twin approach. The digital twin is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the physical truck and to design the controller by providing a virtual platform to test, validate, and optimize control strategies and algorithms before their deployment in the actual system. To this end, a cascade of a nonlinear observer and an unscented Kalman filter is used to estimate the state variables of the physical truck for point-stabilization and orientation controls during the autonomous docking process. The docking motion involves two stabilization problems: point stabilization for smooth motion from the initial configuration to the docking slot, and orientation control to deliver the container truck to the final docking position with a margin of error of 5 cm for position and 0.0087 rad for orientation. The stability of both controllers is investigated, and simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method in a container terminal environment.

AB Vision-based autonomous driving through imitation learning mimics the behavior of human drivers by mapping driver view images to driving actions. This article shows that performance can be enhanced via the use of eye gaze. Previous research has shown that observing an expert's gaze patterns can be beneficial for novice human learners. We show here that neural networks can also benefit. We trained a conditional generative adversarial network to estimate human gaze maps accurately from driver-view images. We describe two approaches to integrating gaze information into imitation networks: eye gaze as an additional input and gaze modulated dropout. Both significantly enhance generalization to unseen environments in comparison with a baseline vanilla network without gaze, but gaze-modulated dropout performs better. We evaluated performance quantitatively on both single images and in closed-loop tests, showing that gaze modulated dropout yields the lowest prediction error, the highest success rate in overtaking cars, the longest distance between infractions, lowest epistemic uncertainty, and improved data efficiency. Using Grad-CAM, we show that gaze modulated dropout enables the network to concentrate on task-relevant areas of the image.

AB To reach a higher level of autonomy for unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) in air combat games, this paper builds an autonomous maneuver decision system. In this system, the air combat game is regarded as a Markov process, so that the air combat situation can be effectively calculated via Bayesian inference theory. According to the situation assessment result, adaptively adjusts the weights of maneuver decision factors, which makes the objective function more reasonable and ensures the superiority situation for UCAV. As the air combat game is characterized by highly dynamic and a significant amount of uncertainty, to enhance the robustness and effectiveness of maneuver decision results, fuzzy logic is used to build the functions of four maneuver decision factors. Accuracy prediction of opponent aircraft is also essential to ensure making a good decision; therefore, a prediction model of opponent aircraft is designed based on the elementary maneuver method. Finally, the moving horizon optimization strategy is used to effectively model the whole air combat maneuver decision process. Various simulations are performed on typical scenario test and close-in dogfight, the results sufficiently demonstrate the superiority of the designed maneuver decision method.

AB In this work, we present a novel fault tolerant leader-follower formation control scheme for a group of underactuated autonomous surface vessels with partially known control input gain functions, where the line-of-sight (LOS) range and angle tracking errors are required to be constrained. Both parametric system uncertainties with time-varying unknown functions and nonparametric system uncertainties satisfying norm-bounded conditions are discussed. To address LOS range and angle constraints and finite time convergence, time-varying tan-type barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs) are incorporated with the control scheme. For the formation control, only measurements of LOS range and angle are used for control implementation, no other information about the leader is required. We show that under the proposed control method, despite the presence of actuator faults and system uncertainties, the formation tracking errors can converge into arbitrarily small neighborhoods around zero in finite time, while the constraint requirements on the LOS range and angle will not be violated. All closed loop signals are bounded. Simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sensors are crucial for the control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, sensor faults will inevitably appear over time. Therefore, it is important to develop a sensor fault detection approach for the reliability of UAV. This article presents a novel model-based UAV fault detection approach based on quadratic Kalman filter (QKF). First, an accurate kinematic and dynamic model of UAVs is established, where the model is linearized and discretized for Kalman filter (KF). Second, the first KF is used for denoising, the secondKF is used to detrend, and residuals are calculated for detection. It is worth mentioning that the second KF is a modified Sage-Husa adaptive KF, which can automatically estimate the measurement noise variance. Compared with traditional approaches, this approach has the advantages of noise reduction, self-adaptation, divergence avoidance, and high detection rate. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can accurately detect the abrupt and incipient fault of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. At the same time, it can get the higher fault detection rates (FDRs) compared with conventional KF. Furthermore, this approach also provides the leading information and foundation for UAV fault-tolerant control.

AB This work presents a method for multi-robot coordination based on a novel distributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) formulation for trajectory optimization and its modified version to mitigate the effects of packet losses and delays in the communication among the robots. Our algorithms consider that each robot is equipped with an onboard computation unit to solve a local control problem and communicate with neighboring autonomous robots via a wireless network. The difference between the two proposed methods is in the way the robots exchange information to coordinate. The information exchange can occur in a following: 1) synchronous or 2) asynchronous fashion. By relying on the theory of the nonconvex alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we show that the proposed solutions converge to a (local) solution of the centralized problem. For both algorithms, the communication exchange preserves the safety of the robots; that is, collisions with neighboring autonomous robots are prevented. The proposed approaches can be applied to various multi-robot scenarios and robot models. In this work, we assess our methods, both in simulation and with experiments, for the coordination of a team of autonomous vehicles in the following: 1) an unsupervised intersection crossing and 2) the platooning scenarios.

AB The response speed of the intelligent systems embedded in an autonomous vehicle is crucial for its correct operation and reduction of the risks on the road derived from autonomous driving. For that reason, it is necessary to optimize the algorithms that process the data from the sensors; with that aim the Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer the possibility of parallelizing the tasks to be carried out by mentioned systems, accelerating their response and improving their performance. In this regard, this paper introduces a fuzzy absolute position correction system, which corrects the latitude and longitude data registered from a GPS Pmod sensor and its implementation on a FPGA to speed up the correction results. A necessary comparison of the algorithm execution time on different platforms such as: A Raspberry pi 4 model B, a personal computer (PC) with Ubuntu 18.04.4 64bit and the FPGA model, was performed to validate the results and the effectiveness of the implementation. The correction system was validated in software and hardware on 4 different routes, each of them with a large number of samples. The results were highly similar in the three platforms; however, the FPGA-based implementation offers a speed up of 40000x compared to software-based implementations.

AB One of the challenges in autonomous robot navigation applications is recognizing the exact location in a dynamic environment in which the location of surrounding objects changes frequently. This study proposes a long-term static mapping and cloning localization (LSMCL) method for estimating real-time accurate location using only natural landmarks even in a dynamic environment using a 3D LiDAR sensor. LSMCL comprises longterm static mapping (LSM) and cloning localization (CL). A LSM creates a 2D grid map and a 3D geometric feature map for objects whose positions do not change in space. A CL uses the generated 2D grid map and particle filter to estimate the 2D global position at the initial stage. After cloning the 2D global location to 3D space, the location is tracked through a 3D feature map and map matching. To verify the LSMCL's usability in a real dynamic environment, a robot navigation experiment was conducted in a highly dynamic parking lot. The experimental results, analyzed in terms of initial localization success rate, location estimation accuracy and precision, processing time, and congested space application confirmed the LSMCL's real-world applicability.

AB Path planning is one of the most essential part in autonomous navigation. Most existing works suppose that the environment is static and fixed. However, path planning is widely used in random and dynamic environment (such as search and rescue, surveillance and other scenarios). In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based method that enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to execute navigation tasks in multi-obstacle environments with randomness and dynamics. The method is based on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3) algorithm. In order to predict the impact of the environment on UAV, the change of environment observations is added into the Actor-Critic network input, and the two-stream Actor-Critic network structure is proposed to extract features of environment observations. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and experiment results show that our method can enable the UAV to complete autonomous navigation tasks safely in multi-obstacle environments, which reflects the efficiency of our method. Moreover, compared to DDPG and the conventional TD3, our method has better generalization ability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article considers the third-order connected vehicle systems (CVSs) to implement cooperative formation control for autonomous vehicles. The error dynamics is modeled based on the proposed distributed control protocols for two large classes of general network topologies. The performance indices, such as stability, scalability, speedability, and string stability (4S) indices, are investigated. The necessary and sufficient conditions of stability for CVSs are derived and properties of characteristic roots are discussed. These roots are dependent on information of the given network topology. The sufficient conditions of stability, which are independent of network topology, are given by analyzing the range of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the corresponding network topology, so scalability is guaranteed. To guarantee fast convergence speed, the upper boundary of stability margin is derived, which is also independent of the size of the network topology and can be conveniently tuned by the controller gains and model parameter. The necessary and sufficient conditions of stability are also achieved for the bidirectional-leader following (BLF) network topology. The conditions of string stability are further derived to ensure that spacing errors (caused by disturbances) decay along the vehicle platoon. Furthermore, combining the conditions of stability, speedability, and string stability, the CVSs are proven to be not only stable but also string stable and quickly convergent. Thus, the 4S indices can be guaranteed. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results.

AB Technological evolutions in the automobile industry, especially the development of connected and autonomous vehicles, have granted vehicles more computing, storage, and sensing resources. The necessity of efficient utilization of these resources leads to the vision of vehicular cloud computing (VCC), which can offload the computing tasks from the edge or remote cloud to enhance the overall efficiency. In this paper, we study the problem of computation offloading through the vehicular cloud (VC), where computing missions from edge cloud can be offloaded and executed cooperatively by vehicles in VC. Specifically, computing missions are further divided into computing tasks with interdependency and executed in different vehicles in the VC to minimize the overall response time. To characterize the instability of computing resources resulting from the high vehicular mobility, a mobility model focusing on vehicular dwell time is utilized. Considering the heterogeneity of vehicular computing capabilities and the interdependency of computing tasks, we formulate an optimization problem for task scheduling, which is NP-hard. For low complexity, a modified genetic algorithm based scheduling scheme is designed where integer coding is used rather than binary coding, and relatives are defined and employed to avoid infeasible solutions. In addition, a task load based stability analysis of the VCC system is presented for the cases where some vehicles within the VC are offline. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the utilization of computing resources while guaranteeing low latency and system stability.

AB Collision at sea is always a significant issue affecting the safety of ship navigation. The shipborne autonomous collision avoidance system (SAGAS) has the great advantage to minimize collision accidents in ship navigation. A parallel trajectory planning architecture is proposed in this paper for SAGAS system. The fully-coupled deliberative planner based on the modified RRT algorithm is developed to search for optimal global trajectory in a low re-planning frequency. The fully-coupled reactive planner based on the modified DW algorithm is developed to generate the optimal local trajectory in a high re-planning frequency to counteract the unexpected behavior of dynamic obstacles in the vicinity of the vessel. The obstacle constraints, ship maneuvering constraints, COLREGs rules, trajectory optimality, and real-time requirements are satisfied simultaneously in both global and local planning to ensure the collision-free optimal navigation in compliance with COLREGs rules. The on-water tests of a trimaran model equipped with a model-scale SACAS system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The good balance between the computational efficiency and trajectory optimality is achieved in parallel trajectory planning.

AB The strength of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) clustering, namely, platoon intensity, has an essential impact on the traffic capacity, safety, and stability of the mixed traffic flow with CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This article proposes the definition, formulas, examples, analysis, and applications of CAV platoon intensity. Firstly, the CAV platoon intensity considering the maximum platoon size is defined, and its mathematical calculation method is developed. Secondly, the three types of value ranges for platoon intensity are discussed. Thirdly, the distribution characteristics of five types of time headways were proposed. Finally, the influence of CAV platoon intensity on the fundamental diagram and traffic safety of mixed traffic flow are analyzed from theoretical derivation and simulation evaluation, respectively. The result suggests the following: (1) According to the sensitivity analysis, an optimal platoon size of 5 vehicles was suggested for the CAV platoon; (2) The penetration rates and platoon intensity of CAVs can improve the capacity of mixed traffic flow, and the increase is gradually more significant; (3) The effect of the increase in platoon intensity on the capacity is not significant enough when the CAV penetration rate is low; (4) A higher platoon intensity is good for dissipating disturbances in the mixed traffic flow; and (5) CAV platoon intensity has a marginal impact on the characteristics of mixed traffic flow with the low penetration rate. It is noteworthy that a reasonable increase in platoon intensity can improve the traffic capacity and safety of mixed traffic flow.

TI GaN-based mini-LED matrix applied to multi-functional forward lighting

ID DESIGN; HEADLAMP; VEHICLE
AB In this paper, we propose and demonstrate to use of a single reflector with 68 segments to project vehicle low beam and high beam with the use of a GaN-based mini-LED matrix, which is a 5 x 6 LED die array. The design of the reflector is based on light field technology in considering etendue from the light source across the segments. The group of the segments with smaller etendue from the LED dies in the bottom 2 rows are used to project low beams. When the other LED dies are turned on, the reflector will project light upward and form the high beam. The selection of the turn-on LED dies in the mini-LED matrix can adjust the width of the illumination pattern so that an adaptive low/high beam can be performed. Besides, to extend the functionality of the headlamp module, we propose to dispense IR phosphor on LED dies in the high-beam zone of the GaN-based mini-LED matrix. Thus the vehicle can emit IR high beam, which can be imaged through a camera and can be incorporated with machine vision for an autonomous vehicle without using a complicated adaptive headlight to avoid glare. The proposed multi-function in spatial and spectral domains will be helpful to various applications with use of a mini-LED matrix.

AB Two Saildrone unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) were instrumented with echosounders and deployed in the Bering Sea to make acoustic observations of walleye pollock for 103 days. The Saildrones proved to be a suitable platform for measurement of fish backscatter: they produced high-quality measurements at wind speeds of <10 m s(-1). Pollock backscatter measured from the Saildrones was compared to backscatter measured by a noise-reduced research vessel during two "follow-the-leader" comparisons. In a location where pollock were shallowly distributed (30-100 m), there was evidence of depth-dependent avoidance reactions to the ship. This behaviour was not evident in a second comparison, where the fish were primarily deeper than 90 m. Opportunistic comparisons indicate that backscatter where the ship and USVs crossed paths was similar. However, the Saildrones observed higher densities of shallow fish, which is consistent with the diving response inferred in the first follow-the-leader comparison. USVs equipped with echosounders, like all platforms, have inherent strengths (endurance) and limitations (species identification) that should be carefully considered for a given application. USVs can complement traditional ship-based surveys by increasing the spatial and temporal extent of acoustic observations, and their use is likely to become more widespread.

AB The paper proposes a new real-time motion planning technique for an autonomous mobile robot that is able to find a collision-free path and a corresponding time-optimal trajectory while taking into account limits on the actuator capacities and constraints from the wheel-ground adhesion. The proposed technique includes two sub-modules. The first one, an optimal path planner, is based on the discretization of the robot workspace and dynamic programming principle. It allows finding the shortest path in the robot environment to avoid obstacles and reach the robot target. The second one, an optimal trajectory generator, operates with the discretized robot state-space and also employs dynamic programming techniques. It produces a time-optimal motion along the obtained path, which may include numerous regular and singular trajectory sections caused by the simultaneous application of actuator and wheel-ground adhesion constraints. To adapt this technique to real-time implementation, a moving window strategy is presented that allows regularly updating the robot motion profile in a dynamic environment. The advantages of the developed technique and its suitability for real-time control are illustrated by experimental studies implemented on a car-like mobile robot.

AB With the vigorous development of vision techniques, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has shown the capability of navigating autonomous robots in global-navigation-satellite-system-denied environments. However, the long-term robust navigation of lightweight autonomous robots in outdoor environments with complex interferences, such as illumination change, dynamic objects, and electromagnetic interference, is still a great challenge. In this paper, a polarization sensor-aided SLAM (POL-SLAM) that can provide absolute heading constraints for pure SLAM is proposed. POL-SLAM is a lightweight, tightly coupled system consisting of a polarization sensor and binocular camera. By means of an initialization that uses a polarization sensor, an absolute heading angle for the entire map is designed. Additionally, an algorithm to eliminate mismatching points using the matching point vector is proposed. The objective function of bundle adjustment is then deduced according to the re-projection error and polarization sensor. The vehicle test shows that the yaw and trajectory accuracies of POL-SLAM are significantly improved compared to pure SLAM. The yaw and trajectory accuracies are increased by 43.1% and 36.6%, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed POL-SLAM can improve the reliability and robustness of pure SLAM and can be used in lightweight autonomous robots in outdoor environments. ?? 2022 Optica Publishing Group

AB 3D object detection is playing a key role in the perception process of autonomous driving and industrial robots automation. Inherent characteristics of point cloud raise an enormous challenge to both spatial representation and association analysis. Unordered point cloud spatial data structure and density variations caused by gradually varying distances to LiDAR make accurate and robust 3D object detection even more difficult. In this paper, we present a novel transformer network POAT-Net for 3D point cloud object detection. Transformer is credited with the great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and exhibiting inspiring potentials in point cloud processing. Our method POAT-Net is inherently insensitive to element permutations within the unordered point cloud. The associations between local points contribute significantly to 3D object detection or other 3D tasks. Parallel offset-attention is leveraged to highlight and capture subtle associations between local points. To overcome the non-uniform density distribution of different objects, we exploit Normalized multi-resolution Grouping (NMRG) strategy to enhance the non-uniform density adaptive ability for POAT-Net. Quantitative experimental results on KITTI3D dataset demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

AB The docking controller for autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) is intractable considering the high precision requirement and the complex disturbances of multiple environment flows. To solve the problems in the docking phase of AAR, such as the uncertainties of the aerodynamic parameters of receiver aircraft and the disturbances acting on the receiver aircraft, an adaptive dynamic surface control (ADSC) scheme based on radical basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is presented in this paper. Firstly, a nonlinear model of longitudinal dynamics of the receiver aircraft relative to the tanker aircraft is established, which incorporates the tanker vortex term. Secondly, a nonlinear strict-feedback form is introduced to design an adaptive dynamic surface controller with RBF-NN. Thirdly, the upper bounds of the "total disturbances" are estimated with the adaptive law, and the uncertain aerodynamic parameters of receiver aircraft are estimated with RBF-NN. It is proved that the proposed controller can guarantee the uniform boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system using Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the docking control of AAR.

ID MODELING VEHICLE INTERACTIONS; INCIDENT DETECTION; BEHAVIOR; RELAXATION;

AB A quantitative understanding of dynamic lane-changing interaction patterns is indispensable for improving the decision-making of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles. This paper develops a novel framework combining the hidden Markov model (HMM) and graph structure to identify the difference in dynamic interaction patterns between mandatory lane changes (MLC) and discretionary lane changes (DLC). An HMM is developed to separate the interaction patterns considering heterogeneity in lane-changing processes and reveal the temporal properties of these patterns. Conditional mutual information is used to quantify the interaction intensity, and the graph structure is used to characterize the relationship between vehicles. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the practical value of the proposed framework and validate its effectiveness in predicting lane-changing trajectories. Based on the lane-changing events extracted from a real-world trajectory dataset, the proposed analytical framework is applied to model MLC and DLC under congested traffic with levels of service E and F. The results show that there could be multiple heterogeneous dynamic interaction patterns in a lane-changing process. A comparison of MLC and DLC demonstrates that MLC involves more intense interactions and more frequent transitions of the interaction network structure, while the evolution rules of interaction patterns in DLC do not exhibit a clear trend. The findings in this study are useful for understanding the connectivity structure between vehicles in lane-changing interactions and for designing safe and smooth driving decision-making models for AVs and advanced driver-assistance systems.

AB Transportation safety, as a critical component of an efficient and reliable transportation system, has been extensively studied with respect to societal economic impacts by transportation agencies and policy officials. However, the embodied energy impact of safety, other than induced congestion, is lacking in studies. This research proposes an energy equivalence of safety (EES) framework to provide a holistic view of the long-term energy and fuel consequences of motor vehicle crashes, incorporating both induced congestion and impacts from lost human productivity resulting from injury and fatal accidents and the energy content resulting from all consequences and activities from a crash. The method utilizes a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) to national energy consumed in a framework that bridges the gap between safety and energy, leveraging extensive studies of the economic impact of motor vehicle crashes. The energy costs per fatal, injury, and property-damage-only (PDO) crashes in gasoline gallon equivalent (GGE) in 2017 were found to be 200,259, 4442, and 439, respectively, which are significantly greater than impacts from induced congestion alone. The results from the motor vehicle crash data show a decreasing trend of EES per crash type from 2010 and 2017, due primarily in part to a decreasing ratio of total energy consumed to GDP over those years. In addition to the temporal analysis, we conducted a spatial analysis addressing national-, state-, and local-level EES comparisons by using the proposed framework, illustrating its applicability.

AB With the development of autonomous driving system, accurate tracking of the number of vehicles and their states is critical to ensure traffic safety. Since the numbers and states of the vehicles are unknown and time-varying, the road traffic surveillance can be considered as a multiple-target tracking (MTT) prob-lem. The Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter is a popular approach in solv-ing MTT problem and has been successfully applied to a range of applications including ground vehicle tracking. However, due to the road constraint, the maneuverability of a ground vehicle is limited to the road lane. Thus, the target detection probability, survival probability, and birth rate, which are assumed to be constant in the original GM-PHD filter, vary according to the surveillance area as well as its own state. To address this, we propose an algorithm that dynamically updates the probability of detection and survival, and birth rate simultaneously in a mathematically rigorous way. This is done by integrating the semantic information inferred from the environment with the state-dependent GM-PHD filter. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated via illustrative road traffic scenarios.(c) 2022 European Control Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID SERVICE MIGRATION; OPTIMIZATION; MEC
AB Multi-access edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technology to facilitate efficient vehicular applications, such as autonomous driving, path planning and navigation. By offloading tasks from vehicles to MEC servers (MECSs), the MEC system can facilitate computation-intensive applications with hard latency constraints in vehicles with limited computing resources. However, owing to the mobility of vehicles, the vehicles are not evenly distributed across the MEC system. Therefore, some MECSs are heavily congested, whereas others are lightly loaded. If a task is offloaded to a congested MECS, it can be blocked or have high latency. Moreover, service interruption would occur because of the high mobility and limited coverage of the MECS. In this paper, we assume that the task can be divided into a set of subtasks and computed by multiple MECSs in parallel. Therefore, we propose a method of task migration with partitioning. To balance loads, the MEC system migrates the set of subtasks of tasks in an overloaded MECS to one or more underloaded MECSs according to the load difference. Simulations have indicated that, compared with conventional methods, the proposed method can increase the satisfaction of quality-of-service requirements, such as low latency, service reliability, and MEC system throughput by optimizing load balancing and task partitioning.

AB Due to the sensitivity of the information exchanged in Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication, generating secret keys is critical to secure these communications. As nature is open access, distributed keys are more vulnerable to attacks in the vehicular environment. Physical layer key generation methods using wireless channel characteristics show promise in preventing such attacks, generating keys independently, and removing the need for distribution. In this paper, we present a novel key generation approach in a real vehicular environment based on Channel State Information (CSI), including a new algorithm for key bit extraction. We implemented our algorithm using USRP B210 Software-Defined Radios (SDR) and the industry-standard V2X communication protocol: IEEE 802.11p. The proposed key generation protocol uses the CSI values of each sub-carrier as a source of randomness, from which bits are extracted using a new QAM demodulator quantizer (QAM-Dem-Quan). We compared our technique to state-of-the-art Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based approaches, and show that our method achieves better performance. Moreover, we reached a min-entropy of approximately 70% for the generated keys and a key generation rate of less than 150 mu s/key for key lengths ranging from 16 to 128 bits.

AB Autonomous driving systems in internet of vehicles (IoV) applications usually adopt a cloud computing mode. In these systems, information got at the edge of the cloud computing center for data analysis and situation response. However, the conventional IoV face enormous challenges to meet the requirements in terms of storage, communication, and computing problems because of the considerable amount of information on the traffic environment. The environment perception during the nighttime is poorer than that during the daytime that this problem also requires addressing. To solve these problems, we propose a nighttime object detection scheme based on a lightweight deep learning model in the edge computing mode. First, the pedestrian detection and the vehicle detection algorithm that using the thermal images based on the YOLO architecture. We can implement the model on edge devices that can achieve real-time detection through the designed lightweight strategy. Next, a spatial prior information and temporal prior information into the detection algorithm and divide the frames into key and non-key frames to increase the performance and speed of the system simultaneously. Finally, we implemented the detection network for performance and feasibility verification on the Jetson TX2 edge device. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve real-time and high-accuracy object detection on edge devices.

AB In the effort to design a more repeatable and consistent platform to collect data for Structure from Motion (SfM) monitoring of coral reefs and other benthic habitats, we explore the use of recent advances in open source Global Positioning System (GPS)-guided drone technology to design and test a low-cost and transportable small unmanned surface vehicle (sUSV). The vehicle operates using Ardupilot open source software and can be used by local scientists and marine managers to map and monitor marine environments in shallow areas (<20 m) with commensurate visibility. The imaging system uses two Sony a6300 mirrorless cameras to collect stereo photos that can be later processed using photogrammetry software to create underwater high-resolution orthophoto mosaics and digital surface models. The propulsion system consists of two small brushless motors powered by lithium batteries that follow pre-programmed survey transects and are operated by a GPS-guided autopilot control board. Results from our project suggest the sUSV provides a repeatable, viable, and low-cost (<$3000 USD) solution for acquiring images of benthic environments on a frequent basis from directly below the water surface. These images can be used to create SfM models that provide very detailed images and measurements that can be used to monitor changes in biodiversity, reef erosion/accretion, and assessing health conditions.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) promise to improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion and emissions, and enhance mobility. However, evidence regarding their safety benefits has not been systematically investigated and documented. In this study, we utilise a scoping review approach to investigate and synthesise the existing literature on higher levels of AVs' safety implications. This aids future relevant studies by identifying the research gaps and reporting the methodological approaches used. The review focused not only on peer-reviewed articles but also on grey literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research state. In total, 5724 articles were identified, and 4167 records were screened after duplicates and dual publications removal, from which 27 were found eligible for review. Ultimately, 24 studies met all the inclusion criteria and were considered for the review. The reported evidence was focused on changes in road safety levels after the deployment of AVs in transport networks. The data was extracted and charted by one reviewer using tables to create a descriptive summary of the results and address the scoping review's questions and objectives. In general, the findings suggest that AVs hold the potential to improve the overall safety on roads, although the existing evidence is not mainly based on real data but assumptions regarding vehicles' capabilities and behaviour. The limited number of studies and the fact that all of them were published or conducted after 2014 indicate that the research on AVs' safety impacts is just emerging.

AB Modern plantation forest procedures still rely heavily on manual data acquisition in the inventory process, limiting the quantity and quality of the collected data. This limitation in collection performance is often due to the difficulty of traversing the plantation forest environment on foot. This work presents an autonomous system for exploring plantation forest environments using multi-rotor UAVs. The proposed method consists of three parts: waypoint selection, trajectory generation, and trajectory following. Waypoint selection is accomplished by estimating the rows' locations within the environment and selecting points between adjacent rows. Trajectory generation is completed using a non-linear optimization-based constant speed planner and the following is accomplished using a model predictive control approach. The proposed method is tested extensively in simulation against various procedurally generated forest environments, with results suggesting that it is robust against variations within the scene. Finally, flight testing is performed in a local plantation forest, demonstrating the successful application of our proposed method within a complex, uncontrolled environment.

AB This paper investigates the path-tracking control problem for an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) with unknown time-varying disturbances and input saturation. A robust nonlinear control law is proposed based on a disturbance observer and an auxiliary system in the context of command filtered control. The disturbance observer is constructed to estimate the unknown time-varying disturbances, the auxiliary dynamic system is employed to handle input saturation, and the compensator based command filtered control technique makes the designed path-tracking control law simple and easy to implement in practice. It is proved that the nonlinear control law can track the desired vessel's position and heading, while guaranteeing the uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the path-tracking control system. Simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

AB Control laws to synchronize attitudes in a swarm of fully actuated rigid bodies, in the absence of a common reference attitude or hierarchy in the swarm, are proposed in [Smith, T.

The present paper studies two separate extensions with the same energy shaping approach: (i) locally synchronizing the rigid bodies' attitudes, but without restricting their final motion and (ii) relaxing the communication topology from undirected, fixed and connected to directed, varying and uniformly connected. The specific strategies that must be developed for these extensions illustrate the limitations of attitude control with reduced information. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To improve energy awareness of unmanned autonomous vehicles, it is critical to co optimize task planning and energy scheduling. To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing task planning algorithms either ignore energy constraints or make energy scheduling decisions based on simple rules. To bridge these research gaps, we propose a combinatorial optimization model for the simultaneous task and energy planning (STEP) problem. In this paper, we propose three variants of STEP problems (i) the vehicle can visit stationary charging stations multiple times at various locations; (ii) the vehicle can efficiently coordinate with mobile charging stations to achieve zero waiting time for recharging, and (iii) the vehicle can maximally harvest solar energy by considering time variance in solar irradiance. Besides, in order to obtain fast and reliable solutions to STEP problems, we propose a neural combinatorial optimizer using the deep reinforcement learning algorithm with a proposed link information filter. The near-optimal solutions can be obtained very fast without solving the problem from scratch when environments change. Our simulation results demonstrate that (i) our proposed neural optimizer can find solutions close to the optimum and outperform the exact and heuristic algorithms in terms of computational cost; (ii) the end-to-end learning (directly mapping from perceptions to control) model outperforms the traditional learning (mapping from perception to prediction to control) model.

AB Exploration of marine habitats is one of the key pillars of underwater science, which often involves collecting images at close range. As acquiring imagery close to the seabed involves multiple hazards, the safety of underwater vehicles, such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), is often compromised. Common applications for obstacle avoidance in underwater environments are often conducted with acoustic sensors, which cannot be used reliably at very short distances, thus requiring a high level of attention from the operator to avoid damaging the robot. Therefore, developing capabilities such as advanced assisted mapping, spatial awareness and safety, and user immersion in confined environments is an important research area for human-operated underwater robotics. In this paper, we present a novel approach that provides an ROV with capabilities for navigation in complex environments. By leveraging the ability of omnidirectional multi-camera systems to provide a comprehensive view of the environment, we create a 360 degrees real-time point cloud of nearby objects or structures within a visual SLAM framework. We also develop a strategy to assess the risk of obstacles in the vicinity. We show that the system can use the risk information to generate warnings that the robot can use to perform evasive maneuvers when approaching dangerous obstacles in real-world scenarios. This system is a first step towards a comprehensive pilot assistance system that will enable inexperienced pilots to operate vehicles in complex and cluttered environments.

AB In modern networking research, infrastructure-assisted unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) are actively considered for real-time learning-based surveillance and aerial data-delivery under unexpected 3D free mobility and coordination. In this system model, it is essential to consider the power limitation in UAVs and autonomous object recognition (for abnormal behavior detection) deep learning performance in infrastructure/towers. To overcome the power limitation of UAVs, this paper proposes a novel aerial scheduling algorithm between multi-UAVs and multi-towers where the towers conduct wireless power transfer toward UAVs. In addition, to take care of the high-performance learning model training in towers, we also propose a data delivery scheme which makes UAVs deliver the training data to the towers fairly to prevent problems due to data imbalance (e.g., huge computation overhead caused by larger data delivery or overfitting from less data delivery). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm between multi-towers and multi-UAVs for joint power-charging from towers to their associated UAVs and training data delivery from UAVs to their associated towers. To compute the workload-aware optimal scheduling decisions in each unit time, our solution approach for the given scheduling problem is designed based on Markov decision process (MDP) to deal with (i) time-varying low-complexity computation and (ii) pseudo-polynomial optimality. As shown in performance evaluation results, our proposed algorithm ensures (i) sufficient times for resource exchanges between towers and UAVs, (ii) the most even and uniform data collection during the processes compared to the other algorithms, and (iii) the performance of all towers convergence to optimal levels.

AB Effective management of demand information is a critical factor in the successful operation of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. This paper classifies, measures and evaluates the demand information for an AMoD system. First, the paper studies demand information at both individual and aggregate levels and measures two critical attributes: dynamism and granularity. We identify the trade-offs between both attributes during the data collection and information inference processes and discuss the compatibility of the AMoD dispatching algorithms with different types of information. Second, the paper assesses the value of demand information through agent-based simulation experiments with the actual road network and travel demand in a major European city, where we assume a single operator monopolizes the AMoD service in the case study area but competes with other transportation modes. The performance of the AMoD system is evaluated from the perspectives of travelers, AMoD operators, and transportation authority in terms of the overall system performance. The paper tests multiple scenarios, combining different information levels, information dynamism, and information granularity, as well as various fleet sizes. Results show that aggregate demand information leads to more served requests, shorter wait time and higher profit through effective rebalancing, especially when supply is high and demand information is spatially granular. Individual demand information from inadvance requests also improves the system performance, the degree of which depends on the spatial disparity of requests and their coupled service priority. By designing hailing policies accordingly, the operator is able to maximize the potential benefits. The paper concludes that the strategic trade-offs of demand information need to be made regarding the information level, information dynamism, and information granularity. It also offers a broader discussion on the benefits and costs of demand information for key stakeholders including the users, the operator, and the society.

AB With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Vehicles and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the cooperative intelligent transportation system (C-ITS) has drawn great attention in recent years. To provide an ultra-reliable, low-latency computation experience of C-ITS, computation offloading is deemed indispensable by working with edge-cloud servers. In this paper, we first investigate a distributed dynamic computation offloading model for multi-access edge computing (MEC) enabled C-ITS under a heterogeneous road network, in which the multiple and heterogeneous computing power sources cooperatively provide computation offloading services for vehicles. Considering the autonomous offloading manner of the vehicles, we formulate the task offloading and computing power allocation as a distributed Stackelberg game, where the MEC servers as the leader to allocate computing resources and manage local energy, and the vehicles as the followers to offload local computation task. Since the observable states in the game is incomplete, the problem of resolving the optimal strategies for each game player is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to maximize the long-term cumulative reward. Then we develop a computation offloading algorithm using Stackelberg game-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (SG-MADDPG), which uses a centralized training and decentralized execution method to learn the optimal computing power allocation and computation offloading policies. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out and show the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Every year, approximately 350,000 vulnerable road users (VRU), like pedestrians and bicyclists, die due to collisions with vehicles. One approach for reducing this number of fatalities is using VRU collision avoidance systems, which aim at detecting and preventing possible collisions. Existing products for VRU collision avoidance systems using sensors mounted on vehicles may already decrease the number of accidents. However, these products require a line-of-sight between the vehicle and a VRU. Especially in urban environments, the line-of-sight between a vehicle and a VRU is often obstructed, e.g., by parked cars. Cooperative VRU collision avoidance systems promise to be a solution to this limitation. In such cooperative collision avoidance systems, the VRU is equipped with a portable device like a smartphone or a smartwatch. This allows exchanging the movement information between the vehicle and the VRU. However, one open question is how accurately such a system needs to recognize the movement of the VRU to achieve the necessary system performance. In this article, we provide a comprehensive analysis of how the accuracy of recognizing a pedestrian' s movement influences the reliability of detecting collisions between the car and the pedestrian in cooperative VRU collision avoidance systems. We conduct this analysis for the "Car-to-Pedestrian Nearside" scenarios from the "Test protocol for Autonomous Emergency Braking VRU systems" of the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP).

AB Landing gear plays an important role in enabling unmanned aerial vehicles to engage in complex missions and protect expensive airborne sensors. Most existing landing gears are designed to satisfy only specific maneuvers in predefined scenarios. Although effective in predefined scenarios, these landing gears cannot guarantee the adaptiveness in multiple scenarios. A promising solution is to build a model automatically generated based on the actual requirements, so that the expected model structure can be obtained through a constraint generation process. However, translating the actual requirements into reasonable design constraints is complex. For this purpose, we propose a landing structure design process in the bistable space of the Kresling tube. Furthermore, we use a combination of graph search and controller to optimize the landing structure. We validate the bistatic and graph search combined design structure in a realistic environment and test the mechanisms flexibility and assisted landing capability. Experiments show that the structure combining spatial bistability with a graph search approach can safely and successfully land a quadrotor under various conditions while enhancing the UAV's shock absorption during landing.

AB In this paper, a new approach of state observer is proposed for the tractor with multi unit trailers. In the case of tractor with two articulated trailers, the dynamic characteristics of the trailers are dominantly determined by the two hitch angles connecting each trailer. A novel estimation system for the hitch angle is introduced by combining the Kalman filter with the deep learning network and transfer function techniques. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network is constructed to calculate hitch angles and these values are used as the virtual measurement in the Kalman filter. The dynamic characteristics of two trailers with respect to the hitch angles are expressed as the transfer function models and these models are used to calculate the hitch angles as the virtual measurement. The virtual measurements from the two methods are integrated separately into the Kalman filter design. The estimation performance of the hitch angle with the proposed hybrid observer is validated in simulations with various curvature scenarios.

AB Current haze removal methods for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images are mostly based on natural image dehazing methods, which ignore the particular imaging mechanism of UAVs. They often fail to restore regions with rich spectral and textural information. In this letter, we propose a saliency-guided parallel learning mechanism for UAV image haze removal. First, we design a saliency-guided parallel dehazing module with two parallel paths. The residual feature extraction path obtains deep-level features to realize global dehazing effectively. The key feature enhancement path, which comprises saliency dense blocks, realizes local textural preservation and spectral restoration. Second, a sporadic foreground saliency detection method is proposed for UAV images with sporadic objects. The saliency map guides the learning of significant spectral and textural information in hazy images. Finally, a multiscale reconstruction module is introduced to more accurately estimate small-scale textural details and large-scale spectral information. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better detail performance and visual effects than state-of-the-art methods.

AB Automated driving and vehicle safety systems need object detection. It is important that object detection be accurate overall and robust to weather and environmental conditions and run in real-time. As a consequence of this approach, they require image processing algorithms to inspect the contents of images. This article compares the accuracy of five major image processing algorithms: Region-based Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN), Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN), Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD), RetinaNet, and You Only Look Once v4 (YOLOv4). In this comparative analysis, we used a large-scale Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD100K) dataset. Their strengths and limitations are analyzed based on parameters such as accuracy (with/without occlusion and truncation), computation time, precision-recall curve. The comparison is given in this article helpful in understanding the pros and cons of standard deep learning-based algorithms while operating under real-time deployment restrictions. We conclude that the YOLOv4 outperforms accurately in detecting difficult road target objects under complex road scenarios and weather conditions in an identical testing environment.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS) often rely on external communication for supervisory control or sensing. Unfortunately, these communications render the system vulnerable to cyber attacks. Attacks that alter messages, such as replay attacks that record measurement signals, and then play them back to the system can cause devastating effects. Dynamic Watermarking methods, which inject a private excitation into control inputs to secure resulting measurement signals, have begun addressing the challenges of detecting these attacks, but have been restricted to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI models are sufficient for some applications, other CPS, such as autonomous vehicles, require more complex models. This article develops a linear time-varying (LTV) extension to previous dynamic watermarking methods by designing a matrix normalization factor to accommodate the temporal changes in the system. Implementable tests are provided with considerations for real-world systems. The proposed method is then shown to be able to detect generalized replay attacks both in theory and in simulation using an LTV vehicle model.

AB Design and fabrication of a wireless charging system, which includes a wireless charging base station and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with wireless charging capability is proposed for enlarging the UAV's working range. First, an optimized magnetic coupler featuring with an orthogonal magnetic structure with a flexible soft magnetic core in receiver is proposed to ensure high efficiency and low-leakage magnetic flux interference. Second, a wireless charging circuit topology and a closed-loop power controller implemented on the primary side are designed and analyzed in detail to maintain constant current/constant voltage charging for the UAV. Then, a wireless charging station with position correction aid device is developed, which can achieve high-precision alignment. A prototype of the UAV wireless charging system with the proposed magnetic structure, primary-side control, and position correction are built and tested. Experimental results show that the fabricated wireless charging system can deliver 87.4 W at a dc-to-battery efficiency of 87.3%, and the system is adapted autonomous charging of UAV.

AB In this paper, a new robotic architecture for plant phenotyping is being introduced. The architecture consists of two robotic platforms: an autonomous ground vehicle (Vinobot) and a mobile observation tower (Vinoculer). The ground vehicle collects data from individual plants, while the observation tower oversees an entire field, identifying specific plants for further inspection by the Vinobot. The advantage of this architecture is threefold: first, it allows the system to inspect large areas of a field at any time, during the day and night, while identifying specific regions affected by biotic and/or abiotic stresses; second, it provides high-throughput plant phenotyping in the field by either comprehensive or selective acquisition of accurate and detailed data from groups or individual plants; and third, it eliminates the need for expensive and cumbersome aerial vehicles or similarly expensive and confined field platforms. As the preliminary results from our algorithms for data collection and 3D image processing, as well as the data analysis and comparison with phenotype data collected by hand demonstrate, the proposed architecture is cost effective, reliable, versatile, and extendable.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODELS; DYNAMICS
AB The deployment of new emerging technologies, such as cooperative systems, allows the traffic community to foresee relevant improvements in terms of traffic safety and efficiency. Autonomous vehicles are able to share information about the local traffic state in real time, which could result in a better reaction to the mechanism of traffic jam formation. An upstream single-hop radio broadcast network can improve the perception of each cooperative driver within a specific radio range and hence the traffic stability. The impact of vehicle to vehicle cooperation on the onset of traffic congestion is investigated analytically and through simulation. A next generation simulation field dataset is used to calibrate the full velocity difference car-following model, and the MOBIL lane-changing model is implemented. The robustness of the calibration as well as the heterogeneity of the drivers is discussed. Assuming that congestion can be triggered either by the heterogeneity of drivers' behaviours or abnormal lane-changing behaviours, the calibrated car-following model is used to assess the impact of a microscopic cooperative law on egoistic lane-changing behaviours. The cooperative law can help reduce and delay traffic congestion and can have a positive effect on safety indicators.

AB The emergence, evolving role, and future potential of unmanned air systems (UAS), as influenced by historical, technological, and cultural factors, are examined from a strategic perspective. The key enabling elements of UAS functionality are firmly entrenched in the information age. Two of these basic capabilities, remote human crew interaction enabled by wireless communication and complimentary autonomous vehicle functionality, are central to understanding the evolution of these systems, as well as for assessing their future prospects. Recent research and technology developments likely to shape future system capabilities and increase their operational presence include the continued increase in the use of small unmanned air vehicles in mission applications, the introduction and employment of multivehicle systems, and the greatly enhanced air vehicle design envelope afforded by leveraging the elimination of onboard human presence. Relevant examples in these areas, including several from the author's personal experience, help clarify the concepts and reinforce the assertions. Despite the many technological advances that have enabled modern UAS capabilities, cultural, institutional, and infrastructure barriers, coupled with economic considerations, continue to temper their advance and constrain their operational use, especially in the commercial arena. Some specific ideas and proposals presented may help to eventually resolve several of these issues.

AB In desert zones, a continuous cleaning activity of photovoltaic panels in solar plants is required since the deposition of both airborne dust and sand after a storm can reduce their efficiency up to 80%. Manual cleaning of the photovoltaic panels in dry areas is costly, cannot make use of water and workers must be employed several times in a month, often under extreme environmental conditions. For all these reasons, the research of cleaning solutions performed by autonomous robotic systems are seen beneficial to recover the solar panels efficiency at reasonable costs also nightly. In this respect, this paper presents the implementation of an unmanned low-cost robotic device operating without rails or guides for waterless dust and sand removal from the surface of photovoltaic panels. The robot autonomously moves as a half-track and gently wipes the dust away by means of a couple of independent helical brushes that alternatively rotate, according to a defined combination of the cleaning and motion strategy. Moreover, in real-time the robot detects its spatial position by ultrasonic sensors, regulates both its speed rate and motion direction. The on-board control system, based on an ARDUINO DUE platform, settles the robot travel direction, its speed and which brush must be activated for cleaning. Experimental tests have been performed by fabricating a prototype of the device to assess its effectiveness and reliability in terms of the autonomous motion, dust removal and low power consumption.

AB On the evening of March 18, 2018, an automated vehicle (AV) struck and killed a 49-year-old pedestrian in Tempe, AZ, as she crossed the road. From about 2 weeks before the crash through April 30, 2018, an online survey, designed to address U.S. public perceptions of AVs among vulnerable road users, was distributed to adult U.S. residents. Survey responses were collected from 1,409 individuals. This survey provided a unique opportunity to examine the "first failure effect" of an AV on U.S. public perceptions of AV technology. The survey considered response date, age, gender, education, place of residence, and primary transportation mode as explanatory variables, and general impression, trust, acceptance, and perceived safety as independent variables. After the crash, general impression, trust, acceptance, and perceived safety levels dropped significantly. Perceived safety did not return to its precrash level through to the end of the survey, whereas all other measures returned to their precrash levels approximately 1 month postcrash. On average, younger, educated, and male respondents held a more positive attitude of AVs than older, less educated, and female respondents. Findings indicate that high-visibility negative events may affect how individuals perceive and interact with AVs.

AB There has been an increasing focus on the development of automation in vehicles due its many potential benefits like safety, improved traffic efficiency, reduced emissions etc. One of the key factors influencing public acceptance of automated vehicle technologies is their level of trust. Development of trust is a dynamic process and needs to be calibrated to the correct levels for safe deployment to ensure appropriate use of such systems. One of the factors influencing trust is the knowledge provided to the driver about the system's true capabilities and limitations. After a 56 participants driving simulator study, the authors found that with the introduction of knowledge about the true capabilities and limitations of the automated system, trust in the automated system increased as compared to when no knowledge was provided about the system. Participants experienced two different types of automated systems: low capability automated system and high capability automated system. Interestingly, with the introduction of knowledge, the average trust levels for both low and high capability automated systems were similar. Based on the experimental results, the authors introduce the concept of informed safety, i.e., informing the drivers about the safety limits of the automated system to enable them to calibrate their trust in the system to an appropriate level.

ID QUADROTOR
AB The paper discusses an intelligent vision-based control solution for autonomous tracking and landing of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on ships without utilizing GPS signals. The central idea involves automating the Navy helicopter ship landing procedure where the pilot utilizes the ship as the visual reference for long-range tracking; however, it refers to a standardized visual cue installed on most Navy ships called the "horizon bar" for the final approach and landing phases. This idea is implemented using a uniquely designed nonlinear controller integrated with machine vision. The vision system utilizes machine learning based object detection for long-range ship tracking and classical computer vision for the estimation of aircraft relative position and orientation utilizing the horizon bar during the final approach and landing phases. The nonlinear controller operates based on the information estimated by the vision system and has demonstrated robust tracking performance even in the presence of uncertainties. The developed autonomous ship landing system was implemented on a quad-rotor UAV equipped with an onboard camera, and approach and landing were successfully demonstrated on a moving deck, which imitates realistic ship deck motions. Extensive simulations and flight tests were conducted to demonstrate vertical landing safety, tracking capability, and landing accuracy.

AB With the development of autonomous driving, ensuring pedestrian safety has become a hot research topic. The traditional pedestrian crossing behavior research mostly track and predict pedestrian crossing from the view of vehicles, but do not have in-depth research on the impact of other elements in the traffic scene. This paper proposes a method for analyzing pedestrian crossing behavior based on roadside equipment for specific road sections. First, a pedestrian awareness-based social force model (PASFM) is proposed by introducing the factors that influence pedestrian crossing decisions in traffic scenarios into the social force model (SFM), including zebra crossings, fellow walkers and vehicles. To explore the psychological state of vehicles and pedestrians when they interact, evolutionary game theory is used to simulate the psychological characteristics of pedestrians when they encounter vehicles, and then reflect in the changes of the desired speed. Then Centralized Unscented Kalman Filter (CUKF) is proposed to complete the whole process of tracking and predicting the motion state of pedestrian crossing behavior, which uses PASFM as its prediction process. Finally, simulations and experiments are designed to show the effectiveness of our methods. Results show that the proposed method performs better during pedestrian tracking and can predict their crossing behavior to a certain extent.

AB This article is concerned with the problem of the secure formation tracking of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to replay attacks, where an observer-based event-triggered sliding mode control approach is adopted. First, a novel attack model is established for multi-UAV systems considering replay attacks, in which the issue of the replay attack beginning and ending within a sampling period is solved. Then, a switched event-triggered scheme is developed for multi-UAV systems subject to replay attacks, under which the corresponding communication mechanisms are invoked for different attack states. This communication scheme brings lower data releasing rate and less energy consumption based on the severity level of replay attacks while the desired tracking performance is ensured. On the basis of the sliding mode control theory, observer-based event-triggered formation tracking strategies are developed for multi-UAV systems with nonlinearities under replay attacks by combining the interactive information from neighbors. Sufficient conditions of the multi-UAV system to achieve the desired formation are obtained by utilizing Lyapunov stability approach. Finally, a simulation example with multiple UAVs is performed to demonstrate the validity of the developed formation control strategy.

AB In a global positioning system (GPS)-denied environment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on local sensing-based formation maneuvering approaches for collective motion. To improve mission efficiency by reducing the total sensing requirements on all UAVs, this article proposes a leader-follower formation maneuvering framework with two leaders, where the followers will track the two leaders and maintain a desired angle-constrained formation with respect to the leaders using direction-only measurements, i.e., removing the need for inter-UAV distance measurements for the followers. To enable the UAV formation to maneuver in translation, rotation, and scaling simultaneously, the desired formation shape is specified by a set of interior angle constraints. By assigning each UAV's yaw angle and position as the four controllable variables, an estimation-based attitude control algorithm is designed. For the UAVs' position control, the designed formation maneuvering algorithm consists of a velocity tracking part and a formation shape control part that enables the first leader UAV to control the translational maneuvering, the second leader UAV to control the rotational and scaling maneuvering, and all the follower UAVs to maintain the formation shape. Simulations and experiments on UAVs' formation maneuvering are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB LiDAR SLAM has become one of the major localization systems for ground vehicles since LiDAR Odometry And Mapping (LOAM). Many extension works on LOAM mainly leverage one specific constraint to improve the performance, e.g., information from on-board sensors such as loop closure and inertial state; prior conditions such as ground level and motion dynamics. In many robotic applications, these conditions are often known partially, hence a SLAM system can be a comprehensive problem due to the existence of numerous constraints. Therefore, we can achieve a better SLAM result by fusing them properly. In this letter, we propose a hybrid LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages both the on-board perception system and prior information such as motion dynamics to improve localization performance. In particular, we consider the case for ground vehicles, which are commonly used for autonomous driving and warehouse logistics. We present a computationally efficient LiDAR-inertial odometry method that directly parameterizes ground vehicle poses on SE(2). The out-of-SE(2) motion perturbations are not neglected but incorporated into an integrated noise term of a novel SE(2)-constraints model. For odometric measurement processing, we propose a versatile, tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve better pose estimation than traditional LiDAR odometry. Thorough experiments are performed to evaluate our proposed method's performance in different scenarios, including localization for both indoor and outdoor environments. The proposed method achieves superior performance in accuracy and robustness.

AB For many automotive functionalities in Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), target objects are detected using state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network (DNN) technologies. However, the main challenge of recent DNN-based object detection is that it requires high computational costs. This requirement makes it challenging to deploy the DNN-based system on a vehicle for real-time inferencing. The low response time and high accuracy of automotive applications are critical factors when the system is deployed in real time. In this paper, the authors focus on deploying the computer-vision-based object detection system on the real-time service for automotive applications. First, five different vehicle detection systems are developed using transfer learning technology, which utilizes the pre-trained DNN model. The best performing DNN model showed improvements of 7.1% in Precision, 10.8% in Recall, and 8.93% in F1 score compared to the original YOLOv3 model. The developed DNN model was optimized by fusing layers horizontally and vertically to deploy it in the in-vehicle computing device. Finally, the optimized DNN model is deployed on the embedded in-vehicle computing device to run the program in real-time. Through optimization, the optimized DNN model can run 35.082 fps (frames per second) on the NVIDIA Jetson AGA, 19.385 times faster than the unoptimized DNN model. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimized transferred DNN model achieved higher accuracy and faster processing time for vehicle detection, which is vital for deploying the ADAS system.

ID ENTRY
AB Multi-vehicle motion planning (MVMP) has become an emerging paradigm in connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). The cooperative lane-change movements with the coexistence of platoons and CAVs are typical scenarios on the muti-lane roads. This paper proposes an optimal control framework with the advantages of completeness and universality for platoons and CAVs' cooperative lane-change motion planning in different task scenarios. Two typical cooperative scenarios are designed for the subsequent study of optimal modeling. The platoons' reconfiguration and original shape maintenance are considered to reflect the universality of moving objects and the diversity of cooperative tasks. Approximately geometric contour models, dynamic externally tangent rectangle and inflated rectangle, are utilized to describe the platoon's profile. Analytical complete collision avoidance constraints among different motion objects are constructed effectively. Other necessary constraints and the weighted cost function that minimizes lane-change time and motion energy are comprehensively considered. The optimal control models are established for the desired scenarios. Moreover, a numerical solution method combined with the simultaneous direct collocation method based on the trapezoidal rule and the barrier function method is proposed to obtain the optimal schemes. Simulation and contrast experiments are conducted for two scenarios. The results indicate that the cost function's weight coefficients and specific lane-change tasks influence the cooperative motion planning effects and verify that the proposed optimal control framework is of reasonability, effectiveness, and unification.

DT Article
ID FORCE MODEL; POSITION
AB There is growing interest in understanding the lateral dimension of traffic. This trend has been motivated by the detection of phenomena unexplained by traditional models and the emergence of new technologies. Previous attempts to address this dimension have focused on lane-changing and non-lane-based traffic. The literature on vehicles keeping their lanes has generally been limited to simple statistics on vehicle position while models assume vehicles stay perfectly centered. Previously the author developed a two-dimensional traffic model aiming to capture such behavior qualitatively. Still pending is a deeper, more accurate comprehension and modeling of the relationships between variables in both axes. The present paper is based on the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) datasets. It was found that lateral position is highly dependent on the longitudinal position, a phenomenon consistent with data capture from multiple cameras. A methodology is proposed to alleviate this problem. It was also discovered that the standard deviation of lateral velocity grows with longitudinal velocity and that the average lateral position varies with longitudinal velocity by up to 8 cm, possibly reflecting greater caution in overtaking. Random walk models were proposed and calibrated to reproduce some of the characteristics measured. It was determined that drivers' response is much more sensitive to the lateral velocity than to position. These results provide a basis for further advances in understanding the lateral dimension. It is hoped that such comprehension will facilitate the design of autonomous vehicle algorithms that are friendlier to both passengers and the occupants of surrounding vehicles.

AB This article presents a cooperative fault-tolerant mission planner system for a team of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) employed for monitoring and inspection of ocean sensor networks. The problem of monitoring and inspection of ocean sensor networks is summarized as verifying the healthiness of the buoy sensors via USVs in a pre-determined zone and within a pre-defined mission time. A realistic map of the SOFAR's global Spotter network, including Spotter buoys used for observation, forecast, and hindcast of ocean and weather data is used. The mission planner system is then developed to provide a cooperative inspection of the Spotter buoys to the maximum possible numbers in an assigned mission time while the uncertainty with failure of USVs due to internal /external faults is incorporated. Extensive simulation studies together with statistical analysis are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed cooperative fault-tolerant mission planner system. The simulation results confirm the fidelity, effectiveness, and robustness of the proposed system to be implemented onboard USVs' host computers for different monitoring and inspection missions.

AB A practical localization system is proposed for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) performing its inspection mission under the global positioning system (GPS) signal blockage. The sensor hardware consists of a single transmitter and a cruciform receiver array, which produces the range difference (RD) information for UAV positioning. Our sensor is based on the impulse-radio ultra wide-band (IR-UWB) technology; hence it is robust to RF interference due to exogeneous electromagnetic fields from electric facilities. With this sensor configuration, UAV localization problem is formulated as state estimation for an uncertain linear measurement model, which can be solved by using the robust weighted least squares (RWLS) estimator. To cope with the performance degradation of the RWLS estimator due to the imperfect prior knowledge of the measurement noise statistics, a geometric constraint expressed by the UAV state variables is exploited to compensate the localization errors. Through experimental results, it is verified that the proposed solution provides satisfactory UAV positioning performance and secures the reliability of the localization system in practice.

AB Integrity monitoring (IM) is essential if GNSS positioning technologies are to be fully trusted by future intelligent transport systems. A tighter and conservative stochastic model can shrink protection levels in the position domain and therefore enhance the user-level integrity. In this study, the stochastic models for vehicle-based GNSS positioning are refined in three respects: (1) Gaussian bounds of precise orbit and clock error products from the International GNSS Service are used; (2) a variable standard deviation to characterize the residual tropospheric delay after model correction is adopted; and (3) an elevation-dependent model describing the receiver-related errors is adaptively refined using least-squares variance component estimation. The refined stochastic models are used for positioning and IM under the Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) framework, which is considered the basis for multi-constellation GNSS navigation to support air navigation in the future. These refinements are assessed via global simulations and real data experiments. Different schemes are designed and tested to evaluate the corresponding enhancements on ARAIM availability for both aviation and ground vehicle-based positioning applications.

AB A Seaglider instrumented with an inertial attitude and heading reference system was tracked for three days on an acoustic tracking range in Dabob Bay, Washington, operated by the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport, WA, USA. Inertial measurements were integrated to yield estimates of position and compared with tracked positions. Within 3 min, the integrated positioning results deviated from tracked positions by more than a kilometer. The addition of a depth constraint from pressure sensor measurements slowed the error growth over time, but even with this constraint, measurements were too noisy to accurately determine position without aid from additional sensors. Inertial data did contribute to accurate localization when used to estimate vehicle attitude and incorporated into an existing flight model; however, results did not demonstrate marked improvement over existing flight models. Although not a decisive demonstration of vehicle positioning with a standalone low-cost, low-power sensor, the results presented here provide a benchmark for comparison as MEMS inertial sensors continue to evolve using a valuable ground-truth of subsea Seaglider position not previously available.

ID DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS; NAVIGATION
AB Collision avoidance (COLAV) is a prerequisite for the navigation safety of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Since USVs have to avoid obstacles clearly and timely, i.e. the COLAV should be agile, the COLAV algorithm should have low computation complexity and make efficient COLAV decisions. However, balancing between the computation complexity and the COLAV decision optimality is still intractable at present. This paper innovatively proposes a COLAV algorithm for USVs by combining the velocity obstacle method with the predictive model method, named the collision shielded model predictive control (CS-MPC) algorithm, such that the agility of USVs COLAV is improved. The runtime of the proposed COLAV algorithm is shortened by shielding the dangerous parts of the search space of the COLAV decisions, and the COLAV decision is efficient with the aid of the accurately predicted motion trajectory by the motion mathematical model of USVs. As such, the USV can safely navigate in complex water areas where multiple vessels and obstacles exist. A series of simulations on a yacht in different kinds of encounter situations were carried out to verify the effectiveness and the agility of the proposed CS-MPC COLAV algorithm.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied in various fields, which is located by the global position system (GPS) in most cases. However, in the GPS-denied cases, visual localization becomes very important. In complicated environments, such as weak illumination and ground objects changed, visual localization is unstable. This letter presents a UAV visual localization model with a block joint learning network (BJN). Different from the traditional feature extraction-comparison paradigm, the proposed BJN extracts the joint features of the input images at the same time, so as to fully mine the coupling relationship between the multi-source images. Besides this, to overcome the challenges of inconsistency style changes in image matching, the saliency feature based on the attention mechanism and the traditional edge feature operator are introduced in joint feature learning. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the experiments on the simulated dataset and the real dataset are given. Both the results on simulated and real datasets indicate that the proposed model is effective on multi-source image matching and UAV visual localization.

AB In this study, a modified Block A* algorithm is applied to the path planning of hybrid-driven underwater gliders, which combine the buoyancy-driven mode of underwater gliders and the propeller-driven mode of autonomous underwater vehicles, in the ocean environment characterized by strong currents. The objective is to predict a sequence of steering directions and the appropriate driving mode, such that vehicles can minimize their energy consumption to reach the goal region. In this work, we modify the path generation approach of the original Block A* algorithm to gain more realistic paths for hybrid-driven underwater gliders and apply an effective energy consumption model in the heap value calculation to find energy-cost optimal paths. Zermelo's function is also incorporated to select the driving mode. The performance of the presented method is then discussed by conducting simulations in three different ocean environments. The results indicate that compared to other methods, the modified Block A* method avoids local turbulent flow and gains feasible paths for hybrid-driven underwater gliders at a lower energy cost.

AB The Automotive Industry has advanced significantly and this process is constantly continuing. Cars are controlled by hundreds of electrical units, which affects directly numberless safety and security related risk factors, especially considering incidents realized in the cyberspace. Due to the increasing number of connected cars, new testing facilities and methods need to be established, to support the solutions, for these novel challenges. For this reason, the Hungarian government has founded the Zalaegerszeg test track, and its special purpose is to provide space for the validation of future vehicles. The overview focused on the presently applied validation methods and processes has highlighted, that cybersecurity related testing methods - from a scientific point of view - are only slightly detailed in the sector of Automobile Industry. In a sector specific term, the lack of a holistic approach, may result a relevant barrier, in the future, for providing a socially tolerable level of cybersecurity. Accordingly, this paper aims to introduce a comprehensive cybersecurity reference model, to provide a solid basis for describing attack patterns and characterizing malicious intervention profiles.

AB The localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for autonomous landing is challenging because the relative positions of the landing objects are almost inaccessible and the objects have nearly no transmission with UAVs. In this paper, a hierarchical vision-based localization framework for rotor UAVs is proposed for an open landing. In such a hierarchical framework, the landing is defined into three phases: "Approaching", "Adjustment", and "Touchdown". Object features at different scales can be extracted from a designed Robust and Quick Response Landing Pattern (RQRLP) and the corresponding detection and localization methods are introduced for the three phases. Then a federated Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) structure is costumed and utilizes the solutions of the three phases as independent measurements to estimate the pose of the vehicle. The framework can be used to integrate the vision solutions and enables the estimation to be smooth and robust. In the end, several typical field experiments have been carried out to verify the proposed hierarchical vision framework. It can be seen that a wider localization range can be extended by the proposed framework while the precision is ensured.

AB Safety is of paramount importance in automated driving. One of the main challenges ensuring safety is the unknown future behavior of surrounding traffic participants. Previous works ignore this uncertainty or often address it by computing probability distributions of other traffic participants over time. Probabilistic approaches make it possible to predict the collision probability with other traffic participants, but cannot formally guarantee (i.e., cannot mathematically prove for given assumptions) whether a planned maneuver is collision-free. Our approach addresses exactly this problem: instead of computing probability distributions, we compute an over-approximation of all passible occupancies of surrounding traffic participants over time. This makes it possible to prove whether an automated vehicle can possibly collide with other traffic participants. The presented algorithm for occupancy prediction works on arbitrary road networks and produces results within a fraction of the prediction horizon. Experiments based on real-world data validate our approach and show that we could not find a behavior of a traffic participant that is not enclosed in our prediction.

In the second solution the space heating demand is satisfied by a centralised boiler while the cooling load is met by a centralised chiller. The third option consists of a trigeneration plant. The fourth configuration is composed by an electric heat pump satisfying space heating and cooling and a centralised boiler used for domestic needs. Dynamic simulations have been carried out to compare the energy and environmental performance of the centralised systems with those achieved by the distributed one. Besides, as further loads, for the third option, two electric vehicles charged by the cogenerated electricity surplus are compared to diesel cars. The results show that the best energy and environmental performance are achieved by the cogenerator-based system, with a primary energy demand of 120.6 MWh/y and equivalent dioxide carbon emissions of 25.2 t/y in the configuration without vehicles. This result is also confirmed with electric and diesel vehicles. The energy competitiveness of the plant with the electric heat pump is achieved only in a scenario with a high penetration of renewable energy sources. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) play an increasingly significant role in our life, where safe and effective vehicular networks supported by sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies are the essence of ITS. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications need to be studied to implement ITS in a secure, robust, and efficient manner, allowing massive connectivity in vehicular communications networks. Besides, with the rapid growth of different types of autonomous vehicles, it becomes challenging to facilitate the heterogeneous requirements of ITS. To meet the above needs, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are introduced to vehicular communications and ITS, containing the reflecting elements that can intelligently configure incident signals from and to vehicles. As a novel vehicular communication paradigm at its infancy, it is key to understand the latest research efforts on applying IRS to 6G ITS as well as the fundamental differences with other existing alternatives and the new challenges brought by implementing IRS in 6G ITS. In this paper, we provide a big picture of deep learning enabled IRS for 6G ITS and appraise most of the important literature in this field. By appraising and summarizing the existing literature, we also point out the challenges and worthwhile research directions related to IRS aided 6G ITS.

AB Roadside collisions are a significant problem faced by all countries. Urbanisation has led to an increase in traffic congestion and roadside vehicle collisions. According to the UK Government's Department for Transport, most vehicle collisions occur on urban roads, with empirical evidence showing drivers are more likely to break local and fixed speed limits in urban environments. Analysis conducted by the Department for Transport found that the UK's accident prevention measure's cost is estimated to be 33bn pound per year. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to investigate the causes of roadside collisions in urban environments to better prepare traffic management, support local council policies, and ultimately reduce collision rates. This study utilises agent-based modelling as a tool to plan, experiment and investigate the relationship between speeding and vehicle density with collisions. The study found that higher traffic density results in more vehicles travelling at a slower speed, regardless of the degree to which drivers comply with speed restrictions. Secondly, collisions increase linearly as speed compliance is reduced for all densities. Collisions are lowest when all vehicles comply with speed limits for all densities. Lastly, higher global traffic densities result in higher local traffic densities near-collision sites across all adherence levels, increasing the likelihood of congestion around these sites. This work, when extended to real-world applications using empirical data, can support effective road safety policies.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Due to the development of its own technology, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) play an increasingly important role in today's social production practice. The complex and changeable environment requires the development of innovative UAV path planning algorithms. In order to meet the requirements of the increasingly complex UAV flight environment, a new UAV flight path planning algorithm based on a version of the White Sharks Optimization (WSO) is proposed in this research. Firstly, the terrain matrix is used to establish the three-dimensional terrain environment and constraint function, and then WSO is improved for handling the path planning. In the process of path planning, multi-trajectory search, nonlinear convergence factor and the model of fish movement behavior are adopted to enrich the population diversity, excavate the search space, speed up the convergence and reduce the likelihood of falling into local optima. Based on the simulation results, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms in terms of optimization accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness, leading to improved outcomes in UAV flight path planning.

ID STANDOFF TRACKING
AB We study the problem of optimally coordinating multiple fixed-wing UAVs to perform vision-based target tracking, which entails that the UAVs are tasked with gathering the best joint vision-based measurements of an unpredictable ground target. We utilize an analytic expression for the error covariance associated with the fused measurements of the target's position, and we employ stochastic fourth-order models for all vehicles, thereby incorporating a high degree of realism into the problem formulation. While dynamic programming can generate an optimal control policy that minimizes the expected value of the fused geolocation error covariance over time, it is accompanied by significant computational challenges due to the curse of dimensionality. In order to circumvent this challenge, we present a novel policy generation technique that combines simulation-based policy iteration with a robust regression scheme. The resulting control policy offers a significant advantage over alternative approaches and shows that the optimal control strategy involves coordinating the UAVs' distances to the target rather than their viewing angles, which had been a common practice in target tracking.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; TIME
AB Increasing population and travel demand has prompted new efforts to model travel demand across the United States. One such model is rJourney that estimates travel demand among thousands of regions and models mode and destination choice. rJourney includes records representing 1.17 billion long-distance trips throughout the year 2010. Although inter-regional impacts caused by an increase of automated vehicles (AVs) has been investigated, there is little research on inter-regional travel and how longer distance destination and mode choices will change. Because of conveniences offered by AVs, the value of travel time of drivers is expected to fall, thus reducing the generalized cost of AV travel. To initially analyze the impacts of AVs in the United States, a new AV mode was added to a subset of the rJourney mode and destination choice models. With an initial scenario assuming an operating cost of AVs that is 118% of traditional cars, two outcomes are observed that are solely based on model results. First, the attractiveness of AVs severely digs into the airline travel market, reducing airline revenues to 53%. Second, the introduction of AVs results in a shift of destination choice, increasing travel in further distances for personal vehicles, but favoring closer distances across all modes, for an overall 6.7% decline in US passenger-miles traveled on existing long-distance trips. While this preliminary research has revealed an initial perspective on how an existing model can support AVs, the increasing availability of data as AVs emerge will refine nationwide long-distance modeling.

AB This paper focuses on racecar longitudinal control with highly-varying driving conditions. The main factors affecting the dynamic behavior of a vehicle, including aerodynamic forces, wheel rolling resistance, traction force resulting from changing tire-road interaction as well as the occurrence of sudden wind gusts or the presence of persistent winds, are considered and assumed to have unknown models. By exploiting the theory on delayed input-state observers and using measurement data about the vehicle and wheel speeds, a dynamic filter that allows the online reconstruction of the above-mentioned unknown time-varying quantities is derived. Moreover, by exploiting the notion of effective tire radius, a reduced-degree-of-freedom model for the longitudinal vehicle dynamics is obtained, which is independent of the traction force and that enables, when used with the observer filter described above, an accurate speed control compensating for the resistance forces. One appealing feature of the proposed estimation and control method is that it requires no model information about such forces, for which, at the state-of-the-art, only heuristic approximations to be a-priori identified are available. Its effectiveness is shown via the simulation of scenarios where the car is required to execute aggressive maneuvers and the asphalt road surface abruptly changes from dry to wet, snowy, and icy. The evaluation also reveals that the proposed estimation technique outperforms standard solutions even in the presence of measurement noise.

These measurements are shared between AUVs via acoustic modem and fused within each AUV's particle filter for estimating the target's position. The AUVs use a leader/follower multi-AUV control system to enable the AUVs to drive toward the estimated target state by following collision-free paths. Once within the local area of the target, the AUVs circumnavigate the target state until it moves to another area. The system builds on previous work by incorporating a new SmartTag package that can be attached to an individual's dorsal fin. The SmartTag houses a full inertial measurement unit (INU), video logger, acoustic transmitter, and timed release mechanism. After real-time AUV tracking experiments, the SmartTag is recovered. Logged IMU data are fused with logged AUV-obtained acoustic tag measurements within a particle filter to improve state estimation accuracy. This improvement is validated through a series of multi-AUV shark and boat tracking experiments conducted at Santa Catalina Island, California. When compared with previous work that did not use the SmartTag package, results demonstrated a decrease in mean position estimation error of 25-75%, tag orientation estimation errors dropped from 80 degrees to 30 degrees, the sensitivity of mean position error with respect to distance to the tag was less by a factor of 50, and the sensitivity of mean position error with respect to acoustic signal reception frequency to the tag was 25 times less. These statistics demonstrate a large improvement in the system's robustness when the SmartTag package is used. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The information exchange among vehicles and road infrastructure with wide sensing range can be accomplished by roadside units (RSUs). Communication delays occur and are influenced by different approaches of deployment of RSUs, which increases the complexity of vehicle automatic control in a mixed traffic flow. Therefore, a speed control strategy was proposed for mixed traffic flow considering RSU deployment distance, interaction radius, and communication delay, aimed at enhancing traffic safety and efficiency. The characteristics of RSU deployment were modeled as functions, where an adaptive efficiency function was proposed to evaluate different RSU deployment plans. An improved speed control model was then developed based on the characteristics of the RSU in the mixed traffic flow. In addition, numerical analysis and simulation were carried out to evaluate vehicle stability and traffic throughput based on the improved speed control model. The analysis results show that the proposed model is stable under different updating frequencies, with the best stability achieved when the velocity update frequency is 500 and the velocity update time interval is 0.01 s. Moreover, it was found that the spatial occupancy rate increases with the increment of penetration rate of autonomous vehicles, which improves the rate by at least 20% compared to the no-control scenario. Additionally, the average speed is also increased by 30% while under the influence of communication delays. This paper investigated the relationship between characteristics of RSUs and traffic performances, which is essential for DOTs to develop an effective RSU plan to adapt to the mixed traffic flow.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), in the context of cooperative intelligent transportation systems (C-ITS), are capable of exchanging information with each other and the infrastructure. They can also form platoons that can drive with shorter time headways resulting in potential higher capacity, smoother flow, less fuel consumption, and reduction in collisions. However, the literature assessing their impacts is still fragmented and does not provide a solid evidence base about their potential contributions, particularly that they are not widely deployed yet. This study aims to establish this evidence using a systematic literature review (SLR) of the relevant body of knowledge. In this paper, 347 journal publications from 2000 to 2021, are analyzed and critiqued. Comprehensive bibliographic and co-citation analyses are conducted to uncover the key findings and bring out a valid and balanced perspective of CAVs and their impacts on traffic operations. A co-citation analysis of the body of knowledge on this topic resulted in the formation of four main clusters of research focus that included safety, efficiency, communication, and technology. This SLR presents an unbiased and objective summary of scientific findings on the topic and serves as a starting point for future investigations on CAVs by identifying research gaps, limitations and challenges, and potential areas of research to overcome these challenges.

AB This work explores methodologies for dynamic trajectory generation for urban driving environments by utilizing coarse global plan representations. In contrast to state-of-the-art architectures for autonomous driving that often leverage lane-level high-definition (HD) maps, we focus on minimizing required map priors that are needed to navigate in dynamic environments that may change over time. To incorporate high-level instructions (i.e., turn right vs. turn left at intersections), we compare various representations provided by lightweight and open-source OpenStreetMaps (OSM) and formulate a conditional generative model strategy to explicitly capture the multimodal characteristics of urban driving. To evaluate the performance of the models introduced, a data collection phase is performed using multiple full-scale vehicles with ground truth labels. Our results show potential use cases in dynamic urban driving scenarios with real-time constraints. The dataset is released publicly as part of this work in combination with code and benchmarks.

AB An automotive radar simulator is proposed that can consider a dynamic driving scenario. The impulse response is computed based on the distance between the radar and the mesh position and the radar equation. The first-order physical optics technique is used to calculate the backscattering by the meshes, which can efficiently consider the shape of the target; however, because the radar operating frequency is very high, the required amount of mesh for discretization is large. Hence, the calculation of the time-domain echo signal requires considerable computational time. To reduce this numerical complexity, a new scheme is proposed to accurately approximate the time-domain baseband signal generated by the large number of meshes. The radar adopts the frequency modulated continuous waveform. Range-Doppler processing is used to estimate the range and relative velocity of the targets based on which simulation results are numerically verified for a driving scenario.

TI Negotiating Visibility for Safe Autonomous Navigation in Occluding and
   Uncertain Environments
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Motion planning; mobile robots; optimal control
AB Navigation through an occluded environment is a challenging task for autonomous mobile robots (AMR), since they must balance both safety and speed in an attempt to fluidly steer around occlusions in uncertain environments. This is because real world environments have dynamic actors that may be occluded to the robot during motion, introducing uncertainty. One key element of eliminating this uncertainty is moving in such a way to maximize perception around these occlusions. This letter presents a novel control framework that combines both perception and safety constraints, resulting in motion that is quick and safe when occlusions are present. Perception is satisfied using a model predictive control (MPC)-based approach to provide inputs that increase visibility around occlusions while safety is promoted by modeling uncertainties as projected probabilities of occupancy derived from current observation and expected traffic motion. Improvements in visibility, safety, and speed are shown in simulations and are experimentally validated using an unmanned ground vehicle.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method that allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to execute navigation tasks in large-scale complex environments. This technique is important for many applications such as goods delivery and remote surveillance. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and solved by a novel online DRL algorithm designed based on two strictly proved policy gradient theorems within the actor-critic framework. In contrast to conventional simultaneous localization and mapping-based or sensing and avoidance-based approaches, our method directly maps UAVs' raw sensory measurements into control signals for navigation. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can enable UAVs to autonomously perform navigation in a virtual large-scale complex environment and can be generalized to more complex, larger-scale, and three-dimensional environments. Besides, the proposed online DRL algorithm addressing POMDPs outperforms the state-of-the-art.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; MOBILE
AB The basic functions of an autonomous vehicle typically involve navigating from one point to another in the world by following a reference path and analyzing the traversability along this path to avoid potential obstacles. What happens when the vehicle is subject to uncertainties in its localization? All its capabilities, whether path following or obstacle avoidance, are affected by this uncertainty, and stopping the vehicle becomes the safest solution. In this work, we propose a framework that optimally combines path following and obstacle avoidance while keeping these two objectives independent, ensuring that the limitations of one do not affect the other. Absolute localization uncertainty only has an impact on path following, and in no way affects obstacle avoidance, which is performed in the robot's local reference frame. Therefore, it is possible to navigate with or without prior information, without being affected by position uncertainty during obstacle avoidance maneuvers. We conducted tests on an EZ10 shuttle in the PAVIN experimental platform to validate our approach. These experimental results show that our approach achieves satisfactory performance, making it a promising solution for collision-free navigation applications for mobile robots even when localization is not accurate.

AB Reaction delay is an indispensable factor in the operation and control process of drivers in a car-following scenario. Utilizing trajectory data obtained from an instrumented vehicle, this paper proposes a data-driven neural network car-following model incorporating instantaneous reaction delay of the drivers in nonlane-based (or disorderly) traffic systems. Considering instantaneous reaction delay as the time interval between relative speed and acceleration, a model is developed where the lateral descriptor of vehicle interaction (or centerline separation, CS) is found as a significant factor in modeling reaction delays in such disordered systems. Interestingly, reaction delays were found to increase with lateral separation between the interacting vehicles. Modeling results further indicate that the car-following model with instantaneous reaction delay outperformed the model with fixed reaction delay. In addition, the proposed model also showed better performance in terms of trajectory reproducing accuracy when compared with the classic car-following models. The results of this work justify the importance of considering CS in the development of algorithms for future autonomous traffic of disorderly traffic environments.

AB Recently, interest in ultrawideband (UWB)-based localization systems has increased in various application fields. However, since UWB anchors are usually fixed, they work only within the limited range that UWB measurement signals can reach. To address this issue, a swarm flight system with movable UWB anchors is developed. One ground station controls multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), each of which is equipped with a UWB anchor and real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) capabilities, and collects the precise (centimeter-level) positions of the UWB anchor UAVs through RTK-GPS. In this way, the constraints of existing UWB systems can be alleviated by changing the UWB anchor positions in real time as desired by the user. In addition, this paper proposes a novel localization algorithm using only time-of-flight (TOF) measurements from UWB signals, heading information from an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS), and altitude information from a barometer. The results of UAV flight tests show that the proposed algorithm provides better localization performance than existing algorithms.

AB This paper presents a low-cost real-time lane-determination system that fuses micro-electromechanical systems inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes), global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and commercially available road network maps. The system can be used for intelligent transportation systems, telematics applications, and autonomous driving. The system does not depend on visual markings or highly precise GNSS technology, such as DGPS or RTK, and it does not need explicit lane-level resolution maps. High-resolution estimation of the vehicle's position, velocity, and orientation is implemented by fusing inertial sensors with GNSS in a loosely coupled mode using extended Kalman filter. A curve-to-curve road-level map-matching is implemented using a hidden Markov model followed by a least-square regression step that estimates the vehicle's lane. The system includes a lane-change detector based on inertial sensors and the filtered vehicle's state. The system has been realized in real time and tested extensively on real-road data. Experiments showed robust map-matching in challenging road intersections and a 97.14% lane-determination success rate.

AB This article presents navigation, guidance and control (NGC) experimental results obtained on an innovative overactuated unmanned surface marine vessel (USV) capable of omnidirectional motion. The results were obtained during sea trials in real environmental conditions where external disturbances and sensor characteristics have significant influence on the vehicle behavior. While performing the NGC experiments, the following set of behaviors is demonstrated: (1) successful heading control even in cases when the USV is performing simultaneous omnidirectional motion; (2) dynamic positioning algorithm performance with the navigation filter that uses only GPS measurement and a simple uncoupled dynamic model of an overactuated USV; (3) two line following algorithms (one using full actuation capabilities, and the other emulating underactuated line following) and comparing them by using quality metrics; and (4) online modification of mission parameters within the mission control architecture that is based on three layers (primitives, high-level and low-level control). Finally, we use results from multiple days of experiments to show how GPS update frequency influences (i) the quality of DP performance and (ii) the quality of the commanded control signal.

AB Radar sensor networks are today widely used in the field of autonomous driving and for generating high-precision images of the environment. The accuracy of the environmental representation depends to a large extent on the accurate knowledge of the sensor's mounting orientation. Both the relative orientation of the sensors to each other and the relative sensor orientation in relation to the vehicle coordinate system are determining factors. For the first time, the orientation estimation of the radar sensors of a network is possible exclusively on the basis of radar target lists without additional localization and orientation devices, such as an inertial measurement unit or global navigation satellite systems. In this work, two algorithms for determining the orientation of incoherently networked radar sensors with respect to the vehicle coordinate system and with respect to each other are derived and characterized. With the presented algorithms, orientation accuracies up to 0.25 degrees are achieved. Furthermore, the algorithms do not impose any requirements on the positioning or the orientation of the radar sensors, such as overlapping field of views or the detection of identical targets. The presented algorithms are applicable to arbitrary driving trajectories as well as for point targets and extended targets which enables the use in regular road traffic.

AB The Thwaites Glacier grounding zone has experienced sustained pulses of rapid retreat over the past two centuries, according to sea floor observations obtained by an autonomous underwater vehicle.
   Understanding the recent history of Thwaites Glacier, and the processes controlling its ongoing retreat, is key to projecting Antarctic contributions to future sea-level rise. Of particular concern is how the glacier grounding zone might evolve over coming decades where it is stabilized by sea-floor bathymetric highs. Here we use geophysical data from an autonomous underwater vehicle deployed at the Thwaites Glacier ice front, to document the ocean-floor imprint of past retreat from a sea-bed promontory. We show patterns of back-stepping sedimentary ridges formed daily by a mechanism of tidal lifting and settling at the grounding line at a time when Thwaites Glacier was more advanced than it is today. Over a duration of 5.5 months, Thwaites grounding zone retreated at a rate of >2.1 km per year-twice the rate observed by satellite at the fastest retreating part of the grounding zone between 2011 and 2019. Our results suggest that sustained pulses of rapid retreat have occurred at Thwaites Glacier in the past two centuries. Similar rapid retreat pulses are likely to occur in the near future when the grounding zone migrates back off stabilizing high points on the sea floor.

AB Intelligent driving system requires more precise and reliable steering control, and steering-by-wire (SBW) technology can better adapt to the development of autonomous driving. The permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) servo system is the actuator of the SBW. Aiming at the uncertainties of the PMSM servo system, a new adaptive control method for the PMSM servo system is proposed. Parameter adaptive laws are designed for each slowly varying parameter and unknown parameter, and robust terms are introduced to the adaptive laws for the parameter uncertainties. The convergence speed of the parameter adaptive law proposed can be improved by adjusting the parameters related to the convergence rate. To reduce the scope of disturbance uncertainties, the steering load disturbances are divided into a bounded unknown time-varying part and a predictable time-varying disturbance. Based on the Luenberger observer, the prediction term of the load torque is estimated by the current of PMSM in real time. By introducing boundary estimation and robust term of unknown disturbance into the control law and parameter adaptive law, respectively, the uncertainties of parameters and unknown external disturbance can be compensated. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop tests are carried out on the SBW platform. Experiments show that the control strategy of the PMSM servo system designed in this article has good tracking accuracy and stability.

AB Pedestrian detection by a car is typically performed using camera, LIDAR, or RADAR-based systems. The first two systems, based on the propagation of light, do not work in foggy or poor visibility environments, and the latter are expensive and the probability associated with their ability to detect people is low. It is necessary to develop systems that are not based on light propagation, with reduced cost and with a high detection probability for pedestrians. This work presents a new sensor that satisfies these three requirements. An active sound system, with a sensor based on a 2D array of MEMS microphones, working in the 14 kHz to 21 kHz band, has been developed. The architecture of the system is based on an FPGA and a multicore processor that allow the system to operate in real time. The algorithms developed are based on a beamformer, range and lane filters, and a CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) detector. In this work, tests have been carried out with different people and in different ranges, calculating, in each case and globally, the Detection Probability and the False Alarm Probability of the system. The results obtained verify that the developed system allows the detection and estimation of the position of pedestrians, ensuring that a vehicle travelling at up to 50 km/h can stop and avoid a collision.

AB Humanitarian Crisis scenarios typically require immediate rescue intervention. In many cases, the conditions at a scene may be prohibitive for human rescuers to provide instant aid, because of hazardous, unexpected, and human threatening situations. These scenarios are ideal for autonomous mobile robot systems to assist in searching and even rescuing individuals. In this study, we present a synchronous ground-aerial robot collaboration approach, under which an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a humanoid robot solve a Search and Rescue scenario locally, without the aid of a commonly used Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Specifically, the UAV uses a combination of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping and OctoMap approaches to extract a 2.5D occupancy grid map of the unknown area in relation to the humanoid robot. The humanoid robot receives a goal position in the created map and executes a path planning algorithm in order to estimate the FootStep navigation trajectory for reaching the goal. As the humanoid robot navigates, it localizes itself in the map while using an adaptive Monte-Carlo Localization algorithm by combining local odometry data with sensor observations from the UAV. Finally, the humanoid robot performs visual human body detection while using camera data through a Darknet pre-trained neural network. The proposed robot collaboration scheme has been tested under a proof of concept setting in an exterior GNSS-denied environment.

AB Boxfishes (family Ostraciidae) are tropical reef-dwelling marine bony fishes that have about three-fourths of their body length encased in a rigid bony test. As a result, almost all of their swimming movements derive from complex combinations of movements of their median and paired fins (MPF locomotion). In terms of both body design and swimming performance, they are among the most sophisticated examples known of naturally evolved vertebrate autonomous underwater vehicles. Quantitative studies of swimming performance, biomechanics, and energetics in one model species have shown that (i) they are surprisingly strong, fast swimmers with great endurance; (ii) classical descriptions of how they swim were incomplete: they swim at different speeds using three different gaits; (iii) they are unusually dynamically well controlled and stable during sustained and prolonged rectilinear swimming; and (iv) despite unusually high parasite (fuselage) drag, they show energetic costs of transport indistinguishable from those of much better streamlined fishes using body and caudal fin (BCF) swimming modes at similar water temperatures and over comparable ranges of swimming speeds. We summarize an analysis of these properties based on a dynamic model of swimming in these fishes. This model accounts for their control, stability, and efficiency in moving through the water at moderate speeds in terms of gait changes, of water-flow patterns over body surfaces, and of complex interactions of thrust vectors generated by fin movements.

TI Precise Vehicle Position and Heading Estimation Using a Binary Road
   Marking Map
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGORITHM
AB Road markings are always present on roads to guide and control traffic. Therefore, they can be used at any time for vehicle localization. Moreover, they can be easily extracted by using light detection and ranging (LIDAR) intensity because they are brightly colored. We propose a vehicle localization method using a 2D road marking grid map. The grid map inserts the map information into the grid directly. Thus, an additional process (such as line detection) is not required and there is no problem due to false detection. We obtained road marking using a 3D LIDAR (Velodyne HDL-32E) and binarized this information to store in the map. Thus, we could reduce the map size significantly. In the previous research, the road marking grid map was used only for position estimation. However, we propose a position-and-heading estimation algorithm using the binary road marking grid map. Accordingly, we derive more precise position estimation results. Moreover, position reliability is an important factor for vehicle localization. Autonomous vehicles may cause accidents if they cannot maintain their lane momentarily. Therefore, we propose an algorithm for evaluating map matching results. Consequently, we can use only reliable matching results and increase position reliability. The experiment was conducted in Gangnam, Seoul, where GPS error occurs largely. In the experimental results, the lateral root mean square (RMS) error was 0.05m and longitudinal RMS error was 0.08 m. Further, we obtained a position error of less than 50 cm in both lateral and longitudinal directions with a 99% confidence level.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS; SYSTEM
AB This paper proposes a closed-loop form quantization algorithm that guarantees the boundness of accumulative error. The algorithm is particularly useful for mobile robot navigation that is usually implemented on embedded systems. If the wheel command of the mobile robot is a given by velocity or positional increments at every control instant that are quantized due to the finite word length of the controller's CPU, the quantization error accumulates to produce large position error. Such an error is critical for wheeled mobile robots or autonomous vehicles with non-holonomic constraints. To solve this problem, a non-error accumulative quantization algorithm with a closed-loop form is presented. We can extend it to a generalized form cot-responding to the nth-order accumulation. The boundness of the accumulative quantization error is proven via mathematic processes and verified by a series of computer simulations. The proposed method is effective to accurately control the autonomous mobile robot, particularly with embedded systems.

AB This paper describes the experiments on orientation recovery and steering of an autonomous mobile robot which uses an encoded magnetic compass disc as an orientation sensor, The mobile robot developed for experiments in this work is highly cost-effective and has two independent position-sensing systems, The one is an odometric sensor installed on the passive castor wheel, and the other consists of an optical incremental shaft encoder using magnetic compass disc, The experiments have been performed on two cases: (1) line path tracking test in a slippery environment and (2) orientation steering test in a circular path, Experimental results show that, while line path tracking in a slippery environment, the orientation of the mobile robot is recovered successfully with an acceptable position shift after two-time recovery action, For the circular path test case, the strayed angle after 90 degrees orientation steering is only about 0.3 degrees. It is shown that the system designed is simple and applicable to mobile robot navigation.

AB This paper proposes a distributed controller for a rendezvous problem of multiple underactuated underwater vehicles (UUVs). The multiple UUVs move in three dimensional space. The formation controller designing process is divided into two parts. In the first part, a systematic distributed optimization method will be established on the basis of a learning game algorithm. This algorithm inherits the learning game theory's nature, that is, simplification and convergence. The property of learning makes the algorithm robust and autonomous. In the second part, based on above algorithm and the line of sight method, the way point tracking controller is designed. In this paper, tracking control problem of position error is converted into the stable control problem of speed error, the heading angle error and the vertical inclination error. The process of controller design is divided into two stages, which avoids the singularity problem. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and adaptive backstepping iterative design method, precise tracking control of the UUV speed, heading and pitch angle is achieved. Finally, simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed controller.

AB A major challenge encountered in the development of systems exposed to weather stressors, such as auton-omous vehicles and unstaffed aerial vehicles, is to ensure their proper functioning under adverse rain or snow conditions. Since the sensing of the surroundings by these vehicles relies on optical sensors such as lidars and cameras, it is essential to ensure the robustness of these systems from the early stages of the project. In this respect, experiments in climatic wind tunnels provide a solution for simulating the operating conditions that the autonomous vehicles will confront. This work proposes a method based on field measurements and unsupervised machine learning to faithfully reproduce in controlled environments real weather conditions captured during wintertime in Ontario, Canada. The purpose of this paper is not to investigate correlations between observed weather conditions and the characteristics of the precipitation encountered, but rather to establish a consistent method based on outdoor disdrometer data to identify critical parameters to be simulated in climatic wind tunnels. To achieve this goal, weather data such as temperature, relative humidity, and droplet size distri-bution were recorded at General Motors's McLaughlin Advanced Technology Track (MATT) using an FD70 disdrometer and WXT530 weather transmitter, both manufactured by Vaisala, installed on a car provided by the Automotive Center of Excellent (ACE) team of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. The implementation of the proposed method allowed the identification of precipitation clusters characterized by parameters of a theoretical model for particle size distri-butions fitted to the collected data.

AB To achieve large-scale automatic operation of agricultural machinery, we designed and developed a following agricultural machinery automatic navigation system. The system consists of a master and a slave agricultural machinery. The master is auto-pilot or manual driving, and the slave follows the master to perform an automatic navigation task. The automatic navigation system adopts a steering wheel control method and consists of a positioning unit, steering control device, wireless communication unit, and vehicle terminal device. Among which, the positioning unit is a global navigation satellite system receiver. The steering control device includes a steering wheel rotation control unit and a front-wheel rotation angle detection feedback unit. The wireless communication unit adopts a data transmission radio to transfer the information between the master and the slaves. The vehicle terminal equipment uses an industrial computer to make navigation decisions and generate instructions. The vehicle terminal software of the master slave navigation system, including agricultural machinery positioning, data communication, navigation, and tracking control modules, was designed. This system can realize data communication, processing, storage, and display. To verify the performance of the designed system, a pilot battery car was used as the master, and the Euro-leopard M904-D tractor (LOVOL Inc., China) was used as the slave. Experimental results showed that the performance of the system is stable, and the slave can autonomously follow the master at a vehicle speed of 0.8 m/s. Furthermore, the root-mean-square error is 6.76 cm, which can satisfy the field operation requirements.

AB Target detection for unmanned aerial vehicles is an important issue in autonomous formation flight. In this paper, a novel target detection approach for unmanned aerial vehicle formation is proposed based on edge matching. The windowed edge potential function is utilized to describe the attraction field for similar edges. Afterwards, the edge-based target detection problem can be formulated as an optimization problem. An improved version of the bird swarm algorithm, which is called competitive bird swarm algorithm, is proposed to find the location, rotation angle and scale of a given template on a specific image. A strategy named "disturbing the local optimum" is designed to help the original bird swarm algorithm converge to the global optimal solution faster and more stably. Formation flight platforms, which consists of unmanned aerial vehicles moving in leader-follower pattern, are used in our experiments. Images obtained by vision sensors embedded in the leaders are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed algorithm is tested on both indoor and outdoor images to demonstrate the robustness. Comparative experiments with other state-of-the-art algorithms, including genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony algorithm, pigeon-inspired optimization, and the basic bird swarm algorithm, are also conducted. The results prove the superiority and robustness of the proposed target detection algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB A low-cost, small, lightweight hyperspectral sensor system that can be loaded onto small unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV) platforms has been developed for the acquisition of aerial hyperspectral data. Safe and easy observation is possible under unstable illumination conditions by using lightweight and autonomous cruising. The hyperspectral sensor system, equipped with a 256-band hyperspectral sensor covering a spectral range from 340-763 nm, a GPS and a data logger, is 400 g in total weight. The acquisition period for each sampling, 768 bytes, is 100 ms. The aerial hyperspectral data of rice paddies are collected under cloudy weather. The flight altitude from the ground is 10 m, and the cruising speed is 2 m/s. The high-accuracy estimation of the chlorophyll densities is confirmed, even under unstable illumination conditions, by frequent monitoring of the illumination level and the chlorophyll indices, based on the red-edge (RE) and near infrared (NIR) spectral ranges.

AB The future challenges and potential opportunities of robotics and autonomous systems in urban ecosystems, and how they may impact biodiversity, are explored and prioritized via a global horizon scan of 170 experts.
   Technology is transforming societies worldwide. A major innovation is the emergence of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS), which have the potential to revolutionize cities for both people and nature. Nonetheless, the opportunities and challenges associated with RAS for urban ecosystems have yet to be considered systematically. Here, we report the findings of an online horizon scan involving 170 expert participants from 35 countries. We conclude that RAS are likely to transform land use, transport systems and human-nature interactions. The prioritized opportunities were primarily centred on the deployment of RAS for the monitoring and management of biodiversity and ecosystems. Fewer challenges were prioritized. Those that were emphasized concerns surrounding waste from unrecovered RAS, and the quality and interpretation of RAS-collected data. Although the future impacts of RAS for urban ecosystems are difficult to predict, examining potentially important developments early is essential if we are to avoid detrimental consequences but fully realize the benefits.

AB The design process for Variable Buoyancy System (VBS) is not known in full, and existing approaches are not scalable. Furthermore, almost all the small size Autonomous Underwater Vehicles/Gliders (AUVs/G's) use very low capacity of buoyancy change (in the range of few milliliters) and the large size AUVs require large buoyancy change. Especially for adverse weather conditions, emergency recovery or defense-related applications, higher rate of rising/sinking (heave velocity) is needed along with an ability to hover at certain depth of operation. Depth of UVs can be controlled either by changing the displaced volume or by changing the overall weight and, herein, our focus is on the later. This article presents the problem of design and analysis of VBS for efficient hovering control of underwater vehicles at desired depth using the state feedback controller. We formulate and analyze the design and analysis approach of VBS using the fundamental of mechanics, system dynamics integration and control theory. Buoyancy is controlled by changing the overall weight of the vehicle using the ballasting/de-ballasting of water in ballast tanks through the use of Positive Displacement Pump (PDP) for control in heave velocity and hovering depth. Furthermore, detailed mass metric analysis of scalable design of VBS for different buoyancy capacities is performed to analyze the overall performance of the VBS. Also, the performances of AUVs integrated with VBS of different buoyancy capacities are investigated in both the open loop and closed loop with the LQR state feedback controller. Hovering performance results are presented for three Design Examples (DEs) of AUVs with 2.8 m, 4.0 m and 5.0 m length and they are integrated with various buoyancy capacities at 9 kg/min rate of change of buoyancy. Results indicate that the AUVs achieve the desired depth with almost negligible steady state error and when they reach the desired hovering depth of 400 m the maximum pitch angle achieved of 16.5 degree for all the Des is observed. Maximum heave velocity achieved during sinking is 0.44 m/s and it reduces to zero when the vehicle reaches the desired depth of hovering. The presented computer simulation results indicate good performance and demonstrate that the designed VBS is effective and efficient in changing the buoyancy, controlling and maintaining the depth, controlling the heave velocity and can be used in rescue/attack operations of both the civil and defense UVs.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles are gaining immense attention in diverse commercial and civil applications. However, adopting this technology will rely on management services that support safe operation. UAV traffic management systems (UTM) aim to facilitate safe, efficient, and fair access to the low-altitude airspace. However, these systems are centralized and lack protocols for secure interaction between the system agents such as authorities, service providers, and end-users. Another limitation of proposed UTM architectures is the absence of efficient mechanisms to enforce airspace rules and regulations. To address these issues, we present a decentralized UTM protocol that controls access to airspace and ensures the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For this purpose, we exploit features of the blockchain and smart-contract technologies. In addition, we employ a mobile crowdsensing technique to seamlessly enforce airspace rules and regulations that govern UAV operations. The solution is implemented on top of the Ethereum platform and evaluated using four different tools for smart-contract verification. We also provide security and performance analysis of the solution. For reproducibility, we made our implementation publicly available on Github.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted considerable research attention because of their strong interoperability, high flexibility, and excellent maneuverability. Path planning and autonomous obstacle avoidance are critical for UAVs. In this study, multiobjective optimization using the ant colony algorithm was performed for solving the UAV obstacle avoidance path planning problem. To overcome the easy-to-fall-into-deadlock tendency and slow convergence speed of the conventional ant colony algorithm, an elite ant colony algorithm was proposed for improving path selection probability and pheromone update strategy. Next, the response surface method was used to analyze the key parameters in the improved algorithm, construct the regression prediction model of response indicators, perform variance analysis, and verify the reliability of the model. The key parameters were optimized to obtain the best parameter combination, and simulation experiments were conducted. The results revealed that the performance of path length, running time, and robustness in various terrains improved considerably. Thus the proposed method is a feasible scheme for the path planning of UAVs in military search and rescue and material transportation.

ID VEHICLE; MODEL
AB Today the automotive industry faces a robust trend toward assisted and automated driving. The technology to accomplish this ambition has evolved rapidly over the last few years, and yet there are still a lot of algorithmical challenges left to make an automation of the driving task a safe and comfortable experience. One of the main remaining challenges is the comprehension of the current traffic situation and the anticipation of all traffic participants' future driving behavior, which is needed for the technical system to obtain situation awareness: an indispensable foundation for successful decision-making. In this paper, a prediction framework is presented that is able to infer a driver's maneuver intention. This is achieved via a hybrid Bayesian network whose hidden layers represent a driver's lane contentedness. A pre-training of the network's parameters with simulated data provides for human interpretable parameters even after running the expectation maximization algorithm based on data gathered on German highways. Moreover, the future driving path of any traffic participant is predicted by solving an optimal control problem, whereby the parameters of the optimal control formulation are found via inverse reinforcement learning.

AB The concept of precision agriculture, which proposes farming management adapted to crop variability, has emerged in recent years. To effectively implement precision agriculture, data must be gathered from the field in an automated manner at minimal cost. In this study, a small autonomous field inspection vehicle was developed to minimise the impact of the scouting on the crop and soil compaction. The proposed approach integrates a camera with a GPS receiver to obtain a set of basic behaviours required of an autonomous mobile robot to inspect a crop field with full coverage. A path planner considered the field contour and the crop type to determine the best inspection route. An image-processing method capable of extracting the central crop row under uncontrolled lighting conditions in real time from images acquired with a reflex camera positioned on the front of the robot was developed. Two fuzzy controllers were also designed and developed to achieve vision-guided navigation. A method for detecting the end of a crop row using camera-acquired images was developed. In addition, manoeuvres necessary for the robot to change rows were established. These manoeuvres enabled the robot to autonomously cover the entire crop by following a previously established plan and without stepping on the crop row, which is an essential behaviour for covering crops such as maize without damaging them.

AB This work presents an autonomous system based on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for victim detection using shape template matching. The system blends an optical image into a thermograph to overcome limitations inherent in the visible and infrared spectra. The system also implements image enhancements to counter thermal image degradation in warm climates. All processing is performed in real-time on-board the UAV to maximize autonomy. The outcome is a set of coordinates allowing direct access to the detected victims by rescue crews. An evaluation vehicle was constructed using a readily available drone with standard off-the-shelf components. The prototype accurately detected all victims in the test area, with rare false positives. The proposed image analysis combination was effective even under elevated ambient temperatures. The prototype was able to capture and analyze an image every three seconds allowing travel at a speed close to 2 m/sec. An area of 10,0 0 0 m(2) can be scanned from an altitude of 10 m without the need for recharging. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents scalable traffic stability analysis for both pure connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) traffic and mixed traffic based on continuum traffic flow models. Human-drive vehicles (HDVs) are modeled by a non-equilibrium traffic flow model, i.e., Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) to capture HDV traffic's unstable nature. CAVs are modeled by a mean field game describing their non-cooperative behaviors as rational utility-optimizing agents. Working with continuum models helps avoiding scalabillty issues in microscopic multi-class traffic models. We demonstrate from linear stability analysis that the mean field game traffic flow model behaves differently from traditional traffic flow models and stability can only be proved when the total density is in a certain regime. We also show from numerical experiments that CAVs help stabilize mixed traffic. Further, we quantify the impact of CAV's penetration rate and controller design on traffic stability. The results may provide qualitative insights on traffic stability in mixed-autonomy for human drivers and city planners. The results also provide suggestions on CAV controller design for CAV manufacturers.

AB Robots have the potential to assist and complement humans in the exploration of hostile environments. For example, underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMSs) have been researched and applied in underwater operations. Motivated by the need for collecting marine organisms cultivated in shallow sea aquafarm, a lightweight and portable UVMS propelled by flexible flippers (named, F-UVMS), rather than typical propellers or jet-based propulsion systems, is investigated. To this end, integrative mechatronic design of F-UVMS is first presented, involving six flipper propulsors for generating thrust in a flapping way, a four-degree-of-freedom arm for grasping, and a certain amount of onboard sensors for environment perception. A thrust-power measurement platform is established to evaluate thrust-power relationship for different sizes and stiffness of flippers. Meanwhile, the locomotion modalities of F-UVMS are analyzed. A framework based on the nonlinear model-predictive control method is implemented to govern autonomous tracking marine organisms. The capabilities of F-UVMS are validated through a series of experiments in laboratory pool and field missions in real sea conditions.

AB We report a localization method that does not rely on the perception and recognition of landmarks for a robot/vehicle traveling in urban area. This is intended to be a fall back solution when everything else fails due to bad weather or other environmental challenges. The method is also very low cost and does not require intensive computation. Named as proprioceptive localization assisted by magnetoreception (PLAM), it employs a gyroscope and a compass to sense heading changes and matches the heading sequence with a preprocessed heading graph to localize the robot. We track the sensory and map uncertainties and model them in the process to formulate a sequential Bayesian estimation problem framework. Not all cases can be successful because degenerated maps may consist of rectangular grid-like streets and the robot may travel in a loop. To analyze these, we use information entropy to model map characteristics and perform both simulation and experiments to find out typical heading and information entropy requirements for localization. We have implemented our algorithm and tested it with both simulated and physical experiments. The results have confirmed that PLAM can localize vehicles on the map for nondegenerated cases.

AB Reliable assessment of terrain traversability using multi-sensory input is a key issue for driving automation, particularly when the domain is unstructured or semi-structured, as in natural environments. In this paper, LIDAR-stereo combination is proposed to detect traversable ground in outdoor applications. The system integrates two self-learning classifiers, one based on LIDAR data and one based on stereo data, to detect the broad class of drivable ground. Each single-sensor classifier features two main stages: an adaptive training stage and a classification stage. During the training stage, the classifier automatically learns to associate geometric appearance of 3D data with class labels. Then, it makes predictions based on past observations. The output obtained from the single-sensor classifiers are statistically combined in order to exploit their individual strengths and reach an overall better performance than could be achieved by using each of them separately. Experimental results, obtained with a test bed platform operating in rural environments, are presented to validate and assess the performance of this approach, showing its effectiveness and potential applicability to autonomous navigation in outdoor contexts.

AB Explaining the phenomenon of declining acceptance of automated driving technology (ADT) and predicting trends in acceptance has become an important area of research. To explore the reasons for the decline in acceptance of automated vehicles and how to improve user acceptance, we studied mechanisms of the influence process from the relationship between safety riskiness of ADT and user acceptance, and examined the mediating and moderating effects of the proposed intervention behaviors on the influence relationship between these two. First, an improved acceptance model incorporating safety risk factors was developed. Subsequently, the psychological change process of user acceptance was analyzed based on people's response to accident information. Ultimately, the results show that safety cognition risk regarding ADT has a significant negative impact on user acceptance. Next, the mediating model where user experience was introduced as a moderating variable was designed. From the test results of this model, it is found that the proposed behavioral intervention strategy is effective in attenuating the degree of impact of the safety riskiness of ADT on acceptance. The risk-based acceptance explanation model and intervention method designed in this study provide a scientific basis and practical approach to develop the market for automated vehicles.

AB Multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), although originally designed and developed for defence and military purposes, in the last ten years have gained momentum, especially for civilian applications, such as search and rescue, surveying and mapping, and agricultural crops and monitoring. Thanks to their hovering and Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capabilities and the capacity to carry out tasks with complete autonomy, they are now a standard platform for both research and industrial uses. However, while the flight control architecture is well established in the literature, there are still many challenges in designing autonomous guidance and navigation systems to make the UAV able to work in constrained and cluttered environments or also indoors. Therefore, the main motivation of this work is to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive literature review on the numerous methods and approaches to address path-planning problems for multi-rotor UAVs. In particular, the inclusion of a review of the related research in the context of Precision Agriculture (PA) provides a unified and accessible presentation for researchers who are initiating their endeavours in this subject.

AB In this paper, a concise leader-follower formation control approach is presented for a group of underactuated unmanned surface vehicle with dynamic system uncertainties and external environment disturbances, where the output errors are required to be within constraints. To settle the output error constraints, a standard barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is incorporated into the backstepping control method. Furthermore, the "differential explosion" problem of virtual control laws is avoided by introducing the dynamic surface control. To estimate the unknown dynamic terms, an adaptive neural network is designed and a nonlinear disturbance observer is adopted to compensate for the approximation errors of neural network and ocean environment disturbances. Under the constraint of output error, the presented controller based on standard BLF has simpler structure and better control performance than depended on tan-type BLF. The presented controller can ensure that the formation errors converge to a small range around zero, while the output error constraint requirements are met. All signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, and the numerical simulation further shows the effectiveness of the presented control scheme.

AB The research study aims to create a framework for autonomous control technology for unmanned aerial vehicles with real-time target-relative guidance capabilities, which leverages onboard decision-making to provide targeting and re-targeting solutions. Thus, this paper aims to develop extremal control and guidance functions in the context of the optimal control problem and their integration for applications. Solving the optimal control problem leads to a constant motor thrust case and trivial and nontrivial cases for the variable motor thrust case. As illustrative examples, two quadcopter maneuvers use integrated extremal control and explicit guidance. The first maneuver is the quadcopter taking off to the desired altitude using maximum and then intermediate thrust. The second maneuver has the quadcopter traveling to a waypoint over an agricultural field. The DJI Onboard Software Development Kit provides a method to implement the proposed integration of extremal control and explicit guidance onboard a Raspberry Pi connected to the DJI M100 quadcopter. Simulated and experimental flight tests demonstrate that the integration of extremal control and explicit guidance allows the DJI M100 to reach the desired locations and velocities for both maneuvers.

AB The performance of traditional techniques of passive localization in ocean acoustics such as time-of-arrival (phase differences) and amplitude ratios measured by multiple receivers may be degraded when the receivers are placed on an underwater vehicle due to effects of scattering. However, knowledge of the interference pattern caused by scattering provides a potential enhancement to traditional source localization techniques. Results based on a study using data from a multi-element receiving array mounted on the inner shroud of an autonomous underwater vehicle show that scattering causes the localization ambiguities (side lobes) to decrease in overall level and to move closer to the true source location, thereby improving localization performance, for signals in the frequency band 2-8 kHz. These measurements are compared with numerical modeling results from a two-dimensional time domain finite difference scheme for scattering from two fluid-loaded cylindrical shells. Measured and numerically modeled results are presented for multiple source aspect angles and frequencies. Matched field processing techniques quantify the source localization capabilities for both measurements and numerical modeling output. (c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America.

AB The utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has become prevalent nowadays. UAVs are autonomous devices, except for self-charging. Wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies eliminate human intervention in UAV charging and enable independent charging. The factors making WPT systems popular are autonomizing charging, eliminating cable complexity, and avoiding difficulties caused by environmental conditions. WPT of the UAV in the near field is provided by inductive coupling. In this paper, two vertical rectangular coils and horizontal DDD (triple rectangle) coils were placed in the receiver and the transmitter for UAV wireless charging, respectively. The design of the coils was made in ANSYS Maxwell 3D. A wireless charger of the UAV was designed for 100 W output power at 140 kHz frequency. The misalignment tolerance of the proposed design concerning the x- and y-axis was examined. In addition, the magnetic flux density and magnetic field distributions of the WPT system were investigated. The study found that the proposed design can transfer energy wirelessly with 94% efficiency up to 10.3 cm horizontal and 1.7 cm vertical misalignment.

AB This article focuses on minimizing the energy consumption of a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) disseminating information to a set of Internet of Things devices. In the considered scenario, each device wants to download a subset of files from a library of files. Considering the storage capacity of the UAVs, a framework is provided that minimizes energy consumption by optimally selecting the contributing UAVs, placing files, and planning the trajectory of each contributing UAV. In this framework, a combinatorial optimization problem is formulated, which is hard to solve directly for a practical number of devices, files, and/or UAVs. In order to tackle this challenge, we develop three solution approaches, namely, a multichromosome genetic algorithm (GA), a hybrid genetic-ant colony algorithm, and a GA with heuristic file placement. Results show that the proposed solution approaches minimize the total energy consumption and provide near-optimal solutions. Results also illustrate that the proposed framework optimizes the number of UAVs participating in the information delivery mission.

AB Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) cooperation systems, such as flocking, consensus, formation control have a wide range of applications in monitoring, mapping, and target tracking. Optimal cooperative control of such systems is particularly important to increase their working efficiency. This paper studies the optimal trajectory tracking and formation control problems for multi-UAVs with a leader-follower structure, and the distributed model predictive control (MPC) scheme based formation control method is proposed. In particular, a novel MPC strategy is firstly designed for the leader modelled by the nonlinear Newton-Euler equations, to generate a feasible tracking trajectory for the formation systems. Then, by separating the system dynamics of the followers into the translation motion and the rotation motion, a two-layer distributed MPC formation control algorithm is designed to reduce the computation and communication loads, while only requiring limited information of the neighbors' states. Finally, simulation and comparison studies verify the effectiveness of the designed algorithms.

AB This article presents the TransBoat, a novel omnidirectional unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with a magnet-based docking system for overwater construction with wave disturbances. This is the first such USV that can build overwater structures by transporting modules. The TransBoat incorporates two features designed to reject wave disturbances. First, the TransBoat's expandable body structure can actively transform from a mono-hull into a multihull for stabilization in turbulent environments by extending its four outrigger hulls. Second, a real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is proposed for all shapes of the TransBoat to enhance its maneuverability and resist disturbance to its movement, based on a nonlinear dynamic model. An experimental approach is proposed to identify the parameters of the dynamic model, and a subsequent trajectory tracking test validates the dynamics, NMPC controller, and system mobility. Further, docking experiments identify improved performance in the expanded form of the TransBoat compared with the contracted form, including an increased success rate (of similar to 10%) and reduced docking time (of similar to 40 s on average). Finally, a bridge construction test verifies our system design and the NMPC control method.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that has rapidly evolved in recent years. The ability to connect many devices is driving the development of new types of applications that allow the remote monitoring of a wide variety of devices. One of the great challenges that has been identified in this field is the monitoring of sensors scattered in wide areas or located in environments with poor or even no communications coverage. To deal with this problem, different approaches based on cellular or satellite communications have been considered. However, these alternatives are complex and very expensive. To overcome these drawbacks, we designed a system based on unmanned aerial vehicles and LoRa technology that enables data transfer from sensors to a central system. Furthermore, machine learning techniques were applied to process and classify the data retrieved from the sensors. Finally, a Java-based application was developed, providing services such as data storage, processing, and visualization. To verify the correct operation of the proposed system, manual and autonomous flight tests were carried out, verifying the correct transmission of the data from the sensors to the central system.

AB In this article, we study the trajectory control, subchannel assignment, and user association design for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-based wireless networks. We propose a method to optimize the max-min average rate subject to data demand constraints of ground users (GUs) where spectrum reuse and co-channel interference management are considered. The mathematical model is a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem which we solve by using the alternating optimization approach where we iteratively optimize the user association, subchannel assignment, and UAV trajectory control until convergence. For the subchannel assignment subproblem, we propose an iterative subchannel assignment (ISA) algorithm to obtain an efficient solution. Moreover, the successive convex approximation (SCA) is used to convexify and solve the nonconvex UAV trajectory control subproblem. Via extensive numerical studies, we illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed design considering different UAV flight periods and number of subchannels and GUs as compared with a simple heuristic.

AB Critical utility infrastructure like power grids are vast (in hundreds of kilometers), linear, and operated 24x7 throughout the year. Maintenance inspections using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial imaging are therefore gaining popularity. To have low-cost framework, the quality of the camera used is not of high quality or a stereo-rig one. Also, the sensors used are limited in variety and efficiency. 3-D reconstruction of a power grid will help to improve access, detect anomalies (damages), and reduce projection error. The depth estimation of wiry objects, like powerlines, in a cluttered background is challenging. The background clutter includes trees, pavement, greenery patches, and man-made objects. In this article, we propose an efficient framework for 3-D anomaly detection in power grids using UAV-based aerial images. The framework uses context information to become adaptive with different nonlinear movements that are unavoidable in aerial imaging. The proposed work is tested on real-data captured using a low-cost framework consisting of a non-stereo-rig aerial camera and a mini-UAV.

AB As the data rate and area capacity are enormously increased with the advent of 5G wireless communication, the network latency becomes a severe issue in a 5G network. Since there are various types of terminals in a 5G network such as vehicles, medical devices, robots, drones, and various sensors which perform complex tasks interacting with other devices dynamically, there is a need to handle heavy computing resource intensive operations. Placing a multiaccess edge computing (MEC) server at the base station, which is located at the edge, can be one of the solutions to it. The application running on the MEC platform needs a specific simulation technique to analyze complex systems inside the MEC network. We proposed and implemented a simulation as a service (SIMaaS) for the MEC platform, which is to offload the simulation using a Cloud infrastructure based on the concept of computation offloading. In the case study, the Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted using the proposed SIMaaS to select the optimal highway tollgate where vehicles are allowed to enter. It shows how clients of the MEC platform use SIMaaS to obtain certain goals.

AB This paper focuses on the trajectory tracking control problem for an articulated unmanned ground vehicle. We propose and compare two approaches in terms of performance and computational complexity. The first uses a nonlinear mathematical model derived from first principles and combines a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) with a nonlinear moving horizon estimator (NMHE) to produce a control strategy. The second is based on an input-state linearization (ISL) of the original model followed by linear model predictive control (LMPC). A fast real-time iteration scheme is proposed, implemented for the NMHE-NMPC framework and benchmarked against the ISL-LMPC framework, which is a traditional and cheap method. The experimental results for a time-based trajectory show that the NMHE-NMPC framework with the proposed real-time iteration scheme gives better trajectory tracking performance than the ISL-LMPC framework and the required computation time is feasible for real-time applications. Moreover, the ISL-LMPC produces results of a quality comparable to the NMHE-NMPC framework at a significantly reduced computational cost.

TI Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) landing in windy conditions
   with MAP-Elites
SO KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW
LA English
DT Review
ID ERROR
AB With the recent increase in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) comes a surge of inexperienced aviators who may not have the requisite skills to react appropriately if weather conditions quickly change while their aircraft are in flight. This creates a dangerous situation, in which the pilot cannot safely land the vehicle. In this work we examine the use of the MAP-Elites algorithm to search for sets of weights for use in an artificial neural network. This neural network directly controls the thrust and pitching torque of a simulated 3-degree of freedom (2 linear, 1 rotational) fixed-wing UAV, with the goal of obtaining a smooth landing profile. We then examine the use of the same algorithm in high-wind conditions, with gusts up to 30 knots.
   Our results show that MAP-Elites is an effective method for searching for control policies, and by evolving two separate controllers and switching which controller is active when the UAV is near-ground level, we can produce a wider variety of phenotypic behaviors. The best controllers achieved landing at a vertical speed of <1 m s(-1) and at an angle of approach of <1 degrees degree.

AB The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) as an environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuel cars faces a range of technological obstacles, including battery technology, charging infrastructure, and standardization. Dynamic conductive road charging (DCRC) of EVs at high speed has the potential to overcome the technical limitations of existing static charging methods. An intelligent motorway system for EVs called tracked electric vehicle (TEV) was proposed to incorporate the latest technologies of dynamic road charging, autonomous driving, and smart city data into transport infrastructure. This paper presents the operation and control of an active bipolar power collection unit (PCU) for the TEV system. The PCU is seamlessly integrated within the wheel structure of an EV using the concept of a stationary-hub wheel, enabling conductive power transfer from roadside conduction rails while the vehicle is in motion. The PCU is equipped with various features designed to maintain the contact force (CF) with the conduction rails, effectively handle instances of wheel bouncing and vibrations, and ensure a consistently smooth dynamic power transfer. This paper presents the experimental validations of the active PCU controls, including the operation sequence of the PCU, CF control, and PCU interaction with wheel bouncing.

ID PURSUIT-EVASION GAME
AB How to use environmental information to improve the cooperative chasing efficiency of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (multi-USV) is a problem worthy of attention. This article considers an archipelago scenario and proposes an obstacle-assisted chasing framework based on reinforcement learning, in which a multi-USV system chases a smart evader through autonomous environmental awareness and target state prediction. When there are obstacles near the evader, the chasing group can use them to quickly complete the chase. Otherwise, within the range of perception, the group can drive the evader closer to the obstacles or directly cooperate to catch the evader. At the same time, the problem of group credit allocation is also considered, so as to achieve a relatively stable encircling structure with the least number of vehicles. Simulation experiments in the multi-obstacle environment demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed framework. Compared with the traditional force-based and learning-based methods in untrained archipelago environments, the model trained by this framework is proven to have higher efficiency while ensuring real-time performance and generalization.

AB Monitoring of aquatic habitats for water quality and biodiversity requires regular sampling, often in off-shore locations and underwater. Such sampling is commonly performed manually from research vessels, or if autonomous, is constrained to permanent installations. Consequentially, high frequency ecological monitoring, such as for harmful algal blooms, are limited to few sites and/or temporally infrequent. Here, we demonstrate the use of MEDUSA, an Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicle which is capable of performing underwater sampling and inspection at up to 10 m depth, and is composed of a multirotor platform, a tether management unit and a tethered micro Underwater Vehicle. The system is validated in the task of vertical profiling of Chlorophyll-a levels in freshwater systems by means of a custom solid sample filtering mechanism. This mechanism can collect up to two independent samples per mission by pumping water through a pair of glass-fibre GF/F filters. Chlorophyll levels measured from the solid deposits on the filters are consistent and on par with traditional sampling methods, highlighting the potential of using UAAVs to sample aquatic locations at high frequency and high spatial resolution.

DE Map-matching; lane-level maps; GNSS; particle filters; camera lane
   detection; integrity
AB Navigation maps provide critical information for advanced driving assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. When these maps are refined to lane-level, ambiguities may occur during themap-matching process, particularly when positioning estimates are inaccurate. This paper presents a dead-reckoning method implementing a particle filter to estimate a set of likely map-matched hypotheses containing the correct solution with a high probability. Our method uses lane-level maps that feature dedicated attributes such as connectedness and adjacency. The vehicle position is essentially estimated by dead-reckoning sensors and lane detection using an intelligent camera. We also describe an integrity monitoring method for assessing the coherence of the set of hypotheses, using the fix of a global navigation satellite system receiver. The method provides in real-time a "Use/Don't Use" characterization of the vehicle positioning information that is transmitted to safety functions, where integrity is fundamental. The performance of the proposed map-aided dead-reckoning method with integrity monitoring is evaluated using data acquired by an experimental car on suburban public roads. The results obtained validate the approach.

AB National and international obligation to protect vulnerable species, communities, habitats, and ecosystems (VSCHEs) require greater attention as human uses extent to deeper water. These obligations increase the need for improved understanding of the distribution and abundance of VSCHEs to develop management actions. Data from low speed vehicles that operate at the seafloor (e.g. remotely operated vehicles camera sleds) predominate, These "low and slow approaches while providing high-resolution data do not operate at the scale required for management. We suggest autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) flown at relatively high altitude and high speed over the seafloor as a high and fast approach to survey areas at the scale fisheries and other activities operate. We used REMUS 6000 AUVs to collect presence data for VSCHEs in a rapid assessment on Physalia Seamount AUVs were programmed to collect digital images side-scan sonar (120.410 kHz); and environmental parameters and could navigate a 40 degrees slope. Our preliminary results of this approach predicated on the assumption that coarse taxonomic resolution is adequate for management needs indicates AUVs can be effective tools for large area surveys in short time periods.

AB Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods are increasingly being applied in Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) providing adaptive control responses to environmental disturbances. However, in physical platforms, these methods are hindered by their inherent data inefficiency and performance degradation when subjected to unforeseen process variations. This is particularly notorious in UUV manoeuvring tasks, where process observability is limited due to the complex dynamics of the environment in which these vehicles operate. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Biologically-Inspired Experience Replay method (BIER), which considers two types of memory buffers: one that uses incomplete (but recent) trajectories of state-action pairs, and another that emphasises positive rewards. The BIER method's ability to generalise was assessed by training neural network controllers for tasks such as inverted pendulum stabilisation, hopping, walking, and simulating halfcheetah running from the Gym-based Mujoco continuous control benchmark. BIER was then used with the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method on UUV manoeuvring tasks to stabilise the vehicle at a given velocity and pose under unknown environment dynamics. The proposed method was evaluated through simulated scenarios in a ROS-based UUV Simulator, progressively increasing in complexity. These scenarios varied in terms of target velocity values and the intensity of current disturbances. The results showed that BIER outperformed standard Experience Replay (ER) methods, achieving optimal performance twice as fast as the latter in the assumed UUV domain.

AB The objective of this work is to develop an optimal management strategy to improve the energetic efficiency of a hybrid electric vehicle. The strategy is built based on an extensive experimental study of mobility in order to allow trips recognition and prediction. For this experimental study, a dedicated autonomous acquisition system was developed. On working days, most trips are constrained and can be predicted with a high level of confidence. The database was built to assess the energy and power needed based on a static model for three types of cars. It was found that most trips could be covered by a 10 kWh battery. Regarding the optimization strategy, a novel real time capable energy management approach based on dynamic vehicle model was created using Energetic Macroscopic Representation. This real time capable energy management strategy is done by a combination of cycle prediction based on results obtained during the experimental study. The optimal control strategy for common cycles based on dynamic programming is available in the database. When a common cycle is detected, the pre-determined optimum strategy is applied to the similar upcoming cycle. If the real cycle differs from the reference cycle, the control strategy is adapted using quadratic programming. To assess the performance of the strategy, its resulting fuel consumption is compared to the global optimum calculated using dynamic programming and used as a reference; its optimality factor is above 98%.

AB Correlation filter (CF) is widely used in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking because of its efficient performance. However, due to the existence of edge effects, CF will be confused so that the peak of the response is no longer obvious, resulting in tracking drift and template degradation, thereby degrading CF performance. To handle the problem, we propose a new CF for this problem. First, we introduce a response-weighted background residual term to make CF learn the background in a targeted manner according to the strength of the response. Second, a history filter model is constructed and a spatio-temporal regularization term is introduced to improve the robustness of CF. Finally, we conduct experiments on two challenging UAV benchmarks, DTB70 and UAV123_10fps. The results show that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared with 15 other SOTA trackers, and can run at 58 frames/s on a single CPU, meeting the needs of UAV real-time tracking.

TI Anomaly Detection for Agricultural Vehicles Using Autoencoders

AB The safe in-field operation of autonomous agricultural vehicles requires detecting all objects that pose a risk of collision. Current vision-based algorithms for object detection and classification are unable to detect unknown classes of objects. In this paper, the problem is posed as anomaly detection instead, where convolutional autoencoders are applied to identify any objects deviating from the normal pattern. Training an autoencoder network to reconstruct normal patterns in agricultural fields makes it possible to detect unknown objects by high reconstruction error. Basic autoencoder (AE), vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), denoising autoencoder (DAE) and semisupervised autoencoder (SSAE) with a max-margin-inspired loss function are investigated and compared with a baseline object detector based on YOLOv5. Results indicate that SSAE with an area under the curve for precision/recall (PR AUC) of 0.9353 outperforms other autoencoder models and is comparable to an object detector with a PR AUC of 0.9794. Qualitative results show that SSAE is capable of detecting unknown objects, whereas the object detector is unable to do so and fails to identify known classes of objects in specific cases.
