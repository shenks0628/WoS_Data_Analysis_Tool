AB In recent years, the embedding approach for solving switched optimal control problems has been developed in a series of papers. However, the embedding approach, which advantageously converts the hybrid optimal control problem to a classical nonlinear optimization, has not been extensively compared with alternative solution approaches. The goal of this paper is thus to compare the embedding approach with multiparametric programming, mixed-integer programming [mixed integer programming (MIP), commercial (CPLEX)], and gradient-descent-based methods in the context of five recently published examples: 1) a spring-mass system; 2) moving-target tracking for a mobile robot; 3) two-tank filling; dc-dc boost converter; and 5) skid-steered vehicle. A sixth example, an autonomous switched 11-region linear system, is used to compare a hybrid minimum principle method and traditional numerical programming. For a given performance index (PI) for each case, cost and solution times are presented. It is shown that there are numerical advantages of the embedding approach: lower PI cost (except in some instances when autonomous switches are present), generally faster solution time, and convergence to a solution when other methods may fail. In addition, the embedding method requires no ad hoc assumptions (e.g., predetermined mode sequences) or specialized control models. Theoretical advantages of the embedding approach over the other methods are also described; guaranteed existence of a solution under mild conditions, convexity of the embedded hybrid optimization problem (under the customary conditions on the PI), solvability with traditional techniques (e.g., sequential quadratic programming) avoiding the combinatorial complexity in the number of modes/discrete variables of MIP, applicability to affine nonlinear systems, and no need to explicitly assign discrete/mode variables to autonomous switches. Finally, common misconceptions regarding the embedding approach are addressed, including whether it uses an average value control model (no), whether it is necessary to tweak the algorithm to obtain bang-bang solutions (no), whether it requires infinite switching to implement embedded solution (no), and whether it has real-time capability (yes).

AB Two-dimensional direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation in azimuth and elevation via radar systems equipped with uniform rectangular arrays (URAs) will play an important role in various application areas-most distinctively in future urban air mobility settings with unmanned aerial vehicles. A key factor is the fast and reliable provision of target detections in terms of range and DoA for safe autonomous operation of the vehicle using on-board antenna arrays with compact installation size. The authors present a technique for improving the performance of DoA estimation using compressive sensing in conjunction with multiple-input multiple-output arrays with electronically steered beams in the transmit direction. The simulation study investigates the impact of different design considerations on radar signal processing performance. An optimisation of a radar system using electronic beamsteering in the transmit domain is presented numerically. Based on the architecture of the URAs used, performance and detection accuracy can be improved.
   The authors deal with direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation of obstacles in the field-of-view (FoV) using compressive sensing (CS) and compares multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar signal processing with a codebook-based electronic beamsteering approach for compact radar sensors in future urban air mobility. Simulations show an improvement in the reliability of DoA estimation when using appropriate beamsteering directions, which can also be seen in the Grammian representation of the selected sensing matrix representing the electronic beamsteering codebook.image

AB Approximating the positions of vessels near underwater devices, such as unmanned underwater vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles, is crucial for many underwater operations. However, long-term monitoring of vessel trajectories is challenging due to limitations in underwater communications, posing challenges for the execution of underwater exploration missions. Therefore, trajectory prediction based on AIS data is vital in the fusion of underwater detection information. However, traditional models for underwater vessel trajectory prediction typically work well for only small-scale and short-term predictions. In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed that leverages a look-back window to decompose the temporal and motion features of ship movement trajectories, enabling long-term vessel prediction in broader sea areas. This research introduces an innovative model structure that enables trajectory features to be simultaneously learned for a larger range of vessels and facilitates long-term prediction. Through this innovative model design, the proposed model can more accurately predict vessel trajectories, providing reliable and comprehensive forecasting results. Our proposed model outperforms the Nlinear model by a 16% improvement in short-term prediction accuracy and an approximately 8% improvement in long-term prediction accuracy. The model also outperforms the Patch model by 5% in accuracy. In summary, the proposed method can produce competitive predictions for the long-term future trajectory trends of ships in large-scale sea areas.

AB The progress in wireless technology over the past decade led to the rapid adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for various applications. As the interest in UAVs is accelerating, increased attention is paid to the reliability and resilience of UAV-based systems with respect to the collision avoidance. One of the ways to improve this aspect is to utilize the RADAR functionality. In this work, we consider a cellular network employed for communication jointly with RADAR operation. The critical parameter that affects the RADAR algorithm is the radar cross-section (RCS). Since the task of obtaining the RCS of a complex-shaped object is extremely challenging, we first propose a novel, accurate, and fast method of scattered field assessment. We further perform radio network planning for the cellular deployment, as well as link budget estimations for the RADAR system that co-exists with it. Under this system model, we carry out detailed Monte-Carlo simulations of the RADAR detection process to obtain reliable statistical results and answer the question of how the actual bistatic RCS model affects the detection algorithm. We then apply mathematical modeling based on stochastic geometry to estimate the collision probability without the need to simulate an extensive number of flight-hours. Our numerical results confirm the robustness to RCS pattern nulls, which is crucial for safety-centric applications such as collision avoidance.

AB To support large-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with both payload communication (PC) packets and control and non-payload communication (CNPC) packets, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is convinced to be a promising solution. However, efficient user association and spectrum allocation are still challenging in mmWave-enabled UAV networks considering that the network state is dynamic and the status information of each UAV is incomplete. In this paper, we investigate a joint UAV association and spectrum allocation problem under a hybrid mmWave sharing paradigm, where PC packets are transmitted over both licensed and pooled bands in a shared manner to achieve high throughput and CNPC packets are transmitted over licensed band in an exclusive manner to guarantee high reliability. To this end, we introduce a strategic form game that can characterize network stochastic states and individual partial observations to reformulate the problem, and then propose a counterfactual regret minimization scheme to achieve its correlated equilibrium (CE). Benefited from the updating mechanism on random observation-action pairs, the designed scheme can converge to the corresponding CE solutions for the two types of packets with partial observation. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme over the baseline schemes.

AB Modern environmental scenarios such as autonomous vehicles, aircrafts, and military vehicles position the human body in a nonstandard posture and induce multiplanar loads; however, current spine alignment methods and loading are based on sagittal and planar loads. The objective of this study is to develop a posture control device and demonstrate its ability to induce multiplanar loads to the human cadaver spinal columns. The inferior end of the device was designed to allow a full six degree-of-freedom control for positioning the specimen via a coupled x-y cross table, vertical lift platform, and triaxial rotation mechanism. The superior end of the device was designed such that the cranial fixation of the specimen could be attached to the piston of the electrohydraulic testing apparatus directly or via a rotary disc through a slider-crank mechanism. The former attachment induces complex forces and moments, while the latter induces controlled moments with minimal forces. The usability of the posture control device was demonstrated by conducting experiments with a thoracolumbar spinal column for combined forces and moments, and with a head-neck column for complex moments, and in both cases, the uniaxial travel of the piston was at a dynamic rate. The posture control device can be used to study the biomechanics of the spine under complex loads and with different postures and develop injury criteria for different field environments.& nbsp; Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents the development of a semiautomated driving line generation method using point clouds acquired by a mobile laser scanning system. Horizontally curved driving lines are a critical component for high-definition maps that are required by autonomous vehicles. The proposed method consists of three steps: Road surface extraction, road marking extraction, and driving line generation. First, the points covering road surfaces are extracted using the curb-based road surface extraction algorithms depending on both the elevation and slope differences. Then, road markings are identified and extracted according to a variety of algorithms consisting of georeferenced intensity imagery generation, multithreshold road marking extraction, and statistical outlier removal. Finally, the conditional Euclidean clustering algorithm is employed, followed by the cubic spline curve-fitting algorithm and equidistant line-based driving line generation algorithms for horizontally curved driving line generation. Our method is evaluated by six MLS point cloud datasets collected from various types of horizontally curved road corridors. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed road marking extraction algorithm achieves an average recall, precision, and F1-score of 90.79%, 92.94%, and 91.85%, respectively. The generated driving lines are assessed by overlaying them on the manually interpreted reference buffers from 4-cm resolution unmanned aerial vehicle orthoimagery, and a 15 cm level navigation and localization accuracy is achieved.

ID IMPACTS
AB One of the main challenges in assessing marine biodiversity is the lack of consistent approaches to monitor it. This threatens to undermine ocean best practice in marine monitoring, as it impedes a reduction in the bias and variance of sampled data and restricts the confidence in the advice that can be given. In particular, there is potential for confounding between the monitoring methods, their measured ecological properties, and the questions they seek to answer. Australia has developed significant long-term marine monitoring and observing programs and has one of the largest marine estates, including the world's largest representative network of marine parks. This new network will require ongoing monitoring and evaluation, beyond what direct funding can support, which needs to be integrated in a standardized way with other national programs to develop sufficient monitoring capacity. The aim of this paper is to describe the process undertaken in developing a suite of field manuals that provide Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for marine sampling in Australian waters so that data are comparable over time and space, thereby supporting a robust, cost-effective, and objective national monitoring program. We encourage readers to refer to the complete manuals of interest at www.nespmarine.edu.au/field-manuals . We generally limit SOP development to benthic or demersal sampling, (multibeam, autonomous underwater vehicles, baited remoted underwater video (BRUV), towed imagery, grabs and box corers, sleds and trawls), with a few exceptions (e.g., pelagic BRUVs). Collaboration was a key characteristic of our approach so rather than single groups trying to impose their standards, more than 70 individuals from over 30 organizations contributed to the first version of this field manual package. We also discuss the challenges that arose while developing these national SOPs, the associated solutions that were implemented, and the plans for ensuring their long-term maintenance and national and international uptake. We anticipate that this paper will contribute to international collaborations by evoking valuable suggestions and sharing of lessons learnt from other national initiatives so that we might work toward a global ocean best practice for biological and geoscientific monitoring of the marine environment.

AB The market size of civilian drones is tremendously increasing and is expected to reach 1.66 million by the end of 2023. The increase in number of civilian drones poses several privacy and security threats. To safeguard critical assets and infrastructure and to protect privacy of people from the illegitimate uses of commercial drones, a drone detection system is inevitable. In particular, there is a need for a drone detection system that is efficient, accurate, robust, cost-effective and scalable. Recognizing the importance of the problem, several drone detection approaches have been proposed over time. However, none of these provides sufficient performance due to the inherited limitations of the underlying detection technology. More specifically, there are trade-offs among various performance metrics e.g., accuracy, detection range, and robustness against environmental conditions etc. This motivates an in-depth study and critical analysis of the existing approaches, highlighting their potential benefits and limitations. In this paper, we provide a rigorous overview of the existing drone detection techniques and a critical review of the state-of-the-art. Based on the review, we provide key insights on the future drone detection systems. We believe these insights will provide researchers and practicing engineers a holistic view to understand the broader context of the drone detection problem.

AB The ability of autonomous flight with obstacle avoidance should be a fundamental feature of all modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The complexity and difficulty of such a task, however, significantly increase in cases combining moving obstacles and nonholonomic UAVs. Additionally, since they assume the symmetrical distribution of repulsive forces around obstacles, traditional repulsive potential fields are not well suited for nonholonomic vehicles. The limited maneuverability of these types of UAVs, including fixed-wing aircraft, requires consideration not only of their relative position, but also their speed as well as the direction in which the obstacles are moving. To address this issue, the following work presents a novel multidimensional repulsive potential field dedicated to nonholonomic UAVs. This field generates forces that repulse the UAV not from the obstacle's geometrical center, but from areas immediately behind and in front of it located along a line defined by the obstacle's velocity vector. The strength of the repulsive force depends on the UAV's distance to the line representing the obstacle's movement direction, distance to the obstacle along that line, and the relative speed between the UAV and the obstacle projected to the line, making the proposed repulsive potential field multidimensional. Numerical simulations presented within the paper prove the effectiveness of the proposed novel repulsive potential field in controlling the flight of nonholonomic UAVs.

AB Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) such as Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) systems are in the focus of current vehicle developments. Of special interest is the calibration task, which plays an increasingly decisive role in early development stages. At this point it is essential to analyze the pre-calibrated controller concepts by appropriate simulation methods. A software toolchain is introduced, using Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) for the evaluation and calibration of the LKA system. Within, a Design-of-Experiment (DoE) tool is integrated together with the simulation environment. This enables the examination of the two different lateral controller concepts Steer-by-Angle (SbA) and Steer-by-Torque (SbT). Their lateral guidance performance is characterized by Key Performance Indicators (KPI), which are derived from simulation quantities of straight-line and cornering maneuvers. Further, statistical behavior models are generated based on those KPI and controller design variables (DV). The subsequent optimization process leads to high performances of both controllers. In particular, the SbA controller shows higher efficiency under the impact of disturbances as well as the reference reaction with lower settling times. Overall, the achieved lateral guidance performances indicate the potential of both control algorithms in an early development stage. With the software toolchain, a platform for further LKA system calibration and lateral guidance performance optimization is established.

AB The articles in this special section focus on vehicular networks in the era of 6G mobile communication. With the growth of the vehicle population, vehicular networks play a key role in building safe, efficient, and intelligent transport systems and has been attracting a lot of attention from both academic and industrial communities around the world. The rise of autonomous driving technology and the prosperity of mobile applications, e.g., real-time video analytic, image-aided navigation, natural language processing, and etc, have brought tremendous pressure on current vehicular networks, e.g., high bandwidth, ultra-low latency, high reliability, high security, powerful computation capability, and massive connections. It is necessary to continue to develop vehicular networks by combining the latest research intends in other fields to meet quickly rising communication and computation demands. The upcoming 6G technology, which provides Holographic and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled communications, together with the increasing implementation of artificial intelligence in mobile devices, will lead to a new research trend to end-edge-cloud orchestrated computing with intelligence. It means that, not only the intelligent communication protocols, but also the intelligent computing resource management and machine learning algorithms among the mobile vehicles, the edge and the cloud, should be redesigned to support the development of vehicular networks.

DE UAS performance; UAS testbed; Harsh environmental conditions
AB Despite many research studies focus on strategies to improve autopilot capabilities and bring artificial intelligence onboard Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), there are still few experimental activities related to these vehicle performance under unconventional weather conditions. Air temperature and altitudes directly affect thrust and power coefficients of small scale propeller for UAS applications. Reynolds numbers are usually within the range 10,000 to 100,000 and important aerodynamic effects, such as the laminar separation bubbles, occur with a negative impact on propulsion performance. The development of autonomous UAS platforms to reduce pilot work-load and allow Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations requires experimental data to validate capabilities of these innovative vehicles. High quality data are needed for a deep understanding of limitations and opportunities of UAS under unconventional flight conditions. The primary objective of this article is to present the characterization of a propeller and a quadrotor capabilities in a pressure-climate-controlled chamber. Mechanical and electrical data are measured with a dedicated test setup over a wide range of temperatures and altitudes. Test results are presented in terms of thrust and power coefficient trends. The experimental data shows low Reynolds numbers are responsible for degraded thrust performance. Moreover, details on brushless motor capabilities are also discussed considering different temperature and pressure conditions. The experimental data collected in the test campaign will be leveraged to improve UAS design, propulsion system modelling as well as to provide guidelines for safe UAS operations in extreme environments.

AB Public transportation (PT) in combination with other active transportation modes is the key to sustainable cities and a solution against congestion and air pollution. Faced with increasing competition from the private sector and the upcoming technology of automated driving (AD), an acute challenge is ensuring a robust future perspective for PT. There is little research thus far on how AD might affect PT, how it addresses the challenges PT and municipalities face, and how the integration of such vehicles into existing systems can be achieved in the best possible way. In this article, we seek to address this research gap and present the results of a comparative study on stakeholder acceptance and requirements of AD in PT. We aim to find out and relate what various stakeholders (users, local authorities, and PT providers), consider relevant as regards AD in PT to derive hints for favorable applications of AD in PT, and discuss recommendable future development pathways for PT. We applied a qualitative research approach. The study entailed participatory survey instruments and was conducted in two German cities in 2017. Its two-step concept entailed a general discussion as well as identifying specific requirements in the context of three systematically developed use cases that are described in the paper. From the comparative results of the perspectives of users, providers, and municipalities we conclude how different use case types comply with the stakeholder perspectives and discuss what favorable use cases and pathways of PT could look like.

AB Drones equipped with cameras can significantly enhance human's ability to perceive the world because of their remarkable maneuverability in 3D space. Ironically, object detection for drones has always been conducted in the 2D image space, which fundamentally limits their ability to understand 3D scenes. Furthermore, existing 3D object detection methods developed for autonomous driving cannot be directly applied to drones due to the lack of deformation modeling, which is essential for the distant aerial perspective with sensitive distortion and small objects. To fill the gap, this work proposes a dual-view detection system named DVDET to achieve aerial monocular object detection in both the 2D image space and the 3D physical space. To address the severe view deformation issue, we propose a novel trainable geo-deformable transformation module that can properly warp information from the drone's perspective to the birds' eye view (BEV). Compared to the monocular methods for cars, our transformation includes a learnable deformable network for explicitly revising the severe deviation. To address the dataset challenge, we propose a new large-scale simulation dataset named AM3D-Sim, and a new real-world aerial dataset named AM3D-Real with high-quality annotations for 3D object detection. Extensive experiments show that i) aerial monocular 3D object detection is feasible; ii) the model pre-trained on the simulation dataset helps real-world performance; and iii) DVDET also helps monocular 3D object detection for cars. To encourage more researchers to investigate this area, we released the dataset and related code.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) multiobject tracking (MOT) is an essential perception task for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Studies have indicated that multimodal data fusion can provide more stable and efficient perception information to AVs than a single sensor. Therefore, this paper proposes a new spatiotemporal adaptive attention 3D (3DSTAA) tracker, which attempts to improve the tracking performance of the end-to-end 3D MOT by adaptively correlating spatiotemporal data. The novelty of this paper includes the following. (1) Different from nonintelligent fusion methods, this paper uses an efficiently adaptive spatial-guided fusion (SGFus) module for multimodal feature fusion. As a result, the 3D structural information obtained from point cloud data can provide additional spatial information as complementary information to the 2D texture information extracted from the image data, collaboratively facilitating and refining the perception information representation in the margin area. (2) This paper develops a spatiotemporal object-unique attention (STOUA) module that calculates the relational degree of each perceived object between two adjacent frames through attentional encoding. At the same time, an adaptive weighting strategy is used to further study the spatiotemporal correlation of unique objects, reducing the similarity among various objects and the differences across the same object. Experiments tested using the KITTI tracking benchmark show that the 3DSTAA tracker is highly competitive in both inference time and tracking performance compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

AB Detecting a potential collision at night is a challenging task owing to the lack of discernible features that can be extracted from the available visual stimuli. To alert the driver or, alternatively, the maneuvering system of an autonomous vehicle, current technologies utilize resource draining and expensive solutions such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) or image sensors coupled with extensive software running sophisticated algorithms. In contrast, insects perform the same task of collision detection with frugal neural resources. Even though the general architecture of separate sensing and processing modules is the same in insects and in image-sensor-based collision detectors, task-specific obstacle avoidance algorithms allow insects to reap substantial benefits in terms of size and energy. Here, we show that insect-inspired collision detection algorithms, when implemented in conjunction with in-sensor processing and enabled by innovative optoelectronic integrated circuits based on atomically thin and photosensitive memtransistor technology, can greatly simplify collision detection at night. The proposed collision detector eliminates the need for image capture and image processing yet demonstrates timely escape responses for cars on collision courses under various real-life scenarios at night. The collision detector also has a small footprint of similar to 40 mu m2 and consumes only a few hundred picojoules of energy. We strongly believe that the proposed collision detectors can augment existing sensors necessary for ensuring autonomous vehicular safety.

AB Mobile light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor point clouds are used in many fields such as road network management, architecture and urban planning, and 3D High Definition (HD) city maps for autonomous vehicles. Semantic segmentation of mobile point clouds is critical for these tasks. In this study, we present a robust and effective deep learning-based point cloud semantic segmentation method. Semantic segmentation is applied to range images produced from point cloud with spherical projection. Irregular 3D mobile point clouds are transformed into regular form by projecting the clouds onto the plane to generate 2D representation of the point cloud. This representation is fed to the proposed network that produces semantic segmentation. The local geometric feature vector is calculated for each point. Optimum parameter experiments were also performed to obtain the best results for semantic segmentation. The proposed technique, called SegUNet3D, is an ensemble approach based on the combination of U-Net and SegNet algorithms. SegUNet3D algorithm has been compared with five different segmentation algorithms on two challenging datasets. SemanticPOSS dataset includes the urban area, whereas RELLIS-3D includes the off-road environment. As a result of the study, it was demonstrated that the proposed approach is superior to other methods in terms of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) in both datasets. The proposed method was able to improve the mIoU metric by up to 15.9% in the SemanticPOSS dataset and up to 5.4% in the RELLIS-3D dataset.

AB In autonomous cars accurate and reliable detection of objects in the proximity of the vehicle is necessary in order to perform further safety critical actions which depend upon it. Many detectors have been developed in the last few years, but there is still demand for more reliable and more robust detectors. Some detectors rely on a single sensor, while some others are based upon fusion of data from multiple sources. The main aim of this paper is to show how image features can contribute to performance improvement of detectors which rely on pointcloud data only. In addition it will be shown, how lidar reflectance data can be substituted by low level image features without degrading the performance of detectors. Three different approaches are proposed to fuse image features with point cloud data. The extended networks are compared with the original network and tested on a well-known dataset and on our own data, as well. This might be important when the same pretrained model is to be used on data generated by a lidar using different reflectance encoding schemes and when due to the lack of training data retraining is not possible. Different augmentation techniques have been proposed and tested on the KITTI dataset as well as on data acquired by a different lidar sensor. The networks augmented with image features achieved a recall increase of a few percent for occluded objects.

ID VISION SYSTEM
AB The vision-based road lane detection technique plays a key role in driver assistance system. While existing lane recognition algorithms demonstrated over 90% detection rate, the validation test was usually conducted on limited scenarios. Significant gaps still exist when applied in real-life autonomous driving. The goal of this article was to identify these gaps and to suggest research directions that can bridge them. The straight lane detection algorithm based on linear Hough transform (HT) was used in this study as an example to evaluate the possible perception issues under challenging scenarios, including various road types, different weather conditions and shades, changed lighting conditions, and so on. The study found that the HT-based algorithm presented an acceptable detection rate in simple backgrounds, such as driving on a highway or conditions showing distinguishable contrast between lane boundaries and their surroundings. However, it failed to recognize road dividing lines under varied lighting conditions. The failure was attributed to the binarization process failing to extract lane features before detections. In addition, the existing HT-based algorithm would be interfered by lane-like interferences, such as guardrails, railways, bikeways, utility poles, pedestrian sidewalks, buildings and so on. Overall, all these findings support the need for further improvements of current road lane detection algorithms to be robust against interference and illumination variations. Moreover, the widely used algorithm has the potential to raise the lane boundary detection rate if an appropriate search range restriction and illumination classification process is added.

DE Bus bunching; Transit operations; Approximate dynamic programming;

ID HOLDING PROBLEM; TIME; PERFORMANCE; MODEL
AB Bus headways are typically susceptible to external disturbances (e.g., due to traffic congestion, clustered passenger arrivals, and special passenger needs), which create gaps in the system that grow eventually into bunching. Although many control strategies, such as static and dynamic holding strategies, have been implemented to mitigate the effects of unreliable bus schedules, most of them would impose longer dwell times on the passengers. In this paper, we investigate the potential of an alternative bus substitution strategy that is currently implemented by some transit agencies in an ad-hoc manner. In this strategy, the agency deploys a fleet of standby buses to take over service from any early or late buses so as to contain deviations from schedule, and the intention is to impose minimum penalties on the onboard passengers. We develop a discrete-time infinite-horizon approximate dynamic programming approach to find the optimal policy to minimize the overall agency and passenger costs. It is shown through numerical examples that schedule deviations can be controlled by regularly inserting standby buses as substitutions. In some implementation scenarios, the proposed strategy holds the potential to achieve comparable performance with some of the most advanced strategies, and to outperform the conventional slack-based schedule control scheme. In light of the emerging opportunities associated with autonomous driving, the performance of the proposed strategy can become even stronger due to the reduction in costs for keeping the fleet of standby buses.

AB Water quality assessment programs for the management of water resources require the collection of water samples for physical, chemical, and biological analyses. Lack of personnel, accessibility of water bodies, and time constraints, especially after natural disasters and emergencies, are some of the challenges of water sampling. To overcome these challenges, a custom-made thief-style water sampling mechanism was developed and mounted on a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for autonomous water sampling. The payload capacity and endurance of the UAV were determined using an indoor test station. The UAV was equipped with floatation, and electronic components were coated to prevent water damage in the event of a forced landing or for sample collection. Water samples from a 1.1 ha pond were collected with the developed UAV-assisted water sampling system and traditional manual methods. Dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, temperature and chloride measurements were made on samples collected with both UAV-assisted and manual methods and compared. Percent differences between the two sampling methods for DO, EC, pH, and temperature were minimal except for chloride level. Percent differences between the two sampling methods for DO, EC, pH, and temperature measurements were 3.6%, 2.3%, 0.76%, and 0.03%, respectively. Measured chloride levels for the manual and UAV-assisted sampling methods were 3.97 and 5.46 mg/L. UAV-assisted water sampling may prove faster and safer than manual water sampling from large surface waters and from difficult to access water bodies.

AB Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based systems are increasingly used in autonomous vehicles for detecting obstacles. CNN-based object detection and per-pixel classification (semantic segmentation) algorithms are trained for detecting and classifying a predefined set of object types. These algorithms have difficulties in detecting distant and heavily occluded objects and are, by definition, not capable of detecting unknown object types or unusual scenarios. The visual characteristics of an agriculture field is homogeneous, and obstacles, like people, animals and other obstacles, occur rarely and are of distinct appearance compared to the field. This paper introduces DeepAnomaly, an algorithm combining deep learning and anomaly detection to exploit the homogenous characteristics of a field to perform anomaly detection. We demonstrate DeepAnomaly as a fast state-of-the-art detector for obstacles that are distant, heavily occluded and unknown. DeepAnomaly is compared to state-of-the-art obstacle detectors including "Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks" (RCNN). In a human detector test case, we demonstrate that DeepAnomaly detects humans at longer ranges (45-90 m) than RCNN. RCNN has a similar performance at a short range (0-30 m). However, DeepAnomaly has much fewer model parameters and (182 ms/25 ms =) a 7.28-times faster processing time per image. Unlike most CNN-based methods, the high accuracy, the low computation time and the low memory footprint make it suitable for a real-time system running on a embedded GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).

AB Visual navigation is a challenging issue in automated robot control, In many robot applications, like object manipulation in hazardous environments or autonomous locomotion, it is necessary to automatically detect and avoid obstacles while planning a safe trajectory. In this context the detection of corridors of free space along the robot trajectory is a very important capability which requires nontrivial visual processing, In most cases it is possible to take advantage of the active control of the cameras.
   In this paper we propose a cooperative schema in which motion and stereo vision are used to infer scene structure and determine free space areas, Binocular disparity, computed on several stereo images over time, is combined with optical flow from the same sequence to obtain a relative-depth map of the scene. Both the time-to-impact and depth scaled by the distance of the camera from the fixation point in space are considered as good, relative measurements which are based on the viewer, but centered on the environment.
   The need for calibrated parameters is considerably reduced by using an active control strategy. The cameras track a point in space independently of the robot motion and the full rotation of the head, which includes the unknown robot motion, is derived from binocular image data.
   The feasibility of the approach in real robotic applications is demonstrated by several experiments performed on real image data acquired from an autonomous vehicle and a prototype camera head.

ID INERTIAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM; MOBILE ROBOT LOCALIZATION; INITIAL ALIGNMENT
AB Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM) and Map Aided Localization (MAL) are very effective techniques employed extensively in robot navigation tasks. However biases and drifts in both exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors adversely impair correct localization (in MAL) and also impair map building (in SLAM). More specifically, accumulated errors as a result of biases in the sensors cause the algorithms to diverge and produce inconsistent and inaccurate results. Although offline calibration of these sensors can reduce the effects to some extent, the process results in longer setup and processing times. Moreover during operation, the sensors' calibration may often be subject to changes or drifts requiring regular resetting and initialization. A convenient, appropriate and effective approach to overcome problems associated with biases in sensors has been to explicitly model and estimate the bias parameters concurrently with the vehicle state online using an augmented state space approach. This paper investigates the properties of the concurrent bias estimation in MAL using an augmented, estimation theoretic state space approach for the localization of a large class of mobile robots, consisting of autonomous ground vehicles. This involves a rigorous theoretical study of the issues of observability and convergence, their interrelations and effects on the algorithm's performance. This paper shows analytically that if sensor biases are estimated jointly with the vehicle pose in a MAL framework: 1) The uncertainties of the estimated errors in the bias parameters of both proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors diminish in each update. 2) A derived lower bound is reached in each of these estimates. 3) The rate of convergence to this lower bound is also derived. 4) Although often neglected in the literature, observability is a major issue. From the analysis it is derived that in order to guarantee observability in MAL with bias estimation, it is necessary to observe simultaneously at least two distinct landmarks, which are not on a straight line with the vehicle position. Extensive simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results established for the general case of nonlinear dynamics and slowly varying sensor biases. The results are further exemplified and verified experimentally using a sophisticated MAL algorithm, utilizing a low cost inertial navigation sensor suite.

AB The present study focuses on summarizing the recent advancements in the field of fish swimming mode research and bionic robotic fish prototypes based on smart materials. It has been widely acknowledged that fish exhibit exceptional swimming efficiency and manoeuvrability compared to conventional underwater vehicles. In the pursuit of developing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), conventional experimental methods often prove to be complex and expensive. Hence, the utilization of computer simulations for hydrodynamic modelling provides a cost-effective and efficient approach for analysing the swimming behaviour of bionic robotic fish. Additionally, computer simulations can provide data that are difficult to obtain through experimental methods. Smart materials, which integrate perception, drive, and control functions, are increasingly being applied to bionic robotic fish research. However, the utilization of smart materials in this field is still an area of ongoing research and several challenges remain unresolved. This study provides an overview of the current state of research on fish swimming modes and the development of hydrodynamic modelling. The application of four distinct types of smart materials in bionic robotic fish is then reviewed, with a focus on analysing the advantages and disadvantages of each material in driving swimming behaviour. In conclusion, the paper highlights the key technical challenges that must be addressed for the practical implementation of bionic robotic fish and provides insights into the potential future directions of this field.

AB Unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-enabled intelligent transportation system (ITS) is an advanced technology that can provide various services including autonomous driving, real-time creation of high-definition maps, and car sharing. In particular, a UAV-enabled ITS can be realized through the combination of traditional vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and UAVs that can act as flying roadside units (RSUs) at the outskirts and monitor road conditions from predefined locations to spot car accidents and any law violations. Notably, to realize these services, real-time communication between UAVs and RSUs must be guaranteed. However, UAVs have limited computing powers, and if extensive computation is required during communication, the provision of real-time ITS services may be hindered. Furthermore, UAVs and RSUs communicate via public channels that are prone to various attacks, such as replay, impersonation, trace, and session key disclosure attacks. Thus, in this article, a secure and lightweight authentication scheme is proposed for UAVs and RSUs using the blockchain technology. The proposed scheme is analyzed using informal and formal methods including Burrows-Abadi-Nikoogadam (BAN) logic, automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) simulation tool, and real-or-random (RoR) model, and its performance is compared with that of related schemes. The results reveal that the proposed scheme is more efficient and secure as compared to the other competing schemes.

AB Dedicated fieldbuses were developed to provide temporal determinisms for industrial distributed real-time systems. In the early stages, communication systems were dedicated to a single protocol and generally supported a single service. Industrial Ethernet, which is used today, supports many concurrent services, but usually only one real-time protocol at a time. However, shop-floor communication must support a range of different traffic from messages with strict real-time requirements such as time-driven messages with process data and event-driven security messages to diagnostic messages that have more relaxed temporal requirements. Thus, it is necessary to combine different real-time protocols into one communication network. This raises many challenges, especially when the goal is to use wireless communication. There is no research work on that area and this paper attempts to fill in that gap. It is a result of some experiments that were conducted while connecting a Collaborative Robot CoBotAGV with a production station for which two real-time protocols, Profinet and OPC UA, had to be combined into one wireless network interface. The first protocol was for the exchange of processing data, while the latter integrated the vehicle with Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and Transport Management System (TMS). The paper presents the real-time capabilities of such a combination-an achievable communication cycle and jitter.

AB This paper presents a new formulation of a reactive obstacle avoidance algorithm, in the Task-Priority framework, delivering a practical solution for obstacle avoidance between vehicle-manipulator systems and complex environments. The presented concepts were implemented on an intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (I-AUV) and tested in an underwater pipe structure inspection and valve turning scenario, in a test tank, using GIRONA500 with an ECA 5E Micro manipulator. The obstacle avoidance is treated as an inequality (set-based) task, which takes into account all obstacles that are interacting with the robot links. Both the robot and the obstacles are represented by spheres to allow for analytical formulation. However, the environment is wrapped with spheres based on its actual geometry stored as an Octomap, hence it can be represented at different resolutions. Depending on the type of the mission performed by the robot we defined two modes of operation: (1) Navigation and Inspection, and (2) Intervention. For each mode, the algorithm takes into account different number of key points at the I-AUV and a different resolution of the environment representation. Typically, for the Intervention mode the resolution is higher, to allow for more precise motion. We also present an escape point strategy in case of the robot getting stuck between obstacles.

AB Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) are prone to several cyber-physical attacks, which decrease the performance of the network and may cause damage to the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or their surrounding environment. In this article, we propose UASTrustChain, a trust management framework based on Blockchain time-stamped series. We consider a system of models, consists of a number of autonomous UAVs, whose behaviors are regularly monitored by a set of distributed observers (DOs). Since most cyber attacks cause interruption in the operations of UAVs or deviation from their original path, the DOs keep track of the UAVs' behavior in terms of their trajectory, as well as the number of their successful tasks. The DOs calculate a relative trust score for each UAV and keep these scores in a transparent, reliable, secure and open ledger. This framework can detect UAVs' abnormal behavior in a real-time manner further to detect the compromised distributed observers, if any. The proposed framework could also distinguish abnormal activities due to real attacks from those caused by harsh environmental conditions. We evaluate the proposed framework for its functionality and accuracy by performing extensive simulation experiments. Our simulation results show that the proposed trust model can detect compromised distributed observers and fades their effect on the UAVs trust scores. Results further show the ability of the system in detecting malicious UAVs, which can be under various cyber-physical attacks.

AB The feasibility and design of the CultCube 12U CubeSat hosting a small Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) for the autonomous cultivation of a small plant in orbit is described. The satellite is aimed at running experiments in fruit plants growing for applications in crewed vehicles for long-term missions in space. CultCube is mainly composed of a pressurized vessel, constituting the outer shell of the ECLSS, and by various environmental controls (water, nutrients, air composition and pressure, light, etc.) aimed at maintaining a survivable habitat for the fruit plants to grow. The plant health status and growth performances is monitored using hyperspectral cameras installed within the vessel, able to sense leaves' chlorophyll content and temperature, and allowing the estimation of plant volume in all its life cycle phases. The paper study case is addressed to the in-orbit experimental cultivation of a dwarf tomato plant (MicroTom), which was modified for enhancing the anti-oxidants production and for growing in stressful environments. While simulated microgravity tests have been passed by the MicroTom plant, the organism behaviour in a real microgravity environment for a full seed-to-seed cycle needs to be tested. The CultCube 12U CubeSat mission presents no particular requirements on the kind of orbit, whereas its minimum significative duration corresponds to one seed-to-seed cycle for the plant, which is 90 days for the paper study case. In the paper, after an introduction on the importance of an autonomous testbed for plant cultivation, in the perspective of the implementation of bioregenerative systems on-board future manned long-term missions, the satellite design and the MicroTom engineered plant for in-orbit growth are described. In addition to the description of the whole set of subsystems, with focus on the payload and its controllers and instrumentation, the system budgets are presented. Finally, the first tests conducted by the authors are briefly reported.

ID STRATEGIES; AVOIDANCE
AB Achieving safe and effective navigation in crowds is a crucial yet challenging problem. Recent work has mainly encoded the pedestrian-robot state pairs, which cannot fully capture the interactions among humans. Besides, existing work attempts to achieve "hard" collision avoidance, which may leave no feasible path to the robot in human-rich scenarios. We suppose that this can be addressed by introducing the local risk map and thus incorporate the risk map into the deep reinforcement learning architecture. The proposed map structure contains the crowd interaction states and geometric information. Meanwhile, a "soft" risk mapping of pedestrians is proposed to promote the robot to generate more humanlike motion patterns, and the riskaware dynamic window is designed to enhance the robot's obstacle avoidance ability. Experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline in terms of navigation performance and social attributes. Furthermore, we successfully validate the proposed policy through real-world environments.

AB This article addresses the problem of estimating the tilt and more generally the attitude of a rigid body that is subject to high accelerations and equipped with inertial measurement units (IMU) and a sensor providing the body velocity (expressed in the reference frame attached to the body). In the absence of a magnetometer, tilt estimation is proposed through a two-step observer: a global-exponentially stable pre-estimation given to a manifold-constrained complementary filter. In the presence of a magnetometer, the presented observer allows us to reconstruct the full attitude and tune how much the estimation of the tilt is influenced by the magnetometer, depending on the level of confidence given to the measurements of the magnetometer. All state estimators are proposed with proofs of almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential convergence. Finally, these estimators are compared with state-of-the-art solutions in clean and noisy simulations, allowing recommended solutions to be drawn for each case.

AB Radars are a major sensor for autonomous driving and active safety. High-angular resolution is the main challenge of the state-ofthe-art automotive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radars. Therefore, MIMO radar sensor array calibration is critical for automotive radar efficiency. Anechoic chamber-based methods for automotive radar testing and calibration are widely used for automotive applications. These methods typically involve a radar target simulator with separate transmit and receive antennas. Frequently, a radar target simulator is located within a relatively small anechoic chamber, compromising the automotive radar's far-field operation conditions. Furthermore, displaced transmit and receive antennas of the radar target simulator induce differences in the steering direction from the radar toward them. This work investigates the effects of these phenomena on automotive radar performance, proposes a method to model them, and introduces the approach to mitigate them.

ID WIRELESS COMMUNICATION
AB In this paper, an omnidirectional underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system is proposed, including six lens-free transceivers. An omnidirectional communication with a data rate of 5 Mbps in a 7-m underwater channel is experimentally demonstrated. The optical communication system is integrated into a self-designed robotic fish, and the signal is processed real-time through an integrated micro-control unit (MCU). In addition, it is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed system could establish a stable communication link between two nodes, regardless of the nodes' locomotion and attitude, with a data rate of 2 Mbps and a communication range up to 7 m. In particular, the optical communication system features small footprint and low power consumption, which is suitable for integration in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarms to achieve an omnidirectional information transmission with low latency, high security, and high data rate compared with its acoustic counterpart.& COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

DE layered learning; transfer learning; catastrophic forgetting;

ID BEHAVIORS
AB Catastrophic forgetting is a stability-plasticity imbalance that causes a machine learner to lose previously gained knowledge that is critical for performing a task. The imbalance occurs in transfer learning, negatively affecting the learner's performance, particularly in neural networks and layered learning. This work proposes a complementary learning technique that introduces long- and short-term memory to layered learning to reduce the negative effects of catastrophic forgetting. In particular, this work proposes the dual memory system in the non-neural network approaches of evolutionary computation and Q-learning instances of layered learning because these techniques are used to develop decision-making capabilities for physical robots. Experiments evaluate the new learning augmentation in a multi-agent system simulation, where autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles learn to collaborate and maneuver to survey an area effectively. Through these direct-policy and value-based learning experiments, the proposed complementary layered learning is demonstrated to significantly improve task performance over standard layered learning, successfully balancing stability and plasticity.

AB The primary purpose of this article is to demonstrate experimentally and explain theoretically (based on physics-based literature and empirical-based industry-standard models) that, in the limit where the receiver height vanishes above an imperfectly conducting plane such as the surface of the Earth, the propagation characteristics of 4G (800 MHz) signals in a typical cellular wireless setup behave very simply as the two-ray-plane Earth model, with approximately 40 dB/decade of signal loss, for almost the entire cell, in contrast to the more common case of finite height receivers with more complex path loss scaling with distance from the transmitter to the receiver. The simple reason behind this is that the "breakpoint" distance, beyond which all models predict this power law, vanishes as the height of the receive antenna vanishes, leading to the unified theory of signal propagation for ground-level receivers in the microwave regime.

ID SALIENCY DETECTION
AB 3D object detection is a key issue and research in autonomous vehicle and computer vision. 3D detection methods based on stereoscopic images estimate 3D boxes and regress the object pose by exploiting the sparse and dense, semantic and geometry information of stereoscopic images. In this paper, we propose stereo VoVNet-CNN for 3D object detection. In this network, we adopt VoVNet as the backbone to extract feature, and Stereo Region Proposal Network(RPN) to refine 2D box, moreover, align and extract 3D box by stereo regression with 3D constraint of stereo images. The VoVNet module considers local and global feature information by integrating the contextual information from different receptive fields and inputting initial feature into the final output feature map. Therefore, the proposed stereo VoVNet can provide high accuracy for feature extraction. We evaluate the proposed network on KITTI dataset by comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate well the effectiveness of the proposed network.

AB This paper presents a novel Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) payload designed to perform semiautonomous contact inspection tasks in vertical structures. The presented system includes on-board positioning capabilities to calculate the distance and angle between the structure and the UAV that support the navigation in the neighbourhood of the structure, considered a GPS-denied area. The collected navigation parameters are the basis to control two horizontal propellers included in the payload and aimed to push the system against the structure gently and to perform the contact. Also, the proposed system has been compared to previous designs based on UAV's pitch signal control, highlighting the advantages of the new prototype. A series of tests conducted in a controlled environment demonstrate an improved contact to the structure in terms of stability and reliability, showing a contact-bounce reduction of 54.4% compared to previous experiments.

AB This article is concerned with the close formation problem of multiple underactuated surface vessels in the presence of model uncertainties, roll motion, and environmental disturbances. To effectively address these issues, a novel control scheme considering roll stabilization is designed by combing terminal hierarchical sliding mode control with Lyapunov direct method, which can quickly ensure a small formation error in a finite-time for vessels. Meanwhile, a new switching gain adaptation mechanism is utilized to reduce chattering and acquire faster adaptive rate without the excessive temporary tracking errors. Radial basis function neural network and finite-time observer are employed to deal with model uncertainties and disturbances, respectively. Furthermore, dynamic surface control technology is introduced to reduce the complexity of control law. Various simulations and comparison results are conducted to verify the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB The application of engineered bacteria-based drug delivery vehicles to treat cancer has been practiced for more than a century. Mitochondria, evolutionarily originated from bacteria, are ubiquitous, semi-autonomous cellular organelles. In this study, we present the first exploration of using mitochondria as a delivery system of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) for in vivo imaging and administration of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The results show that mitochondria as carriers are compatible with CQD loading and preserve the optical properties of CQDs. Moreover, the mitochondria delivery system can improve the CQD bio-distribution in organs and prolong the retention time of CQDs after intravenous injection. Furthermore, mitochondria loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (Mito-DOX) show an enhanced therapeutic effect compared to free DOX. The mitochondria-based "aircraft" system may be a promising novel therapeutic platform with high potential for biological imaging and drug delivery to fight cancer and other diseases.

DE Traffic light; BP neural network; convolutional neural network
AB This paper proposed an algorithm for a deep learning network for identifying circular traffic lights (CTL-DNNet). The sample labeling process uses translation to increase the number of positive samples, and the similarity is calculated to reduce the number of negative samples, thereby reducing over fitting. We use a dataset of approximately 370 000 samples, with approximately 20 000 positive samples and approximately 350 000 negative samples. The datasets are generated from images taken at the Beijing Garden Expo. To obtain a very robust method for the detection of traffic lights, we use different layers, different cost functions and different activation functions of the depth neural network for training and comparison. Our algorithm has evaluated autonomous vehicles in varying illumination and gets the result with high accuracy and robustness. The experimental results show that CTL-DNNet is effective at recognizing road traffic lights in the Beijing Garden Expo area.

ID TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION; SPACECRAFT REORIENTATION; RANK MINIMIZATION;
   RELAXATION; NAVIGATION; AIRCRAFT; VEHICLES
AB This paper presents a general quadratic optimization methodology for autonomous path planning of spatial rigid motion with constrained attitude. The motion to be planned has six degrees of freedom and is assumed under constant velocity in the body frame. The objective is to determine the motion orientation (or attitude), handled as control variables, along the planned paths. A procedure is discussed to transform the rotational constraints and attitude constraints as quadratic functions in terms of unit quaternions, and the path-planning problem is reformulated as a general, quadratically constrained, quadratic programming problem. A semidefinite relaxation method is then applied to obtain a bound on the global optimal value of the nonconvex, quadratically constrained, quadratic programming problem. Subsequently, an iterative rank minimization approach is proposed to find the optimal solution. Application examples of aircraft path-planning problems are presented using the proposed method and compared with those obtained from the other method.

AB The fault-tolerant integrated navigation methods using strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are studied herein to address two types of possible faults, system fault and measurement fault. Two typical approximationbased nonlinear filters, extended Kalman filter (EKF) and divided difference Kalman filters (DDKFs), are modified to be fault-tolerant for accurate navigation even in the presence of these faults. Criteria are presented to detect the faults, and related covariance matrices of the predicted errors are enlarged using fault accommodation factors to make the faulty state or measurement components be normally treated. Navigation simulations using the nonlinear quaternion-based navigation error model are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimisation approach to improve container handling operations at the Patrick AutoStrad container terminal located in Brisbane Australia. In this paper we focus on scheduling for container transfers and encode the problem using a two-part chromosome approach which is then solved using a modified genetic algorithm. In simulation experiments, the performance of the GA-based approach and a sequential job scheduling method are evaluated and compared with different scheduling scenarios. The experimental results show that the GA-based approach can find better solutions which improve the overall performance. The GA-based approach has been implemented in the terminal scheduling system and the live testing results show that the GA-based approach can reduce the overall time-related cost of container transfers at the automated container terminal.

ID LINEAR-SYSTEMS; STABILIZATION; CONSTRAINTS
AB In the average consensus a set of linear systems has to be driven to the same final state, which corresponds to the average of their initial states. This mathematical problem can be seen as the simplest example of coordination task. In fact it can be used to model both the control of multiple autonomous vehicles which all have to be driven to the centroid of the initial positions, and to model the decentralized estimation of a quantity from multiple measure coming from distributed sensors. This contribution presents a consensus strategy in which the systems can exchange information among themselves according to a fixed strongly connected digital communication network. Beside the decentralized computational aspects induced by the choice of the communication network, we here have also to face the quantization effects due to the digital links. We here present and discuss two different encoding/decoding strategies with theoretical and simulation results on their performance. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB It is crucial for an autonomous vehicle to predict cyclist behavior before decision-making. When a cyclist is on real traffic roads, his or her body orientation indicates the current moving directions, and his or her head orientation indicates his or her intention for checking the road situation before making next movement. Therefore, estimating the orientation of cyclist's body and head is an important factor of cyclist behavior prediction for autonomous driving. This research proposes to estimate cyclist orientation including both body and head orientation using deep neural network with the data from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor. In this research, two different methods are proposed for cyclist orientation estimation. The first method uses 2D images to represent the reflectivity, ambient and range information collected by LiDAR sensor. At the same time, the second method uses 3D point cloud data to represent the information collected from LiDAR sensor. The two proposed methods adopt a model ResNet50, which is a 50-layer convolutional neural network, for orientation classification. Hence, the performances of two methods are compared to achieve the most effective usage of LiDAR sensor data in cyclist orientation estimation. This research developed a cyclist dataset, which includes multiple cyclists with different body and head orientations. The experimental results showed that a model that uses 3D point cloud data has better performance for cyclist orientation estimation compared to the model that uses 2D images. Moreover, in the 3D point cloud data-based method, using reflectivity information has a more accurate estimation result than using ambient information.

AB Classical imitation learning methods suffer substantially from the learning hierarchical policies when the imitative agent faces an unobserved state by the expert agent. To address these drawbacks, we propose an online active learning through active inference approach that encodes the expert's demonstrations based on observation-action to improve the learner's future motion prediction. For this purpose, we provide a switching Dynamic Bayesian Network based on the dynamic interaction between the expert agent and another object in its surrounding as a reference model, which we exploit to initialize an incremental probabilistic learning model. This learning model grows and matures based on the free-energy formulation and message passing of active inference dynamically at discrete and continuous levels in an online active learning phase. In this scheme, generalized states of the learning world are represented as distance-vector, where it is the learner's observation concerning its interaction with a moving object. Considering the distance vector entail intentions, it enables action prediction evaluation in a prospective sense. We illustrate these points using simulations of driving intelligent agents. The learning agent is trained by using long-term predictions from the generative learning model to reproduce the expert's motion while learning how to select a suitable action through new experiences. Our results affirm that a Dynamic Bayesian optimal approach provides a principled framework and outperforms conventional reinforcement learning methods. Furthermore, it endorses the general formulation of action prediction as active inference.

AB Urban mobility efficiency is of utmost importance in big cities. Taxi vehicles are key elements in daily traffic activity. The advance of ICT and geo-positioning systems has given rise to new opportunities for improving the efficiency of taxi fleets in terms of waiting times of passengers, cost and time for drivers, traffic density, CO2 emissions, etc., by using more informed, intelligent dispatching. Still, the explicit spatial and temporal components, as well as the scale and, in particular, the dynamicity of the problem of pairing passengers and taxis in big towns, render traditional approaches for solving standard assignment problem useless for this purpose, and call for intelligent approximation strategies based on domain specific heuristics. Furthermore, taxi drivers are often autonomous actors and may not agree to participate in assignments that, though globally efficient, may not be sufficently beneficial for them individually. This paper presents a new heuristic algorithm for taxi assignment to customers that considers taxi reassignments if this may lead to globally better solutions. In addition, as such new assignments may reduce the expected revenues of individual drivers, we propose an economic compensation scheme to make individually rational drivers agree to proposed modifications in their assigned clients. We carried out a set of experiments, where several commonly used assignment strategies are compared to three different instantiations of our heuristic algorithm. The results indicate that our proposal has the potential to reduce customer waiting times in fleets of autonomous taxis, while being also beneficial from an economic point of view.

AB Accurate navigation is crucial in the construction of intelligent orchards, and the need for vehicle navigation accuracy becomes even more important as production is refined. However, traditional navigation methods based on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and 2D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can be unreliable in complex scenarios with little sensory information due to tree canopy occlusion. To solve these issues, this paper proposes a 3D LiDAR-based navigation method for trellis orchards. With the use of 3D LiDAR with a 3D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, orchard point cloud information is collected and filtered using the Point Cloud Library (PCL) to extract trellis point clouds as matching targets. In terms of positioning, the real-time position is determined through a reliable method of fusing multiple sensors for positioning, which involves transforming the real-time kinematics (RTK) information into the initial position and doing a normal distribution transformation between the current frame point cloud and the scaffold reference point cloud to match the point cloud position. For path planning, the required vector map is manually planned in the orchard point cloud to specify the path of the roadway, and finally, navigation is achieved through pure path tracking. Field tests have shown that the accuracy of the normal distributions transform (NDT) SLAM method can reach 5 cm in each rank with a coefficient of variation that is less than 2%. Additionally, the navigation system has a high positioning heading accuracy with a deviation within 1 & DEG; and a standard deviation of less than 0.6 & DEG; when moving along the path point cloud at a speed of 1.0 m/s in a Y-trellis pear orchard. The lateral positioning deviation was also controlled within 5 cm with a standard deviation of less than 2 cm. This navigation system has a high level of accuracy and can be customized to specific tasks, making it widely applicable in trellis orchards with autonomous navigation pesticide sprayers.

AB Higher-level autonomous driving necessitates the best possible execution of important moves under all conditions. Most of the accidents in recent years caused by the AVs launched by leading automobile manufacturers are due to inadequate decision-making, which is a result of their poor perceivance of environmental information. In today's technology-bound scenarios, versatile sensors are used by AVs to collect environmental information. Due to various technical and natural calamities, the environmental information acquired by the sensors may not be complete and clear, due to which the AVs may misinterpret the information in a different context, leading to inadequate decision-making, which may then lead to fatal accidents. To overcome this drawback, effective preprocessing of raw sensory data is a mandatory task. Pre-processing the sensory data involves two vital tasks, namely data cleaning and data fusion. Since the raw sensory data are complex and exhibit multimodal characteristics, more emphasis is given to data preprocessing. Since more innovative models have been proposed for data cleaning, this study focused on data fusion. In particular, this study proposed a generic data fusion engine, which classifies different formats of sensory data and fuses them accordingly to improve accuracy. This study proposed a generic framework to fuse the text, image, and audio data. In the first stage of this research, an innovative hybrid model was proposed to fuse multispectral image and video data. Simple and efficient models to extract the salient image features were also proposed. The hybrid image fusion model that was proposed did not yield satisfactory outcomes when combining 3D point cloud data, and its performance declined when evaluating large datasets. To address this issue, the study expanded by introducing an advanced generative adversarial network (GAN) to transform the hybrid image fusion model into a machine learning model capable of handling substantial datasets. Additionally, customized kernel functions were suggested to fuse 3D point cloud data effectively. The performance of the proposed models was assessed using standard metrics and datasets, comparing them with existing popular models. The results revealed that the proposed image fusion model outperformed the other models.

AB We deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a large-scale uniform planar array (UPA) to serve multiple ground users in millimeter-wave band. Particularly, the practical UAV jitter is carefully considered, which may affect the beam gains and impact the communication quality. To provide a stable service, we first model the attitude change of the UPA caused by UAV jitter. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum achievable rate of the users by optimizing the position and robust hybrid beamforming of the UAV. To solve the non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, a two-stage optimization strategy is developed. The first stage aims to decouple the beamforming from the original problem and design the UAV deployment under the assumption of an ideal beam pattern. The second stage aims to design robust hybrid beamforming with the obtained UAV position. Specifically, we first design analog beamforming for wide beams to cover the potential jitter angle range for each user via a chirp sequence-inspired method. Then, with equivalent channel estimation, we design digital beamforming by combining zero-forcing and water-filling power allocation algorithms. Extensive simulation results show the performance superiority of the proposed solution compared to the benchmark algorithms.

AB Edge computing is a new computing paradigm which distributes tasks to edge networks for processing, it provides effective support for various mobile applications to meet their rapid response requirement. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in emergency rescue, mapping, etc., with the advantages of flexible deployment and rapid movement. However, on one hand, mobile applications will be terminated when the battery energy is exhausted. On the other hand, mobile applications will be out of service when mobile devices are out of radio coverage of UAVs. How to achieve low-cost task unloading in the resource limited and location sensitive multi-UAVs edge computing environment is rather challenging. In this paper, we propose a distributed location-aware task offloading scheme, aiming at the above issues. Specifically, we create a nonlinear task allocation problem by combining the limited energy constraints of edge nodes with the random movement of users, where the cost function is divided into static and dynamic costs, respectively. Then, we formulate this problem to a convex optimization one with linear constrains, based on regularization technology. The mathematical proof shows that the scheme can support a parameterized competitive ratio without requiring any prior knowledge of the input task. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve lower cost edge computing services.

AB The need for civilian use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has drastically increased in recent years. Their potential applications for civilian use include door-to-door package delivery, law enforcement, first aid, and emergency services in urban areas, which put the UAVs into obstacle collision risk. Therefore, UAVs are required to be equipped with sensors so as to acquire Artificial Intelligence (AI) to avoid potential risks during mission execution. The AI comes with intensive training of an on-board machine that is responsible to autonomously navigate the UAV. The training enables the UAV to develop humanoid perception of the environment it is to be navigating in. During the mission, this perception detects and localizes objects in the environment. It is based on this AI that this work proposes a real-time three-dimensional (3D) path planner that maneuvers the UAV towards destination through obstacle-free path. The proposed path planner has a heuristic sense of A(star) algorithm, but requires no frontier nodes to be stored in a memory unlike A(star). The planner relies on relative locations of detected objects (obstacles) and determines collision-free paths. This path planner is light-weight and hence a fast guidance method for real-time purposes. Its performance efficiency is proved through rigorous Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations in constrained-environment and preliminary real flight tests.

AB The functionality advancements and novel customer features that are currently found in modern automotive systems require high-bandwidth and low-latency in-vehicle communications, which become even more compelling for autonomous vehicles. In a recent effort to meet these requirements, the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has developed a set of standards that introduce novel features in Switched Ethernet. TSN standards offer, for example, a common notion of time through accurate and reliable clock synchronization, delay bounds for real-time traffic, time-driven transmissions, improved reliability, and much more. In order to fully utilize the potential of these novel protocols in the automotive domain, TSN should be seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice model-based development processes for automotive embedded systems. Some of the core phases in these processes include software architecture modeling, timing predictability verification, simulation, and hardware realization and deployment. Moreover, throughout the development of automotive embedded systems, the safety and security requirements specified on these systems need to be duly taken into account. In this context, this work provides an overview of TSN in automotive applications and discusses the recent technological developments relevant to the adoption of TSN in automotive embedded systems. The work also points at the open challenges and future research directions.

AB BACKGROUND Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in agriculture to collect imagery for crop and pest monitoring, and for decision-making purposes. Spraying-capable UAVs are now commercially available worldwide for agricultural applications. Combining UAV weed mapping and UAV sprayers into an UAV integrated system (UAV-IS) can offer a new alternative to implement site-specific pest management. RESULTS The UAV-IS was 0.3- to 3-fold more efficient at identifying and treating target weedy areas, while minimizing treatment on non-weedy areas, than ground-based broadcast applications. The UAV-IS treated 20-60% less area than ground-based broadcast applications, but also missed up to 26% of the target weedy area, while broadcast applications covered almost the entire experimental area and only missed 2-3% of the target weeds. The efficiency of UAV-IS management practices increased as weed spatial aggregation increased (patchiness). CONCLUSION Integrating UAV imagery for pest mapping and UAV sprayers can provide a new strategy for integrated pest management programs to improve efficiency and efficacy while reducing the amount of pesticide being applied. The UAV-IS has the potential to improve the detection and control of weed escapes to reduce/delay herbicide resistance evolution. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB Following the emergence of small flight-capable flapping-wing micro air vehicles, efforts toward autonomous outdoor operations of these small robots outside controlled laboratory conditions have been made. For the robots to overcome wind disturbances, it necessitates better insights into the interaction between the aerodynamics of flapping wings in the presence of winds and the robot's actuation system. In this paper, we consider the effects of constant frontal wind on a direct-drive flapping wing robot with passively rotating hinges and a compliant transmission. A simplified quasi-steady model that encapsulates the effects of frontal wind on aerodynamic forces is proposed. The model facilitates the calculation of periodic aerodynamic forces from nominal flapping kinematics. When combined with the dynamics of the actuation system, we are able to predict the lift force generated by the robot from the driving signals, without direct measurements of the flapping kinematics or the angle of attack. The proposed framework was experimentally verified on a flapping-wing robot prototype with a single wingspan of 76 mm. The results reveal up to 40% increases in lift when the robot was subject to 2.5 m/s horizontal winds. An analysis of the frequency response of the system is also provided to explain the resonance principles of the robot in the presence of frontal winds.

AB Driving simulators are very suitable test beds for the evaluation and development of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). However, the impact of such systems on the behavior of individual drivers can properly be analyzed through driving simulators only if autonomous vehicles in the driving scenario move according to the system under evaluation. This condition means that the simulation of the traffic surrounding the interactive vehicle should already take into account the driver's behavior as affected by the system under analysis. Currently, this "loop" is not properly tackled, because the effects on individuals and traffic are, in general, separately and, often, independently evaluated. The integration of traffic and driving simulations, instead, may provide a more consistent solution to this challenging evaluation problem. It also opens up new scenarios for enhancing the credibility of both traffic modeling and driving simulation and for their combined development. For instance, because drivers directly interact with driver/traffic models in a driving simulation environment, such models may also be tested against nonnormative behavior, and this case seems the only way to test driver/traffic models for safety applications. Based on this idea, this paper describes the integration of a driving simulation engine known as SCANeR and a traffic-flow microsimulation model known as AIMSUN. Methodological and technical issues of such integration are first presented, and future enhancements for higher consistency of the simulation environments are finally envisaged.

AB Autonomous navigation is an important task for unmanned vehicles operating both on the surface and underwater. A sophisticated solution for autonomous non-global navigational satellite system navigation is comparative (terrain reference) navigation. We present a method for fast processing of 3D multibeam sonar data to make depth area comparable with depth areas from bathymetric electronic navigational charts as source maps during comparative navigation. Recording the bottom of a channel, river, or lake with a 3D multibeam sonar data produces a large number of measuring points. A big dataset from 3D multibeam sonar is reduced in steps in almost real time. Usually, the whole data set from the results of a multibeam echo sounder results are processed. In this work, new methodology for processing of 3D multibeam sonar big data is proposed. This new method is based on the stepwise processing of the dataset with 3D models and isoline maps generation. For faster products generation we used the optimum dataset method which has been modified for the purposes of bathymetric data processing. The approach enables detailed examination of the bottom of bodies of water and makes it possible to capture major changes. In addition, the method can detect objects on the bottom, which should be eliminated during the construction of the 3D model. We create and combine partial 3D models based on reduced sets to inspect the bottom of water reservoirs in detail. Analyses were conducted for original and reduced datasets. For both cases, 3D models were generated in variants with and without overlays between them. Tests show, that models generated from reduced dataset are more useful, due to the fact, that there are significant elements of the measured area that become much more visible, and they can be used in comparative navigation. In fragmentary processing of the data, the aspect of present or lack of the overlay between generated models did not relevantly influence the accuracy of its height, however, the time of models generation was shorter for variants without overlay.

   Safety-critical
AB Considering the growing prominence of production-level AI and the threat of adversarial attacks that can poison a machine learning model against a certain label, evade classification, or reveal sensitive data about the model and training data to an attacker, adversaries pose fundamental problems to machine learning systems. Furthermore, much research has focused on the inverse relationship between robustness and accuracy, raising problems for real-time and safety-critical systems particularly since they are governed by legal constraints in which software changes must be explainable and every change must be thoroughly tested. While many defenses have been proposed, they are often computationally expensive and tend to reduce model accuracy. We have therefore conducted a large survey of attacks and defenses and present a simple and practical framework for analyzing any machine-learning system from a safety-critical perspective using adversarial noise to find the upper bound of the failure rate. Using this method, we conclude that all tested configurations of the ResNet architecture fail to meet any reasonable definition of 'safety-critical' when tested on even small-scale benchmark data. We examine state of the art defenses and attacks against computer vision systems with a focus on safety-critical applications in autonomous driving, industrial control, and healthcare. By testing a combination of attacks and defenses, their efficacy, and their run-time requirements, we provide substantial empirical evidence that modern neural networks consistently fail to meet established safety-critical standards by a wide margin.

ID IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFIER
AB This article describes a novel approach to the problem of developing explainable machine learning models. We consider a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model representing a highway path planning policy for autonomous highway driving [1]. The model constitutes a mapping from the continuous multidimensional state space characterizing vehicle positions and velocities to a discrete set of actions in longitudinal and lateral direction. It is obtained by applying a customized version of the double deep Q-network learning algorithm [2]. The main idea is to approximate the DRL model with a set of IF-THEN rules that provide an alternative interpretable model, which is further enhanced by visualizing the rules. This concept is rationalized by the universal approximation properties of the rule-based models with fuzzy predicates. The proposed approach includes a learning engine composed of zero-order fuzzy rules, which generalize locally around the prototypes by using multivariate function models. The adjacent (in the data space) prototypes, which correspond to the same action, are further grouped and merged into the so-called MegaClouds reducing significantly the number of fuzzy rules. The input selection method is based on ranking the density of the individual inputs. Experimental results show that the specific DRL agent can be interpreted by approximating with families of rules of different granularity. The method is computationally efficient and can be potentially extended to addressing the explainability of the broader set of fully connected deep neural network models.

TI Deformable microswimmer in an external force field
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS

DT Article
ID GRAVITAXIS; SEDIMENTATION; DUMBBELL; LATTICE; FLUID
AB External forces, such as gravity, play significant role in the swimming properties of autonomous biological microswimmers as well as artificial swimming robots. Here we have studied the influence of the external forces on the transport characteristics of the triangular bead-spring microswimmers. The microswimmer, formed by connecting three beads using three springs in an equilateral triangular arrangement, is capable of performing autonomous translational ("mover") and rotational ("rotor") motions. We show that for a mover triangle the application of a small external force results in the alignment of swimming direction with that of the external force, a phenomenon known as "gravitaxis." We demonstrate that this gravitactic nature of the active triangle is purely due to the hydrodynamic interaction among the beads. Under large external force, however, the gravitactic nature is lost. This transition from gravitactic to nongravitactic motion of the microswimmer is characterized by a saddle node or pitchfork bifurcations (depending on nature of active forces), where the strength of the critical external force scales linearly with the active force amplitude, f(e)(c) similar to f(a). However, for the rotor triangle only saddle node bifurcation is observed, which results in a vanishing angular velocity as the strength of the external force is increased. The critical value of the external force for the rotor, however, scales as f(e)(c) similar to f(a)(2/3). These findings will provide insights into the nature of biological swimming under gravity, especially the gravitactic microorganisms such as Chlamydomonas, as well as help in the design of underwater vehicles.

AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles as aerial base stations (ABSs) can significantly enhance the capacity and coverage of wireless systems. In this paper, the problem of optimal ABS placement is studied while exploiting high-rise topographic features to maximize wireless coverage. In contrast to prior art that relies on simplified full line-of-sight (LoS) channel models or impractical probabilistic LoS channel models, this paper presents a novel feature-aware channel model that decisively discerns whether an air-to-ground (A2G) link is in LoS or non-LoS (NLoS) based on the topographical environment data for the target area. To resolve the challenges created by the dependence between the channel gain and the topographical environment in this feature-aware channel model, the LoS and NLoS zones in the target area are analyzed from a geometrical point of view. Then, based on the analysis results, the coverage area is derived in a tractable form and then used to develop a feature-aware ABS placement algorithm, called ABS-FA, based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is compared with two other baseline algorithms based on the full LoS and probabilistic LoS channel models, called ABS-LoS and ABS-Prob, respectively. Simulation results show that, depending on the topographical environment, ABS-LoS may outperform ABS-Prob, or vice versa, and even both may be very limited in some cases, because the full LoS and probabilistic LoS channel models cannot properly capture whether an A2G link is in LoS or NLoS. The results also show that the proposed ABS-FA scheme always outperforms these baseline algorithms and that, for instance, it can provide approximately 25% and 50% higher coverage performance compared to ABS-Prob and ABS-LoS, respectively. These results verify that considering a feature-aware channel model can be a very effective approach for determining the ABS location.

AB An autonomous power supply device based on a 30 W fuel cell (FC) stack and a hydrolysis-type hydrogen generator was developed. The creation of this device included the construction of a unit for hydrogen generation, development of an electronic control unit for the operation of the device, and testing and optimizing the overall performance. The hydrolysis of NaBH4 was catalyzed by Pt-based catalysts and was studied for different reactor configurations and reagent concentrations. The flat type of the reactor, Pt catalyst deposited on cordierite as a support, and 10% solution of NaBH4 proved to be the most efficient when generating H-2 for use in the 30 W FC. A developed electronic control unit effectively regulates the hydrolysis reaction rate and provides the required hydrogen supply to the FC. A Li-ion battery was used to start the work of the developed system. One important feature of the developed electronic system is the use of supercapacitors, enabling smoothening of the periodic variations of the generated power. The created hydrolysis unit integrated with the FC provides a stable power supply for at least 9 h from one refueling (U (const) = 12 V, I = 0-2.5 A, nominal power = 30 W). The specific generated power of the system when accounting for its weight and volume is similar to the analogues described in the reference data, while the electronic circuit enables its stable and efficient performance, satisfying the consumer needs for autonomous energy supply when a stationary electrical grid is not available.

AB The development of a navigation system is one of the major challenges in building a fully autonomous platform. Full autonomy requires a dependable navigation capability not only in a perfect situation with clear GPS signals but also in situations, where the GPS is unreliable. Therefore, self-contained odometry systems have attracted much attention recently. This paper provides a general and comprehensive overview of the state of the art in the field of self-contained, i.e., GPS denied odometry systems, and identifies the out-coming challenges that demand further research in future. Self-contained odometry methods are categorized into five main types, i.e., wheel, inertial, laser, radar, and visual, where such categorization is based on the type of the sensor data being used for the odometry. Most of the research in the field is focused on analyzing the sensor data exhaustively or partially to extract the vehicle pose. Different combinations and fusions of sensor data in a tightly/loosely coupled manner and with filtering or optimizing fusion method have been investigated. We analyze the advantages and weaknesses of each approach in terms of different evaluation metrics, such as performance, response time, energy efficiency, and accuracy, which can be a useful guideline for researchers and engineers in the field. In the end, some future research challenges in the field are discussed.

AB The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of autonomous driving systems. However, it remains a daunting task to achieve full autonomy, especially when it comes to understanding the ever-changing, complex driving scenes. To alleviate the difficulty of perception, self-driving vehicles are usually equipped with a suite of sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDARs), hoping to capture the scenes with overlapping perspectives to minimize blind spots. Fusing these data streams and exploiting their complementary properties is thus rapidly becoming the current trend. Nonetheless, combining data that are captured by different sensors with drastically different ranging/ima-ging mechanisms is not a trivial task; instead, many factors need to be considered and optimized. If not careful, data from one sensor may act as noises to data from another sensor, with even poorer results by fusing them. Thus far, there has been no in-depth guidelines to designing the multi-modal fusion based 3D perception algorithms. To fill in the void and motivate further investigation, this survey conducts a thorough study of tens of recent deep learning based multi-modal 3D detection networks (with a special emphasis on LiDAR-camera fusion), focusing on their fusion stage (i.e., when to fuse), fusion inputs (i.e., what to fuse), and fusion granularity (i.e., how to fuse). These important design choices play a critical role in determining the performance of the fusion algorithm. In this survey, we first introduce the background of popular sensors used for self-driving, their data properties, and the corresponding object detection algorithms. Next, we discuss existing datasets that can be used for evaluating multi-modal 3D object detection algorithms. Then we present a review of multi-modal fusion based 3D detection networks, taking a close look at their fusion stage, fusion input and fusion granularity, and how these design choices evolve with time and technology. After the review, we discuss open challenges as well as possible solutions. We hope that this survey can help researchers to get familiar with the field and embark on investigations in the area of multi-modal 3D object detection.

AB Purpose The development of robust control algorithms for the position, velocity and trajectory control of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) depends on the accuracy of their mathematical models. Accuracy of the model is determined by precise estimation of the UUV hydrodynamic parameters. The purpose of this study is to determine the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on an underwater vehicle with complex body geometry and moving at low speeds and to achieve the accurate coefficients associated with them. Design/methodology/approach A three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design (CAD) model of UUV is designed with one-to-one dimensions. 3D fluid flow simulations are conducted using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software programme in the solution of Navier Stokes equations for laminar and turbulent flow analysis. The coefficients depending on the hydrodynamic forces and moments are determined by the external flow analysis using the CFD programme. The Flow Simulation k-epsilon turbulence model is used for the transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow. Hydrodynamic properties such as lift and drag coefficients and roll and yaw moment coefficients are calculated. The parameters are compared with the coefficient values found by experimental methods. Findings Although the modular type UUV has a complex body geometry, the comparative results of the experiments and simulations confirm that the defined model parameters are accurate and close to the actual experimental values. In the proposed k-epsilon method, the percentage error in the estimation of drag and lifting coefficients is decreased to 4.2% and 8.39%, respectively. Practical implications The model coefficients determined in this study can be used in high-level control simulations which leads to the development of robust real-time controllers for complex-shaped modular UUVs. Originality/value The Lucky Fin UUV with 4 degrees of freedom is a specific design and its CAD model is first extracted. Verification of simulation results by experiments is generally less referenced in studies. However, it provides more precise parameter identification of the model. Proposed study offers a simple and low-cost experimental measurement method for verification of the hydrodynamic parameters. The extracted model and coefficients are worthwhile references for the analysis of modular type UUVs.

AB To address the technical difficulties of artificial potential filed (APF)-based automatic collision avoidance (CA) algorithms, a stable and reliable technological framework was established for autonomous CA from the perspectives of navigation practice and real-ship application. First, an improved route-plan-guided APF (RPGAPF) approach was introduced, considering the ship motion and constraints by the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS). Second, a simulation-based real-ship accompanying test system (SRSATS) was well-designed for the intelligent navigation projects and installed on a 45.0 m length ship. Third, various real-ship open-loop CA tests were conducted under different encountering situations, and concurrently, simulation testing in both open-loop and closed-loop were carried out. The results indicated that simulation tests may be used as precursors before real-ship trials, and that the proposed SRSATS can be employed as a practical verification method for real-ship testing to generate variety of complex encountering situations. The CA procedures and results for the corresponding real-ship and simulation tests produced similar trends, and the improved RPGAPF approach can be applied in real-ship automatic CA systems owing to its dependability, determinism, and repeatability. This study proposes a complete solution for the APF-base CA approach, including system modelling, integration and testing. The findings provide valuable insights into the ship CA research and contribute to the improvement of ship intelligence.

AB Object detection in autonomous driving scenarios has become a popular task in recent years. Due to the high-speed movement of vehicles and the complex changes in the surrounding environment, objects of different scales need to be detected, which places high demands on the performance of the network model. Additionally, different driving devices have varying performance capabilities, and a lightweight model is needed to ensure the stable operation of devices with limited computing power. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight network called BiGA-YOLO based on YOLOv5. We design the Ghost-Hardswish Conv module to simplify the convolution operations and incorporate spatial coordinate information into feature maps using Coordinate Attention. We also replace the PANet structure with the BiFPN structure to enhance the expression ability of features through different weights during the process of fusing multi-scale feature maps. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset, and our BiGA-YOLO achieved a mAP@0.5 of 92.2% and a mAP@0.5:0.95 of 68.3%. Compared to the baseline model YOLOv5, our proposed model achieved improvements of 1.9% and 4.7% in mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95, respectively, while reducing the model size by 15.7% and the computational cost by 16%. The detection speed was also increased by 6.3 FPS. Through analysis and discussion of the experimental results, we demonstrate that our proposed model is superior, achieving a balance between detection accuracy, model size, and detection speed.

DE radiation mapping; mobile sensors; autonomous

AB Distributed and networked mobile sensor platforms using unmanned aerial and/or ground vehicles to survey areas of interest offer a safer and more efficient method for radiological contamination mapping; however, most applications rely on uniformly sweeping of the area in a raster-type motion without utilizing the information available in a dynamic sense. We have developed a fully autonomous optimal motion planning procedure for networks with two or more mobile sensors. The procedure utilizes well-established concepts of Gaussian processes in combination with control laws based on centroidal Voronoi tessellations to achieve optimal next-iteration sensor movements. A new method of informing optimal motion planning is proposed, whereby the absolute difference between the prior and current full-map prediction, referred to as the prediction-difference map, is used as the spatial density function within each Voronoi cell, providing immediate and iterative feedback for dynamic use of available information. The Gaussian process regression model used to estimate the contamination in unvisited locations also provides prediction uncertainties, and can be used as a quantitative metric to assess the confidence in the calculated contamination map; these estimates and prediction uncertainties are unavailable for standard uniform survey routines as they can only produce maps in the vicinity of observed locations. We present through simulation the achievable performance gains from using this new method by directly comparing to a uniform survey method. Results show that using the prediction-difference maps to inform motion planning procedures offers a faster rate of producing an accurate and convergent map relative to a uniform survey route.

AB This paper presents an innovative two-processor computer architecture, developed for the data processing unit (DPU) of the Magnetospheric IMaging Instrument (MIMI), onboard the Cassini spacecraft mission to Saturn. The main advantages of this architecture are its high performance and reliability, and its intelligence. The high performance is justified by the following:
   1) optimum combination of two powerful Harris RTX 2010 processors;
   2) adoption of two independent main bus structures used for the communication of the processors with the various instrument interfaces and subsystems;
   3) adoption of two additional local buses on each processor board used to speed the onboard operations of the processors;
   4) high speed interprocessor communication port,
   The high reliability is justified by the following:
   1) simplicity of hardware/software structures;
   2) fault tolerance capabilities;
   3) capability for on-flight hardware/software reconfiguration by ground command.
   Moreover, the onboard intelligence is justified by the following:
   1) sophisticated fault protection, data handling, and instrument control software;
   2) intelligent interfaces [implemented using field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's)];
   3) capability for autonomous on-flight hardware/software reconfiguration in case of an unrecoverable failure in one processor,
   The advantages of this architecture make it the best choice for the DPU of the complex, sophisticated scientific MIMI instrument, compared to the traditional master-slave (low reliability-single point failure) and common shared bus (Low performance, hardware and software complexity) architectures.

AB Integrated and intelligent in situ observations are important for the remote sensing monitoring of dynamic water environments. To meet the field investigation requirements of ocean color remote sensing, we developed a water color remote sensing-oriented unmanned surface vehicle (WC-USV), which consisted of an unmanned surface vehicle platform with ground control station, data acquisition, and transmission modules. The WC-USV was designed with functions, such as remote controlling, status monitoring, automatic obstacle avoidance, and water and meteorological parameter measurement acquisition, transmission, and processing. The key data acquisition module consisted of four parts: A floating optical buoy (FOBY) for collecting remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) via the skylight-blocked approach; a water sample autocollection system that can collect 12 1-L bottles for analysis in the laboratory; a water quality measurement system for obtaining water parameters, including Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), turbidity, and water temperature, among others; and meteorological sensors for measuring wind speed and direction, air pressure, temperature, and humidity. Field experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the WC-USV on 23-28 March 2018 in the Honghu Lake, which is the seventh largest freshwater lake in China. The tests proved the following: (1) The WC-USV performed well in terms of autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance; (2) the mounted FOBY-derived R-rs showed good precision in terms of the quality assurance score (QAS), which was higher than 0.98; (3) the Chl-a and suspended matters (SPM) as ocean color parameters measured by the WC-USV were highly consistent with laboratory analysis results, with determination coefficients (R-2) of 0.71 and 0.77, respectively; and (4) meteorological parameters could be continuously and stably measured by WC-USV. Results demonstrated the feasibility and practicability of the WC-USV for automatic in situ observations. The USV provided a new way of thinking for the future development of intelligent automation of the aquatic remote sensing ground verification system. It could be a good option to conduct field investigations for ocean color remote sensing and provide an alternative for highly polluted and/or shallow high-risk waters which large vessels have difficulty reaching.

AB Mesoscale eddies help regulate ocean energy cascades. Eddies deformation influences barotropic instability, which represents kinetic energy transfer between scales; however, the barotropic instability structure has not been well studied. We investigated an intra-thermocline eddy (ITE) and developed a novel anisotropic method to examine the horizontal barotropic instability. The development of the ITE was monitored using a state-of-the-art autonomous underwater vehicle from May to July. The ITE became trapped in June and moved eastward in July. Based on anisotropic theory, the barotropic instability was separated into isotropic and anisotropic productions. The anisotropy contained information regarding shape and mean flow feedback of the eddy. Barotropic instability was the main source for ITE eastward propagation and was dominated by anisotropic production. Following a shape and anisotropy change, the ITE gained the mean-flow kinetic energy by the anisotropy shear production in June and by the anisotropy stretch production when moving eastward in July.
   Mesoscale eddies play vital roles in ocean circulation and are important in energy cascades between large-scale ocean circulation and dissipate scales. The barotropic instability could induce kinetic energy transition between scales, however, the underlying mechanism has not been well studied. We developed a novel method to decompose the horizontal barotropic instability into isotropic production and anisotropic production. The development of a mesoscale eddy was monitored continuously using a state-of-the-art autonomous underwater vehicle. This mesoscale eddy became stationary in June and began to move eastward in July. In the observation case, the barotropic instability mainly controlled the eddy kinetic energy budget and is dominated by anisotropic production, indicating the contribution of the mean-flow strain. We found that, the mesoscale eddy gained the mean-flow kinetic energy via the anisotropy shear production when it was stationary, while via anisotropy stretch production when it moved eastward.
   For 3 months, a state-of-the-art AUV monitored the development of an intra-thermocline eddy (ITE) in terms of vertical transectsNovel anisotropy analysis was developed and revealed interactions between eddy anisotropy and mean-flow strain in barotropic instabilityThe anisotropic partitioning of the ITE at different stages helped gain kinetic energy from the mean flow

AB Objective Self-driving technology will bring novelty in vehicle interior design and allow for a wide variety of occupant seating choices. Previous studies have shown that the increased risk of submarining exhibited by reclined occupants cannot be fully mitigated by changes in the seat configuration alone. This study aims to investigate the effects of three restraint countermeasures on cases with marginal submarining events and estimate their effect on submarining risk and injury prediction metrics. Methods Vehicle environment frontal crash Finite Element (FE) simulations were performed with the two simplified Global Human Body Model Consortium (GHBMC) occupant models: small female and midsize male. The baseline occupant restraints consisted of a frontal airbag, a seatback-integrated 3-point belt with a lap belt anchor pre-tensioner, and a retractor-mounted pre-tensioner and load limiter. Based on submarining thresholds identified in previous studies, three baseline configurations were identified for each occupant size. For each baseline case three restraint system modifications were evaluated. The modifications consisted of the introduction of a pelvis restraint cushion airbag (PRC), the use of a knee airbag (KAB) and the modification of the of the passenger airbag location (PAB). Simulations were performed using the USNCAP 56 km/h frontal crash pulse. Occupant kinematic data was extracted from each simulation to investigate how changes in the restraint system configuration affects submarining. Results Overall, in only one of the investigated cases did the proposed restraint modification prevent submarining occurrence, however each of the restraint modifications reduced the pelvis excursion over the baseline scenario. The presence of the PRC airbag showed the highest reduction in pelvis forward excursion for the female model. The presence of the KAB and the modified location of the PAB also contributed to reductions in excursion to a smaller degree. For the male surrogate, the KAB showed the highest reduction in pelvis forward excursion. The presence of the PRC led to a reduction in the lumbar spine shear force. Conclusions Submarining may be a major challenge to overcome for reclined occupants in autonomous driving systems. This suggests that there may not be a single generalizable currently-existing countermeasure able to effectively prevent marginal submarining cases in reclined positions.

AB The Epsilometer ("epsi") is a small (7 cm diameter x 30 cm long), low-power (0.15 W), and extremely modular microstructure package measuring thermal and kinetic energy dissipation rates, chi and epsilon. Both the shear probes and FP07 temperature sensors are fabricated in house following techniques developed by Michael Gregg at the Applied Physics Laboratory/University of Washington (APL/UW). Sampling eight channels (two shear, two temperature, three-axis accelerometer, and a spare for future sensors) at 24 bit precision and 325 Hz, the system can be deployed in standalone mode (battery power and recording to microSD cards) for deployment on autonomous vehicles, wave powered profilers, or it can be used with dropping body termed the "epsi-fish" for profiling from boats, autonomous surface craft or ships with electric fishing reels or other simple winches. The epsi-fish can also be used in real-time mode with the Scripps "fast CTD" winch for fully streaming, altimeter-equipped, line-powered, rapid-repeating, near-bottom shipboard profiles to 2200 m. Because this winch has a 25 ft (similar to 7.6 m) boom deployable outboard from the ship, contamination by ship wake is reduced one to two orders of magnitude in the upper 10-15 m. The noise floor of epsilon profiles from the epsi-fish is similar to 10(-10) W kg(-1). This paper describes the fabrication, electronics, and characteristics of the system, and documents its performance compared to its predecessor, the APL/UW Modular Microstructure Profiler (MMP).

AB Localization in aerial imagery-based maps offers many advantages, such as global consistency, geo-referenced maps, and the availability of publicly accessible data. However, the landmarks that can be observed from both aerial imagery and on-board sensors is limited. This leads to ambiguities or aliasing during the data association. Building upon a highly informative representation (that allows efficient data association), this paper presents a complete pipeline for resolving these ambiguities. Its core is a robust self-tuning data association that adapts the search area depending on a pseudo-entropy of the measurements. Additionally, to smooth the final result, we adjust the information matrix for the associated data as a function of the relative transform produced by the data association process. We evaluate our method on real data from urban and rural scenarios around the city of Karlsruhe in Germany. We compare state-of-the-art outlier mitigation methods with our self-tuning approach, demonstrating a considerable improvement, especially for outer-urban scenarios.

AB This paper tackles the problem of performing persistent and complete coverage of a target space with a minimum number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs are required to preferentially visit subareas of interest with higher frequency than the rest of the surveillance area within a predefined time threshold. A Minimum Spanning Tree based recursive algorithm is firstly proposed to estimate the upper bound of minimum number of UAVs for area coverage with visiting frequency constraints. Then an autonomous path planning strategy is proposed for persistent coverage, where a combinatorial priority function is designed as the goal assignment strategy and a modified Dijkstra algorithm is applied as the goal planning to obtain the optimum path. Finally, computer simulations have been conducted for the evaluation of the proposed solution, and the obtained results show that these algorithms can compute valid and sound solutions under different setups for the UAVs.

AB In the paper, a new cascade control system for an autonomous flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and finite-time State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) control is proposed. The PID and SDRE controllers are used in a hybrid control system for precise control and stabilization, which is necessary to increase the drone's flight stability and maneuver precision. The hybrid PID-SDRE control system proposed for the quadrotor model is quasi-optimal, since the suboptimal control algorithm for the UAV stabilization is used. The combination of the advantages of PID and SDRE control gives a significant improvement in the quality of control while maintaining the simplicity of the control system. Furthermore, the use of the suboptimal control technique provides the UAV attitude tracking in finite time. These remarks are drawn from a series of simulation tests conducted for the drone model.

AB A biplane quadrotor is a hybrid type of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that has advantages of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAVs. In this study, we design controllers using (i) Backstepping Control (BSC), (ii) Integral Terminal Sliding Mode Control (ITSMC), and (iii) Hybrid control (ITSMC + BSC), where the ITSMC controls attitude and BSC controls the altitude subsystems as per the mathematical model of biplane quadrotor. The performance of these controllers is evaluated based on the autonomous trajectory tracking containing all possible maneuvers and operation modes that the biplane quadrotor can perform. Performance analysis reveals that the BSC-based controller is susceptible to a steady-state error in altitude tracking when mass is changed. In contrast, the ITSMC and the "hybrid" controllers achieve smooth tracking in a finite time. Furthermore, the "hybrid" controller outperforms the other designs, reducing tracking error and faster convergence time.

AB The integration of IoT communication technologies such as Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) is essential in today systems including supply chain, healthcare, autonomous vehicle, etc. In such environments there is an increase in IoT applications that require End Devices (EDs) mobility within similar or heterogeneous LPWAN technologies. Supporting mobility refers to ensure the delivery of data on demand and during movement. In this paper, we investigate the mobility of ED between different LPWAN technologies. We propose a new mobility management solution in LPWAN to achieve continuity of the communication after the link layer technology changes between the ED and the Application Server (AS). This solution is IPv6-based and supports switching between heterogeneous LPWAN networks and technologies. It results in reducing the time required to deliver the data by optimizing the communication routing and saving the bandwidth. The validation of the proposed solution is achieved through the scenarios of ED handovers between LoRaWAN and NB-IoT using simulations as well as experimentation.

AB In this paper, we investigate an accurate trajectory tracking control of marine surface vessels (MSVs) under external disturbances. First, introducing an auxiliary velocity vector, a complicated MSV models can be further simplified. Then, a fixed-time disturbance observer (FDO) is employed to identify external disturbances to enhance the tracking performance of the system. The estimation errors can achieve the origin within a finite time independent of the initial conditions. On the basis of the FDO, in the context of fixed-time sliding mode manifold, a novel nonsingular fixed-time terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) scheme is formulated, by which MSVs can track the reference trajectory with all states globally stabilized in a fixed time. The effectiveness of the developed scheme is validated by numerical simulation results.

AB In this letter, we present Gaussian Process Preintegration, a preintegration theory based on continuous representations of inertial measurements. A novel use of linear operators on Gaussian Process kernels is employed to generate the proposed Gaussian Preintegrated Measurements (GPMs). This formulation allows the analytical integration of inertial signals on any time interval. Consequently, GPMs are especially suited for asynchronous inertial-aided estimation frameworks. Unlike discrete preintegration approaches, the proposed method does not rely on any explicit motion-model and does not suffer from numerical integration noise. Additionally, we provide the analytical derivation of the Jacobians involved in the first-order expansion for postintegration bias and inter-sensor time-shift correction. We benchmarked the proposed method against existing preintegration methods on simulated data. Our experiments show that GPMs produce the most accurate results and their computation time allows close-to-real-time operations. We validated the suitability of GPMs for inertial-aided estimation by integrating them into a lidar-inertial localisation and mapping framework.

AB This letter presents a novel, compute-efficient and training-free approach based on Histogram-of-Oriented-Gradients (HOG) descriptor for achieving state-of-the-art performance-per-compute-unit in Visual Place Recognition (VPR). The inspiration for this approach (namely CoHOG) is based on the convolutional scanning and regions-based feature extraction employed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By using image entropy to extract regions-of-interest (ROI) and regional-convolutional descriptor matching, our technique performs successful place recognition in changing environments. We use viewpoint- and appearance-variant public VPR datasets to report this matching performance, at lower RAM commitment, zero training requirements and 20 times lesser feature encoding time compared to state-of-the-art neural networks. We also discuss the image retrieval time of CoHOG and the effect of CoHOG's parametric variation on its place matching performance and encoding time.

AB In the Multi-tier Shuttle Warehousing System (MSWS), shuttles are responsible for horizontal movements and lifts are responsible for vertical movements. In this paper, a retrieval task scheduling problem for a tier-captive MSWS under single command cycle is considered. This paper aims to determine the sequence of retrieval tasks to minimize the makespan. A mixed integer programming model is developed for the retrieval task scheduling problem. When the number of tasks is less than 10, the mixed integer programming model can be solved by the GUROBI solver to find the exact solutions within a short period. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm, an ant colony algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm are designed and applied to solve large size problems with up to 200 tasks. By analyzing experimental results, the ant colony algorithm shows stable and superior performance in solving large size problems.

AB Real multi-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) cooperative systems operate in complicated marine environments. The interaction between a multi-AUV cooperative system and its marine environment will affect the reliability of the system. Current is an important influencing factor of multi-AUV cooperative systems. A reliability index of multi-AUV cooperative systems known as System Reliable Probability (SRP) is proposed in this study. A method to calculate SRP is introduced, and the influence of current on SRP is discussed in detail. Current is considered an attack source, and the degree of its influence on SRP is calculated. As an example, the performance of this method is shown on two multi-AUV cooperative systems. Results show that the influence of the same current environment on different structures of the multi-AUV cooperative systems differs. This result provides a reference for the structure selection of multi-AUV systems. This study provides a practical method to estimate the reliability of multi-AUV cooperative systems.

AB Pathfinding is becoming more and more common in autonomous vehicle navigation, robot localization, and other computer vision applications. In this paper, a novel approach to mapping and localization is presented that extracts visual landmarks from a robot dataset acquired by a Kinect sensor. The visual landmarks are detected and recognized using the improved scale-invariant feature transform (I-SIFT) method. The methodology is based on detecting stable and invariant landmarks in consecutive (red-green-blue depth) RGB-D frames of the robot dataset. These landmarks are then used to determine the robot path, and a map is constructed by using the visual landmarks. A number of experiments were performed on various datasets in an indoor environment. The proposed method performs efficient landmark detection in various environments, which includes changes in rotation and illumination. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem using stable visual landmarks, but with less computation time.

TI A Fully Automatic Calibration Algorithm for a Camera Odometry System

AB This paper focuses on the calibration of a mobile robot system with odometry and a monocular camera. Most current approaches are based on either batch optimization or Bayesian filter, which require a good initial guess to obtain the optimal calibration results. In this paper, a two-step calibration algorithm is proposed for a fully automatic calibration of the camera-odometry system, consisting of: 1) a non-iterative auto initialization step for spatial extrinsic calibration based on the landmark measurements and 2) a joint optimization step to estimate both the spatio-temporal extrinsic parameters and the odometric parameters. By exploiting the planar constraints of landmark measurements, our auto initialization method can achieve better accuracy compared with the current solutions. Experiments are conducted based on both the simulation data sets and also the real world data sets collected from an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) system, which validate our algorithm compared with a VO-based non-iterative method.

DE Underactuated AUV; Path following; Control; Line-of-sight guidance;
   Dynamic circle guidance
AB A 2D path following control method for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) based on dynamic circle heading modification (DCHM) is presented. The method makes a dynamic auxiliary circle, whose radius depends on the cross- track error e, to intersect the desired path to get a new expected path point, and then determines a modified expected heading for the AUV. The guidance function is achieved by a direct mapping between e and the heading modification value psi(m). Several cases are tested in order to demonstrate the performance of the guidance and control method based on DCHMs for a real AUV. Results show that methods using a convex mapping function between e and psi(m) based on our new idea can easily achieve a better convergence of path following, and reduce the error between the actual and desired heading angles. We can also customize a discretionary mapping between e and psi(m) to get better path following performance.

AB This paper proposes an approach based on Ordinal Optimization (OO) to solve trajectory planning for automated driving. As most planning approaches based on candidate curves optimize the trajectory curve and the velocity profile separately, this paper formulates the problem as an unified Non-Linear Programming (NLP) model, optimizing the trajectory curve and the acceleration profile (acceleration is the derivative of velocity) simultaneously. Then a hybrid optimization algorithm named OODE, developed by combining the idea of OO and Differential Evolution (DE), is proposed to solve the NLP model. With the acceleration profile optimized "roughly", OODE computes and compares "rough" (biased but computationally-easier) curve evaluations to select the best curve from candidates, so that a good enough curve can be obtained very efficiently. Then the acceleration profile is optimized again "accurately" with the selected curve. Simulation results show that good enough solutions are ensured with a high probability and our method is capable of working in real time.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a new algorithm for linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) controller of a quadrotor with fast and stable performance, which is based on pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO).
   Design/methodology/approach - The controller is based on LQR. The determinate parameters are optimized by PIO, which is a newly proposed swarm intelligent algorithm inspired by the characteristics of homing pigeons.
   Findings - The PIO-optimized LQR controller can obtain the optimized parameters and achieve stabilization in about 3 s.
   Practical implications - The PIO-optimized LQR controller can be easily applied to the flight formation, autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) and detection of unmanned aerial vehicles, especially applied to (AAR) in this paper.
   Originality/value - This research applies PIO to optimize the tuning parameters of LQR, which can considerably improve the fast and stabilizing performance of attitude control. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

ID LOCALIZATION; SLAM
AB This work focuses on autonomous operation of rotary-wing Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in previously unexplored, GPS-denied environments. This type of operation requires the MAV to simultaneously estimate a map of its surroundings and its own position within that map. This work presents a refined algorithm for performing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) which does not rely on revisiting previously mapped areas. The algorithm is first benchmarked against previously published algorithms. Different scenarios, both indoors and outdoors, are then presented, showing the high amount of detail captured by the proposed method. Scenarios were mapped using three different platform types, including a conventional main-tail rotor helicopter, showing that the algorithm is platform-independent and does not require the rotorcraft's dynamic model, which can be complex. Experimental validation of the SLAM method shows an accuracy of approximately 0.1% of the traveled course length. The algorithm is capable of operating in real time on small form factor computers.

AB The recent Deepwater Horizon disaster resulted in a dispersed oil plume at an approximate depth of 1000 m. Several methods were used to characterize this plume with respect to concentration and spatial extent including surface supported sampling and autonomous underwater vehicles with in situ instrument payloads. Additionally, echo sounders were used to track the plume location, demonstrating the potential for remote detection using acoustic backscatter (ABS). This study evaluated use of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) to quantitatively detect oil-droplet suspensions from the ABS response in a controlled laboratory setting. Results from this study showed log-linear ABS responses to oil-droplet volume concentration. However, the inability to reproduce ABS response factors suggests the difficultly in developing meaningful calibration factors for quantitative field analysis. Evaluation of theoretical ABS intensity derived from the particle size distribution provided insight regarding method sensitivity in the presence of interfering ambient particles.

AB The goal of engineering self-organising emergent systems is to acquire a macroscopic system behaviour solely from autonomous local activity and interaction. Due to the non-deterministic nature of such systems, it is hard to guarantee that the required macroscopic behaviour is achieved and maintained. Before even considering a self-organising emergent system in an industrial context, e.g. for Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) transportation systems, such guarantees are needed. An empirical analysis approach is proposed that combines realistic agent-based simulations with existing scientific numerical algorithms for analysing the macroscopic behaviour. The numerical algorithm itself obtains the analysis results on the fly by steering and accelerating the simulation process according to the algorithm's goal. The approach is feasible, compared to formal proofs, and leads to more reliable and valuable results, compared to mere observation of simulation results. Also, the approach allows to systematically analyse the macroscopic behaviour to acquire macroscopic guarantees and feedback that can be used by an engineering process to iteratively shape a self-organising emergent solution.

DE Autonomous driving; change detection; localization; mapping; Structure
   from Motion (SfM)
AB Autonomous driving requires 3-D maps that provide accurate and up-to-date information about semantic landmarks. Since cameras present wider availability and lower cost compared with laser scanners, vision-based mapping solutions, especially, the ones using crowdsourced visual data, have attracted much attention from academia and industry. However, previous works have mainly focused on creating 3-D point clouds, leaving automatic change detection as open issue. We propose a pipeline for initiating and updating 3-D maps with dashcam videos, with a focus on automatic change detection based on comparison of metadata (e.g., the types and locations of traffic signs). To improve the performance of metadata generation, which depends on the accuracy of 3-D object detection and localization, we introduce a novel deep learning-based pixelwise 3-D localization algorithm. The algorithm, trained directly with Structure from Motion (SfM) point cloud data, accurately locates objects in 3-D space by estimating not only depth from monocular images but also lateral and height distances. In addition, we also propose a point clustering and thresholding algorithm to improve the robustness of the system to errors. We have performed experiments with different types of cameras, lighting, and weather conditions. The changes were detected with an average accuracy above 90%. The errors in the campus area were mainly due to traffic signs seen from a far distance to the vehicle and intended for pedestrians and cyclists only. We also conducted cause analysis of the detection and localization errors to measure the impact from the performance of the background technology in use.

AB The problem of continuous inverse optimal control (over finite time horizon) is to learn the unknown cost function over the sequence of continuous control variables from expert demonstrations. In this article, we study this fundamental problem in the framework of energy-based model (EBM), where the observed expert trajectories are assumed to be random samples from a probability density function defined as the exponential of the negative cost function up to a normalizing constant. The parameters of the cost function are learned by maximum likelihood via an ``analysis by synthesis'' scheme, which iterates: 1) synthesis step: sample the synthesized trajectories from the current probability density using the Langevin dynamics via backpropagation through time and 2) analysis step: update the model parameters based on the statistical difference between the synthesized trajectories and the observed trajectories. Given the fact that an efficient optimization algorithm is usually available for an optimal control problem, we also consider a convenient approximation of the above learning method, where we replace the sampling in the synthesis step by optimization. Moreover, to make the sampling or optimization more efficient, we propose to train the EBM simultaneously with a top-down trajectory generator via cooperative learning, where the trajectory generator is used to fast initialize the synthesis step of the EBM. We demonstrate the proposed methods on autonomous driving tasks and show that they can learn suitable cost functions for optimal control.

AB Background: The daily commute could be a right moment to teach drivers to use movement or breath towards improving their mental health. Long commutes, the relevance of transitioning from home to work, and vice versa and the privacy of commuting by car make the commute an ideal scenario and time to perform mindful exercises safely. Whereas driving safety is paramount, mindful exercises might help commuters decrease their daily stress while staying alert. Increasing vehicle automation may present new opportunities but also new challenges.
   Objective: This study aimed to explore the design space for movement-based mindful interventions for commuters. We used qualitative analysis of simulated driving experiences in combination with simple movements to obtain key design insights.
   Methods: We performed a semistructured viability assessment in 2 parts. First, a think-aloud technique was used to obtain information about a driving task. Drivers (N= 12) were given simple instructions to complete movements (configural or breath-based) while engaged in either simple (highway) or complex (city) simulated urban driving tasks using autonomous and manual driving modes. Then, we performed a matching exercise where participants could experience vibrotactile patterns from the back of the car seat and map them to the prior movements.
   Results: We report a summary of individual perceptions concerning different movements and vibrotactile patterns. Beside describing situations within a drive when it may be more likely to perform movement-based interventions, we also describe movements that may interfere with driving and those that may complement it well. Furthermore, we identify movements that could be conducive to a more relaxing commute and describe vibrotactile patterns that could guide such movements and exercises. We discuss implications for design such as the influence of driving modality on the adoption of movement, need for personal customization, the influence that social perception has on participants, and the potential role of prior awareness of mindful techniques in the adoption of new movement-based interventions.
   Conclusions: This exploratory study provides insights into which types of movements could be better suited to design mindful interventions to reduce stress for commuters, when to encourage such movements, and how best to guide them using noninvasive haptic stimuli embedded in the car seat.

TI Safe Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving in
   Urban Environments. Additional Filter? How and Where?
SO IEEE ACCESS

   filters; autonomous vehicles
AB Autonomous driving (AD) provides a reliable solution for safe driving by replacing human drivers responsible for the majority of accidents. The emergence of Machine Learning, specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and its ability to solve complex games proved its potential to address AD challenges. However, model-free methods still suffer from safety-related issues that can be resolved using safe-DRL approaches. The addition of model-based safety filters to the learning-based algorithms provides safety bounds on their performance and constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we investigate the addition of a safety filter based on Model Predictive Control and show an increase in mean testing episode reward by 110% from -75 mean episode reward during testing for 50 episodes for Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to 7.758. We study the impacts of safety filters (7.758 mean reward), heuristic rules, bounded additive noises (0.49% performance increase comparing to noise-free case), and exploration (3.425 mean reward) on the learning algorithm. We compare the effects of filters in the context of simulated exploration and bounded exploration and prove that bounded exploration results in 9.86% increase in mean reward and 12.95% decrease in std comparing to the other method. Additionally, inspired by Deep Internal Learning and biological mechanisms like brain plasticity, we investigate the idea of using each sample for training only once instead of utilizing stochastic batches which increases the mean testing accumulated reward by 1.87% and leads to the best performance (7.942 mean reward and 0.048 std). Finally, the results demonstrate better automotive results for our proposed method than DDPG. Our proposed method, DDPG with safety filter in bounded exploration and adaptive learning under noisy input conditions, has a success rate of 100% under different traffic densities for the simulation environment used in this paper and our assumptions. The proposed method's automotive results are shown for a braking scenario to avoid collision with other road users.

AB Current methods that use Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms to inspect roads still have many limitations in practical applications, such as the lack of or difficulty in the route planning, the unbalanced utilization rate of the UAV swarm and the difficulty of the site selection for the distributed droneports. To solve the limitations, firstly, we construct the inspection map and remove the redundant information irrelevant to the road inspection. Secondly, we formulate both the route planning problem and the droneport site selection problem in a unified multi-objective optimization model. Thirdly, we redesign the encoding strategy, the updating rules and the decoding strategy of the particle swarm optimization method to effectively solve both the route planning problem and the droneport site selection problem. Finally, we introduce the comprehensive evaluation indicators to verify the effectiveness of the route planning and the droneport site selection. The experimental results show that (1) with the proposed method, the overlapped part of the optimized inspection routes is less than 7% of the total mileage, and the balanced utilization rate of the UAVs is above 75%; (2) the reuse rate of the distributed droneports is significantly improved after optimization; and (3) the proposed method outperforms the ant colony optimization (ACO) method in all evaluation indicators. To this end, the proposed method can effectively plan the inspection routes, balance the utilization of the UAVs and select the sites for the distributed droneports, which has great significance for a fully autonomous UAV swarm inspection system for road inspection.

AB Outdoor autonomous mobile robots heavily rely on GPS data for localization. However, GPS data can be erroneous and signals can be interrupted in highly urbanized areas or areas with incomplete satellite coverage, leading to localization deviations. In this paper, we propose a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system that combines the IESKF (Iterated Extended Kalman Filter) and a factor graph to address these issues. We perform IESKF filtering on LiDAR and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data at the front-end to achieve a more accurate estimation of local pose and incorporate the resulting laser inertial odometry into the back-end factor graph. Furthermore, we introduce a GPS signal filtering method based on GPS state and confidence to ensure that abnormal GPS data is not used in the back-end processing. In the back-end factor graph, we incorporate loop closure factors, IMU preintegration factors, and processed GPS factors. We conducted comparative experiments using the publicly available KITTI dataset and our own experimental platform to compare the proposed SLAM system with two commonly used SLAM systems: the filter-based SLAM system (FAST-LIO) and the graph optimization-based SLAM system (LIO-SAM). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SLAM system outperforms the other systems in terms of localization accuracy, especially in cases of GPS signal interruption.

   fusion; Contextual interaction
AB Sensor fusion is an important component of the perception system in autonomous driving, and the fusion of radar point cloud information and camera visual informa-tion can improve the perception capability of autonomous vehicles. However, most of the existing studies ignore the extraction of local neighborhood information and only consider shallow fusion between the two modalities based on the extracted global information, which cannot perform a deep fusion of cross-modal contextual informa-tion interaction. Meanwhile, in data preprocessing, the noise in radar data is usually only filtered by the depth information derived from image feature prediction, and such methods affect the accuracy of radar branching to generate regions of interest and cannot effectively filter out irrelevant information of radar points. This paper proposes the CenterTransFuser model that makes full use of millimeter-wave radar point cloud information and visual information to enable cross-modal fusion of the two heteroge-neous information. Specifically, a new interaction called cross-transformer is explored, which cooperatively exploits cross-modal cross-multiple attention and joint cross-mul-tiple attention to mine radar and image complementary information. Meanwhile, an adaptive depth thresholding filtering method is designed to reduce the noise of radar modality-independent information projected onto the image. The CenterTransFuser model is evaluated on the challenging nuScenes dataset, and it achieves excellent per-formance. Particularly, the detection accuracy is significantly improved for pedestrians, motorcycles, and bicycles, showing the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed model.

   control; probability and statistical methods
AB Gaussian processes (GPs) have been exploited for various applications even including online learning. To learn time-varying hyperparameters from an information-limited sparse data stream, we consider the infinite-horizon Gaussian process (IHGP) with a low computational complexity. For example, the IHGP framework could provide efficient GP online learning with a sparse data stream in mobile devices. However, we show that the originally proposed IHGP has difficulty in learning time-varying hyperparameters online from the sparse data stream due to the numerically approximated gradient of the marginal likelihood function. In this paper, we show how to extend the IHGP in order to learn time-varying hyperparameters using a sparse and non-stationary data stream. In particular, our solution approach offers the exact gradient as the solution of a Lyapunov equation. Therefore, our approach achieves better performance with a sparse data stream while still keeping the computational complexity low. Finally, we present the comparison results to demonstrate that our approach outperforms the originally proposed IHGP on practical applications with sparse data streams. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we consider a multi-rate sensor fusion or an interpolation problem where slow vision systems need to be combined with other fast sensory units for feedback control in the field of autonomous driving. In particular, we apply our approach to vehicle lateral position error estimation together with a deep learning model for autonomous driving using non-stationary lateral position error signals in a model-free and data-driven fashion.

AB Over 20 % of global crash fatalities involve pedestrians, but pedestrian crash causation and pedestrian protection systems have not been thoroughly developed or reliably tested. To understand the causation characteristics of pedestrian crashes, 398 pedestrian crashes were extracted from the China in-depth accident study (CIDAS), and most of these crashes were aggregated into five scenarios. The two scenarios with the highest proportion of crashes were analyzed by the driving reliability and error analysis method (DREAM) to identify high-risk causation patterns. From these patterns, three main contributing factors were identified: 1) extremely envi-ronmental light disturbance; 2) distracted driving caused by drivers' own thoughts; 3) drivers violating pedes-trian yield law. Based on these patterns and factors, a pedestrian protection system was designed. It consists of a forward vision sensor and radar to sense the environment and the three-stage autonomous emergency braking (AEB) algorithm to automatically avoid pedestrian collisions. Crash scenarios from CIDAS data were recreated in MATLAB Simulink to test the pedestrian protection system proposed in this study. This system was found to reduce pedestrian crashes by more than 90 %. The optimal parameters for three AEB stages were obtained, with decelerations of 0.2 g, 0.3 g, and 0.6 g. This study designed an active safety system based on causation analysis of the vehicle-pedestrian crashes and calibrated the AEB algorithm of it, thus providing reference and insight for further development of pedestrian protection systems.

AB An autonomous surface vehicle known as a wave glider, instrumented with a low-power towed hydrophone array and embedded digital signal processor, is demonstrated as a viable low-noise system for the passive acoustic monitoring of marine mammals. Other key design elements include high spatial resolution beamforming on a 32-channel towed hydrophone array, deep array deployment depth, vertical motion isolation, and bandwidth-efficient real-time acoustic data transmission. Using at-sea data collected during a simultaneous deployment of three wave glider-based acoustic detection systems near Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in September 2019, the capability of a low-frequency towed hydrophone array to spatially reject noise and to resolve baleen whale vocalizations from anthropogenic acoustic clutter is demonstrated. In particular, mean measured array gain of 15.3 dB at the aperture design frequency results in a post-beamformer signal-to-noise ratio that significantly exceeds that of a single hydrophone. Further, it is shown that with overlapping detections on multiple collaborating systems, precise localization of vocalizing individuals is achievable at long ranges. Last, model predictions showing a 4x detection range, or 16x area coverage, advantage of a 32-channel towed array over a single hydrophone against the North Atlantic right whale upcall are presented for the continental shelf environment south of Martha's Vineyard.

AB In multiagent learning, one of the main ways to improve learning performance is to ask for advice from another agent. Contemporary advising methods share a common limitation that a teacher agent can only advise a student agent if the teacher has experience with an identical state. However, in highly complex learning scenarios, such as autonomous driving, it is rare for two agents to experience exactly the same state, which makes the advice less of a learning aid and more of a one-time instruction. In these scenarios, with contemporary methods, agents do not really help each other learn, and the main outcome of their back and forth requests for advice is an exorbitant communications' overhead. In human interactions, teachers are often asked for advice on what to do in situations that students are personally unfamiliar with. In these, we generally draw from similar experiences to formulate advice. This inspired us to provide agents with the same ability when asked for advice on an unfamiliar state. Hence, we propose a model-based self-advising method that allows agents to train a model based on states similar to the state in question to inform its response. As a result, the advice given can not only be used to resolve the current dilemma but also many other similar situations that the student may come across in the future via self-advising. Compared with contemporary methods, our method brings a significant improvement in learning performance with much lower communication overheads.

AB Robotic solutions and technological advances for turf management demonstrated excellent results in terms of quality, energy, and time consumption. Two battery-powered autonomous mowers (2 WD and 4 WD) with random patterns were evaluated according to different trampling levels (control, low, medium, high) on a typical warm season turfgrass at the DAFE, University of Pisa, Italy. Data on the percentage of area mowed, the distance traveled, the number of passages, and the number of intersections were collected through RTK devices and processed by a custom-built software (1.8.0.0). The main quality parameters of the turfgrass were also analyzed by visual and instrumental assessments. Soil penetration resistance was measured through a digital penetrometer. The efficiency significantly decreased as the trampling level increased (from 0.29 to 0.11). The over-trampled areas were mainly detected by the edges (on average for the medium level: 18 passages for the edges vs. 14 in the central area). The trampling activity caused a reduction in turf height (from about 2.2 cm to about 1.5 cm). The energy consumption was low and varied from 0.0047 to 0.048 kWh per cutting session. Results from this trial demonstrated suitable quality for a residential turf of the Mediterranean area (NDVI values from 0.5 to 0.6), despite the over-trampling activity. Soil penetration data were low due to the reduced weight of the machines, but slightly higher for the 4 WD model (at 5 cm of depth, about 802 kPa vs. 670 kPa).

AB Fully formal verification of perception models is likely to remain challenging in the foreseeable future, and yet these models are being integrated into safety-critical control systems. We present a practical method for reasoning about the safety of such systems. Our method is based on systematically constructing approximations of perception models from system-level safety requirements, data, and program analysis of the modules that are downstream from perception. These approximations have some desirable properties like being low-dimensional, intelligible, and tractable. The closed-loop system, with the approximation substituting the actual perception model, is verified to be safe. Establishing the formal relationship between the actual and the approximate perception models remains well beyond available verification techniques. However, we do provide a useful empirical measure of their closeness called precision. Overall, our method can tradeoff the size of the approximation against precision. We apply the method to two significant case studies: 1) a vision-based lane tracking controller for an autonomous vehicle and 2) a controller for an agricultural robot. We show how the generated approximations for each system can be composed with the downstream modules and be verified using program analysis tools like CBMC. Detailed evaluations of the impacts of size, and the environmental parameters (e.g., lighting, road surface, and plant type) on the precision of the generated approximations suggest that the approach can be useful for realistic control systems.

AB Industrial control system (ICS) employs complex multistate protocols to realize high-reliability communication and intelligent control over automation equipment. ICS has been widely used in various embedded fields, such as autonomous vehicle systems, power automation systems, etc. However, in recent years, many attacks have been performed on ICS, especially its protocols, such as the hijacks over Jeep Uconnect and Tesla Autopilot autonomous systems, also the Stuxnet and DragonFly viruses over national infrastructures. It is important to guarantee the security of ICS protocols. In this article, we present Charon, an efficient fuzzing platform for the vulnerability detection of ICS protocol implementations. In Charon, we propose an innovative fuzzing strategy that leverages state guidance to maximize cross-state code coverage instead of focusing on isolated states during the fuzzing of ICS protocols. Moreover, we devise a novel feedback collection method that employs program status inferring to avoid the restart of the ICS protocol at each iteration, allowing for continuous fuzzing. We evaluate Charon on several popular ICS protocol implementations, including real-time publish subscribe, IEC61850-MMS, MQTT, etc. Compared with typical fuzzers, such as American fuzzy lop, Polar, AFLNET, Boofuzz, and Peach, it averagely improves branch coverage by 234.2%, 194.4%, 215.9%, 52.58%, and 35.18%, respectively. Moreover, it has already confirmed 21 previously unknown vulnerabilities (e.g., stack buffer overflow) among these ICS protocols, most of which are security critical and corresponding patches from vendors have been released accordingly.

AB Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) path planning is a crucial technology for achieving USV autonomous navigation. Under global path planning, dynamic local obstacle avoidance has become the primary focus for safe USV navigation. In this study, a USV autonomous dynamic obstacle avoidance method based on the enhanced velocity obstacle method is proposed in order to achieve path replanning. Through further analysis of obstacles, the obstacle geometric model set in the conventional velocity obstacle method was redefined. A special triangular obstacle geometric model was proposed to reconstruct the velocity obstacle region. The collision time was predicted by fitting the previously gathered data to the detected obstacle's distance, azimuth, and other relevant data. Then, it is combined with the collision risk to determine when obstacle avoidance should begin and end. In order to ensure safe driving between path points, the international maritime collision avoidance rules (COLREGs) are incorporated to ensure the accuracy of obstacle avoidance. Finally, through numerical simulations of various collision scenarios, it was determined that, under the assumption of ensuring a safe encounter distance, the maximum change rates of USV heading angle are optimized by 17.54%, 58.16%, and 28.63% when crossing, head-on, and overtaking, respectively. The results indicate that, by optimizing the heading angle, the enhanced velocity obstacle method can avoid the risk of ship rollover caused by an excessive heading angle during high-speed movement and achieve more accurate obstacle avoidance action in the event of a safety encounter.

AB In recent years, autonomous vehicle driving technology and advanced driver assistance systems have played a key role in improving road safety. However, weather conditions such as snow pose severe challenges for autonomous driving and are an active research area. Thanks to their superior reliability, the resilience of detection, and improved accuracy, advances in computation and sensor technology have paved the way for deep learning and neural network-based techniques that can replace the classical approaches. In this research, we investigate the semantic segmentation of roads in snowy environments. We propose a multi-modal fused RGB-T semantic segmentation utilizing a color (RGB) image and thermal map (T) as inputs for the network. This paper introduces a novel fusion module that combines the feature map from both inputs. We evaluate the proposed model on a new snow dataset that we collected and on other publicly available datasets. The segmentation results show that the proposed fused RGB-T input can segregate human subjects in snowy environments better than an RGB-only input. The fusion module plays a vital role in improving the efficiency of multiple input neural networks for person detection. Our results show that the proposed network can generate a higher success rate than other state-of-the-art networks. The combination of our fused module and pyramid supervision path generated the best results in both mean accuracy and mean intersection over union in every dataset.

ID CLASSIFICATION; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION
AB Finding high-value locations for in situ data collection is of substantial importance in ocean science, where diverse bio-physical processes interact to create dynamically evolving phenomena. These cover a variable spatial extent, and are sparse and difficult to predict. Autonomous robotic platforms can sustain themselves in harsh conditions with persistent presence, but require deployment at the correct place and time. To that end, we consider the use of remote sensing data for building compact models that can improve skill in predicting sub-mesoscale features and inform onboard sampling. The model enables prediction of regional patterns based on sparse in situ data, a capability that is essential in regions where use of satellite remote sensing in real time is often limited by cloud cover. Our model is based on classification of sea-surface temperature (SST) images, but the technique is general across any remotely sensed parameter. Images having similar magnitude and spatial patterns are grouped into a compact set of conditional means representing the dominant states. The classification is unsupervised and uses a combination of dictionary learning and hierarchical clustering. The method is demonstrated using SST images from Monterey Bay, California. The consistency of the classification result is verified and compared with oceanographic forcing using historical wind measurements. The established model is then shown to work in a real application using measurements from an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), together with forecast and sampling strategies. Finally an analysis of the model prediction error is presented and compared across different paths and survey duration.

AB Objective: This study explores the role of anticipation in motion sickness. We compared three conditions varying in motion predictability and assessed the effect of anticipation on subsequent illness ratings using a within-subjects design. Background: Anticipation is thought to play a role in motion sickness by reducing the discrepancy between sensed and expected sensory information. However, both the exact role and potential magnitude of anticipation on motion sickness are unknown. Method: Participants (N = 17) were exposed to three 15-min conditions consisting of repeated fore-aft motion on a sled on a 40-m rail (1) at constant intervals and consistent motion direction, (2) at constant intervals but varied motion direction, and (3) at varied intervals but consistent motion direction. Conditions were otherwise identical in motion intensity and displacement, as they were composed of the same repetitions of identical blocks of motion. Illness ratings were recorded at 1-min intervals using an 11-point motion sickness scale. Results: Average illness ratings after exposure were significantly lower for the predictable condition, compared with both the directionally unpredictable condition and the temporally unpredictable condition. Conclusion: Unpredictable motion is significantly more provocative compared with predictable motion. Findings suggest motion sickness results from a discrepancy between sensed and expected motion, rather than from unpreparedness to motion. Application: This study underlines the importance of an individual's anticipation to motion in motion sickness. Furthermore, this knowledge could be used in domains such as that of autonomous vehicles to reduce carsickness.

AB Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is a rapidly developing research direction that has significant applications in autonomous vehicles, remote sensing and other areas. Existing NLOS methods primarily depend on time-gated measurements and sophisticated signal processing to extract information from scattered light. Here we introduce a method that directly manipulates light to counter the wall's scattering. This method, termed unseen non-line-of-sight casted optical aperture visibility-enhanced return (UNCOVER) focusing, operates by actively focusing light onto the hidden target using wavefront shaping. By raster scanning that focus, we can actively image the hidden object. The focus thus formed is near diffraction limited and can be substantially smaller than the object itself, thereby enabling us to perform NLOS imaging with unprecedented resolution. We demonstrate that a resolution of similar to 0.6 mm at a distance of 0.55 m is achievable in UNCOVER, giving us a distance-to-resolution ratio of similar to 970.

AB Real-time object detection is a challenging but crucial task for autonomous underwater vehicles because of the complex underwater imaging environment. Resulted by suspended particles scattering and wavelength-dependent light attenuation, underwater images are always hazy and color-distorted. To overcome the difficulties caused by these problems to underwater object detection, an end-to-end CNN network combined U-Net and MobileNetV3-SSDLite is proposed. Furthermore, the FPGA implementation of various convolution in the proposed network is optimized based on the Winograd algorithm. An efficient upsampling engine is presented, and the FPGA implementation of squeeze-and-excitation module in MobileNetV3 is optimized. The accelerator is implemented on a Zynq XC7Z045 device running at 150 MHz and achieves 23.68 frames per second (fps) and 33.14 fps when using MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small as the feature extractor. Compared to CPU, our accelerator achieves 7.5x-8.7x speedup and 52x-60x energy efficiency.

AB Continuously detecting traffic signs in a video sequence is necessary for autonomous or assisted driving scenarios, since a vehicle needs the information from the signs to facilitate navigation. Single-image based traffic sign detector may fail in many cases, when the car moves fast on the road, resulting in motion blur, partial occlusion, and abrupt environmental change. In this paper, we propose an effective methodology, called detection-by-tracking, for robust traffic sign detection in videos, so as to improve the detection performance beyond a basic object detector. We explore the temporal cues among frames to help with the proposal reasoning for further regression. The correlations of spatial location and appearance similarity for the same sign in adjacent frames are considered in our approach. Experimental results show that the proposed detection-by-tracking mechanism is helpful, with improved detection performance to a large extent. Moreover, the idea of the detection-by-tracking can also be generalized to other scenarios for object detection tasks in videos.

AB Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) collaborate with humans to operate in diverse, safety-critical applications. However, assurance technologies need to be integrated into the design process in order to guarantee safe behavior, thereby enabling UAS operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). In this paper, formal methods are integrated with learning-enabled systems representations. The generation and representation of knowledge are captured via monadic second-order logic rules in the cognitive architecture Soar. These rules are translated into timed automata, and a proof of correctness for the translation is provided so that safety and liveness properties can be checked in the formal verification environment Uppaal. This approach is agnostic to the learning mechanism used to generate the learned rules (e.g., chunking, etc.). An example of a fault-tolerant, learning-enabled UAS deciding which of four contingency procedures to execute under a lost link scenario while overflying an urban area is used to illustrate the approach.

AB Inspired by the swarming behavior of male mosquitoes that aggregate to attract and subsequently pursue a female mosquito, we study how random swarming motion in autonomous vehicles affects the success of target capture. We consider the scenario in which multiple guardians with limited perceptual range and bounded acceleration are deployed to protect an area from an intruder. The main challenge for the guardian (male mosquito) is to quickly respond to a fast intruder (female) by matching its velocity. We focus on the motion strategy for the guardians before they perceive the intruder, which we call the swarming phase. In the parameter space consisting of the intruder's speed and guardians' ability (i.e., maximum acceleration and perceptual range) we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for target capture. We propose a swarming algorithm inspired by the behavior of male mosquitoes to improve the target-capture capability. The theoretical results are illustrated by experiments with an indoor quadrotor swarm.

ID SEMANTIC SLAM
AB Natural-language-based scene understanding can enable heterogeneous robots to cooperate efficiently in large and unconstructed environments. However, studies on symbolic planning rarely consider the semantic knowledge acquisition problem associated with the surrounding environments. Further, recent developments in deep learning methods show outstanding performance for semantic scene understanding using natural language. In this paper, a cooperation framework that connects deep learning techniques and a symbolic planner for heterogeneous robots is proposed. The framework is largely composed of the scene understanding engine, planning agent, and knowledge engine. We employ neural networks for natural-language-based scene understanding to share environmental information among robots. We then generate a sequence of actions for each robot using a planning domain definition language planner. JENA-TDB is used for knowledge acquisition storage. The proposed method is validated using simulation results obtained from one unmanned aerial and three ground vehicles.

AB This paper investigates cooperative trajectory planning of multiple unmanned combat aerial vehicles (multi-UCAV) in performing autonomous cooperative air-to-ground target attack missions. By integrating an approximate allowable attack region model, several constraint models, and a multicriterion objective function, the problem is formulated as a cooperative trajectory optimal control problem (CTOCP). Then, a virtual motion camouflage (VMC) for cooperative trajectory planning of multi-UCAV, combining with the differential flatness theory, Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM), and nonlinear programming, is designed to solve the CTOCP. In particular, the notion of the virtual time is introduced to the VMC problem formulation to handle the temporal cooperative constraints. The simulation experiments validate that the CTOCP can be effectively solved by the cooperative trajectory planning algorithm based on VMC which integrates the spatial and temporal constraints on the trajectory level, and the comparative experiments illustrate that VMC based algorithm is more efficient than GPM based direct collocation method in tackling the CTOCP.

AB The design of a prototype remote-controlled glacier-surveying robot, capable of taking accurate above- and below-water measurements of calving glacier fronts, using swath bathymetry and laser scanning hardware is presented. Data captured using the remote control system during field trials on the Lille Gletscher in western Greenland are informally compared with data captured using the same sensors from the same glacier using a much larger manned vessel during the same time period. The potential use of such a device during extended repeat survey missions is discussed and the implications in terms of both the improvement in data quality and the logistics in the field are also outlined. Future improvements to the robot and in particular the control system are described, as well as mechanical and electrical design considerations that became apparent during trials. The transition to a more autonomous system and the possibility of full autonomy are considered. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Model-based sea mine classification with synthetic aperture sonar

LA English
DT Article
AB The quality and effectiveness of sensor information provided by mine-hunting autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with high-resolution sonars has improved drastically in recent years. In parallel, data rates have significantly increased resulting in information overload. Automatic target recognition (ATR) is regarded as a solution for this problem. This study describes a specific ATR technique based on model matching for application to high-resolution data. A sonar model for generation of high-resolution synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images is described and applied both as database generator and classification. The performance of the model matching, which is attained by correlation and stochastically, is evaluated using a large data set covering the variety expected in mine-hunting operations. The model-based features generated in this way are able to reach an acceptable classification performance. The article is concluded with one real data example, which is easily classified when training with the simulated database. Further work is next aimed to confirm performance on real data.

DE Advanced driver assistance system; autonomous driving; map generation;
   digital map; lane graph
AB Lane-level digital maps are crucial to advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving, since they can simplify driving tasks and enhance system performance by providing strong priors about the driving environment. However, the high cost of current map generation systems prevents their benefits to normal commercial cars as they usually depend on specialized sensors and need great manual postprocessing. In this paper, a low-cost solution is proposed for automatic generation of a precise lane-level map by using conventional sensors that have been already installed in contemporary cars. It mainly consists of two modules, i.e., road orthographic image generation and lane graph construction. First, the global map is divided into fixed local segments based on the road network topology. With the reference of the local map segments, the bird's eye view images of the road surface are accumulated by fusing GPS, INS, and visual odometry and subsequently integrated into synthetic orthographic images. Next, the driving lane information is extracted from the road orthographic images and a large amount of vehicle trajectories. Such information is then used to construct a lane graph of the map based on the sophisticated lane models we proposed without manual processing. Experiments show promising results of the automatic map generation of the real-world roads, which substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Such a system can offer increased value and promote the automation level for today's commercial cars without being supplemented additional sensors.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have shown their remarkable effectiveness in learning navigation policy for the mobile robot navigating in a human crowded environment. Moreover, attention mechanisms coupled with DRL allows the robot to identify neighbors with different level of influence and incorporate them into the robot's decision. However, as the crowd density increases, attention mechanisms may fail to identify critical neighbors which can lead to significant drops in navigation efficiency. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by encoding both human-human and human-robot interaction using a special class of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) known as Message-Passing GCN (MP-GCN). In contrast to existing methods, where attention between robot and humans are encoded uniformly, the proposed approach named MP-GatedGCN-RL encodes asymmetric interactions using the combination of novel message-passing function and edge-wise gating mechanisms. We evaluate our approach on the simulated environments of ETH/UCY pedestrians datasets consisting of different scenarios like collision avoidance, group forming, diverging, crossing, and so on. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the conventional benchmark dynamic avoidance method ORCA with a 20.6% increase in success rate and a 9.1% reduction in navigation time. Moreover, we also achieve a 5.5% enhancement in success rate compared to other state-of-the-art DRL-based methods without any additional labeled expert data nor prior supervised learning.

LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous navigation; graph search; LiDAR; object segmentation;
   traversable ground segmentation
AB Perception of traversable regions and objects of interest from a 3D point cloud is one of the critical tasks in autonomous navigation. A ground vehicle needs to look for traversable terrains that are explorable by wheels. Then, to make safe navigation decisions, the segmentation of objects positioned on those terrains has to be followed up. However, over-segmentation and under-segmentation can negatively influence such navigation decisions. To that end, we propose TRAVEL, which performs traversable ground detection and object clustering simultaneously using the graph representation of a 3D point cloud. To segment the traversable ground, a point cloud is encoded into a graph structure, tri-grid field, which treats each tri-grid as a node. Then, the traversable regions are searched and redefined by examining local convexity and concavity of edges that connect nodes. On the other hand, our above-ground object segmentation employs a graph structure by representing a group of horizontally neighboring 3D points in a spherical-projection space as a node and vertical/horizontal relationship between nodes as an edge. Fully leveraging the node-edge structure, the above-ground segmentation ensures real-time operation and mitigates over-segmentation. Through experiments using simulations, urban scenes, and our own datasets, we have demonstrated that our proposed traversable ground segmentation algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the conventional metrics and that our newly proposed evaluation metrics are meaningful for assessing the above-ground segmentation.

AB IT technology and traditional industries have been combined recently, resulting in IT convergence technology in various fields. Through convergence with the automobile, pedestrian detection technology, in particular, is used in the autonomous navigation control service of autonomous vehicles and also applied in various fields such as intelligent CCTV and robot recognition technology. For pedestrian detection, hierarchical classification and feature vector were used in early stage, and deep learning is under active progress. However, since deep learning for pedestrian detection is time-consuming for processing a large volume of image data, it requires a lot of computing resources, and hence building such a system is very expensive. Therefore, in this paper we shall present a distributed deep learning platform which can easily build a cluster, and execute deep learning process in the distributed cloud environment, while achieving performance improvement in various ways. Our platform provides a convenient interface for easily and efficiently executing the deep learning process in a distributed environment by providing a multilayered system architecture. Our system builds and utilizes computing power in easy and efficient way by leveraging container technique, so-called OS-level virtualization, rather than traditional hypervisor-based virtualization. In our system, we improve the whole performance by exploiting both of data and parameter parallelisms at once and reduce the synchronization overhead by exploiting asynchronous communication for parameter updates. Also, we propose an efficient resource allocation scheme for parameter servers and slaves which can improve the performance from the experiment.

The traditional digital map cannot meet the automatic driving requirements, and it is very difficult for lane-level road maps (LRMs) to achieve a good balance between the representation accuracy and data storage volume. To tackle this problem, we obtain the recursive definition of a lane line by analyzing road lanes using the fractal geometry theory. Subsequently, we construct a recursive feedback system and model it. On this basis, an autonomous storage optimization LRM generation strategy based on cascaded NURBS is devised. According to the input data density, this framework generates an LRM with the minimum data storage volume within the error constraint. It is mainly composed of two modules: (1) a random fractal and (2) an adaptive iteration memory optimizer, based on cascaded NURBS error feedback. First, the whole lane is divided into several meta lane line modules. Second, data sampling/interpolation is carried out iteratively according to the NURBS fitting error and symmetry of road geometry. In this way, the storage space used to store lane lines and other information is automatically optimized. Last, a simulation experiment is carried out by using a dataset obtained from a park. The simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy and high storage efficiency. Under the constraint of a 0.1 m curve fitting error, the average memory demand of the lane line elements is less than 2.4 bytes/m.

ID QUALITY
AB Currently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered in the development of various applications in agriculture, which has led to the expansion of the agricultural UAV market. However, Nano Aerial Vehicles (NAVs) are still underutilised in agriculture. NAVs are characterised by a maximum wing length of 15 centimetres and a weight of fewer than 50 g. Due to their physical characteristics, NAVs have the advantage of being able to approach and perform tasks with more precision than conventional UAVs, making them suitable for precision agriculture. This work aims to contribute to an open-source solution known as Nano Aerial Bee (NAB) to enable further research and development on the use of NAVs in an agricultural context. The purpose of NAB is to mimic and assist bees in the context of pollination. We designed this open-source solution by taking into account the existing state-of-the-art solution and the requirements of pollination activities. This paper presents the relevant background and work carried out in this area by analysing papers on the topic of NAVs. The development of this prototype is rather complex given the interactions between the different hardware components and the need to achieve autonomous flight capable of pollination. We adequately describe and discuss these challenges in this work. Besides the open-source NAB solution, we train three different versions of YOLO (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOR) on an original dataset (Flower Detection Dataset) containing 206 images of a group of eight flowers and a public dataset (TensorFlow Flower Dataset), which must be annotated (TensorFlow Flower Detection Dataset). The results of the models trained on the Flower Detection Dataset are shown to be satisfactory, with YOLOv7 and YOLOR achieving the best performance, with 98% precision, 99% recall, and 98% F1 score. The performance of these models is evaluated using the TensorFlow Flower Detection Dataset to test their robustness. The three YOLO models are also trained on the TensorFlow Flower Detection Dataset to better understand the results. In this case, YOLOR is shown to obtain the most promising results, with 84% precision, 80% recall, and 82% F1 score. The results obtained using the Flower Detection Dataset are used for NAB guidance for the detection of the relative position in an image, which defines the NAB execute command.

ID GENERATION; MODEL
AB In this study, we propose a procedure for parameters setting of the motion control method to find the required state estimation accuracy. A lot of motion control methods have been proposed for automatic driving vehicles in recent years to reduce fuel consumption and drivers' mental load. Mode predictive control (MPC) method is one of the often-used control methods in motion control of automobiles. The technique to find the required state estimation accuracy is necessary to implement a motion control method. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, such a technique has not been presented in any literature before. Therefore, we proposed a parameter setting method to find the required state estimation accuracy, assuming a model-predictive-type motion control method designed based on an optimal control problem. The contributions of this work are as follows: (1) A specific procedure to set the control parameters is proposed. (2) To overcome the difficulty of the parameter setting problem, we divide the control parameters into two sets. The first set of parameters are unrelated to the robustness against state estimation errors, while the others are related. (3) The parameters in the first set are designed independently of the others, so that parameter setting can be easily accomplished. The parameters in the first set are designed to obtain desirable motion of the ego vehicles ignoring the errors. The other parameters are set to find the required state estimation accuracy. (4) The parameter tuning problem and the specification of the state estimation accuracy is considered together. As a result, once the control parameters are determined, the required state estimation accuracy is specified. As an example, a robust motion control method based on MPC for merging scenario was considered. Calculations for some cases were conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. The results showed that, if the estimation errors in the displacements of the vehicles are bounded in [- 1, 1][m]and that in the velocities are bounded in [- 1/30, 1/30][m/s], desirable motion control is possible for all the tested initial conditions.

AB Motion planning with visual perception is a hot topic for autonomous flight of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). However, many existing works fail to be implemented in realistic scenarios in real time due to practical constraints, such as the limited field of view (FOV) of the onboard camera and the limited computational capability. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed approach solves the optimization of motion and perception at the same time. A sampling-based model-predictive control framework is explored as a local planner to generate trajectories, which are dynamically feasible and collision-free with limited perception. The sampling-based local planning framework is extended to two independent scenarios for MAVs: 1) planning safe trajectories with limited FOV constraint and 2) planning trajectories with effective perception of the point of interest. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both simulation and real-flight experiments.

AB The task sequence planning problem (TSPP) is one of the most significant combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we formulate the TSPP and prove that the optimal task sequence planning problem (OTSPP) is NP-complete based on the graph theory. We incorporate the idea of topological sorting into the solution and propose the exact method, named all topology sort minimum distance (ATS-MD). Given the shortcomings of the ATS-MD, the time complexity is very high. We use the idea of dynamic programming to reduce the search range of the algorithm and propose the dynamic programming based on topological relationship algorithm (DP-TR). However, both ATS-MD and DP-TR are unable to cope with largescale OTSPP. We present a hybrid genetic algorithm, genetic algorithm based on topological relationship (GA-TR), which can give an approximate solution to the large-scale OTSPP in a feasible time. The results of numerical experiments prove the validity of the three algorithms.

AB Ship berthing operations in restricted waters such as ports requires the accurate use of onboard-vessel equipment such as rudder, thrusters, and main propulsions. For big ships, the assistance of exterior supports such as tugboats are necessary, however with the advancement of technology, we may hypothesize that the use of artificial intelligence to support ship berthing safely at ports without the dependency on the tugboats may be a reality. In this paper we comprehensively assessed and analyzed several literatures regarding this topic. Through this review, we seek out to present a better understanding of the use of artificial intelligence in ship berthing especially neural networks and collision avoidance algorithms. We discovered that the use of global and local path planning combined with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) may help to achieve collision avoidance while completing ship berthing operations.

AB Nanomaterials have been widely used in cancer treatment and have achieved remarkable results. However, the specificity of the tumor microenvironment and a series of biological barriers (such as blood flow, cell membrane, dense tissue, etc.) have caused many obstacles faced by nanomaterials after entering the human body, which makes traditional drug delivery vehicles have insurmountable difficulties, such as low delivery efficiency, poor permeability, etc. The micro/nanomotors with autonomous movement capabilities provide the possibility to solve the above problems. Therefore, this review summarizes the current researches of micro/nanomotors strategies to overcome the different biological barriers of nanomaterials in cancer treatment. The advantages and disadvantages of three typical micro/nanomotors (biological, physical and chemical micro/nanomotors) in cancer treatment are summarized separately, and the future design of micro/nanomotors more suitable for tumor environment was discussed.

AB Trust is essential in shaping human interactions with one another and with robots. In this article we investigate how human trust in robot capabilities transfers across multiple tasks. We present a human-subject study of two distinct task domains: a Fetch robot performing household tasks and a virtual reality simulation of an autonomous vehicle performing driving and parking maneuvers. The findings expand our understanding of trust and provide new predictive models of trust evolution and transfer via latent task representations: a rational Bayes model, a data-driven neural network model, and a hybrid model that combines the two. Experiments show that the proposed models outperform prevailing models when predicting trust over unseen tasks and users. These results suggest that (i) task-dependent functional trust models capture human trust in robot capabilities more accurately and (ii) trust transfer across tasks can be inferred to a good degree. The latter enables trust-mediated robot decision-making for fluent human-robot interaction in multi-task settings.

TI UAV Robust Strategy Control Based on MAS
SO ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB A novel multiagent system (MAS) has been proposed to integrate individual UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) to form a UAV team which can accomplish complex missions with better efficiency and effect. The MAS based UAV team control is more able to conquer dynamic situations and enhance the performance of any single UAV. In this paper, the MAS proposed and established combines the reacting and thinking abilities to be an initiative and autonomous hybrid system which can solve missions involving coordinated flight and cooperative operation. The MAS uses BDI model to support its logical perception and to classify the different missions; then the missions will be allocated by utilizing auction mechanism after analyzing dynamic parameters. Prim potential algorithm, particle swarm algorithm, and reallocation mechanism are proposed to realize the rational decomposing and optimal allocation in order to reach the maximum profit. After simulation, the MAS has been proved to be able to promote the success ratio and raise the robustness, while realizing feasibility of coordinated flight and optimality of cooperative mission.

TI Search Algorithm for Teams of Heterogeneous Agents with Coverage

SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION

DT Article
AB Among common intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance tasks, searching for a target in a complex environment is a problem for which autonomous systems are well suited. This work considers the problem of searching for targets using a team of heterogeneous agents. The system maintains a grid-based world model which contains information about the probability that a target is located in a given cell of the map. Agents formulate control decisions for a fixed number of time steps using a modular algorithm that allows parameterizations of agent capabilities. This paper investigates a solution that guarantees total map coverage. The control law for each agent does not require explicit knowledge of other agents. This yields a system which is scalable to a large number of vehicles. The resulting search patterns guarantee an exhaustive search of the map in the sense that all cells will be searched sufficiently to ensure that the probability of a target going unnoticed is driven to zero. Modifications to this algorithm for explicit cooperation between agents is also investigated.

AB In this paper, a new predictive approach is proposed for the impedance control of bilateral drive-by-wire teleoperation systems. The proposed control structure includes two mirror predictors/observers in both the master and slave sides. These predictors/observers are used to simultaneously estimate the master and slave internal dynamics, and thereby to avoid the use of the delayed transmitted information. As a consequence, the influence of the delay on the whole system can be minimized and the performance can be improved. Under a set of suited hypotheses, the proposed control structure is shown to be uniformly ultimate stable, even in the presence of time-varying delays. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The behavior of the control structure is also experimentally demonstrated while performing remote steering of a small autonomous vehicle.

AB Measurements of the vertical distribution of aerosol properties provide essential information for generating more accurate model estimates of radiative forcing and atmospheric heating rates compared with employing remotely sensed column averaged properties. A month long campaign over the Indian Ocean during March 2006 investigated the interaction of aerosol, clouds, and radiative effects. Routine vertical profiles of aerosol and water vapor were determined using autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with miniaturized instruments. Comparisons of these airborne instruments with established ground-based instruments and in aircraft-to-aircraft comparisons demonstrated an agreement within 10%.
   Aerosol absorption optical depths measured directly using the unmanned aircraft differed from columnar AERONET sun-photometer results by only 20%. Measurements of total particle concentration, particle size distributions, aerosol absorption and black carbon concentrations are presented along with the trade wind thermodynamic structure from the surface to 3000 m above sea level. Early March revealed a well-mixed layer up to the cloud base at 500 m above mean sea level (m a.s.l.), followed by a decrease of aerosol concentrations with altitude. The second half of March saw the arrival of a high altitude plume existing above the mixed layer that originated from a continental source and increased aerosol concentrations by more than tenfold, yet the surface air mass showed little change in aerosol concentrations and was still predominantly influenced by marine sources. Black carbon concentrations at 1500 m above sea level increased from 70 ng/m(3) to more than 800 ng/m(3) with the arrival of this polluted plume. The absorption aerosol optical depth increased from as low as 0.005 to as much as 0.035 over the same period. The spectral dependence of the aerosol absorption revealed an absorption Angstrom exponent of 1.0, which is typical of an aerosol with most of its absorption attributed to black carbon and generally indicates the absorbing component originated from fossil fuel sources and other high-temperature combustion sources. The results indicate that surface measurements do not represent the aerosol properties within the elevated layers, especially if these layers are influenced by long range transport.

AB The first/last mile is a long known deterrent to public transportation use, yet difficult to solve with fixed route transit. Many transit agencies are exploring partnerships with ridesourcing companies to offer subsidized feeder services. Ridership, however, has been surprisingly low. We explore two conceptual explanations. First, ridesourcing fares are found to exceed travel time savings for all distances below 1 mile and annual household incomes below USD 30,000 (i.e., the majority of US bus-using households). Subsidies are thus necessary, yet common schemes (flat fees, flat value or percentage discounts) are inequitable as they particularly benefit high-income households (thus miss their main target group). Second, the disutility of the additional transfer ('transfer penalty') and wait times exceed travel time savings assuming modest values for all distances below 0.45 miles. Subsidized ridesourcing for the first/last mile is thus not the panacea often portrayed, particularly not for short first/last miles. Where first/last miles are longer, investments in first/last mile services only might miss their purpose as the private car often remains the faster, more convenient and cheaper option. A much more holistic set of policy changes is hence required. Where transit agencies decide to proceed with first/last mile subsidies, they are advised to integrate them into existing fares (offering first/last mile rides for free) as this is the most equitable approach.

AB Multiple mobile robots have gradually played a key role in many industrial systems, such as factory freight logistics system, patrol security in the factory environment, and multirobot collaborative service and work. As a key issue in industrial environment perception, the accurate robot localization can enhance their autonomous ability and is an important branch of robotic studies in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a new method for cooperative autonomous localization among air-ground robots in a wide-ranging outdoor industrial environment. The aerial robot first maps an area of interest and achieves self-localization. Then the aerial robot transfers a simplified orthogonal perspective 2.5-D map to the ground robots for collaboration. Within the collaboration, the ground robot achieves pose estimation with respect to the unmanned aerial vehicle pose by instantaneously registering a single panorama with respect to the 2.5-D map. The 2.5-D map is used as the spatial association among air-ground robots. The ground robots estimate the orientation using automatically detected geometric information and generates the translation by aligning the 2.5-D map with a semantic segmentation of the panorama. Our method effectively overcomes the dramatic differences between the air-level view and the ground-level view. A set of experiments is performed in the outdoor industrial environment to demonstrate the applicability of our localization method. The proposed robotic collaborative localization outperforms most consumer sensor in accuracy and also has an outstanding running time.

AB Underwater robot positioning and navigation achieve autonomous underwater robot movement based on the premise that positioning obtains the coordinates of the relative position of the underwater robot using a sensor, and navigation yields a known location to the destination path planning. Due to the location of an underwater robot and the complex and changing environment in which it operates, it is difficult to achieve precise positioning using the traditional positioning method. This paper systematically analyzes and summarizes several typical localization and navigation methods of underwater robots, such as multisensor information fusion technology, underwater acoustic localization and navigation methods, GPS buoy, underwater vision, SLAM and coordinate localization and navigation of multiple underwater robots. Multisensory information fusion technology integrates the advantages of the above methods, enhances the system stability and robustness, overcomes the disadvantages of traditional positioning and navigation, and enables the autonomous navigation and positioning of underwater robots. Underwater acoustics enable flexible and convenient positioning, whereas GPS can achieve high-precision and high-positioning navigation information, and visual positioning effectively overcomes the problem of error accumulation. Multirobot cooperative positioning resolves the problem of positioning failure caused by the collapse of a single system and completes complex tasks that cannot be completed by a single robot, thus enhancing the stability and robustness of the system. This paper systematically describes the realization of these methods, presents an actual analysis of their respective advantages and problems, and discusses the development of the field of research prospects and application prospects.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have rapidly developed in the last few decades due to their autonomous properties in the investigation of an underwater environment. The goal of this paper is to develop a power efficient formation control for the cooperative motion of AUVs with a support vessel as a leader. In this paper, a kinematic algorithm for the joint motion of an AUV with a support vessel was developed and that algorithm was expanded for the formation of AUVs. The AUV yaw, surge and sway control loops were designed for that purpose. The complexing navigation system structure for the AUV was also developed. Simulation results demonstrated efficiency of the proposed kinematic algorithm for the joint motion of AUVs. Also, influence of lateral ocean current was considered. After development of the centralized leader-follower formation control for the group of AUVs with a support vessel as a leader, we optimized a formation configuration in terms of power efficiency. Drag forces caused by AUV motion in the water can significantly influence power consumption. We investigated the relationship between the AUV's formation configuration, underwater coverage efficiency, communication quality and power consumption. As a result of research, we proposed a power efficient formation configuration for typical underwater operations. As a result, the effect of the AUV formation configuration on the power consumption was investigated and a trade-off solution for the optimal AUV positions in formation with minimal energy consumption, high coverage efficiency and small communication power consumption was derived.

AB This paper proposes a 3D object recognition method for non-coloured point clouds using point features. The method is intended for application scenarios such as Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (IMR) of industrial sub-sea structures composed of pipes and connecting objects (such as valves, elbows and R-Tee connectors). The recognition algorithm uses a database of partial views of the objects, stored as point clouds, which is available a priori. The recognition pipeline has 5 stages: (1) Plane segmentation, (2) Pipe detection, (3) Semantic Object-segmentation and detection, (4) Feature based Object Recognition and (5) Bayesian estimation. To apply the Bayesian estimation, an object tracking method based on a new Interdistance Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound (IJCBB) algorithm is proposed. The paper studies the recognition performance depending on: (1) the point feature descriptor used, (2) the use (or not) of Bayesian estimation and (3) the inclusion of semantic information about the objects connections. The methods are tested using an experimental dataset containing laser scans and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation data. The best results are obtained using the Clustered Viewpoint Feature Histogram (CVFH) descriptor, achieving recognition rates of 51.2%, 68.6% and 90%, respectively, clearly showing the advantages of using the Bayesian estimation (18% increase) and the inclusion of semantic information (21% further increase).

DE Generative networks; Sim -to -real translation; Autonomous navigation;
   Unmanned surface vessels
AB Recent advances in robotics and autonomous systems (RAS) have significantly improved the autonomy level of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and made them capable of undertaking demanding tasks in various environments. During the operation of USVs, apart from normal situations, it is those unexpected scenes, such as busy waterways or navigation in dust/nighttime, impose most dangers to USVs as these scenes are rarely seen during training. Such a rare occurrence also makes the manual collection and recording of these scenes into dataset difficult, expensive and inefficient, with the majority of existing public available datasets not able to fully cover them. One of many plausible solutions is to purposely generate these data using computer vision techniques with the assistance from high-fidelity simulations that can create various desirable motions/scenarios. However, the stylistic difference between the simulation images and the natural images would cause a domain shift problem. Hence, there is a need for designing a method that can transfer the data distribution and styles of the simulation images into the realistic domain. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel solution to fill this gap using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based model, ShipGAN, to translate the simulation images into realistic images. Experiments were carried out to investigate the feasibility of generating realistic images using GAN-based image translation models. The synthetic realistic images from the simulation images were demonstrated to be reliable by the object detection and image segmentation algorithms trained with natural images.

AB Point cloud-based object detection is vital and essential for many real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and robot vision. The PointPillars model has achieved the efficient detection of objects in front of a vehicle. However, the algorithm does not consider the spatial structures semantic information stored in the threedimensional point cloud for a given spatial structure, thus leading to missed or false detections for objects with complex spatial structures or singular structures. We propose an approach based on PointPillars, which considers the spatial structure characteristics of 3D point clouds to enhance the detection accuracy. First, based on the specified range of the z-axis coordinates, the entire point cloud scene is divided into several layers so that the point cloud areas in the same height interval form one layer. Data from several layers are obtained. Second, the point clouds of several layers are processed with Pillar Feature Net to obtain several pseudoimages. Each pseudoimage represents the semantic information from the corresponding level of the point cloud. Third, the obtained pseudoimages from each level are merged with the pseudoimages of the entire scene to obtain a feature map with spatial structure characteristics. We apply a Region Proposal Network, and an object detection operator processes the feature map and obtains the result of object detection. Experiments show that the proposed method has a highly accurate detection effect for objects with complex spatial structures. In addition, the proposed method does not erroneously detect objects with similar semantic information after vertical dimension projection.

AB Deep neural network is the main research branch in artificial intelligence and suitable for many decision-making fields. Autonomous driving and unmanned vehicle often depend on deep neural networks for accurate and reli-able detection, classification, and ranging of surrounding objects in real on-road environments, either locally or by swarm intelligence among distributed nodes via 5G channel. But, it has been demonstrated that deep neural networks are vulnerable to well-designed adversarial examples that are imperceptible to human eyes in computer vision tasks. It is valuable to study the vulnerability for enhancing the robustness of neural networks. However, existing adversarial examples against object detection models are image-dependent, so in this paper, we imple-ment adversarial attacks against object detection models using universal perturbations. We find the cross-task, cross-model, and cross-dataset transferability of universal perturbations, we train universal perturbations genera-tor firstly and then add the universal perturbations to the target images in two ways: resizing and pile-up, in order to solve the problem that universal perturbations cannot be directly applied to attack object detection models. We use the transferability of universal perturbations to attack black-box object detection models. In this way, the time cost of generating adversarial examples is reduced. A series of experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrating the feasibility of cross-task attacks and proving the effectiveness of our attack on two representative object detectors: regression-based models like YOLOv3 and proposal-based models like Faster R-CNN.

AB Computer vision remains challenged by tracking multiple objects in motion frames, despite efforts to improve surveillance, healthcare, and human-machine interaction. This paper presents a method for monitoring several moving objects in non-stationary settings for autonomous navigation. Additionally, at each phase, movement information between successive frames, including the new frame and the previous frame, is employed to determine the location of moving objects inside the camera's field of view, and the background in the new frame is determined. With the help of a matching algorithm, the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker for each frame is determined. To get the new frame, we access the matching feature points between two subsequent frames, calculate the movement size of the feature points and the camera movement, and subtract the previous frame of moving objects from the current frame. Every moving object within the camera's field of view is captured at every moment and location. The moving items are categorized and segregated using fuzzy logic based on their mass center and length-to-width ratio. Our algorithm was implemented to investigate autonomous navigation surveillance of three types of moving objects, such as a vehicle, a pedestrian, a bicycle, or a motorcycle. The results indicate high accuracy and an acceptable time requirement for monitoring moving objects. It has a tracking and classification accuracy of around 75 % and processes 43 frames per second, making it superior to existing approaches in terms of speed and accuracy.

AB A great number of collision accidents can be attributed to incongruous collision-avoidance actions between the give-way vessel and the stand-on vessel in a crossing or overtaking situation. If the give-way vessel does not take appropriate collision-avoidance action according to international regulations for preventing collisions at sea, the last barrier to pass safely is the appropriate and effective collision-avoidance action taken by the stand-on vessel. To find the proper autonomous collision-avoidance action of the stand-on vessel, a method is proposed that combines quantitative analysis rules of collision-avoidance with the deduction of nonlinear maneuvering motion process based on the mathematical model group, which conformity can reach 90%. This research presents a method to calculate the timing and most effective collision-avoidance actions for the stand-on vessel based on the four-stage theory of encountering vessels and the characteristics of vessel motion. The accuracy of the latest-action timing and the action amplitude for the stand-on vessel can be increased to the level of second and degree, respectively. A novel model of collision risk index is constructed by the latest time of the feasible collision-avoidance action on the precise of different course-altering amplitude. Methods to find the stand-on vessel's proper collision-avoidance actions in the open sea are presented. The simulation indicates the proposed method for the stand-on vessel can make correct collision-avoidance decisions autonomously.

AB The work presented in this article focuses on the use of embodied neural networks - developed through Evolutionary Robotics and Multi-Agent Systems methodologies - as autonomous distributed controllers for Micro-unmanned Aerial Vehicle (MAV) teams. The main aim of the research is to extend the range of domains that could be successfully tackled by the Evolutionary Robotics approach. The flying robots realm is an area that has not been yet thoroughly investigated by this discipline. This is due to the lack of an affordable and reliable robotic platform to use for carrying out experiments, and to the difficulty and the high computational load involved in experiments based upon a realistic software simulator for aircraft. We believe that the most recent improvements to the state of the art now permit the investigation of this domain. For demonstrating this point, two different evolutionary computer simulation models are presented in this article. The first model, which uses a simplified 2D test environment, has resulted in controllers evolved with the following capabilities: (1) navigation through unknown environments, (2) obstacle-avoidance, (3) tracking of a movable target, and (4) execution of cooperative and coordinated behaviors based on implicit communication strategies. In order to improve the robustness of these results and their potential use in real MAV teams, a more sophisticated 3D model is presented herein. The results obtained so far using the two models demonstrate the feasibility of the chosen approach for further research on the design of autonomous controllers for MAVs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Visual navigation is a challenging issue in automated robot control, In many robot applications, like object manipulation in hazardous environments or autonomous locomotion, it is necessary to automatically detect and avoid obstacles while planning a safe trajectory, In this context the detection of corridors of free space along the robot trajectory is a very important capability which requires nontrivial visual processing. In most cases it is possible to take advantage of the active control of the cameras.
   In this paper we propose a cooperative schema in which motion and stereo vision are used to infer scene structure and determine free space areas. Binocular disparity, computed on several stereo images over time, is combined with optical flow from the same sequence to obtain a relative-depth map of the scene, Both the time-to-impact and depth scaled by the distance of the camera from the fixation point in space are considered as good, relative measurements which are based on the viewer, but centered on the environment.
   The need for calibrated parameters is considerably reduced by using an active control strategy. The cameras track a point in space independently of the robot motion and the full rotation of the head, which includes the unknown robot motion, is derived from binocular image data.
   The feasibility of the approach in real robotic applications is demonstrated by several experiments performed on real image data acquired from an autonomous vehicle and a prototype camera head.

AB Benthic imagery is an effective tool for quantitative description of ecologically and economically important benthic habitats and biota. The recent development of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) allows surveying of spatial scales that were previously unfeasible. However, an AUV collects a large number of images, the scoring of which is time and labour intensive. There is a need to optimise the way that subsamples of imagery are chosen and scored to gain meaningful inferences for ecological monitoring studies. We examine the trade-off between the number of images selected within transects and the number of random points scored within images on the percent cover of target biota, the typical output of such monitoring programs. We also investigate the efficacy of various image selection approaches, such as systematic or random, on the bias and precision of cover estimates. We use simulated biotas that have varying size, abundance and distributional patterns. We find that a relatively small sampling effort is required to minimise bias. An increased precision for groups that are likely to be the focus of monitoring programs is best gained through increasing the number of images sampled rather than the number of points scored within images. For rare species, sampling using point count approaches is unlikely to provide sufficient precision, and alternative sampling approaches may need to be employed. The approach by which images are selected (simple random sampling, regularly spaced etc.) had no discernible effect on mean and variance estimates, regardless of the distributional pattern of biota. Field validation of our findings is provided through Monte Carlo resampling analysis of a previously scored benthic survey from temperate waters. We show that point count sampling approaches are capable of providing relatively precise cover estimates for candidate groups that are not overly rare. The amount of sampling required, in terms of both the number of images and number of points, varies with the abundance, size and distributional pattern of target biota. Therefore, we advocate either the incorporation of prior knowledge or the use of baseline surveys to establish key properties of intended target biota in the initial stages of monitoring programs.

AB Anticipating the motion of all humans in dynamic environments such as homes and offices is critical to enable safe and effective robot navigation. Such spaces remain challenging as humans do not follow strict rules of motion and there are often multiple occluded entry points such as corners and doors that create opportunities for sudden encounters. In this work, we present a Transformer based architecture to predict human future trajectories in human-centric environments from input features including human positions, head orientations, and 3D skeletal keypoints from onboard in-the-wild sensory information. The resulting model captures the inherent uncertainty for future human trajectory prediction and achieves state-of-the-art performance on common prediction benchmarks and a human tracking dataset captured from a mobile robot adapted for the prediction task. Furthermore, we identify new agents with limited historical data as a major contributor to error and demonstrate the complementary nature of 3D skeletal poses in reducing prediction error in such challenging scenarios.

AB This study investigates a method of implementing virtual IR images, similar to the IR images of actual objects, on a transparent and flexible substrate. Virtual IR images/videos can be implemented by irradiating the near-infrared-to-long-wave IR (NIR-to-LWIR) conversion film that can emit LWIR after absorbing NIR and quickly converting it to heat energy. Furthermore, IR images/videos that have shapes and colors similar to actual objects can be formed by adjusting the intensity of the LWIR emitted from the NIR-to-LWIR conversion film. This IR image implementation technology is expected to be applicable to advanced camouflage technology-technology that can hide objects or cause them to be perceived as different objects-as well as the implementation of a virtual IR environment that can be used to verify the performance of IR cameras and IR search and tracking systems for artificial intelligence robots, autonomous vehicles, and combat equipment.

AB In this work, we present a methodology to compute an artificial time-varying vector field in $n$ dimensions that defines trajectories that converge to and follow a given desired curve. The Euclidean distance function is used to construct the field, which is easily computed from a parametric representation of the curve. The computation of the time feedforward term to compensate for time dependence is such that its norm is limited by the maximum velocity of the curve. This fact allows the normalization of the time-varying vector field such that it has a constant norm without any negative effect for convergence. We present convergence proofs for the proposed normalized time-varying vector field and demonstrate the existence of ultimate bounds in the case bounded disturbances are present. Finally, we show several simulations and experiments with an actual quadrotor to validate our methodology.

AB Manoeuvrability is one of the essential keys in the development of improved autonomous underwater vehicles for challenging missions. In the last years, more researches were dedicated to the development of new hulls shapes and thrusters to assure more manoeuvrability. The present review explores various enabling technologies used to implement the vectorial thrusters (VT), based on water-jet or propellers. The proposals are analysed in terms of added degrees of freedom, mechanisms, number of necessary actuators, water-tightness, electromagnetomechanical complexity, feasibility, etc. The usage of magnetic coupling thrusters (conventional or reconfigurable) is analysed in details since they can assure the development of competitive full waterproof reconfigurable thrusters, which is a frictionless, flexible, safe, and low-maintenance solution. The current limitations (as for instance the use of non conductive hull) are discussed and ideas are proposed for the improvement of this new generation of underwater thrusters, as extending the magnetic coupling usage to obtain a fully contactless vector thrust transmission.

AB Deep reinforcement learning using convolutional neural networks is the technology behind autonomous vehicles. Could this same technology facilitate the road to college? During the summer between high school and college, college-related tasks that students must navigate can hinder successful matriculation. We employ conversational artificial intelligence (AI) to efficiently support thousands of would-be college freshmen by providing personalized, text message based outreach and guidance for each task where they needed support. We implemented and tested this system through a field experiment with Georgia State University (GSU). GSU-committed students assigned to treatment exhibited greater success with pre-enrollment requirements and were 3.3 percentage points more likely to enroll on time. Enrollment impacts are comparable to those in prior interventions but with substantially reduced burden on university staff Given the capacity for AI to learn over time, this intervention has promise for scaling personalized college transition guidance.

AB Hair cells are ubiquitous in nature. These natural and efficient mechanoreceptors are exploited as efficient transducers for flow sensing and chemical sensing in many living systems, ranging from cells to aquatic animals. In aquatic environment hair cells are probably the most effective mechanism of sensing and environment perception. Mimicking these mechanoreceptors and their structure and behavior for developing MEMS artificial hair cells (AHC) could be a powerful approach for producing efficient underwater sensors and technologies. In this paper we review the most recent approaches and designs to realize waterproof hair cell-like mechanotransducers for applications in underwater flow and acoustic sensing, mimicking the so-called "lateral line" in fishes. Recent developments for the achievement of artificial lateral lines to be applied in underwater autonomous vehicles will be highlighted. Finally research strategies to obtain artificial hair cells biosensing in liquid environment will be introduced. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Parallel-Snake with Balloon Force for Lane Detection
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE lane detection; parallel-snake; planar homography
AB Lane detection plays an important role in Driver Assistance Systems and Autonomous Vehicle System. In this paper, we propose a parallel-snake model combined with balloon force for lane detection. Parallel-snake is defined as two open active contours with parallel constrain. The lane boundaries on the left and right sides are assumed as parallel curves, parallel-snake is deformed to estimate these two boundaries. As lane regions between left and right boundaries usually have low gradient, snake will lose external force on these regions. Furthermore, inspired by balloon active contour model, the balloon force is introduced into parallel-snake to expand two parallel curves from center of road to the left and right lane boundaries. Different from closed active contour, stretching force is adopted to prevent the head and tail of snake from converging together. The experimental results on three different datasets show that parallel-snake model can work well on images with shadows and handle the lane with broken boundaries as the parallel property.

AB A fleet of autonomous ground vehicles (AGV) is envisioned to expand farming to arable land suitable for production except for being too steep for conventional equipment. The success of proposed multi-AGV system largely depends on the traction performance of the individual AGVs on unevenly sloped terrain and optimization of the AGVs control variables. Therefore, the drawbar pull performance of a prototype AGV was evaluated in a soil bin at varying slopes, speeds, and drawbar pull (DP). The AGV's traction performance was expressed in three metrics: tractive efficiency (TE), travel reduction ratio (TRR), and power number (PN). Optimizing the control variables is intricate and ill-defined, which requires an accurate model to predict the performance of the proposed multi-AGV system. Hence, this study aims to design an artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the traction behavior of the AGV on a sloped testbed as a function of AGV's speed, applied DP, and slope. A multi layer perceptron feed-forward ANN architecture with a single hidden layer trained with a back-propagation algorithm was adopted. A series of ANN models with increasing complexity and different hidden layer activation functions were developed for each response variable, i.e., ANN-TE, ANN-TRR, and ANN-PN. A re-sampling based method, K-fold cross-validation, was employed to estimate the model generalization error. The model success was evaluated via Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) against a test set. The final predictive model was trained on the entire data set, and the observed R-2 was 0.933, 0.882 and 0.858, respectively, for ANN-TE, ANN-TRR, and ANN-PN. Subsequently, a Monte-Carlo Simulation based uncertainty analysis was carried out to demonstrate the model strength and the degree of uncertainty by constructing a 95% prediction interval. This study shows ANN as a promising, robust, and reliable method to predict traction performance in agricultural tillage-traction studies and developed models can empower the multi-AGV system on steep-uneven slope terrain.

AB Recent advances in autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increased their use in remote sensing applications, such as precision agriculture, biosecurity, disaster monitoring, and surveillance. However, onboard UAV cognition capabilities for understanding and interacting in environments with imprecise or partial observations, for objects of interest within complex scenes, are limited, and have not yet been fully investigated. This limitation of onboard decision-making under uncertainty has delegated the motion planning strategy in complex environments to human pilots, which rely on communication subsystems and real-time telemetry from ground control stations. This paper presents a UAV-based autonomous motion planning and object finding system under uncertainty and partial observability in outdoor environments. The proposed system architecture follows a modular design, which allocates most of the computationally intensive tasks to a companion computer onboard the UAV to achieve high-fidelity results in simulated environments. We demonstrate the system with a search and rescue (SAR) case study, where a lost person (victim) in bushland needs to be found using a sub-2 kg quadrotor UAV. The navigation problem is mathematically formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). A motion strategy (or policy) is obtained once a POMDP is solved mid-flight and in real time using augmented belief trees (ABT) and the TAPIR toolkit. The system's performance was assessed using three flight modes: (1) mission mode, which follows a survey plan and used here as the baseline motion planner; (2) offboard mode, which runs the POMDP-based planner across the flying area; and (3) hybrid mode, which combines mission and offboard modes for improved coverage in outdoor scenarios. Results suggest the increased cognitive power added by the proposed motion planner and flight modes allow UAVs to collect more accurate victim coordinates compared to the baseline planner. Adding the proposed system to UAVs results in improved robustness against potential false positive readings of detected objects caused by data noise, inaccurate detections, and elevated complexity to navigate in time-critical applications, such as SAR.

TI Modeling and performance analysis of shuttle-based compact storage

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE STORAGE; RETRIEVAL-SYSTEMS; DESIGN
AB Short response time for order processing is important for modern warehouses, which can be potentially achieved by adopting appropriate processing policy. The parallel processing policy have advantages in improving performance of many autonomous storage and retrieval systems. However, researchers tend to assume a sequential processing policy managing the movement of independent resources in shuttle-based compact storage systems. This paper models and analyses a single-tier of specialized shuttle-based compact storage systems under parallel processing policy. The system is modeled as a semi-open queueing network with class switching and the parallel movement of shuttles and the transfer car is modeled using a fork-join queueing network. The analytical model is validated against simulations and the results show our model can accurately estimate the system performance. Numerical experiments and a real case are carried out to compare the performance of parallel and sequential processing policies. The results suggest a critical transaction arrival rate and depth/width ratio, below which the sequential processing policy outperforms the parallel processing policy. However, the advantage of sequential processing policy is decreasing with the increasing of shuttle number, transaction arrival rate and depth/width ratio. The results also suggest an optimal depth/width ratio with a value of 1.75 for minimizing the expected throughput time in the real system. Given the current system configurations, the parallel processing policy should be considered when the number of shuttles is larger than 2 or the transaction arrival rate is larger than 24 per hour.

AB In autonomous driving, stereo vision-based depth estimation technology can help to estimate the distance of obstacles accurately, which is crucial for correctly planning the path of the vehicle. Recent work has formulated the stereo depth estimation problem into a deep learning model with convolutional neural networks. However, these methods need a lot of post-processing and do not have strong adaptive capabilities to ill-posed regions or new scenes. In addition, due to the difficulty of the labelling the ground truth depth for real circumstance, training data for the system is limited. To overcome the above problems, the authors came up with self-improving pyramid stereo network, which can not only get a direct regression disparity without complicated post-processing but also be robust in ill-posed area. Moreover, by online learning, the proposed model can not only address the data limitation problem but also save the time spent on training and hardware resources in practice. At the same time, the proposed model has a self-improving ability to new scenes, which can quickly adjust the model according to the test data in time and improve the accuracy of prediction. Experiments on Scene Flow and KITTI data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network.

AB Energy is the significant limitation in underwater sensor arrangement. In Underwater sensor organization, the sink node uses high energy in charge of sending information from nodes that are more remote away. The battery depleted in a brief span. The suggested technique productively diminishes the energy utilization in Mobicast steering convention in Underwater Sensor Networks (USN). Underwater Sensor Network is broadly utilized for checking and assembling information in a self-sufficient form. Since sensors are little and power obliged gadgets, it is the most vital to reduce the energy utilization. The autonomous Underwater vehicle (AUV) goes along a way that has been characterized by the client to bring the detecting information from a Underwater sensor node. The Mobicast Routing Protocol for Underwater Sensor Networks is utilized to manage the cost of a spatiotemporal answer for the Underwater Sensor Networks and furthermore it gives an effective information gathering and a energy sparing directing convention for the USN. The researchers suggest Node Degree Algorithm for improving life span of varied Under Water Sensor systems with Time Differential on Arrival (TDOA), the TDOA saves the energy use of sensor nodes. A considerable measure of particularly, TDOA decreases energy utilization and will expand network life time, as contrasted and existing calculations. To discover mobility the GaussMarkov versatility model is utilized. The suggested techniques utilize a static sensor node which gathers the accumulated information from different nodes in its Zone of Reference (ZOR) area and send this gathered information to AUV while it enters 3-D ZOR, in this way lessening the energy utilized for transmission. Once the static node losses the energy in the bunch another node in the ZOR group which has high energy with fewer portability as well as higher node degree would be selected as a static node. Simulation results and data analysis shows the performance of proposed protocol is more efficient in terms of overall performance as compared to other existing routing protocols for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks and it was simulated in NS2 simulation software environment. This research achieves to minimize power consumption, response time and avoid overload finally it increases the throughput and Network lifetime.

AB Conventional autonomous unmanned air vehicle (UAV) autopilot systems use global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal for navigation. However, autopilot systems fail to navigate due to lost or jammed GNSS signal. To solve this problem, information from other sensors such as optical sensors are used. Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been developed over the last few years and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., visual SLAM algorithms achieve centimeter-level precision in an in-doors environment). Also, map matching localization approaches are used for UAV localization relatively to imagery from static maps such as Google Maps. Unfortunately, the accuracy and robustness of these algorithms are very dependent on up-to-date maps. The purpose of this research is to improve the accuracy and robustness of map-relative particle filter-based localization using a downward-facing optical camera mounted on an autonomous aircraft. This research shows how image similarity to likelihood conversion function impacts the results of particle filter localization algorithm. Two parametric image similarity to likelihood conversion functions (logistic and rectifying) are proposed. A dataset of simulated aerial imagery is used for experiments. The experiment results are shown, that the particle filter localization algorithm using the logistic function was able to surpass the accuracy of state-of-the-art ORB-SLAM2 algorithm by 2.6 times. The algorithm is shown to be able to navigate using up-to-date maps more accurately and with an average decrease in precision by 30% using out-of-date maps.

AB Among so many autonomous driving technologies, autonomous lane changing is an important application scenario, which has been gaining increasing amounts of attention from both industry and academic communities because it can effectively reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety. However, most of the existing researchers transform the multi-objective optimization problem of lane changing trajectory into a single objective problem, but how to determine the weight of the objective function is relatively fuzzy. Therefore, an optimization method based on the combination of the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which provides a new idea for solving the multi-objective optimization problem of lane change trajectory algorithm, is proposed in this paper. Firstly, considering the constraints of lane changing and combining with the collision detection algorithm, the feasible lane changing trajectory cluster is obtained based on the quintic polynomial. In order to ensure the comfort, stability and high efficiency of the lane changing process, the NSGA-II Algorithm is used to optimize the longitudinal displacement and time of lane changing. The continuous ordered weighted averaging (COWA) operator is introduced to calculate the weights of three objective optimization functions. Finally, the TOPSIS Algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal lane change trajectory. The simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate a satisfactory trajectory for automatic lane changing actions.

AB Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) consisting of multiple space-borne and airborne non-terrestrial base stations (NT-BSs) have recently been introduced by 3GPP as a new paradigm of infrastructure to extend the capacity and coverage of existing terrestrial networks to further support non-terrestrial UEs (NT-UEs). Mobility of NT-BSs and NT-UEs however leads to a dynamic and non-stationary environment, which creates unique challenges in the coverage optimization particularly for the dynamic deployment of multiple NT-BSs. Under the dynamic and non-stationary environment, each NT-BS should autonomously predict not only moving trajectories of NT-UEs and other NT-BSs but also the probability of presence of NT-UEs at any given location, and consequently a new machine learning (ML) scheme is desired. In this paper, instead of adopting the recent innovation of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches inducing an unaffordable complexity for NT-BSs with a limited computing capability, new reinforcement learning (RL) schemes are therefore proposed, by which each of multiple NT-BSs autonomously determines the deployment trajectories to maximize the number of NT-UEs that can access NT-BSs. Through the comprehensive analysis, we justify the convergence of the performance of the proposed schemes. The simulation results also show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and the outstanding performances as compared with state-of-the-art schemes.

AB When driving, people make decisions based on current traffic as well as their desired route. They have a mental map of known routes and are often able to navigate without needing directions. Current published self-driving models improve their performances when using additional GPS information. Here we aim to push forward self-driving research and perform route planning even in the complete absence of GPS at inference time. Our system learns to predict in real-time vehicle's current location and future trajectory, on a known map, given only the raw video stream and the final destination. Trajectories consist of instant steering commands that depend on present traffic, as well as longer-term navigation decisions towards a specific destination. Along with our novel proposed approach to localization and navigation from visual data, we also introduce a novel large dataset in an urban environment, which consists of video and GPS streams collected with a smartphone while driving. The GPS is automatically processed to obtain supervision labels and to create an analytical representation of the traversed map. In tests, our solution outperforms published state of the art methods on visual localization and steering and provides reliable navigation assistance between any two known locations. We also show that our system can adapt to short and long-term changes in weather conditions or the structure of the urban environment. We make the entire dataset and the code publicly available.

AB This paper aims to establish a new event-triggered model predictive control (MPC) strategy for perturbed nonlinear systems working in a networked environment, which can effectively save the computation and communication resources while ensuring control performance. The core of the framework is a new event-triggered mechanism, which is built by combining the differential and integral (D-I) information of the error between the optimal state and the actual state in a pre-specified time horizon. Based on such a triggering mechanism, a D-I based event-triggered robust MPC algorithm is proposed to stabilise the system and reduce the computation/communication resource consumption. In addition, sufficient conditions to ensure the feasibility and stability of the proposed MPC algorithm and avoid Zeno behaviour are obtained through rigorous theoretical analysis. Finally, the proposed control framework is implemented in the nonlinear cart-damper-spring and autonomous underwater vehicle systems to verify its effectiveness.

AB Human-centered systems play an important role in the modern world, for example, driverless car, autonomous and smart vehicles, drones, and robotics. The internet of things environment demands a faster real-time response depending on the applications processed in a particular duration. Mobile edge computing (MEC) allows a user to get a real-time response as compared with cloud computing (CC), although ensuring a number of security attributes in MEC environment remains challenging. In this article, a protocol is designed to achieve mutual authentication, anonymous communication, and security against traceability, as these are very crucial factors to ensure the security of data and user's privacy. Moreover, the proposed scheme ensures mutual authentication between a mobile user and an edge server along with the user's anonymity and untraceability. The proof of security and evaluation of performance of the scheme validates that it ensures security attributes and improves efficiency in terms of communication and computation overheads.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is paramount for unmanned systems to achieve self-localization and navigation. It is challenging to perform SLAM in large environments, due to sensor limitations, complexity of the environment, and computational resources. We propose a novel approach for localization and mapping of autonomous vehicles using radio fingerprints, for example WiFi (Wireless Fidelity) or LTE (Long Term Evolution) radio features, which are widely available in the existing infrastructure. In particular, we present two solutions to exploit the radio fingerprints for SLAM. In the first solution-namely Radio SLAM, the output is a radio fingerprint map generated using SLAM technique. In the second solution-namely Radio+LiDAR SLAM, we use radio fingerprint to assist conventional LiDAR-based SLAM to improve accuracy and speed, while generating the occupancy map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in three different environments, namely outdoor, indoor building, and semi-indoor environment.

AB Video analysis drives a wide range of applications in the fields of public safety, autonomous vehicles, etc., with the great potential to impact society. Traditional cloud-based approaches are not applicable because of prohibitive bandwidth consumption and high response latency, while simply edge-based video analysis suffers from large computation delay, considering the restricted computing capacity of edge servers. Therefore, in this article, we focus on low-latency edge-cloud collaborative video analytic applications (ECCVApps) by making full use of resources at both the edge and cloud. Particularly, we present an edge-cloud collaborative video analysis system called ECCVideo, to support the unified management of heterogeneous servers and facilitate the development and deployment of large-scale ECCVApps. Under ECCVideo, we design the application architecture of ECCVApps, including presentation paradigm, transparent communication services, and full lifecycle management. To validate the proposed system, a real-time object detection application is deployed on the ECCVideo prototype.

AB Sixth generation (6G) mobile communication aims to construct an autonomous network architecture with human-like consciousness and intelligence. 6G mobile technology is expected to integrate space, air, ground, and sea networks to provide full-dimensional wireless and ubiquitous coverage. Compared to terrestrial communications, maritime wireless communications are still far behind expectations to satisfy 6G requirements for ubiquitous wireless connectivity and extensive coverage. Fortunately, the unmanned surface vessel (USV) with agile maneuverability and adaptive capability is a potential solution to enhance maritime communication coverage and performance. However, how to apply mobile USVs to maritime wireless communication is still an open issue. In this article, we provide an overview of USV-assisted maritime wireless communication by introducing three typical USV application scenarios, basic networking architecture, andvdesign considerations, as well as the main challenges. An example of USV-assisted mobile relaying is conducted to demonstrate the benefits provided by adopting USV in maritime wireless communication.

AB Trajectory planning is commonly used as part of a local planner in autonomous driving. This paper considers the problem of planning a continuous-curvature-rate trajectory between fixed start and goal states that minimizes a tunable trade-off between passenger comfort and travel time. The problem is an instance of infinite dimensional optimization over two continuous functions: a path and a velocity profile. We propose a simplification of this problem that facilitates the discretization of both functions. This paper also proposes a method to quickly generate minimal-length paths between start and goal states based on a single tuning parameter: the second derivative of curvature. Further, we discretize the set of velocity profiles along a given path into a selection of longitudinal jerk way-points along the path. Finally, we repeatedly solve the path and velocity profiles in an iterative fashion. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the benefits of the proposed methods.

AB The existing, universal approaches to sensory system calibration do not consider target application during calibration. We propose a new approach to calibration that uses the target application processing pipeline to measure the calibration quality. This approach is exemplified and tested in the calibration of an onboard vision system used to localize a city bus to an electric charging station. Our calibration procedure determines the parameters applying optimization and automatic features detection from a deep learning-based vision processing pipeline. The parameters are calibrated to produce localization estimates matching the ground truth pose measurements. We measure the calibration's performance in a target application on over 10000 poses recorded from a real city bus over several days. The automatic calibration procedure results in numerous optimization constraints, which can be used to calibrate more parameters and reduce manual labor. The proposed approach reduces the localization errors by almost 50% in the presented target application.

AB In this paper, we propose an advanced double layered multi-agent system to reduce learning time, expressing a state space using a 2D grid. This system is based on asynchronous advantage actor-critic systems (A3C) and reduces the state space that agents need to consider by hierarchically expressing a 2D grid space and determining actions. Specifically, the state space is expressed in the upper and lower layers. Based on the learning results using A3C in the lower layer, the upper layer makes decisions without additional learning, and accordingly, the total learning time can be reduced. Our method was verified experimentally using a virtual autonomous surface vehicle simulator. It reduced the learning time required to reach a 90% goal achievement rate by 7.1% compared to the conventional double layered A3C. In addition, the goal achievement by the proposed method was 18.86% higher than that of the traditional double layered A3C over 20,000 learning episodes.

AB Semantic segmentation of street view images is an important step in scene understanding for autonomous vehicle systems. Recent works have made significant progress in pixel-level labeling using Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) framework and local multi-scale context information. Rich global context information is also essential in the segmentation process. However, a systematic way to utilize both global and local contextual information in a single network has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we propose a global-and-local network architecture (GLNet) which incorporates global spatial information and dense local multi-scale context information to model the relationship between objects in a scene, thus reducing segmentation errors. A channel attention module is designed to further refine the segmentation results using low-level features from the feature map. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed GLNet achieves 80.8% test accuracy on the Cityscapes test dataset, comparing favorably with existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB This work deals with the development of a nonlinear Periodic Event-Triggered Control strategy employed to the consensus of a multi-vehicle autonomous system based on (3,0) mobile robots. First, the existence of the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) applicable to the consensus problem is proven. This is subsequently used to develop event and feedback functions. The Periodic Event-Triggered Control ensures trajectories boundedness and convergence to consensus while a specific sampling period is provided. Also, the formation problem is addressed as an extension of the presented work. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed control strategy which reduces 99.78% the number of control updates compared to a continuous control law, resulting in energy saving for the information transfer from central control to the mobile robots.

AB When 3D laser scanning (LIDAR) is used for navigation of autonomous vehicles operated on unstructured terrain, it is necessary to register the acquired point cloud and accurately perform point cloud reconstruction of the terrain in time. This paper proposes a novel registration method to deal with uneven-density and high-noise of unstructured terrain point clouds. It has two steps of operation, namely initial registration and accurate registration. Multisensor data is firstly used for initial registration. An improved Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is then deployed for accurate registration. This algorithm extracts key points and builds feature descriptors based on the neighborhood normal vector, point cloud density and curvature. An adaptive threshold is introduced to accelerate iterative convergence. Experimental results are given to show that our two-step registration method can effectively solve the uneven-density and high-noise problem in registration of unstructured terrain point clouds, thereby improving the accuracy of terrain point cloud reconstruction.

AB Queueing and queueing network models have been extensively employed for the performance analysis of manufacturing systems. They have enjoyed successful applications in rapid modelling for system design and performance evaluation of operational plans. In this paper, we briefly review literature on significant queuing network models developed and applied to the analysis of manufacturing systems. Previous work has focused almost exclusively on static environments of various types including open and closed networks for serial and general systems with various attributes such as unreliable machines, general arrival and service distributions, finite buffers and controlled work-in-process levels. As many systems experience dynamic demand and time-dependent resource availability, we propose a framework for the analysis of manufacturing systems under dynamic conditions. Numerical validation of this framework against simulation estimates is performed for realistic sized flowshop and jobshop instances.

ID ALGORITHM
AB In this paper, the path planning problem for a single autonomous robot treading on a static terrain is solved using optimal control theory. The performance measure selected for the optimal control formulation is the path length between a predefined initial and final position on an inertial frame of reference. The terrain features are assumed to be known a priori and is represented using a b-spline surface. The terrain tractability constraint is decoupled from the dynamic stability equation of the robot and absorbed as a terrain feature. The results indicate that the target is reached optimally and the trajectory is smooth. The smoothness of the trajectory eliminates the need for post processing for trajectory tracking. This formulation can be applied to path planning problems related to aerial and ground vehicles with minimum modifications to take care of the real time requirements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, the global adaptive neural control with finite-time (FT) convergence learning performance for a general class of nonlinear robot manipulators has been investigated. The scheme proposed in this paper offers a subtle blend of neural controller with robust controller, which palliates the limitation of neural approximation region to ensure globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) stability. by integrating a switching mechanism. Moreover, the proposed scheme guarantees the estimated neural weights converging to optimal values in finite time by embedding an adaptive learning algorithm driven by the estimated weights error. The optimal weights obtained through the learning process of the neural networks (NNs) will be reused next time for repeated tasks, and can thus reduce computational load, improve transient performance and enhance robustness. The simulation studies have been carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the controller in comparison to the conventional methods.

ID CONSENSUS ALGORITHM; CONTROL-SYSTEMS
AB In view of problems of low independent self-positioning accuracy of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with low precision sensors, and the strong nonlinear characteristics of motion control model and non Gaussian noise when filtering using the distances between leaders and followers, a collaborative localization framework with multi-leaders for AUVs is presented, which is based on the unscented particle filter. This approach lets unscented Kalman filter act on each particle of particle filter algorithm, which makes particle mix the latest posterior information of measurement when updating. It solves the depletion problem of particles to some extent and improves the effectiveness of filtering method. Collaborative location simulating experiments are carried out in two leaders model with different noises conditions. The implementation results show that this method effectively enhances the estimation accuracy of followers position.

AB Photogrammetry is a well-studied and much-used analysis tool. Typical use cases include area surveillance, flood monitoring and related tasks. Usually, an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is used as support for image acquisition from an a priori delimited region in a semi-automated manner (via a mix of ground control and autonomous trajectory tracking). This in turn has led to various algorithms which handle path trajectory generation under realistic constraints but still many avenues remain open. In this paper, we consider typical costs and constraints (UAS dynamics, total-path length, line inter-distance, turn points, etc.) in order to obtain, via optimization procedures, an optimal trajectory. To this end we make use of polyhedral set operations, flat trajectory generation and other similar tools. Additional work includes the study of non-convex regions and estimation of the number of photographs taken via Ehrhart polynomial computations.

ID VEHICLE DETECTION; FEATURES
AB Detection of cars has a high variety of civil and military applications, e.g., transportation control, traffic monitoring, and surveillance. It forms an important aspect in the deployment of autonomous unmanned aerial systems in rescue or surveillance missions. In this paper, we present a two-stage algorithm for detecting automobiles in aerial digital images. In the first stage, a feature-based detection is performed, based on local histogram of oriented gradients and support vector machine classification. Next, a generative statistical model is used to generate a ranking for each patch. The ranking can be used as a measure of confidence or a threshold to eliminate those patches that are least likely to be an automobile. We analyze the results obtained from three different types of data sets. In various experiments, we present the performance improvement of this approach compared to a discriminative-only approach; the false alarm rate is reduced by a factor of 7 with only a 10% drop in the recall rate.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB This paper assesses the behavior of electrical output for a Ballard Mark V 35-cell 5 kW PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) stack-based dc-dc power conversion for applications in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under load changes. Since the fuel cell produces dc output voltage that is unregulated, pulsewidth modulated (PWM) dc-dc converters are connected to the output of the studied fuel cell for converting the unregulated voltage into a desired voltage level. The fuel cell model includes the double-layer charging effect, gases diffusion in the electrodes, and the thermodynamic characteristic. Moreover, PWM dc-dc converters are assumed to operate in continuous-conduction mode (CCM), and the compensator is designed with voltage-mode control. The models of the study's fuel cell and PWM dc-dc converters have been implemented in a Matlab/SIMULINK (TM) environment. The results show that the output voltages of the studied PEMFC connected with PWM dc-dc converters during a load change are stable.

AB This paper presents a methodology for the realization of intelligent, task-based reconfiguration of the computational hardware for mobile robot applications. Task requirements are first partitioned into requirements on the system hardware and software. Architecture is proposed that enables these requirements to be addressed through appropriate hardware and software components. Hardware-software co-design and hardware reconfiguration are utilized to design robotic systems that are fault-tolerant and have improved reliability. It is shown that this design enables the implementation of efficient controllers for each task of the robot thereby permitting better operational efficiency using fixed computational resources. The approach is validated through case studies where a team of robots is configured and the behavior of the robots is dynamically modified at run-time. It is demonstrated through this implementation that the design procedure results in increased flexibility in configuration at run-time. The ability to reconfigure the resources also aids collaboration between robots, and results in improved performance and fault tolerance.

AB There exists a high demand for reliable, high capacity underwater acoustic networks to allow efficient data gathering and information exchange. This is evidenced by significant research in overcoming the limitations of the shallow water acoustic channel, such as low bandwidth, highly varying multipath effects and large propagation delays. This paper proposes an energy-efficient scheduling mechanism for a scalable network topology with a hybrid RF-acoustic communication architecture, designed for underwater littoral surveillance applications. In combination with a scalable buoy positioning scheme that assures AUV underwater synchronization and position computation, we propose a Time Division Multiple Access scheduling technique for underwater communication that achieves energy-efficient, collision-free data exchange on the low data rate acoustic channel. We measure the performance of the communication architecture by extensive simulations using the Opnet network simulator. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The combination of a single-photon avalanche diode detector with a high-sensitivity and photon-efficient reconstruction algorithm can realize the reconstruction of target range image from weak light signal conditions. The limited spatial resolution of the detector and the substantial background noise remain significant challenges in the actual detection process, hindering the accuracy of 3D reconstruction techniques. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a denoising super-resolution reconstruction network based on generative adversarial network (GAN) design. Soft thresholding is incorporated into the deep architecture as a nonlinear transformation layer to effectively filter out noise. Moreover, the Unet-based discriminator is introduced to complete the high-precision detail reconstruction. The experimental results show that the proposed network can achieve high-quality super-resolution range imaging. This approach has the potential to enhance the accuracy and quality of long-range imaging in weak light signal conditions, with broad applications in fields such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and biomedical imaging.

AB SkyWinder is an open-source Python package useful for instrument control, telemetry, and image analysis. It is adapted from software that successfully managed flight control, telemetry, preliminary image analysis, and data visualization for a balloon-borne mission and it has broad uses for mid- and upper-atmosphere science instrumentation including aurora, cloud, and airglow imagers. SkyWinder will save future aeronomy experiments significant time and money, and lowers the barrier to entry in analyzing data hosted in public available repositories. Our software consists of two distinct parts: the flight and analysis modules. The SkyWinder flight package includes modular distributed flight control including telemetry and subsystem coordination for running mobile aeronomy experiments such as balloon-borne payloads, airplanes, sounding rockets, and suborbital reusable launch vehicles (sRLVs), as well as isolated semi-autonomous ground instruments. The SkyWinder analysis software provides functionality more broadly useful in neutral upper atmosphere dynamics, such as pointing reconstruction, image projection, preliminary image processing, and various image analysis techniques.

AB This paper studies the distributed cooperative control problem for multiple surface vessels (MSVs) subject to unknown environmental disturbances, model uncertainties, unavailable velocities and prescribed performance constraints. Firstly, a fixed-time extended state observer (FxESO) is designed to provide the estimations of velocities and lumped disturbances (including unknown environmental disturbances and model uncertainties). Secondly, to improve the convergence performance of the MSVs, a hyperbolic cosecant prescribed performance function is incorporated into the cooperative control algorithm. Thirdly, a fixed-time event-triggered control law with prescribed performance constraint is applied to cooperative control based on a fixed-time nonsingular terminal sliding mode manifold (FxNTSMM), and the cooperative errors can converge within fixed time. Finally, by employing Lyapunov function theory, the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB For autonomous systems, the smoothness of estimated trajectories is essential to ensure robust and performant vehicle control. Unfortunately, approaches for state estimation using Kalman filters are sensitive to measurement outliers that can diverge dramatically. We propose a state-estimation algorithm using factor graph optimization (FGO) in continuous-time for GNSS/INS navigation systems to track this problem. The focus is on the smoothness of the estimated trajectory in environments where the GNSS observations become temporarily unreliable. Therefore, an inland shipping scenario with bridge crossings is selected as an application example. To estimate the trajectory in continuous-time, we integrate a White-Noise-On-Acceleration (WNOA) motion prior factor based on Gaussian process regression between successive states. Our results show a 30% improvement in accuracy and increased smoothness of the estimated trajectory with FGO compared to Kalman filtering.

ID SUPERRESOLUTION
AB This paper presents a novel application of a Multi-frame Super Resolution (MFSR) method for lunar surface imagery called Lunar HighRes-net (L-HRN). In this work, we adapted and used NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) image database to train the Deep Learning architecture for image super resolution. Additionally, we also gathered an artificial image dataset from our virtual Moon to improve the amount of input data in the neural network training process. The network's architecture follows a standard MFSR algorithm that was enhanced for this specific use case. The proposed MFSR method has been evaluated using the well-known peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metric against other generic super-resolution methods of the state of the art. This work aims to improve environmental knowledge about the lunar surface to enhance future autonomous robots capabilities on the surface of the Moon.

AB High-frequency demodulation of wide area optical signals in a snapshot manner remains a technological challenge. If solved, it could open tremendous perspectives in 3D imaging, vibrometry, free-space communications, automated vision, or ballistic photon imaging in scattering media with numerous applications in smart autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis. We present here a snapshot quadrature demodulation imaging technique, capable of estimating the amplitude and phase from a single acquisition, without synchronization of emitter and receiver, and with the added capability of continuous frequency tuning. This all-optical optimized setup comprises an electro-optic crystal acting as a fast sinusoidal optical transmission gate, and allows four quadrature image channels to be recorded simultaneously with any conventional camera. We report the design, experimental validation and examples of applications of such wide-field quadrature demodulating system that allowed snapshot demodulation of images with good spatial resolution and continuous frequency selectivity up to a few 100s of kilohertz.

AB Vehicle state estimation is an essential prerequisite for navigation. The present approach seeks to use skylight polarization to facilitate state estimation under autonomous unconstrained flight conditions. Atmospheric scattering polarizes incident sunlight such that solar position is mathematically encoded in the resulting skylight polarization pattern. Indeed, several species of insects are able to sense skylight polarization and are believed to navigate polarimetrically. Sun-finding methodologies for polarized skylight navigation (PSN) have been proposed in the literature but typically rely on calibration updates to account for changing atmospheric conditions and/or are limited to 2D operation. To address this technology gap, a gradient-based PSN solution is developed based upon the Rayleigh sky model. The solution is validated in simulation, and effects of measurement error and changing atmospheric conditions are investigated. Finally, an experimental effort is described wherein polarimetric imagery is collected, ground-truth is established through independent imager-attitude measurement, the gradient-based PSN solution is applied, and results are analyzed.

AB With ever increasing global demand and depleting resources for fossil fuels, oil and gas industry is now positively looking for advanced robotic solutions to increase their productivity and safety. With time easy resources of the fossil fuels are shrinking and newly searched reservoirs, to feed supply demands of global consumption, are mostly located in extreme environmental conditions such as hot deserts, deep water and arctic zone etc. Production of the fossil fuels, in such inhospitable environmental conditions, poses difficult challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE). Tragic incidents like Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon oil spills are examples of such challenges. Therefore, oil and gas industry has lot to learn from successful implementation of robotics and automation for dull, dirty and dangerous (3D) tasks of manufacturing industry. Most of the robotics technologies, currently used in the oil and gas industry, are mainly focused on inspection, maintenance and repair (IMR) of plant facilities with higher frequency and accuracy. Fundamental idea, involved in the automatization of these processes, is based on the principle of teleoperation with skilled operator. Automation of 3D tasks not only improves HSE standards but also lead to much needed economic efficiency by reducing production cycle, floor space and number of staff members required for continuous inspection and manipulation of plant facilities. Considering the risks involved in this industry usage of completely autonomous robots, first without achieving very high reliability, is still a far fetch choice. Therefore, semi-autonomous robots, where actions are performed by robots but cognitive decisions are still taken by skilled operator, is an excellent choice for this industry as a near future solution. In the onshore oil and gas industry robotic solutions are used both in upstream and downstream processes, such as site survey, drilling, production and transportation, mainly focused in the form of in-pipe inspection robots (IPIRs), tank inspection robots (TIRs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) etc. This paper presents the state of art robotic solutions currently used in onshore oil and gas facilities.

AB We present the modeling and dynamic analysis of a Mobile Underwater Turbine System, a novel integration of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and Hydrokinetic Turbines, for harvesting Marine Hydrokinetic Energy from the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream, an ocean current that flows off the coast of North Carolina, is a source of hydrokinetic energy. However, the meandering nature of the Gulf Stream makes it challenging to harvest the full energy potential of the stream using fixed turbine systems. One possible solution for increasing the amount of energy that can be extracted from the Gulf Stream involves using a mobile underwater energy harvester system that can follow the meandering stream so as to remain in regions of maximum energy potential. The framework for the conceptual design, and studies focusing on the feasibility of such a system, have been presented previously in (Divi, 2017). The focus of this paper is a mathematical model of the system which has been developed to analyze the dynamics of such a system, along with parametric studies utilizing this model to come up with a system with an optimized set of design parameters. A 6-DOF analytical model of the system is developed to gain an understanding of the system's dynamic behavior and stability. A bead-based tether model is further developed to analyze the behavior of the system when it is anchored and harvesting energy. A study regarding the effects of tether parameters such as the number of tether elements, the spring constant, and the damping coefficient of the tether on the tether behavior and computation time required for analysis, is put forth to help determine an optimal set of tether parameters. In addition, a set of system parameters such as turbine diameter, hull diameter, L/D ratio of the hull and ballast tank size, are analyzed to see how they affect the net energy produced and the maximum distance travelled by the system. Finally, three modes of power transfer to the shore are considered, and an optimization algorithm is presented and used to find the best set of parameters suited for maximum energy transfer for each mode.

AB The objective of this study was to develop a visual navigation system capable of navigating an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) travelling between tree rows in the outdoor orchard. Thus far, while most research has developed algorithms that deal with ground structures in the orchard, this study focused on the background of canopy plus sky to eliminate the interference factors such as inconsistent lighting, shadows, and color similarities in features. Aiming at the problem that the traditional Hough transform and the least square method are difficult to be applied under outdoor conditions, an algorithm combining Hough matrix and random sample consensus (RANSAC) was proposed to extract the navigation path. In the image segmentation stage, this study used an H-component that was adopted to extract the target path of the canopy plus sky. Then, after denoising and smoothing the image by morphological operation, line scanning was used to determine the midpoint of the target path. For navigation path extraction, this study extracted the feature points through Hough matrix to eliminate the redundant points, and RANSAC was used to reduce the impact of the noise points caused by different canopy shapes and fit the navigation path. The path acquisition experiment proved that the accuracy of Hough matrix and RANSAC method was 90.36%-96.81% and the time consumption of the program was within 0.55 s under different sunlight intensities. This method was superior to the traditional Hough transform in real-time and accuracy, and had higher accuracy, slightly worse real-time compared with the least square method. Furthermore, the OPENMV was used to capture the ground information of the orchard. The experiment proved that the recognition rate of OPENMV for identifying turning information was 100%, and the program running time was 0.17-0.19 s. Field experiments showed that the UGV could autonomously navigate the rows with a maximum lateral error of 0.118 m and realize the automatic turning of the UGV. The algorithm satisfied the practical operation requirements of autonomous vehicles in the orchard. So the UGV has the potential to guide multipurpose agricultural vehicles in outdoor orchards in the future.

AB Objective Self-driving technology will bring novelty in vehicle interior design and allow for a wide variety of occupant seating choices. Thus, vehicle safety systems may be challenged to protect occupants over a wider range of potential postures. This study aims to investigate the effects of the seat cushion angle on submarining risk, lumbar spine loads and pelvis excursion for reclined occupants in frontal crashes. Methods Frontal crash finite element simulations were performed with two of the simplified Global Human Body Model Consortium (GHBMC) occupant models: the small female and the midsize male. Occupant restraints consisted of a frontal airbag, a seatback-integrated 3-point belt with a lap belt anchor pre-tensioner, and a retractor pre-tensioner with a force limiter. For each simulation, parameters including seat cushion angle (3 degrees, 8 degrees, 13 degrees), seatback recline angle (0 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees), and knee bolster (KB) position relative to the occupant (baseline and no KB) were varied. A full-factorial simulation matrix was performed using the USNCAP 56 km/h frontal crash pulse. Occupant kinematics data were extracted from each simulation to investigate how changes in seat cushion angle, anthropometry, seatback angle, and KB position would affect submarining across all simulated cases. Results Overall, the F05-OS female model was more likely to submarine when compared to the male occupant model. The threshold for submarining was also affected by the seat cushion angle, seatback angle and KB distance. For the F05-OS model, increasing the seat cushion angle to 13 degrees prevented submarining in the 10 degrees seatback angle case, regardless of the KB position. Similarly, the 13 degrees cushion angle prevented submarining for the M50-OS in the 30 degrees seatback angle configuration but only in the presence of a KB. The results further show an increased lumbar flexion load with increased seat recline angle, as well as occupant-to-KB distance, although an opposite trend with the increased seat cushion angle. Conclusions Submarining may be a major challenge to overcome for reclined occupants in autonomous driving systems. This study shows that seat cushion angle plays a role in restraining occupants in recline scenarios, but it is not sufficient to prevent submarining without additional countermeasures.

TI MOBQOS: MOBILITY AWARE AND QOS-DRIVEN SDN FRAMEWORK FOR AUTONOMOUS

AB An intelligent transportation system (ITS) is a cyber physical system (CPS) that is well recognized due to its distinctive applications such as passenger safety, enhanced traffic efficiency, and infotainment services. However, very recently, these CPSs have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of autonomous vehicles (AVs), and the count is expected to increase significantly in the years to come. Under such scenarios, the conventional ITS solutions would fall short due to numerous technical limitations such as reduced flexibility, poor connectivity, limited scalability, and lack of adequate intelligence. In this direction, the cloud computing paradigm would also lag behind in meeting the following expected challenges: high mobility, minimal latency, real-time services, and high quality of service (QoS). Software defined networking (SDN) and edge computing (EC) are expected to be promising solutions for modern ITS. SON allows efficient management of networks by virtue of its decoupled data and control planes. Moreover, EC is an extension of cloud computing that allows data processing, storage, and management at the edge of the network. Thus, these promising paradigms can address the network and data processing challenges of AV networks in rea time. Further, distributed mobility management (DMM) with improvised routing capabilities in the considered setup can bring added advantages in the form of zero tunneling overhead, full-fledged control of flow table entries, QoS-driven routing decisions, and efficient interplay between the edge and the cloud. Keeping in view the potential benefits of SDN, EC, and DMM in future AV networks, this work presents a composite framework with a distributed SDN-DMM approach in ITS ecosystems. Further, conventional DMM has been improved by stacking the Optimized Routing Decision module on it. This coupling yields a mobility-aware and QoS-driven (MobQoS) SDN framework for AVs that handles both the mobility and QoS challenges of the underlying vehicular networks. Additionally, it is also designed to handle the interplay between the edge and the cloud in an optimized manner using the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOLA/D). Numerical comparisons depict that the proposed MobQoS outperforms the existing state of the art in terms of overall communication latency and bandwidth utilization. The performance assessment has been carried out using NS-3 and SUMO wherein an overall improvement of 15.95 percent has been reported in terms of end-to-end delay.

AB The Department of Defense (DOD), the Services and Congress have put out numerous autonomous/unmanned guidance, roadmaps, and visionary documents. This push is designed to bring the US Military to the next stage of the Information Technology revolution. However, simply replacing manned systems with unmanned systems will deny our forces the true strength of autonomous vehicles. An interconnected system of systems will truly revolutionize military operations.Why interconnectedness? It doesn't sound very cool and besides aren't we all about interoperability? Is interconnectedness even a real word? Assuming "Interconnectedness" is a real word, why is it important? Interconnectedness is important because the Naval Services have been tasked with completely changing the way we have conducted business for the last 70 years. The Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Naval Operations have directed the naval services to bring new technologies online and integrate them into our operating forces to compete with peer and near-peer adversaries. So why interconnectedness?Interconnectedness is the state of having different parts or things connected or related to each other. Interoperability is the degree to which two products, programs, etc. can be used together, or the quality of being able to be used together.1 In other words interconnected systems are working together, interoperable systems can work together. This is a key distinction. We are at the cusp of a revolution in autonomy and artifi cial intelligence, decisions we make today will shape how these technologies are employed for decades. The Interconnectedness of these systems, the degree to which they are connected, will be a vital determinant for success.

AB Annotated driving scenario trajectories are crucial for verification and validation of autonomous vehicles. However, annotation of such trajectories based only on explicit rules (i.e. knowledge-based methods) may be prone to errors, such as false positive/negative classification of scenarios that lie on the border of two scenario classes, missing unknown scenario classes, or even failing to detect anomalies. On the other hand, verification of labels by annotators is not cost-efficient. For this purpose, active learning (AL) could potentially improve the annotation procedure by including an annotator/expert in an efficient way. In this study, we develop a generic active learning framework to annotate driving trajectory time series data. We first compute an embedding of the trajectories into a latent space in order to extract the temporal nature of the data. Given such an embedding, the framework becomes task agnostic since active learning can be performed using any classification method and any query strategy, regardless of the structure of the original time series data. Furthermore, we utilize our active learning framework to discover unknown driving scenario trajectories. This will ensure that previously unknown trajectory types can be effectively detected and included in the labeled dataset. We evaluate our proposed framework in different settings on novel real-world datasets consisting of driving trajectories collected by Volvo Cars Corporation. We observe that active learning constitutes an effective tool for labeling driving trajectories as well as for detecting unknown classes. Expectedly, the quality of the embedding plays an important role in the success of the proposed framework.

TI Video-Based Detection Infrastructure Enhancement for Automated Ship

AB Video-based detection infrastructure is crucial for promoting connected and autonomous shipping (CAS) development, which provides critical on-site traffic data for maritime participants. Ship behavior analysis, one of the fundamental tasks for fulfilling smart video-based detection infrastructure, has become an active topic in the CAS community. Previous studies focused on ship behavior analysis by exploring spatial-temporal information from automatic identification system (AIS) data, and less attention was paid to maritime surveillance videos. To bridge the gap, we proposed an ensemble you only look once (YOLO) framework for ship behavior analysis. First, we employed the convolutional neural network in the YOLO model to extract multi-scaled ship features from the input ship images. Second, the proposed framework generated many bounding boxes (i.e., potential ship positions) based on the object confidence level. Third, we suppressed the background bounding box interferences, and determined ship detection results with intersection over union (IOU) criterion, and thus obtained ship positions in each ship image. Fourth, we analyzed spatial-temporal ship behavior in consecutive maritime images based on kinematic ship information. The experimental results have shown that ships are accurately detected (i.e., both of the average recall and precision rate were higher than 90%) and the historical ship behaviors are successfully recognized. The proposed framework can be adaptively deployed in the connected and autonomous vehicle detection system in the automated terminal for the purpose of exploring the coupled interactions between traffic flow variation and heterogeneous detection infrastructures, and thus enhance terminal traffic network capacity and safety.

AB Nesting sea turtles appear to avoid brightly lit beaches and often turn back to sea prematurely when exposed to artificial light. Observations and experiments have noted that nesting turtles prefer darker areas where buildings and high dunes act as light barriers. As a result, sea turtles often nest on darker beaches, creating spatial concentrations of nests. Artificial nighttime light, or light pollution, has been quantified using a variety of methods. However, it has proven challenging to make accurate measurements of ambient light at fine scales and on smaller nesting beaches. Additionally, light has traditionally been measured from stationary tripods perpendicular to beach vegetation, disregarding the point of view of a nesting sea turtle. In the present study, nighttime ambient light conditions were assessed on three beaches in central North Carolina: a developed coastline of a barrier island, a nearby State Park on the same barrier island comprised of protected and undeveloped land, and a completely uninhabited wilderness on an adjacent barrier island in the Cape Lookout National Seashore. Using an autonomous terrestrial rover, high resolution light measurements (mag/arcsec(2)) were collected every minute with two ambient light sensors along transects on each beach. Spatial comparisons between ambient light and nesting density at and between these locations reveal that highest densities of nests occur in regions with lowest light levels, supporting the hypothesis that light pollution from coastal development may influence turtle nesting distribution. These results can be used to support ongoing management strategies to mitigate this pressing conservation issue.

SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS

DT Article
DE array signal processing; sonar imaging; synthetic aperture radar
AB Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) interferometry is a technique for very high resolution imaging and mapping of the seabed. In SAS interferometry, the seabed depth estimation performance is a function of the system, the geometry, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the filter size, equivalent to the achieved horizontal resolution. A strong driver for SNR is the imaging range and grazing angle. The variation of these parameters over a typical SAS swath gives rise to a large variation in the depth estimation performance. To mitigate the negative effect of this, we suggest to use an adaptive phase estimation filter size, such that the standard deviation of the depth estimate is proportional to the horizontal resolution. We demonstrate the suggested adaptive filter size method on long range data collected using a HUGIN Superior autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a HISAS 1032 Dual receiver interferometric SAS. Our technique increases the valid area coverage when the SNR is marginal, at the expense of reduced horizontal resolution.

AB Declines in eelgrass, an important and widespread coastal habitat, are associated with wasting disease in recent outbreaks on the Pacific coast of North America. This study presents a novel method for mapping and predicting wasting disease using Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with low-altitude autonomous imaging of visible bands. We conducted UAV mapping and sampling in intertidal eelgrass beds across multiple sites in Alaska, British Columbia, and California. We designed and implemented a UAV low-altitude mapping protocol to detect disease prevalence and validated against in situ results. Our analysis revealed that green leaf area index derived from UAV imagery was a strong and significant (inverse) predictor of spatial distribution and severity of wasting disease measured on the ground, especially for regions with extensive disease infection. This study highlights a novel, efficient, and portable method to investigate seagrass disease at landscape scales across geographic regions and conditions.

TI Efficient Stereo Depth Estimation for Pseudo-LiDAR: A Self-Supervised
   Approach Based on Multi-Input ResNet Encoder

AB Perception and localization are essential for autonomous delivery vehicles, mostly estimated from 3D LiDAR sensors due to their precise distance measurement capability. This paper presents a strategy to obtain a real-time pseudo point cloud from image sensors (cameras) instead of laser-based sensors (LiDARs). Previous studies (such as PSMNet-based point cloud generation) built the algorithm based on accuracy but failed to operate in real time as LiDAR. We propose an approach to use different depth estimators to obtain pseudo point clouds similar to LiDAR to achieve better performance. Moreover, the depth estimator has used stereo imagery data to achieve more accurate depth estimation as well as point cloud results. Our approach to generating depth maps outperforms other existing approaches on KITTI depth prediction while yielding point clouds significantly faster than other approaches as well. Additionally, the proposed approach is evaluated on the KITTI stereo benchmark, where it shows effectiveness in runtime.

TI Siamese Attention Networks with Adaptive Templates for Visual Tracking
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Visual object tracking takes an important role in realistic applications, such as video understanding, unmanned auto vehicles, and autonomous robots. Although the Siamese-based tracker has achieved good performance in tracking tasks, the existing methods using initial template or updating template with simple strategy result in the performance degradation of the model when the target varies in realistic scenarios such as target occlusion, scale variation, and deformation. In this paper, we propose a visual tracking framework with adaptive template update and spatiotemporal attention, named SiamAttnAT. Specially, we propose a historical template selecting strategy and a template adaptively generating method for robust tracking. In addition, we apply the proposed mechanisms to the employed baseline SiamRPN++. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art trackers on short-term and long-term visual tracking benchmarks including VOT2018, OTB-100, UAV123, NFS, and LaSOT show that the proposed framework achieves the outstanding performance with a considerable real-time speed, verifying its efficiency and effectiveness.

TI Determining Road Networks' Platoonability

DT Article
DE Truck platooning; Autonomous and connected trucks; Platoonability
ID SPEEDS
AB Truck platooning has several benefits over traditional truck mobility. Platooning improves safety and reduces fuel consumption up to 15%, depending on platoon configuration. Although platooning benefits are quantifiable, platooning routes are not identified. Many factors are relevant to identifying these routes. For efficient platooning, a truck platoon needs to travel at a constant high speed for an extended distance. In addition, platoon integrity should be preserved from interfering vehicles and frequent ramps that may compromise the robustness and safety of the operation. This study presents an easy to implement approach to determine platoonable routes based on platoon configuration, speed, roadway volume/capacity, and number of highway exit and entry conflicts. Based on this approach, each roadway section is assigned a level of platoonability from one to five, where one is the most platoonable. This approach was used to analyze the highway network in Illinois. According to this approach, 89% of the interstates and freeways in Illinois are platoonable under average traffic conditions.

AB The distance estimation of objects from a single camera can play a crucial role in many real-life applications, such as mobile robot navigation, autonomous vehicles and camera-based assistive devices for visually impaired people. This paper addresses the problem of distance estimation of people from a monocular camera. The paper proposes using face features, in addition to body features, with various regression algorithms to estimate the distance from a camera. These features are extracted from the bounding boxes of the people, detected in camera images. Two datasets, an ideal manual one and a practical automatic one, have been built for training and validation purposes. Various metrics, including a novel one proposed in this paper, have been utilized to evaluate the different regression models. The results reveal that the distance estimation errors have been significantly reduced using the body and face features together for all used regression algorithms, and a distance precision of about 98% has been achieved.

AB The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is currently a dominant sensor fusion method for mobile devices, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Its performance heavily depends on the selection of EKF parameters. Therefore, the optimal selection of parameters is a critical factor in EKF design and use. In this paper, a methodical and efficient method of EKF parameter tuning is presented. The tuning framework uses nominal parameters generated by Gauss Markov (GM) and Allan Variance (AV) methods that are tuned by Genetic Algorithms (GA) accelerated by Design of Experiments (DoE). This framework has been implemented in MATLAB and tested using simulations and real data under a tightly coupled EKF that fuses IMU and GNSS measurements of a self-driving car provided by the Blackberry QNX company. The results demonstrate that GA-tuned parameters increase accuracy substantially over nominally tuned parameters, and that the DoE technique consistently improves the convergence behavior of the GA.

AB Image restoration and recognition are important computer vision tasks representing an inherent part of autonomous systems. These two tasks are often implemented in a sequential manner, in which the restoration process is followed by a recognition. In contrast, this paper proposes a joint framework that simultaneously performs both tasks within a shared deep neural network architecture. This joint framework integrates the restoration and recognition tasks by incorporating: (i) common layers, (ii) restoration layers and (iii) classification layers. The total loss function combines the restoration and classification losses. The proposed joint framework, based on capsules, provides an efficient solution that can cope with challenges due to noise, image rotations and occlusions. The developed framework has been validated and evaluated on a public vehicle logo dataset under various degradation conditions, including Gaussian noise, rotation and occlusion. The results show that the joint framework improves the accuracy compared with the single task networks.

AB This paper addresses the path following problem of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with the aim of dealing with parameter uncertainties and current disturbances. An adaptive robust control system was proposed by employing fuzzy logic, backstepping and sliding mode control theory. Fuzzy logic theory is adopted to approximate unknown system function, and the controller was designed by combining sliding mode control with backstepping thought. Firstly, the longitudinal speed was controlled, then the yaw angle was made as input of path following error to design the calm function and the change rate of path parameters. The controller stability was proved by Lyapunov stable theory. Simulation and outfield tests were conducted and the results showed that the controller is of excellent adaptability and robustness in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. It is also shown to be able to avoid the chattering of AUV actuators.

AB To achieve accurate positioning of autonomous underwater vehicles, an appropriate underwater terrain database storage format for underwater terrain-matching positioning is established using multi-beam data as underwater terrainmatching data. An underwater terrain interpolation error compensation method based on fractional Brownian motion is proposed for defects of normal terrain interpolation, and an underwater terrain-matching positioning method based on least squares estimation (LSE) is proposed for correlation analysis of topographic features. The Fisher method is introduced as a secondary criterion for pseudo localization appearing in a topographic features flat area, effectively reducing the impact of pseudo positioning points on matching accuracy and improving the positioning accuracy of terrain flat areas. Simulation experiments based on electronic chart and multi-beam sea trial data show that drift errors of an inertial navigation system can be corrected effectively using the proposed method. The positioning accuracy and practicality are high, satisfying the requirement of underwater accurate positioning.

Existing parking information systems usually ignore the parking price factor and do not automatically provide optimal car parks matching drivers' demand. Currently, the parking price has no negotiable space; consumers lose their bargaining position to obtain better and cheaper parking. This study uses in intelligent agent system, and considering negotiable parking prices, selects the optimal car park for the driver. The autonomous coordination activities challenge traditional approaches and call for new paradigms and supporting middleware. An agent-based coordination network is proposed to bring true benefit to drivers and car park operators. These modern intelligent agents have capabilities including planning, mobility, execution monitoring and coordination. These properties can be used to construct the integrated parking assistant system. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID FAULT-DETECTION
AB Accurate and robust localization is crucial for supporting high-level driving automation and safety. Modern localization solutions rely on various sensors, among which GPS has been and will continue to be essential. However, GPS can be vulnerable to malicious attacks and GPS spoofing has been identified as a high threat. With transportation infrastructure becoming increasingly important in supporting emerging vehicle technologies and systems, this study explores the potential of applying infrastructure data for defending against GPS spoofing. We propose an infrastructure-enabled framework using roadside units as an independent, secured data source. A real-time detector, based on the Isolation Forest, is constructed to detect GPS spoofing. Once spoofing is detected, GPS measurements are isolated, and the potentially compromised location estimator is corrected using secure infrastructure data. We test the proposed method using both simulation and real-world data and show its effectiveness in defending against various GPS spoofing attacks, including stealthy attacks that are proposed to fail the production-grade autonomous driving systems.

AB Automotive electrical and electronic (E/E) engineering architectures are being radically overhauled to satisfy the needs of the current automotive trends ranging from electrification to connected vehicles and autonomous driving. Novel networking technologies are being explored for future-proofing in-vehicular networks and making them ready for applications emerging from these trends. Programmable data plane technologies based on reconfigurable match-action tables have been successfully used in data center networking for handling data center-specific applications. In this article, we seek to explore programmable data planes for their utility in in-vehicular networks. To this end, we briefly discuss programmable data plane technologies and present a case study on implementing a distributed feedback control loop using SOME/IP, an automotive service-oriented communication middleware. We outline the parts of the SOME/IP stack that can be moved from the end systems to the network devices for achieving a better workload split using these technologies, thus improving system utilization.

AB We present a unified pipeline architecture for a real-time detection system on an embedded system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Neural architectures have been the industry standard for computer vision. However, most existing works focus solely on concatenating deeper layers to achieve higher accuracy with run-time performance as the tradeoff. This pipeline of networks can exploit the domain-specific knowledge on aerial pedestrian detection and activity recognition for the emerging UAV applications of autonomous surveying and activity reporting. In particular, our pipeline architectures operate in a time-sensitive manner, have high accuracy in detecting pedestrians from various aerial orientations, use a novel attention map for multiactivities recognition, and jointly refine its detection with temporal information. Numerically, we demonstrate our model's accuracy and fast inference speed on embedded systems. We empirically deployed our prototype hardware with full live feeds in a real-world open field.

AB The increasing number of electronic devices on board and the use of novel composite materials in the aerospace industry create a harsh electromagnetic environment that must be studied. In this article, a UAV demonstrator (DEMO-E3) with different test cases is evaluated through the low-level swept field test following a nested resonant chambers approach, which is framed under the high intensity radio frequency measurements. The aim is to analyze the difference in terms of the shielding effectiveness of the enclosure considering the different materials and apertures of each test sample. Some of the test cases had been previously measured independently, according to the IEC 61000-4-21 standard, while in this study, they are incorporated into the demonstrator and former results are used as a comparison.

AB Robust vanishing point estimation has been widely applied to various applications in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition for robotics, advanced driver assistance systems, and autonomous driving vehicles. The major challenge for vanishing point detection lies in line segments, spurious vanishing candidate removal, and clustering for refinement. Recent vanishing point detection approaches have attempted to reduce the computational complexity involved with voting processes using optimized voter selection strategies to identify the vanishing point from line segments. This paper proposes a novel vanishing point detection method to select robust candidates, applying optimized minimum spanning tree-based clustering of the vanishing point candidates by analyzing the lines within a unit sphere domain. The proposed scheme was applied to an open database that included illumination, partial occlusion, and viewpoint changes to validate robustness without prior scene information.

AB This letter presents a method for local motion planning in unstructured environments with static and moving obstacles, such as humans. Given a reference path and speed, our optimization-based receding-horizon approach computes a local trajectory that minimizes the tracking error while avoiding obstacles. We build on nonlinear model-predictive contouring control (MPCC) and extend it to incorporate a static map by computing, online, a set of convex regions in free space. We model moving obstacles as ellipsoids and provide a correct bound to approximate the collision region, given by the Minkowsky sum of an ellipse and a circle. Our framework is agnostic to the robot model. We present experimental results with a mobile robot navigating in indoor environments populated with humans. Our method is executed fully onboard without the need of external support and can be applied to other robot morphologies such as autonomous cars.

AB Underwater image processing is very challenging due to its environmental conditions and poor sunlight. Images captured from the ocean using autonomous vehicles are often non-uniformly illuminated and contain noise due to the underlying environment. Object recognition is a challenging task under water due to the variation in the environment, target shape and orientation. Traditional algorithms based on spatial information may not lead to accurate segmentation as the intensity variation is often less in underwater images. Texture information representing the characteristics of the object is needed. Statistical features like autocorrelation, sum average, sum variance and sum entropy were extracted. These were fed as input to learning algorithms and training was done to effectively classify the object of interest and background. Chain coding was further applied for object recognition. The proposed methodology achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 96%.

DE Containment control; distributed control; double-integrator dynamics;

AB This note studies the distributed containment control problem for a group of autonomous vehicles modeled by double-integrator dynamics with multiple dynamic leaders. The objective is to drive the followers into the convex hull spanned by the dynamic leaders under the constraints that the velocities and the accelerations of both the leaders and the followers are not available, the leaders are neighbors of only a subset of the followers, and the followers have only local interaction. Two containment control algorithms via only position measurements of the agents are proposed. Theoretical analysis shows that the followers will move into the convex hull spanned by the dynamic leaders if the network topology among the followers is undirected, for each follower there exists at least one leader that has a directed path to the follower, and the parameters in the algorithm are properly chosen. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB Simultaneous planning and control of a large variety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is tackled using the harmonic potential field (HPF) approach. A dense reference velocity field generated from the gradient of an HPF is used to regulate the velocity of the UAV concerned in a manner that would propel the UAV to a target point while enforcing the constraints on behavior that were a priori encoded in the reference field. The regulation process is carried-out using a novel and simple concept called the: virtual velocity attractor (VVA). The combined effect of the HPF gradient and the VVA is found able to yield an efficient, easy to implement, well-behaved and provably-correct context-sensitive control action that suits a wide variety of UAVs. The approach is developed and basic proofs of correctness are provided along with simulation results.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) station keeping (SK) in shallow water area. During SK, an AUV is required to maintain position and orientation with respect to a fixed reference point at the sea floor. When AUV operates in shallow water, high-frequency disturbances due to waves will significantly affect the motion of the AUV. In order to derive wave disturbance information for control purposes, a nonlinear observer is first designed to estimate the shallow water wave velocities and AUV relative velocities by using position and attitude measurement. Using the observer estimates, a nonlinear output feedback controller is subsequently synthesized by applying observer backstepping technique. Global exponential stability (GES) of the proposed nonlinear observer-controller design is proved through Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation studies on a model based on an actual AUV were performed to verify the performance of the proposed nonlinear observer and output feedback controller.

ID MISSILES
AB Future end game interception scenarios of autonomous uncrewed flying vehicles are expected to be characterized by variable velocities and lateral acceleration limits. A time-varying linear pursuit-evasion game model with bounded controls is presented that can be used to analyze such scenarios. The usefulness of this model is demonstrated by simulations of a realistic ballistic missile defense scenario, as an example. It is shown that a differential game guidance law derived using this time-varying model provides a significant improvement in the homing accuracy compared to a guidance law based on a model with constant velocities and lateral acceleration limits. Moreover, the time-varying linear model provides a much more accurate prediction of the miss distance, confirming its validity. Also a general review of possible structures of the game space decomposition is presented. One of these structures implies that even if the pursuer does not have a maneuverability advantage over the evader, but has an agility advantage, a zero miss distance can still be achieved for some initial conditions.

AB Machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) methods have been used successfully in recent years to solve problems in many areas, including image recognition, unsupervised and supervised classification, game-playing, system identification and prediction, and autonomous vehicle control. Data-driven machine learning methods have also been applied to fusion energy research for over 2 decades, including significant advances in the areas of disruption prediction, surrogate model generation, and experimental planning. The advent of powerful and dedicated computers specialized for large-scale parallel computation, as well as advances in statistical inference algorithms, have greatly enhanced the capabilities of these computational approaches to extract scientific knowledge and bridge gaps between theoretical models and practical implementations. Large-scale commercial success of various ML/AI applications in recent years, including robotics, industrial processes, online image recognition, financial system prediction, and autonomous vehicles, have further demonstrated the potential for data-driven methods to produce dramatic transformations in many fields. These advances, along with the urgency of need to bridge key gaps in knowledge for design and operation of reactors such as ITER, have driven planned expansion of efforts in ML/AI within the US government and around the world. The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science programs in Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) and Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) have organized several activities to identify best strategies and approaches for applying ML/AI methods to fusion energy research. This paper describes the results of a joint FES/ASCR DOE-sponsored Research Needs Workshop on Advancing Fusion with Machine Learning, held April 30-May 2, 2019, in Gaithersburg, MD (full report available at). The workshop drew on broad representation from both FES and ASCR scientific communities, and identified seven Priority Research Opportunities (PRO's) with high potential for advancing fusion energy. In addition to the PRO topics themselves, the workshop identified research guidelines to maximize the effectiveness of ML/AI methods in fusion energy science, which include focusing on uncertainty quantification, methods for quantifying regions of validity of models and algorithms, and applying highly integrated teams of ML/AI mathematicians, computer scientists, and fusion energy scientists with domain expertise in the relevant areas.

AB Perhaps the most substantial single obstacle to progress of space exploration and utilization of space for human benefit is the safety & reliability and the inherent cost of launching to, and returning from, space. The primary influence in the high costs of current launch systems (the same is true for commercial and military aircraft and most other reusable systems) is the operations, maintenance and infrastructure portion of the program's total life cycle costs. Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) maintenance and design have traditionally been two separate engineering disciplines with often conflicting objectives - maximizing ease of maintenance versus optimizing performance, size and cost. Testability analysis, an element of Informed Maintenance (IM), has been an ad hoc, manual effort, in which maintenance engineers attempt to identify an efficient method of troubleshooting for the given product, with little or no control over product design. Therefore, testability deficiencies in the design cannot be rectified. It is now widely recognized that IM must be engineered into the product at the design stage itself, so that an optimal compromise is achieved between system maintainability and performance.
   The elements of IM include testability analysis, diagnostics/prognostics, automated maintenance scheduling, automated logistics coordination, paperless documentation and data mining. IM derives its heritage from complimentary NASA science, space and aeronautic enterprises such as the on-board autonomous Remote Agent Architecture recently flown on NASA's Deep Space 1 Probe as well as commercial industries that employ quick turnaround operations. Commercial technologies and processes supporting NASA's IM initiatives include condition based maintenance technologies from Boeing's Commercial 777 Aircraft and Lockheed-Martin's F-22 Fighter, automotive computer diagnostics and autonomous controllers that enable 100,000 mile maintenance free operations, and locomotive monitoring system software.
   This paper will summarize NASA's long-term strategy, development, and implementation plans for Informed Maintenance for next generation RLVs. This will be done through a convergence into a single IM vision the work being performed throughout NASA, industry and academia. Additionally, a current status of IM development throughout NASA programs such as the Space Shuttle, X-33, X-34 and X-37 will be provided and will conclude with an overview of near-term work that is being initiated in FY00 to support NASA's 2(nd) Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle Program.

AB Experimental identification (EI) methods are often discussed in the literature because of the importance of building reliable dynamical models and control systems. This is especially true when thinking about autonomous vehicle control. An important characteristic of EI approaches is the necessity of a signal with good excitation properties to model the system, which is usually obtained by optimal input design approaches. Although this is a method that reproduces the actual behavior through a mathematical tool, it can ignore unmodeled features such as asymmetry or even constructive addictions. In this way, this work aims to construct a hybrid identification method through a mathematical model estimated in convolution with a deep neural network (DNN). The Gated recurrent unit (GRU) must be able to determine the states of the next instant based on the input and output of the theoretical model. The results are promising and suggest that this association is valid and capable of refining the outputs of a purely mathematical model.

AB Fixed-wing, solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) can use thermals to expand the duration of flight. Nevertheless, due to the demand for calculating the thermal state parameters of the SUAV during flight, the existing methods still have some shortcomings in their practical applications, such as an inaccurate location estimation of the thermal and an insufficient seeking efficiency. In this paper, by integrating the Gaussian distribution model of thermal updraft of the pitching and roll moment of SUAVs, it is demonstrated that the approach introduced is superior to the traditional methods, disregarding the pitching moment. The simulation indicated that the accuracy and convergence speed of the thermal state estimation, performed while employing the cubature Kalman filter (CKF), are significantly improved after the SUAVs pitching moment is considered. The proposed method improves the automaticity and intelligence of SUAVs autonomous thermal search and enhances the cognitive and decision-making capabilities of SUAVs.

AB Resilience is a dimension of trade study analysis that must be accounted for in early conceptual system design because it can influence cost, reliability, performance, and overall lifecycle cost. Traditional trade studies, which focus on risk, safety, and costs aspects analysis are no longer sufficient because they only account for predicted and known disruptions. This article proposes a practical and implementable methodology for measuring, predicting, and architecting system resilience during conceptual design that considers both known and unknown disruptions. This article extends the current literature by motivating the resilience curve using a Markov process, verifying resilience with empirical data, and incorporating the interaction between subsystems using common cause failure with the binomial failure rate. A verified simulation model is used as a predictive analysis tool and applied to an unmanned surface vehicle case study.

AB Since the density of LiDAR points reduces significantly with increasing distance, popular 3D detectors tend to learn spatial features from dense points and ignore very sparse points in the far range. As a result, their performance degrades dramatically beyond 50 meters. Motivated by the above problem, we introduce a novel approach to jointly detect objects from multimodal sensor data, with two main contributions. First, we leverage PointPainting [15] to develop a new key point sampling algorithm, which encodes the complex scene into a few representative points with approximately similar point density. Further, we fuse a dynamic continuous occupancy heatmap to refine the final proposal. In addition, we feed radar points into the network, which allows it to take into account additional cues. We evaluate our method on the widely used nuScenes dataset. Our method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods in the far range by a large margin and also achieves comparable performance in the near range.

AB The zero-velocity update (ZUPT) algorithm provides valuable state information to maintain the inertial navigation system (INS) reliability when stationary conditions are satisfied. Employing ZUPT along with leveraging non-holonomic constraints can greatly benefit wheeled mobile robot dead-reckoning localization accuracy. However, determining how often they should be employed requires consideration to balance localization accuracy and traversal rate for planetary rovers. To address this, we investigate when to autonomously initiate stops to improve wheel-inertial odometry (WIO) localization performance with ZUPT. To do this, we propose a 3D dead-reckoning approach that predicts wheel slippage while the rover is in motion and forecasts the appropriate time to stop without changing any rover hardware or major rover operations. We validate with field tests that our approach is viable on different terrain types and achieves a 3D localization accuracy of similar to 97% over 650 m drives on rough terrain.

AB Various smart connected devices are emerging like automated driving cars, autonomous robots, and remote-controlled construction vehicles. These devices have vision systems to conduct their operations without collision. Machine vision technology is becoming more accessible to perceive self-position and/or the surrounding environment thanks to the great advances in deep learning technologies. The accurate perception information of these smart connected devices makes it possible to predict wireless link quality (LQ). This paper proposes an LQ prediction scheme that applies machine learning to HD camera output to forecast the influence of surrounding mobile objects on LQ. The proposed scheme utilizes object detection based on deep learning and learns the relationship between the detected object position information and the LQ. Outdoor experiments show that LQ prediction proposal can well predict the throughput for around 1 s into the future in a 5.6-GHz wireless LAN channel.

AB Many observers believe that solar with storage, plus EVs, are emerging as the inevitable future of the energy economy. How fast could this transition occur? This paper reviews the Solar Dominance Hypothesis (SDH). The SDH argues that solar, storage, and related energy and business model innovations are fundamentally disruptive, not incremental technologies. For economic reasons, solar plus storage will provide at least half of electric power generation globally by 2030. In evaluating challenges to the hypothesis, we argue that local, regional and national policy could either impede or substantially support the speed at which solar dominance materializes. At the same time, if the hypothesis is in fact on track, "energy policy' in the 2020's will have to transition to a focus addressing economic, political and social concerns including job transitions, stranded economic assets and geopolitical shifts driven by energy and related disruptions.

AB The number of civilian and military applications using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increased during the last years and the forecasts for upcoming years are exponential. One of the current major challenges consist in considering UAVs as autonomous swarms to address some limitations of single UAV usage such as autonomy, range of operation and resilience. In this article we propose novel mobility models for multi-level swarms of collaborating UAVs used for the coverage of a given area. These mobility models generate unpredictable trajectories using a chaotic solution of a dynamical system. We detail how the chaotic properties are used to structure the exploration of an unknown area and enhance the exploration part of an Ant Colony Optimization method. Empirical evidence of the improvement of the coverage efficiency obtained by our mobility models is provided via simulation. It clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

AB In this paper, a Multi-fidelity optimization method via information fusion with uncertainty (MFOIFU) is proposed. MFOIFU combines prediction uncertainty of kriging and model uncertainty, aiming at reducing computational cost of optimization and guaranteeing reliability of the optima. Firstly, the uncertainty of Low-fidelity (LF) and High-fidelity (HF) models is confirmed, respectively. After that, the optimal estimation theory of Kalman filter is employed to fuse information from LF and HF models. Then, the fused model is optimized and a distinctive updating strategy is presented to supplement feasible solutions. The newly introduced MFOIFU is verified through eight benchmark examples. Results showed that MFOIFU has some advantages over the Single high-fidelity optimization (SHO) method and some of the well-established multi-fidelity methods on computational expense and optimization efficiency. Finally, the MFOIFU method is successfully applied to the shell structure design of an Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).

AB This paper focuses on the simultaneous extrinsico-dometric calibration of a mobile robot system equipped with odometric devices and a monocular camera. Most current approaches are based on either optimization or Gaussian filter, which depends on a manually provided initial guess. In this paper, we propose a two-step fully automatic calibration algorithm, which does not require any prior knowledge of the un-calibrated parameters. In the first step, both the odometric parameters and the extrinsic ones are estimated through a non-iterative auto initialization process. In the second step, a joint optimization problem is solved iteratively to obtain a refined calibration result. By exploiting the planar motion constraints of the landmark measurements, our auto initialization method outperforms a comparison approach in robustness against the image noise. Experiments are conducted with data sets collected from both simulation and an autonomous guided vehicle system, which validates the improvement.

AB Aiming at the problem of low segmentation accuracy and high computation time by applying existing segmentation methods for underwater color images, this paper has proposed an underwater color image segmentation method via RGB color channel fusion. Based on thresholding segmentation methods to conduct fast segmentation, the proposed method relies on dynamic estimation of the optimal weights for RGB channel fusion to obtain the grayscale image with high foreground-background contrast and reaches high segmentation accuracy. To verify the segmentation accuracy of the proposed method, the authors have conducted various underwater comparative experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to illumination, and it is superior to existing methods in terms of both segmentation accuracy and computation time. Moreover, a segmentation technique is proposed for image sequences for real-time autonomous underwater vehicle operations. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB Traffic sign recognition plays an important role in driver assistant systems and intelligent autonomous vehicles. Its real-time performance is highly desirable in addition to its recognition performance. This paper aims to deal with real-time traffic sign recognition, i.e., localizing what type of traffic sign appears in which area of an input image at a fast processing time. To achieve this goal, we first propose an extremely fast detection module, which is 20 times faster than the existing best detection module. Our detection module is based on traffic sign proposal extraction and classification built upon a color probability model and a color HOG. Then, we harvest from a convolutional neural network to further classify the detected signs into their subclasses within each superclass. Experimental results on both German and Chinese roads show that both our detection and classification methods achieve comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods, with significantly improved computational efficiency.

AB Minimum-time trajectories of unmanned aircraft in a horizontal plane are studied. The boundary conditions comprise initial and final locations and heading angles. The system model assumes instantaneously changing velocity. We view this model as a generalization of the constant-velocity model. As the study of that model has shwon, the favorable trajectories that meet these boundary conditions, which have an analytical solution and comply with the minimum principle (MP), are of a hang-level-bang type. Thus, we adopt such trajectories to the current problem and investigate their compliance with the MP. The interesting result of this study is that such trajectories do not satisfy the necessary conditions of the MP inherently (as was the case in the constant velocity model), but under restrictive conditions, which are derived and analyzed. Analytic solutions are given together with some examples of the trajectories obtained. A numerical example of an optimal trajectory (with no restrictions on the number of switching points) is examined with regard to the general conditions for compliance with the MP.

AB Focusing on the low efficiency and weak universality in autonomous path planning of harvesting robots during the process of irregular farmland operations, a full coverage path planning method based on multi-objective constraints is proposed. Firstly, in sight of the influence of the shape of the farmland, the minimum turning radius of the harvesting robot, the distribution of the unloading position, and the manual operation experience on working path, a full coverage path planning model for the irregular quadrilateral farmland is established, which significantly improve the adaptability of path planning algorithm to working environment and performance of the harvesting robot. Secondly, according to the farmland boundary, selected operating direction, and estimated output of the operating row, an operating environment model is established. Then the corner turning method of the irregular quadrilateral farmland is researched, and the turning path by taking turning area as optimization target is designed. Finally, the shuttle method and the improved ant colony algorithm are used to design the full coverage path respectively, by considering the constrains of the harvesting robot's granary capacity, total travel distance, full-load travel distance and unloading position distribution as constrains. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can perform intelligent planning under the multi-objective constraint according to the principle of maximum load rate. When solving the traversal sequence of job rows, the algorithm is not affected by the traversal sequence, the full load rate is greater than 90%, and full coverage path planning is realized.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; MASS-SPECTROMETER; VELOCITY
AB Many common ocean sensor systems measure a localized space above a single sensor element. Single-point measurements give magnitude but not necessarily direction information. Expanding single sensor elements, such as used in salinity sensors, into arrays permits spatial distribution measurements and allows flux visualizations. Furthermore, applying microsystem technology to these macro sensor systems can yield imaging arrays with high-resolution spatial/temporal sensing functions. Extending such high spatial resolution imaging over large areas is a desirable feature for new vision modes on autonomous robotic systems and for deployable ocean sensor systems. The work described here explores the use of printed circuit board (PCB) technology for new sensing concepts and designs. In order to create rigid-conformal, large area imaging camera systems, we have merged flexible PCB substrates with rigid constructions from 3-D printing. This approach merges the 2-D flexible electronics world of printed circuits with the 3-D printed packaging world. Furthermore, employing architectures used by biology as a basis for our imaging systems, we explored naturally and biologically inspired designs, their relationships to visual imagining, and alternate mechanical systems of perception. Through the use of bio-inspiration, a framework is laid out to base further research on design for packaging of ocean sensors and arrays. Using 3-D printed exoskeleton's rigid form with flexible printed circuits, one can create systems that are both rigid and form-fitting with 3-D shape and enable new sensor systems for various ocean sensory applications.

AB A nonholonomic under-actuated robot with a bounded control range travels inside an unknown and unstructured 3D tunnel bounded by a generic 2D surface. The robot has access to the nearest point of the surface and measures the distance to the surface along any ray from a narrow beam emitted from the robot around the direction to the nearest point. We present a new navigation law that ensures constant advancement of the robot through the tunnel, along with respecting a given safety margin to its surface, driving the robot to the desired distance to it, and subsequently maintaining this distance. This law is reactive: it generates the current control as a reflex-like reaction to the current observation. Rigorous justification of the proposed guidance approach is provided: its applicability and performance are confirmed by computer simulation tests. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter, a novel methodology using electrotextile fabrics is employed for designing a highly transparent, wideband frequency selective surface (FSS) in the millimeter-wave band. The standard metallization is replaced by a low-cost, extremely fine conductive mesh (RadioScreen or VeilShield) that gives to the periodic structure high see-through properties in the 27-35 GHz frequency band. An acrylic dielectric material that is easily available and very low-cost has been used as a substrate. Simulation and measurement results alike are presented to validate the principle. By assessing the high transparency properties of the FSS and its high performance in terms of stopband, this FSS could be seen as a potential candidate for multiple 5G applications like for on-chip shielding, autonomous vehicles, antenna and on-chip antenna devices, radar cross section augmentation, robotic guided paths, and electromagnetic interference protection.

AB Mixed traffic between automatic guided cars and human road users makes it necessary to understand cooperative behaviour between road users in order to adapt automated behaviour to human expectations. Road traffic offers various challenges, one being cooperative situations, which are not regulated by law. For example a t-intersection in which one road user is driving straight forward and two road users are turning left. To solve this situation the road users have to cooperate with each other. Different kinds of approaching behaviours in such situations were generated and analyzed according to cooperation readiness, preference to drive first and perceived safety of the situation by means of an experiment.
   The results show that in complex situations - like the investigated scenario - human road users prefer not to drive first. Additionally a high cooperation readiness of the opposite driver combined with a defensive driving style received higher ratings in the "confidence of passing". (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB When self-interested agents plan individually, interactions that prevent them from executing their actions as planned may arise. In these coordination problems, game-theoretic planning can be used to enhance the agents' strategic behavior considering the interactions as part of the agents' utility. In this work, we define a general-sum game in which interactions such as conflicts and congestions are reflected in the agents' utility. We propose a better-response planning strategy that guarantees convergence to an equilibrium joint plan by imposing a tax to agents involved in conflicts. We apply our approach to a real-world problem in which agents are Electric Autonomous Vehicles (EAVs). The EAVs intend to find a joint plan that ensures their individual goals are achievable in a transportation scenario where congestion and conflicting situations may arise. Although the task is computationally hard, as we theoretically prove, the experimental results show that our approach outperforms similar approaches in both performance and solution quality.

AB Active large scale surveillance of indoor and outdoor environments with multiple cameras is becoming an undeniable necessity in today's connected world. Enhanced computational and storage capabilities in smart cameras establish them as promising platforms for implementing intelligent and autonomous surveillance networks. However, poor resolution, limited number of samples per object, and pose variation in multi-view surveillance streams, make the task of efficient image representation highly challenging. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework for features extraction using embedded processing on smart cameras. Efficient, high performance, pre-trained CNNs are separately fine-tuned on persons and vehicles to obtain discriminative, low dimensional features from segmented surveillance objects. Furthermore, multi-view queries of surveillance objects are used to improve retrieval performance. Experiments reveal better efficiency and retrieval performance in different surveillance datasets.

AB Autonomous Lagrangian profilers are now widely used as measurement and monitoring platforms, notably in observation programs as Argo. In a typical mode of operation, the profilers drift passively at their parking depth before making a vertical profile to go back to the surface. This paper presents simple and computationally-efficient control strategies to actively select and use ocean currents so that a profiler can autonomously reach a desired destination. After briefly presenting a typical profiler and possible mechanical modifications for a coastal environment, we introduce simple mathematical models for the profiler and the currents it will use. We then present simple feedback controllers that, using the direction of the currents and taking into account the configuration of the environment (coastal or deep-sea), is able to steer the profiler to any desired horizontal location. To illustrate the approach, a few results are presented using both simulated currents and real current velocity profiles from the North Sea.

AB This paper presents ail application of a multihierarchical, symbolic model of large-scale space for representing the environment of a robotic wheelchair that has been automated for assistance to mobility impaired people. Rehabilitation robotics has an issue that is not present in mobile robotics: the need for an interface with the human driver. Our hierarchical model demonstrates its suitability to represent the environment in a structure easily manageable by the human (it serves as a good interface with the human's cognitive map) and. at the same time, provides better performance than flat topological maps in route planning. This is achieved by including multiple hierarchies of abstraction in the model, which improves the adaptation of the vehicle to its tasks and environment. The paper describes and illustrates an experiment in which the, wheelchair, with the assistance of the human driver, builds a model of space and uses it for autonomous navigation.

AB Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have gained prominence in wireless sensor technology, featuring resource-limited sensor nodes deployed in challenging underwater environments. To address challenges like power consumption, network lifetime, node deployment, topology, and propagation delays, cooperative transmission protocols like co-operative (Co-UWSN) and co-operative energy-efficient routing (CEER) have been proposed. These protocols utilize broadcast capabilities and neighbor head node (NHN) selection for cooperative routing. This research introduces NBEER, a novel neighbor-based energy-efficient routing protocol tailored for UWSNs. NBEER aims to surpass the limitations of Co-UWSN and CEER by optimizing NHNS and cooperative mechanisms to achieve load balancing and enhance network performance. Through comprehensive MATLAB simulations, we evaluated NBEER against Co-UWSN and CEER, demonstrating its superior performance across various metrics. NBEER significantly maximizes end-to-end delay, reduces energy consumption, improves packet delivery ratio, extends network lifetime, and enhances total received packets analysis compared to the existing protocols.

DT Article
DE Uncertainty-conditioned policy; robust behavior
AB Deep reinforcement learning has been used to solve complex tasks in various fields, particularly in robotics control. However, agents trained using deep reinforcement learning have a problem of taking overconfident actions, even when the input state is far from the learned state distribution. This restricts deep reinforcement learning from being applied to real-world environments as overconfident actions in unlearned situations can result in catastrophic events; such as the collision of an autonomous vehicle. To address this, the agents should know "what they do not know" and choose an action by considering not only the state but also its uncertainty. In this study, we propose a novel uncertainty-conditioned policy (UNICON) inspired by the human behavior of changing policies according to uncertainty, e.g., slowing a car on a narrow road that has never been visited before. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to unfamiliar scenarios that are not seen during training.

AB The rapid development and deployment of the Cellular V2X (C-V2X) require a highly reliable support system for many vehicular key applications. However, the current standard sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SB-SPS) protocol yields poor performance in terms of reliability, due to the hidden terminal problem and the half-duplex issue. In this paper, we propose a reliable self-adaptive MAC protocol for C-V2X Mode 4 (autonomous sidelink). It utilizes frame information and RSSI to exclusively scheduling resource blocks in two-hop neighbors, and dynamically adjusts scheduling and frame length according to changes of the network environment. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol achieves significantly higher PDR and lower number of the packet collisions than SB-SPS and IEEE 802.11p.

AB Hybrid energy systems such as PV-battery-diesel have been identified as an effective option to solve the power-supply problem and, therefore, the optimal sizing of such hybrid PV systems becomes important. Also, activities related to the demand side of the power system such as demand response programs are interested and, electric vehicle to grid (V2G) parking lot as a controllable load unit is recently used with demand response potential through charging and discharging V2Gs according to electricity price variations. The goal of this study is to develop and examine a heuristic optimization algorithm to solve the optimal sizing for hybrid PV-battery-diesel system with considerations for V2G parking lot as a controllable load. Simulation results show that utilization of V2G parking lot can reduce total cost for optimal sizing of hybrid PV-battery-diesel system by 5.21%.

AB This paper presents a framework for teaching robotics at engineering university degrees in a practical way. It is open source, multiplatform (Linux, Windows, MacOS) and emphasizes the programming of the robot intelligence. It consists of a collection of exercises of several types, which are similar to the new robotic applications (autonomous vehicles, drones, vacuum cleaners...). It uses the Gazebo simulator and the Python programming language. For each exercise an academic application has been created which performs all the auxiliary tasks like graphical interface, connection to the sensors and actuators, timing of the code, etc. and hosts the student's code, who can focus on the perception and control algorithms. Each academic application combines an infrastructure part, which it is provided and remains hidden, and the student part, who simply fills a form file with the robot logic for such exercise. It has been successfully used in several subjects at engineering degree, master and robotics introductory courses.

AB Learning from the motion principle of quadrotor, a symmetric propeller AUV, which has small size and low velocity is designed. Compared with the AUV equipped with rudders, it has better maneuverability and manipulation at low velocity. According to the Newton-Euler method, the 6 DOF kinematic model and dynamic model of the propeller AUV are established. A stability controller that consists of 3 different PID controllers is designed. It makes the depth and attitude angle as trigger conditions, and the relevant controller is chosen in different moving process. The simulation experiments simulate ideal motion state and disturbed motion state, and experiments results show that the stability controller based on combined sections method can make the best of mature technology of PID, and meet the control requirements in different stages. It has a higher respond speed and accuracy, improving the stability of the propeller AUV under the disturbance of complex ocean currents.

AB The heterogeneity of turbulent structure in a near-field river plume is evaluated through the application of three distinct measurement techniques: turbulent overturn analysis, direct turbulence measurement using microstructure sensors mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and a larger scale control volume approach. These techniques exploit the preturbulent potential energy available for conversion to turbulent energy, the kinetic energy associated with active turbulence, and the artifacts of turbulence demonstrated through a modified density structure, respectively. Comparisons between these methods indicate that all three techniques can provide robust estimates of mean turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates. Results suggest a highly heterogeneous turbulent field, with significant overturns occupying a volume fraction of less than 10%, and active turbulence occupying a volume fraction only 2-3 times larger. The combined data sets are also used to estimate expected means and confidence limits for overturn-derived dissipation rates associated with varying sample sizes.

AB Most of the current quality assessment techniques interpret an image quality as a measure of its fidelity with another reference image, assuming the availability of that "perfect" image. It has been the concern of many researchers around the world to algorithmically assess the quality of image sequences based on human visual perception. This paper presents a novel technique for quantitatively assessing the quality of image sequences without the need for a reference image and in a way that precisely correlates to human judgement on quality. This research is a part of a larger framework that incorporates multi-objective optimisation algorithms to optimise the quality metrics of compressed videos acquired by autonomous vehicles and transmitted over low-bandwidth communication channels. Our system was trained on a dataset that involved 700 videos of 5 different categories. We validate the performance of our model and show that it highly correlates to the human subjective quality assessment.

AB Ocean climate research is being carried out considering the use of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the Antarctic Ocean. In this study, to understand the characteristics of sound propagation in Lutzow-Holm bay of the Antarctic Ocean for acoustical communication with an AUV, we estimate pulse waveforms using a two-dimensional (2D) parabolic equation method. We assumed that one transmitter each is placed at three different depths (50, 100, and 150 m) and the propagation range is up to 39 km in a traverse line OW. We calculate the pulse propagation in the Antarctic Ocean using three bottom models to determine its influences on pulse wave amplitude by bathymetry. The results show a variation in pulse wave amplitude of about 3 dB when the source depth is 100 m. The pulse amplitude varies from 5 to -10 dB when the source depth changes from 50 to 150 m.

AB We propose a neural predictor-based dynamic surface parallel control method for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems in this brief. The dynamics of the physical system is in the strict-feedback form and subject to multi-input, multi-output, and uncertain nonlinearities. The parallel control method is developed based on an ACP methodology, including three steps. Firstly, an artificial system to the physical system is developed using an echo state network-based neural predictor structure. Next, a high-order tuner-based computational experiment is developed to achieve online adaptive training of the echo state network. Finally, parallel execution is developed by using a second-order linear tracking differentiator-based dynamic surface control approach. The total closed-loop system can be proved to be input-to-state stable. The effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results is demonstrated by a simulation of trajectory tracking of an autonomous surface vehicle.

AB In this study, the crow search algorithm is used for the first time to address the parameter identification problem of the ship motion model in the autonomous navigation of ships. A target-oriented crow search algorithm (TO-CSA) is developed to use in this new search technique to identify model parameters, which greatly improves the speed of convergence, accuracy, and stability of the identification results. The main advantages of this approach over previous research are its improved computational accuracy and precise identification of ship parameters with fewer data or under specific sea conditions, which are in line with actual sailing scenarios. Additionally, the feasibility and efficiency of the created algorithm are evaluated by simulations and actual ship trials, and the engineering applicability of this research is shown based on the effectiveness of ship direction autopilot control.

TI Research on Satisfaction of Driverless Function Based on the Artificial

SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB With the popularization of driverless technology, more and more vehicles have begun to apply this technology. Under these circumstances, user satisfaction with driverless function begins to have an increasing impact on car sales. This paper adopts the KANO model, a two-dimensional model, to analyze users' attitudes toward driverless functions. It is found that users have a high dependence on functions such as forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, and stated-speed sign recognition. Therefore, relevant enterprises should continue to develop these functions. Besides, users have high expectations for functions such as blind spot detection systems and rear cross-traffic alerts. Enterprises can achieve more support from users by optimizing these functions. Functions like lane-keeping assist, lane departure warning, parking distance control, and door open warning systems belong to indifferent attributes of driverless function, which are not cared about by users. There is no need for enterprises to optimize these functions. However, the lane change assist system has been criticized by users and should be improved by corresponding manufacturers.

AB Infrared imaging is a crucial technique in a multitude of applications, including night vision, autonomous vehicle navigation, optical tomography, and food quality control. Conventional infrared imaging technologies, however, require the use of materials such as narrow bandgap semiconductors, which are sensitive to thermal noise and often require cryogenic cooling. We demonstrate a compact all-optical alternative to perform infrared imaging in a metasurface composed of GaAs semiconductor nanoantennas, using a nonlinear wave-mixing process. We experimentally show the upconversion of short-wave infrared wavelengths via the coherent parametric process of sum-frequency generation. In this process, an infrared image of a target is mixed inside the metasurface with a strong pump beam, translating the image from the infrared to the visible in a nanoscale ultrathin imaging device. Our results open up new opportunities for the development of compact infrared imaging devices with applications in infrared vision and life sciences.

AB This essay develops three key claims made in my 2018 book, Exceptional Technologies. Part one argues for 'trivialising the transcendental', to remove stigmas attached to the word 'transcendental' in philosophy in general and philosophy of technology in particular. Part two outlines the concept of 'exceptional technologies'. These are artefacts and practices that show up as limit cases for our received pictures of what constitutes a 'technology' (what I refer to as our 'pictures of method') and that force us to reassess the conditions for the possibility of these pictures. I focus on the case of autonomous vehicles here, arguing that Google Street View provides a relatively better picture for approaching philosophical issues at stake than the famous 'Trolley Problem'. Part three then concludes with a focus on Heidegger's 'Question Concerning Technology' essay. Heidegger asserts that philosophical questioning 'builds a way' (1977: 3). I argue that philosophical approaches to technologies might better be considered in terms of a multidimensional problem space.

AB Object recognition in underwater images becomes a challenging task because of its poor visibility conditions. Marine scientists often prefer automation tools for object recognition as large amount of data is captured everyday with the help of autonomous underwater vehicles. The challenge for classification in such underwater images is the limited color information. An attempt is made to recognize objects in underwater images using an adaptive Gaussian mixture model. The Gaussian mixture model performs accurate object segmentation provided the number of clusters is predefined. Optimization techniques like genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and differential evolution were analyzed for initializing the parameter set. Differential evolution is known for its accurate decision making in fewer iterations and proved to be better for initializing the number of clusters for the Gaussian mixture model. Further for object recognition, inner distance shape matching technique was applied. The proposed classification method achieved a maximum accuracy of 99%.

AB The rapid proliferation of intelligent systems (e.g., fully autonomous vehicles) in today's society relies on sensors with low latency and computational effort. Yet current sensing systems ignore most available a priori knowledge, notably in the design of the hardware level, such that they fail to extract as much task-relevant information per measurement as possible. Here, a "learned integrated sensing pipeline" (LISP), including in an end-to-end fashion both physical and processing layers, is shown to enable joint learning of optimal measurement strategies and a matching processing algorithm, making use of a priori knowledge on task, scene, and measurement constraints. Numerical results demonstrate accuracy improvements around 15% for object recognition tasks with limited numbers of measurements, using dynamic metasurface apertures capable of transceiving programmable microwave patterns. Moreover, it is concluded that the optimal learned microwave patterns are nonintuitive, underlining the importance of the LISP paradigm in current sensorization trends.

AB Connected devices in Internet-of-Things (IoT) continuously generate enormous amount of data, which is transient and would be requested by IoT application users, such as autonomous vehicles. Transmitting IoT data through wireless networks would lead to congestions and long delays, which can be tackled by caching IoT data at the network edge. However, it is challenging to jointly consider IoT data-transiency and dynamic context characteristics. In this paper, we advocate the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the problem of caching IoT data at the edge without knowing future IoT data popularity, user request pattern, and other context characteristics. By defining data freshness metrics, the aim of determining IoT data caching policy is to strike a balance between the communication cost and the loss of data freshness. Extensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based IoT data caching policy outperforms other baseline policies.

AB A key goal of contemporary agriculture is to dramatically increase production of food, feed, fiber, and biofuel products in a sustainable fashion, facing the pressure of diminishing farm labor supply. Agricultural robots can accelerate plant breeding and advance data-driven precision farming with significantly reduced labor inputs by providing task-appropriate sensing and actuation at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. This article highlights the distinctive challenges imposed on ground robots by agricultural environments, which are characterized by wide variations in environmental conditions, diversity and complexity of plant canopy structures, and intraspecies biological variation of physical and chemical characteristics and responses to the environment. Existing approaches to address these challenges are presented, along with their limitations; possible future directions are also discussed. Two key observations are that biology ( breeding) and horticultural practices can reduce variabilities at the source and that publicly available benchmark data sets are needed to increase perception robustness and performance despite variability.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are an excellent platform for autonomous exploration. Most MAVs rely mainly on cameras for buliding a map of the 3D environment. Therefore, vision-based MAVs require an efficient exploration algorithm to select viewpoints that provide informative measurements. In this paper, we propose an exploration approach that selects in real time the next-best-view that maximizes the expected information gain of new measurements. In addition, we take into account the cost of reaching a new viewpoint in terms of distance and predictability of the flight path for a human observer. Finally, our approach selects a path that reduces the risk of crashes when the expected battery life comes to an end, while still maximizing the information gain in the process. We implemented and thoroughly tested our approach and the experiments show that it offers an improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of precision of the reconstruction, execution time, and smoothness of the path.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper deals with the genericmodeling of systems of systems (SoSs) using agent-based modeling. SoSs are large-scale systems, including numerous-possibly heterogeneousinteracting component systems evolving in a dynamic environment. The aim of this paper is to provide generic formalism allowing to represent and control the whole complexity of a SoS using agent-based simulations. In particular, organizational aspects of SoSs are managed with the Agent-Group-Role model. Functional aspects, guiding SoSs to accomplish their global goals, are handled via a functional specification. Multilevel aspects are modeled with the Influence Reaction Model for Multilevel Simulation (IRM4MLS) agent-based meta-model. Models generated using this formalism encompass static and dynamic aspects of SoSs. They consider reorganization of SoSs caused by changes of goals or subsystem capacity. All these elements are illustrated in this paper using a SoS case study of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles initiated by the Intelligent Transportation for Dynamic Environment (InTraDE) European project to automate the port container logistic.

AB As urban roads expand over time, road surface features become more complicated and critical to driving safety. Constructing a database of road surface features through an automatic process is particularly crucial when these features are applied to the fields of facility maintenance, autonomous vehicle assistance, 3D cyber city construction, and navigation-information renewal. This paper proposes a fully automatic approach for reconstructing road surface features based on the terrestrial mobile light detection and ranging (lidar) technique. Analysis steps were developed and an experiment was performed using a real lidar data set. The results indicated that the proposed road surface reconstruction method is feasible and that the classification indices, correctness and completeness, were both higher than 90%. Finally, the uncertainty associated with each analysis stage was explicitly assessed through an error budget analysis. This can provide a guideline for practical applications and further system optimization. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Emerging Methods of Signal Timing Optimization

DT Article
AB Many believe that there is little room for improvement in the signal timing optimization process. To the contrary, recent advances imply that the current practice is far from perfected. Rapidly evolving intelligent transportation system (ITS) technologies are not close to being used to their full potential. Multimodalism and "complete streets" are hot topics within the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), but their connection to signal optimization is not being made. Advances in optimization theory have not yet made an impact on signal timing. Computer speeds have increased exponentially, making it possible to deploy optimization methods that are much more powerful and much more computationally expensive. Alternative intersection designs are going viral, but the research on optimizing these facilities has only just begun. Finally, connected and autonomous vehicles could drastically improve traffic flow and traffic safety, but they may upset the way that transportation engineers traditionally do their jobs. With all of these changes looming, are you ready for 21st century signal timing?

AB This work investigates the underwater noise propagation of the primary vessel used by the Australian Antarctic Division Aurora Australis while stationary in a configuration and location suitable for under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) deployment. It outlines a novel method for recording and validating the noise of a vessel using available equipment and standard deployment options. Numerical modelling using the Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method (FMBEM) is combined with the response to a calibrated source to assess the limitations and residual uncertainty of the experiment. The results of this work indicate that there is a 10 dB re 1 mu Pa reduction in mean noise by removal of main engine noise and a low point in ship noise at 3.8 kHz. Two hundred metres depth was found to be a preferred depth for uniformity in the noise field. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SPACECRAFT; SATURATION; DESIGN
AB In the motion control of AUVs, especially those driven by multiple thrusters, the thruster misalignment and thrust loss cause the actual force and moment applied to the AUV to deviate from that desired, making accurate and fast motion control difficult. This paper proposes a sliding mode control method with dual-observer estimation for the AUV 3D motion control problem in the presence of thruster misalignment uncertainty and thrust loss uncertainty. Firstly, this paper considers the force and moment deviation as disturbances that vary with the controller output, and proposes the TD disturbance observer to address the problem of deviation caused by uncertainty in thruster misalignment. Secondly, this paper introduces the dynamics equation of thrust loss and designs the gain disturbance observer to estimate the thrust loss uncertainty during AUV navigation. The designed controller, verified by simulation and field tests, ensures that the AUV maintains better motion control despite thruster misalignment and thrust loss.

AB In recent years, there has been an enormous interest in using deep learning to classify underwater images to identify various objects, such as fishes, plankton, coral reefs, seagrass, submarines, and gestures of sea divers. This classification is essential for measuring the water bodies' health and quality and protecting the endangered species. Furthermore, it has applications in oceanography, marine economy and defense, environment protection, underwater exploration, and human-robot collaborative tasks. This article presents a survey of deep learning techniques for performing underwater image classification. We underscore the similarities and differences of several methods. We believe that underwater image classification is one of the killer application that would test the ultimate success of deep learning techniques. Toward realizing that goal, this survey seeks to inform researchers about state-of-the-art on deep learning on underwater images and also motivate them to push its frontiers forward.

TI A Discretionary Lane-Changing Decision-Making Mechanism Incorporating
   Drivers' Heterogeneity: A Signalling Game-Based Approach
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; BEHAVIOR
AB This paper attempts to propose a discretionary lane-changing decision-making model based on signalling game in the context of mixed traffic flow of autonomous and regular vehicles. The effects of the heterogeneity among different drivers and the endogeneity of same drivers in lane-changing behaviours, e.g., aggressive or conservative, are incorporated through the specification of different payoff functions under different scenarios. The model is calibrated and validated using the NGSIM dataset with a bilevel calibration framework, including two kinds of methods, genetic algorithm and perfect Bayesian equilibrium. Comparative results based on simulation show that the signalling game-based model outperforms the traditional space-based lane-changing model in the sense that the proposed model yields relatively stable reciprocal of time to collision and higher success rate of lane-changing under different traffic densities. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to test the robustness of the proposed model, which indicates that the signalling game-based model is stable to the varying ratios of driver type.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown huge superiority over humans in image recognition, speech processing, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis. However, recent studies indicate that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which are designed by attackers to fool deep learning models. Different from real examples, AEs can mislead the model to predict incorrect outputs while hardly be distinguished by human eyes, therefore threaten security-critical deep-learning applications. In recent years, the generation and defense of AEs have become a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) security. This article reviews the latest research progress of AEs. First, we introduce the concept, cause, characteristics, and evaluation metrics of AEs, then give a survey on the state-of-the-art AE generation methods with the discussion of advantages and disadvantages. After that, we review the existing defenses and discuss their limitations. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges on AEs are prospected.

ID ACCESS; MEMORY
AB The growing demand for mobile data and the evolution of next-generation networks, particularly fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, has called for new approaches to pricing and managing the limited capacity of existing network resources and infrastructures. In particular, emerging mobile applications like autonomous vehicles, augmented/virtual reality, and more broadly the Internet-of-Things will have heterogeneous demand patterns and service requirements, raising questions on how they should pay for their data usage and how next-generation networks can meet their demands with limited resources. Several recent policy changes and regulatory initiatives have been proposed to address the shift in demands due to next-generation networks and technologies. These include the FCC's "5G Fast Plan," which outlines strategies for modifying spectrum policies, infrastructure policies, and existing regulations, in light of emerging 5G technologies. This plan has included the rollback of net neutrality rules in June 2018, allowing broadband providers to offer a wider variety of service options.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used, but it is a tough challenge to guarantee the underwater location accuracy of AUVs. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to improve the accuracy of vision-based localization systems in feature-poor underwater environments. The traditional stereo visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, which relies on the detection of tracking features, is used to estimate the position of the camera and establish a map of the environment. However, it is hard to find enough reliable point features in underwater environments and thus the performance of the algorithm is reduced. A stereo point and line SLAM (PL-SLAM) algorithm for localization, which utilizes point and line information simultaneously, was investigated in this study to resolve the problem. Experiments with an AR-marker (Augmented Reality-marker) were carried out to validate the accuracy and effect of the investigated algorithm.

AB Fundamental modernisation of railway transportation is on the agenda of the next generation train project funded by the German Aerospace Center DLR as well as the Roll2Rail project within the Shift2Rail initiative. Reliable direct train-to-train (T2T) communication can significantly enhance train control and signalling towards semi- or fully autonomous operation, in order to significantly increase the efficiency and safety. With terrestrial trunked radio a communication standard is available with high potential for this use-case. It offers the ability of direct communications between vehicles, i.e. ad hoc communications over several kilometres. The authors summarise the results of T2T measurements conducted at 450MHz. The authors will characterise the propagation conditions and assess the link performance by analysing transmissions in different scenarios and railway environments.

AB Perception of the seabed environment is an important capability of autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper focuses on defining and extracting robust texture features from visual images that lead to useful and practical automated identification of the types of seabed sediments. The visual texture features are described by using a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and fractal dimension, after which an unsupervised learning method, self-organizing map (SOM), is adopted to evaluate the validity of features descriptors on three types of seabed sediments. Subsequently, a kernel-based approach that exhibits robustness versus low numbers of high dimensional samples, named support vector domain description (SVDD), is applied to classify the types of seabed sediments. In comparison with state-of-the-art classifiers, the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the SVDD on the classification of seabed sediments.

AB In this paper we propose a vision-based stabilization and output tracking control method for a model helicopter. A novel two-camera method is introduced for estimating the full six-degrees-of-freedom pose of the helicopter One of these cameras is located on-board the helicopter and the other camera is located on the ground. Unlike previous work, these two cameras are set to see each other. The pose estimation algorithm is compared in simulation to other methods and is shown to be less sensitive to errors on feature detection. In order to build an autonomous helicopter, two methods of control art studied: one using a series of mode-based, feedback linearizing controllers and the other using a backstepping-like control law. Various simulations demonstrate the implementation of these controllers. Finally, we present flight experiments where the proposed pose estimation algorithm and non-linear control techniques have been implemented on a remote-controlled helicopter.

AB Sonar images have the characteristics of lower resolution and blurrier edges compared to optical images, which make the feature-matching method in underwater target tracking less robust. To solve this problem, we propose a particle filter (PF)-based underwater target-tracking method utilizing Zernike moment feature matching. Zernike moments are used to construct the feature -description vector for feature matching and contribute to the update of particle weights. In addition, the particle state transition method is optimized by using a first-order autoregressive model. In this paper, we compare Hu moments and Zernike moments, and we also compare whether to optimize the particle state transition on the tracking results or not based on the effects of each option. The experimental results based on the AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) prove that the robustness and accuracy of this innovative method is better than the other combined methods mentioned in this paper.

AB This article proposes a vision-based framework to track the pose of lander in real time during planetary exploration with craters as landmarks. The contour of landmark crater is represented with three-dimensional Fourier series offline. During tracking, for the first instant, the tracking system is initialized by crater-based correspondence and optimization. For each subsequent instant, with the initial guess from the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the lander pose is determined by L1-norm minimization of the reprojection errors of the crater contour models in the descent image. The covariance of the determined pose is inferred based on Laplace distribution. With this covariance, the EKF generates the final estimate to pose and gives the initial guess for the pose at the next instant. Sufficient trails verify the efficacy of the proposed method.

ID FAULTS
AB The autonomous operation of the electric power system of a spacecraft is a key enabling functionality for deep-space missions. This functionality is informed by the real-time physical status of its power system, which is determined by processing the inputs obtained from various voltage and current sensors distributed throughout the electric network. In particular, it is important to have an accurate estimate of the current in each branch of the power system to detect overload conditions. However, voltage and current measurements can have an error due to noise and sensor faults. In this work, the focus is on ensuring accurate estimation of the voltages and currents in the presence of such faults. To this end, a method is proposed to optimally design a network of compound current sensors that enhances the ability to reliably identify faulty or biased current sensors. The proposed sensor fault detection method is validated using simulation results.

AB Automatic parking systems are increasingly used in daily life, and the restriction of parking spaces will make parking more difficult. This paper proposes parallel parking and forwards vertical parking path planning algorithms considering the park-ing corridor space. First, an anthropomorphic parallel parking path planning using parking space is proposed for the limited space over the length of the parking corridor. Second, a for-ward vertical parking path planning algorithm is proposed con-sidering the width of the parking space corridor. Third, the tar-get line set for parallel parking and vertical parking paths is generated. At the same time, the target line set considers the error factor and then selects the target line. Fourth, the clothoid solves the problem of discontinuous curvature of the parking path. Finally, a driver model is constructed to follow the gener-ated parking path, and the parking planning method proposed in this paper is compared with other methods.

AB With advances in emerging technologies, options for operating public transit services have broadened from conventional fixed-route service through semi-flexible service to on-demand microtransit. Nevertheless, guidelines for deciding between these services remain limited in the real implementation. An open-source simulation sandbox is developed that can compare state-of-the-practice methods for evaluating between the different types of public transit operations. For the case of the semi-flexible service, the Mobility Allowance Shuttle Transit (MAST) system is extended to include passenger deviations. A case study demonstrates the sandbox to evaluate and existing B63 bus route in Brooklyn, NY and compares its performance with the four other system designs spanning across the three service types for three different demand scenarios.

AB In this paper, we present the development of a low-cost multi-agent system experimental platform for teaching, and research purposes. The platform consists of train-like autonomous agents equipped with local speed estimation, distance sensing to their nearest predecessor, and wireless communications with other agents and a central coordinator. The individual agents can be used for simple PID experiments in a classroom or laboratory setting, while a collection of agents are capable of performing decentralized platooning with cooperative adaptive cruise control in a variety of settings, the latter being the main goal of the platform. The agents are built from low cost components and programmed with open source software, enabling teaching experiences and experimental work with a larger number of agents that would otherwise be possible with other existing solutions. Additionally, we illustrate with experimental results some of the teaching activities that the platform is capable of performing.

AB From the standpoint of complex marine environments relative to underwater acoustic signal propagation, the application of multi-beam systems for the filtering and processing of multi-beam sounding data is critical. However, currently existing automatic filtering methods estimate data, which involve several calculations and require the respective computer to possess significant processing capabilities. In this study, raw data are measured using an interferometer multi-beam echo sounder, and the characteristics of the noise data are analyzed. The noise data are discontinuous; however, accurate data can be approximated as a continuous distribution. Under the assumption of continuous underwater terrain, in consideration of a circle of the appropriate radius rolling on the terrain profile, the continuous underwater terrain data can be extracted from the raw data by means of the alpha-shapes algorithm. Finally, on the basis of the measured data in a sail trial, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified.

AB Symmetries are an essential feature of complex networks as they regulate how the graph collective dynamics organizes into clustered states. We here show how to control network symmetries, and how to enforce patterned states of synchronization with nodes clustered in a desired way. Our approach consists of perturbing the original network connectivity, either by adding new edges or by adding/removing links together with modifying their weights. By solving suitable optimization problems, we guarantee that changes made on the existing topology are minimal. The conditions for the stability of the enforced pattern are derived for the general case, and the performance of the method is illustrated with paradigmatic examples. Our results are relevant to all the practical situations in which coordination of the networked systems into diverse groups may be desirable, such as for teams of robots, unmanned autonomous vehicles, power grids and central pattern generators.

AB The letter presents a new, robust control algorithm for position trajectory tracking in a 3D space, dedicated to underactuated airships. In order to take into account real characteristics of such vehicles, and to reflect practically motivated constraints, the algorithm assumes a highly uncertain system dynamics model. The tracking problem is solved in a uniform way, without dividing it into subtasks considered in 2D spaces, thanks to the introduction of an auxiliary tracking error. The proposed controller is based on the sliding mode approach. Its stability is investigated using Lyapunov theorem. Numerical simulations are conducted in order to verify properties of a closed-loop system for a generic model of the airship. Performance of the control system is examined via experiments in various scenarios using a prototype airship. The obtained results indicate that the control objectives are satisfied in practice with a reasonable accuracy. Moreover, it is shown that the controller is robust to some bounded additive measurement perturbations and delays in the control loop.

AB Path tracking control for the autonomous tractor has been receiving increased attention with the rapid development of modern agriculture. Lateral displacement control is essential for the path tracking effect. The objective of this research is to develop a lateral displacement control system to control the lateral position of tractor. Based on the kinematic model, a cascade control scheme for lateral displacement control system was designed. The two feedback loops in the cascade control structure were implemented using the measurements of the Beidou receiver and gyroscope respectively. The yaw rate controller was designed using IMC-PID technique, and the lateral position controller was devised as a PID form using the method of minimum sensitivity. A set point filter was added in the outer loop to improve the tracking performance. The simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed control scheme by showing fast response, control accuracy and robust performance for the lateral displacement control system.

AB This letter was motivated by the problem of how to make robots fuse and transfer their experience so that they can effectively use prior knowledge and quickly adapt to new environments. To address the problem, we present a learning architecture for navigation in cloud robotic systems: Lifelong Federated Reinforcement Learning (LFRL). In the letter, we propose a knowledge fusion algorithm for upgrading a shared model deployed on the cloud. Then, effective transfer learning methods in LFRL are introduced. LFRL is consistent with human cognitive science and fits well in cloud robotic systems. Experiments show that LFRL greatly improves the efficiency of reinforcement learning for robot navigation. The cloud robotic system deployment also shows that LFRL is capable of fusing prior knowledge. In addition, we release a cloud robotic navigation-learning website to provide the service based on LFRL: www.shared-robotics.com.

DE Multi-AUV; Collaborative positioning; iUSBL; Signal design
AB Recent years scholars have seen remarkable advancements in Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) technologies despite limited underwater energy. Multi-AUV positioning technology is an especially popular collaborative research subject; at present, long baseline and ultra-short baseline systems are available for multi-AUV positioning. Long baseline positioning has many disadvantages including overly complex settings and limited effective area for beacon collection.Ultra-short baseline positioning system is rather heavy and allows for fewer users.This paper proposes a new model based on the inverted ultra short baseline (iUSBL) for AUV positioning. The model accommodates many users, maintains secret positions under deep sea conditions, and functions over lengthy distances, among other advantages. Highly detectable signals are designed for enhanced positioning accuracy in the proposed system. Simulation and anechoic tank experiment results indicate that the direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signal is the optimal transmission signal during the positioning process.

AB Traffic light recognition is an essential task for an advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) as well as for autonomous vehicles. Recently, deep-learning has become increasingly popular in vision-based object recognition owing to its high performance of classification. In this study, we investigate how to design a deep-learning based high-performance traffic light detection system. Two main components of the recognition system are investigated: the color space of the input video and the network model of deep learning. We apply six color spaces (RGB, normalized RGB, Ruta's RYG, YCbCr, HSV, and CIE Lab) and three types of network models (based on the Faster R-CNN and R-FCN models). All combinations of color spaces and network models are implemented and tested on a traffic light dataset with 1280x720 resolution. Our simulations show that the best performance is achieved with the combination of RGB color space and Faster R-CNN model. These results can provide a comprehensive guideline for designing a traffic light detection system.

AB The shortest/optimal path planning is essential for efficient operation of autonomous vehicles. In this article, a new nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm has been applied for mobile robot path planning in an unknown or partially known environment populated by a variety of static obstacles. This meta-heuristic algorithm is based on the levy flight behaviour and brood parasitic behaviour of cuckoos. A new objective function has been formulated between the robots and the target and obstacles, which satisfied the conditions of obstacle avoidance and target-seeking behaviour of robots present in the terrain. Depending upon the objective function value of each nest (cuckoo) in the swarm, the robot avoids obstacles and proceeds towards the target. The smooth optimal trajectory is framed with this algorithm when the robot reaches its goal. Some simulation and experimental results are presented at the end of the paper to show the effectiveness of the proposed navigational controller.

AB The ability to perform autonomous emergency (forced) landings is one of the key technology enablers identified for UAS. This paper presents the flight test results of forced landings involving a UAS, in a controlled environment, and which was conducted to ascertain the performances of previously developed (and published) path planning and guidance algorithms. These novel 3-D nonlinear algorithms have been designed to control the vehicle in both the lateral and longitudinal planes of motion. These algorithms have hitherto been verified in simulation. A modified Boomerang 60 RC aircraft is used as the flight test platform, with associated onboard and ground support equipment sourced Off-the-Shelf or developed in-house at the Australian Research Centre for Aerospace Automation (ARCAA). HITL simulations were conducted prior to the flight tests and displayed good landing performance, however, due to certain identified interfacing errors, the flight results differed from that obtained in simulation. This paper details the lessons learnt and presents a plausible solution for the way forward.

This article discusses some aspects of the physical platform development, in particular those related to the control system, software architecture, the generation and path tracking, job scheduling and traffic management system, as well as results of the integration of the global system and its application to a hospital transport system. The global system consists of a set of mobile robots capable of independent navigation and a central server which manages the activities to be performed by robots and organize traffic at critical points. Although robots perform tasks independently, interacting with environmental elements such as elevators, occupancy sensors in areas of pick and drop, and doors, is also done through the central server. Human operators can connect to the central server to change the activities to be performed by robots or monitor its status.

ID VISION SYSTEM
AB Three-feature based automatic lane detection algorithm (TFALDA) is a new lane detection algorithm which is simple, robust, and efficient, thus suitable for real-time processing in cluttered road environments without a priori knowledge on them. Three features of a lane boundary-starting position, direction (or orientation), and its gray-level intensity features comprising lane vector are obtained via simple image processing. Out of the many possible lane boundary candidates, the best one is then chosen as the one at a minimum distance from the previous lane vector according to a weighted distance metric in which each feature is assigned a different weight. An evolutionary algorithm then finds the optimal weights for combination of the three features that minimize the rate of detection error. The proposed algorithm was successfully applied to a series of actual road following experiments using the PRV (POSTECH research vehicle) II both on campus roads and nearby highways.

It can reduce social exclusion and assist social and vocational integration. Highly manoeuvrable wheelchairs for indoor use and wheelchair mounted arms are of particular importance. Due to their mobility, they are available on different locations, e.g. in different rooms of a dwelling for use in activities of daily living (ADL). Practical experiences and tests of a wheelchair mountable robot by users with disability are reported. This user analysis leads to further development of the human-machine interface and system integration towards an improved usability. A new type of highly manoeuvrable wheelchair is introduced. The modular software design provides comfortable means of integration. Parts of the work described are carried out within the ESPRIT project PMMA, the SPRINT project IMMeDIAte and the TIDE project OMNI.

ID AGGRESSIVE FLIGHT; SYSTEMS; MOTION
AB This article proposes a novel algorithm for aerobatic trajectory generation for a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) tailsitter flying wing aircraft. The algorithm differs from existing approaches for fixed-wing trajectory generation, as it considers a realistic six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) flight dynamics model, including aerodynamic equations. Using a global dynamics model enables the generation of aerobatics trajectories that exploit the entire flight envelope, allowing agile maneuvering through the stall regime, sideways uncoordinated flight, inverted flight, etc. The method uses the differential flatness property of the global tailsitter flying wing dynamics, which is derived in this work. By performing snap minimization in the differentially flat output space, a computationally efficient algorithm, suitable for online motion planning, is obtained. The algorithm is demonstrated in extensive flight experiments encompassing six aerobatic maneuvers, a time-optimal drone racing trajectory, and an airshowlike aerobatic sequence for three tailsitter aircraft.

ID TRIGGERED CONSENSUS; TRACKING
AB The present article investigates the consensus control of a multiagent system (MAS) composed by vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) rotorcrafts subject to aerodynamic disturbances. Initially, the attitude's VTOLs model based on quaternion formalism is detailed to subsequently derive the corresponding control law. Likewise, the MAS translational dynamics is extended to entail the airframe's aerodynamics. In order to achieve the consensus objective, a robust adaptive event-triggered sliding-mode control (SMC) is synthesized considering a leader-follower scheme guaranteeing Lyapunov's closed-loop stability and avoiding the Zeno behavior. Results from an extensive simulation stage witness the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The latter allows to fulfill the collective consensus and leader's trajectory tracking objectives in presence of unknown disturbances while keeping a reduced computational cost.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is the key sensor behind the 3D perception of self-driving vehicles. The range, precision and accuracy of a LiDAR sensor mainly depend on how each received pulse is captured, sampled and processed. However, to the best of our knowledge, such a topic is yet to be investigated in depth. This work aims to fill such a gap by introducing a new range estimation method. The method takes only 3 samples from the rising edge of the received pulse and combines two simple estimation techniques: time-domain edge detection and frequency-domain phase estimation. The proposed method was demonstrated over a dynamic range of 45 dB, proving to be robust over the entire interval. Sub-centimeter precision and accuracy were achieved over a dynamic range of 24 dB. The obtained estimations are bounded by a derived theoretical limit that is identical to a Cramer-Rao lower bound of a phase estimator.

AB In this letter, a simultaneous wireless power and data transfer system based on a novel multidirectional magnetic coupler is presented for the application of swarm AUVs. The transmitting coil consisting of two reversely wound helix loops can generate a multidirectional magnetic field in space, which supplies power to multiple arc-shaped receiving coils placed in different directions. Aiming at high coupling strength and low core volume, a multiobjective genetic algorithm is used to optimize coil parameters. In addition, a hybrid injection communication method based on LCC-S compensation topology is proposed and analyzed. An experiment platform is built and the results show that the system can achieve 92.25% efficiency at a power level of 200 W when four AUVs are powered. Meanwhile, the transferred data are successfully recovered at the data rate of 30 kbps.

AB Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs) are becoming more significant in portable devices, autonomous vehicles, and data centers. As the demand for highly integrated and high-performance semiconductor devices grows, recent 3D integration technologies focus on lowering the size of the micro-structures on such devices for high density. In order to inspect the 3D semiconductor devices, it is critical to measure the heights, depths, and overall surface profiles of the micro-structures made with silicon materials. Here, we demonstrate precise surface imaging for silicon devices by using a femtosecond mode-locked laser centered at 785 nm wavelength and an electro-optic sampling-based time-of-flight detection method with sub-10-nanometer axial precision. We could successfully measure the surface profiles as well as the step heights of silicon wafer stacks and micro-scale structures on silicon substrates.

AB The Electrostatic Charging Laboratory for Interactions between Plasma and Spacecraft (ECLIPS) research vacuum chamber has recently been developed as part of the Autonomous Vehicle Systems Laboratory at the University of Colorado Boulder. The experimental spacecraft charging research facility allows conducting experiments relevant to charged astrodynamics in a space-like environment. This paper discusses the development, characterization, and present capabilities of the vacuum chamber, which includes a range of sources to provide electron, ion, and photon fluxes, probes to characterize electron fluxes, x-rays, and potentials, and a variety of ancillary components to ensure the safe operation of the system, such as 3-axis motion stages, a magnetic environment control system, or a residual gas analyzer, among others. This state-of-the art facility has been used to conduct experiments on touchless spacecraft potential sensing, electrostatic actuation, or electron gun development, and will continue to be employed for the study of charged astrodynamics in the future.

AB The modern world contains an immense number of different and interacting systems, from the evolution of weather systems to variations in the stock market, autonomous vehicles interacting with their environment, and the spread of diseases. For society to function, it is essential to understand the behavior of the world so that informed decisions can be made that are based on likely future outcomes. For instance, consider the spread of a new disease such as COVID-19 coronavirus. It is of great importance to be able to predict the number of people that will be infected at different points in time to ensure that appropriate health-care facilities are available. It is also of interest to be able to make decisions based on accurate information to best attenuate the spread of disease. Moreover, understanding specific attributes of a disease-such as the incubation time and number of unreported cases-and how certain we are about this knowledge are also crucial.

AB High-resolution automotive radar sensors are required to meet the high bar of autonomous vehicle needs and regulations. However, current radar systems are limited in their angular resolution, causing a technological gap. An industry and academic trend to improve angular resolution by increasing the number of physical channels also increases system complexity, requires sensitive calibration processes, lowers robustness to hardware malfunctions, and drives higher costs. We offer an alternative approach, named Radar signal Reconstruction using Self Supervision (R2S2), which substantially improves the angular resolution of a given radar array without increasing the number of physical channels. R2S2 is a family of algorithms that use a deep neural network (DNN) with complex range-Doppler radar data as input and trained in a self-supervised method using a loss function that operates in multiple data representation spaces. Improvement of 4x in angular resolution was demonstrated using a real-world dataset collected in urban and highway environments during clear and rainy weather conditions.

AB Fire incidents are responsible for severe damage and thousands of deaths every year all over the world. Extreme temperatures, low visibility, toxic gases, and unknown locations of victims create difficulties and delays in rescue operations, escalating the risk of injury or death. It is time-critical to detect the victims trapped inside the burning sites for facilitating the rescue operations. This research work presents an audio-based automated system for victim detection in fire emergencies, investigating two machine learning (ML) methods: support vector machines (SVM) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The performance of these two ML techniques has been evaluated based on a variety of performance metrics. Our analyses show that both ML methods provide superior scream detection performance, with SVM slightly overperforming LSTM. Because of its lower complexity, SVM is a better candidate for real-time implementation in our autonomous embedded system vehicle (AESV).

AB Pathfinding becomes an important component in many real-world scenarios, such as popular warehouse systems and autonomous aircraft towing vehicles. With the development of reinforcement learning (RL) especially in the context of asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C), pathfinding is undergoing a revolution in terms of efficient parallel learning. Similar to other artificial intelligence-based applications, A3C-based pathfinding is also threatened by the adversarial attack. In this paper, we are the first to study the adversarial attack to A3C, that can unexpectedly wake up longtime retraining mechanism until successful pathfinding. We also discover an attack example generation to launch the attack based on gradient band, in which only one baffle of extremely few unit lengths can successfully perform the attack. Experiments with detailed analysis are conducted to show a high attack success rate of 95% with an average baffle length of 2.95. We also discuss defense suggestions leveraging the insights from our analysis.

AB Precision agriculture is the collection of hardware and software technologies that allow a farmer to make informed, differentiated decisions regarding agricultural operations such as planting, fertilizing, pest control, and harvesting. In recent years, advances in agricultural machinery and the emergence of agricultural robots continuously increased the resolution at which differentiated treatment is possible. This creates a corresponding need for information at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. Autonomous multi-robot systems (e.g., unmanned ground and aerial vehicles) are some of the most promising approaches for such information collection in open-air farms. In this paper, we survey the current state and challenges of multi-robot information gathering for precision agriculture, with a special focus on maximizing information and ensuring the security of the collected data while simultaneously keeping energy consumption in check.

AB Automated storage systems have become the basis of warehouse logistics. The article presents a discussion on the reliability and dependability of Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS), which are perceived as solutions with high technical reliability. Still, their role in the dependability of the entire warehouse system is to be discussed. The concepts of reliability and dependability in logistics systems like ASRS are defined, and a literature review in this area is presented. On this basis, the factors influencing the dependability of ASRS are discussed in a way not present in the discussion on this topic so far. Then, the ASRS simulation model (based on FlexSim simulation software) is presented. The model tests the influence of ASRS configuration and assigned resources on the dependability of the warehouse as a master system. The summary includes observations on defining the reliability and dependability of ASRS.

AB As a type of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), blended-wing-body underwater gliders (BWBUGs) have drawn much attention due to their unique performance advantages in long-distance navigation missions. Because the configuration is the direct component to influence the navigation efficiency, it is significant to perform shape optimisation of BWBUGs. In this paper, an optimisation framework is presented, where Free-Form Deformation (FFD) is adopted for geometric parameterisation. Besides, an Euler-based CFD solver with a discrete adjoint method is applied for numerical simulation and gradients calculation, and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is employed as the optimiser. With the help of the proposed framework, an optimised BWBUG is regarded as the initial shape and four shape optimisation cases are carried out for different design purposes. All the objective functions aim to increase the lift-drag ratio under the thickness and volume constraints. The simulation results show that all the cases achieve a higher lift-drag ratio.

AB Does the human mind resemble the machine-learning systems that mirror its performance? Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved human-level benchmarks in classifying novel images. These advances support technologies such as autonomous vehicles and machine diagnosis; but beyond this, they serve as candidate models for human vision itself. However, unlike humans, CNNs are "fooled" by adversarial examples-nonsense patterns that machines recognize as familiar objects, or seemingly irrelevant image perturbations that nevertheless alter the machine's classification. Such bizarre behaviors challenge the promise of these new advances; but do human and machine judgments fundamentally diverge? Here, we show that human and machine classification of adversarial images are robustly related: In 8 experiments on 5 prominent and diverse adversarial imagesets, human subjects correctly anticipated the machine's preferred label over relevant foils-even for images described as "totally unrecognizable to human eyes". Human intuition may be a surprisingly reliable guide to machine (mis)classification-with consequences for minds and machines alike.

AB Control valves are used to close off piping and prevent backflow. Radiated noise is generated when gas discharges through the check valves. In this study, three-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted to observe the flow patterns and to measure the flow fluctuations when the control value had different valve openings. The internal aerodynamic noise from the check valve was computed by using a frequency domain acoustic analogy, based on the Lighthill acoustic analogy. These results not only provided an understanding of the flow pattern in check values, but also were used to determine the location of the noise and the noise characteristics. The optimized water-microjets system, used for reducing the noise emitted by gas jets, was obtained by Max Kandula. The water-microjet were referenced and designed into the modified check value. The experimental results indicated that the modified value produces lower noise. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Obstacle detection is an essential element for the development of intelligent transportation systems so that accidents can be avoided. In this paper, we propose a stereovision-based method for detecting obstacles in urban environment. The proposed method uses a deep stacked auto-encoders (DSA) model that combines the greedy learning features with the dimensionality reduction capacity and employs an unsupervised k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to accurately and reliably detect the presence of obstacles. We consider obstacle detection as an anomaly detection problem. We evaluated the proposed method by using practical data from three publicly available data sets, the Malaga stereovision urban data set, the Daimler urban segmentation data set, and the Bahnhof data set. Also, we compared the efficiency of DSA-KNN approach to the deep belief network-based clustering schemes. Results show that the DSA-KNN is suitable to visually monitor urban scenes.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

AB The problem of how to optimally deploy a suite of sensors to estimate the oceanographic environment is addressed. An optimal way to estimate (nowcast) and predict (forecast) the ocean environment is to assimilate measurements from dynamic and uncertain regions into a dynamical ocean model. In order to determine the sensor deployment strategy that optimally samples the regions of uncertainty, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach is presented. The scalar cost function is defined as a weighted combination of a sensor suite's sampling of the ocean variability, ocean dynamics, transmission loss sensitivity, modeled temperature uncertainty (and others). The benefit of the GA approach is that the user can determine "optimal" via a weighting of constituent cost functions, which can include ocean dynamics, acoustics, cost, time, etc. A numerical example with three gliders, two powered AUVs, and three moorings is presented to illustrate the optimization approach in the complex shelfbreak region south of New England.

AB Side-scan sonar imaging conducted in Great Bay, New Jersey, during August 2003 reveals local variations in acoustic backscatter from the seabed that can be related to small-, medium-, and large-scale bedforms. Analysis of 600-kilohertz side-scan sonar data collected at a System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) survey site of the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve shows a relationship between backscatter intensity, bathymetry, and changing seabed morphology. Side-scan sonar records obtained at the survey site in Great Bay via deployment of an autonomous underwater vehicle (Remote Environmental Monitoring Units) provide in-depth characterization of an array of complex and multiscaled bedforms and associated benthic habitats. Bedforms documented within the swath map region by side-scan sonar imaging include constructive transverse forms, notably ripples, dunes, and sand waves. These bedforms are valuable for assessing potentially important habitats for benthic invertebrate and demersal finfish populations.

AB The Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides has been the object of a rapidly expanding longline fishery in the Southern Ocean. Little is known about the biology of D. eleginoides and traditional methods of estimating stock size using trawling techniques have proved ineffective because the adult fish are found in deep waters on the continental slope at depths of 700-2500 m. During September 1997, a preliminary study was undertaken using arrival times at an autonomous baited camera vehicle, the Aberdeen University Deep Ocean Submersible (AUDOS), to estimate the abundance and size of toothfish in waters around South Georgia (SG) and the Falkland Islands (FI). These are the first attempts at estimating the abundance of toothfish that are independent of catch data from the commercial fishery. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Matching landmark patches from a real-time image captured by an on-vehicle camera with landmark patches in an image database plays an important role in various computer perception tasks for autonomous driving. Current methods focus on local matching for regions of interest and do not take into account spatial neighborhood relationships among the image patches, which typically correspond to objects in the environment. In this paper, we construct a spatial graph with the graph vertices corresponding to patches and edges capturing the spatial neighborhood information. We propose a joint feature and metric learning model with graph-based learning. We provide a theoretical basis for the graph-based loss by showing that the information distance between the distributions conditioned on matched and unmatched pairs is maximized under our framework. We evaluate our model using several street-scene datasets and demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art matching results.

AB Axial Seamount in the northeast Pacific erupted in 2015, 2011, and 1998. Although monitored by the Regional Cabled Array of the Ocean Observatory Initiative, few magnetic surveys have been conducted over the region. This study uses high-resolution magnetic data over the seamount collected by autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry during three years (2015, 2017, and 2020). The goal is to investigate whether there are temporal changes in the near-surface magnetic field observable over the time scale of one volcanic cycle. We compare magnetic maps from repeated tracklines from each year. We find maps of the yearly difference in magnetization show coherent patterns that are not random. The central region of the caldera has become more magnetic during recent years, suggesting cooling of the surficial lava flows since 2015. Sentry data are more sensitive to shallow crustal structure compared to sea surface data which show longer wavelength anomalies extending deeper into the crust.

AB This paper proposes a distributed control scheme for autonomous tugboats to tow a ship in a restricted water traffic environment ensuring collision avoidance while being compliant with maritime regulation called COLREGS. The complex problem is cooperatively solved by addressing three sub-optimization problems. The first is to optimize the towing forces and angles for solving ship waypoint following and collision avoidance problems. The second is to optimize the tug thruster forces and moment for solving the tug online trajectory tracking and collision avoidance problems. The third is to optimize the Lagrange Multipliers for solving the consensus problem between the ship and tugs. The distributed control architecture follows the Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy using the Altering Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Simulation experiments indicate that the proposed control scheme can deal with static and dynamic obstacles in restricted waterways for a physically interconnected multi-vessel system executing the towing process, and the collision avoidance complies with COLREGS rules.

ID SUPPRESSION
AB Frequency diverse array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) communication regime has received a lot of attention in the field of point-to-point communication and interference suppression due to its degrees of freedom in the range domain. Previous researches have mainly considered non-coherent source scenarios. However, FDA-MIMO communication system in low-elevation is subject to multipath effects in addition to the potential threats within the mainlobe. The discrimination of true and false targets using meter-wave FDA-MIMO radar in low-elevation scenarios is still a problem that needs to be addressed. This letter mainly derives the signal model of the mainlobe deceptive jamming acting on the meter-wave FDA-MIMO radar and proposes a method for the discrimination of true and false targets. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This research focuses on big experimental data analysis and the replenishment operation in a crane & shuttle based storage and retrieval system (C&SBS/RS). It is proposed that the order structure is expressed by three indicators: the order strength, the order size, and the order density. This aims to develop a regression function for the replenishment strategy to reveal the relationship between the order structure and replenishment parameters. The simulation model of the system is developed using FlexSim 7.1. A total of 13,440 combinations of order structures are provided as the simulation input. The statistical analyses are completed using the popular statistical software MINITAB. In this study, we use two different methods, best subset regression, and stepwise regression, to fit the regression function and find the best regression. According to the regression function, operation managers can develop better operation strategies.

AB The idea of improving human's life quality by making life more comfortable and easy is nowadays possible using current technologies and techniques to solve complex daily problems. The presented idea in this work proposes a control strategy for autonomous robotic systems, specifically car-like robots. The main objective of this work is the development of a reactive navigation controller by means of obstacles avoidance and position control to reach a desired position in an unknown environment. This research goal was achieved by the integration of potential fields and neuroevolution controllers. The neuro-evolutionary controller was designed using the (NEAT) algorithm "Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies" and trained using a designed training environment. The methodology used allowed the vehicle to reach a certain level of autonomy, obtaining a stable controller that includes kinematic and dynamic considerations. The obtained results showed significant improvements compared to the comparison work.

DE Computational photography; non-line-of-sight imaging
AB Imaging objects obscured by occluders is a significant challenge for many applications. A camera that could "see around corners" could help improve navigation and mapping capabilities of autonomous vehicles or make search and rescue missions more effective. Time-resolved single-photon imaging systems have recently been demonstrated to record optical information of a scene that can lead to an estimation of the shape and reflectance of objects hidden from the line of sight of a camera. However, existing non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reconstruction algorithms have been constrained in the types of light transport effects they model for the hidden scene parts. We introduce a factored NLOS light transport representation that accounts for partial occlusions and surface normals. Based on this model, we develop a factorization approach for inverse time-resolved light transport and demonstrate high-fidelity NLOS reconstructions for challenging scenes both in simulation and with an experimental NLOS imaging system.

DE Visual-inertial odometry; Unmanned aircraft systems; Observability;
   Sensitivity
AB Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is an important component in autonomous navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in GPS-denied or degraded environments. VIO is a nonlinear estimation problem where control inputs, such as acceleration and angular velocity, have significant impact on the estimation performance. In this paper, we examine the effects of controls on the VIO problem. We first propose a sensitivity function that characterizes the relationship between the errors in the control inputs and the state estimation performance. This function depends on the control inputs, which is unique for nonlinear systems since for linear systems, state observability properties are independent of control inputs. We next derive analytical expressions of the sensitivity functions for various VIO scenarios relevant to UAV motions. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we validate the derived sensitivity functions. We also show an interesting fact that deceleration along the velocity direction yields better estimation performance than acceleration with the same magnitude.

AB A multi-agent based system is proposed to simultaneous scheduling of flexible machine groups and material handling system working under a manufacturing dynamic environment. The proposed model is designed by means of methodology and programmed in agent based systems development environment. Each agent in the model is autonomous and has an ability to cooperate and negotiate with the other agents in the system. Due to these abilities of agents, the structure of the system is more suitable to handle dynamic events. The proposed dynamic scheduling system is tested on several test problems the literature and the results are quite satisfactory because it generates effective schedules for both dynamic cases in the real time and static problem sets. Although the model is designed as an online method and has a dynamic structure, obtained schedule performance parameters are very close to those obtained from offline optimization based algorithms.

AB This paper addresses the issue of enabling a comfortable highly automated driving style. Two studies have been conducted to identify metrics which can be used to parametrize a high-quality automated driving style for automobiles with regard to safety, functionality and comfort. The studies were set either in an urban and rural or a highway environment. Participants (N = 12 per study) manually drove a round course assuming either an everyday, a comfortable, or a dynamic driving style in randomized order. The obtained results emphasize the importance of maneuver-based analysis. Namely, a variety of maneuver-specific metrics, such as acceleration, jerk, quickness and headway distance in seconds, were identified, which are prerequisites to differentiate between the three driving styles. These metrics seem to be the essential components for the development of comfortable highly automated driving. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Integrating celestial navigation system (CNS) and inertial navigation system (INS) is an effective way to realize autonomous navigation for hypersonic cruise vehicles. In multi-stars synchronous observation, the error levels of starlight observations are not only changing with time, but also different from star to star, which is ignored by classic INS/CNS integrated navigation. In this paper, a new tightly-coupled INS/CNS integrated navigation algorithm with weighted multi-stars observations is proposed. Different from the classic method, tightly-coupled model provides a novel framework for INS/CNS integration, which enables direct fusion of INS measurements with original CNS observations. Meanwhile, star subsets traversal strategy is designed to evaluate the error level of each observation. Then adaptive filter which can fuse multi-star observations with INS according to evaluated error levels is researched. The proposed new algorithm shows significant improvement in navigation accuracy than the classic method in simulation.

AB This brief presents the real-time dynamic Dubins-Helix (RDDH) method for trajectory smoothing, which consists of Dubins-Helix trajectory generation and pitch angle smoothing. The generated 3-D trajectory is called the RDDH trajectory. On one hand, the projection of 3-D trajectory on the horizontal plane is partially generated by Dubins path planner such that the curvature radius constraint is satisfied. On the other hand, the Helix curve is constructed to satisfy the pitch angle constraint, even in the case that the initial and final poses are close. Furthermore, by analyzing the relationship between the parameters and the effectiveness of the RDDH trajectory, the smoothing algorithm is designed to obtain appropriate parameters for a shorter and smoother trajectory. In the end, the numerical results show the proposed method can generate an effective trajectory under diverse initial conditions and achieve real-time computation.

AB This paper demonstrates an innovative and simple solution for obstacle detection and collision avoidance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) optimized for and evaluated with quadrotors. The sensors exploited in this paper are low-cost ultrasonic and infrared range finders, which are much cheaper though noisier than more expensive sensors such as laser scanners. This needs to be taken into consideration for the design, implementation, and parametrization of the signal processing and control algorithm for such a system, which is the topic of this paper. For improved data fusion, inertial and optical flow sensors are used as a distance derivative for reference. As a result, a UAV is capable of distance controlled collision avoidance, which is more complex and powerful than comparable simple solutions. At the same time, the solution remains simple with a low computational burden. Thus, memory and time-consuming simultaneous localization and mapping is not required for collision avoidance.

AB Oceanographic climatology is widely used in different applications, such as climate studies, ocean model validation and planning of naval operations. Conventional climatological estimates are based on historic measurements, typically by averaging the measurements and thereby smoothing local phenomena. Such phenomena are often local in time and space, but crucial to some applications. Here, we propose a new method to estimate time-calibrated oceanographic profiles based on combined historic and real-time measurements. The real-time measurements may, for instance, be SAR pictures or autonomous underwater vehicles providing temperature values at a limited set of depths. The method employs empirical orthogonal functions and clustering on a training data set in order to divide the ocean into climatological regions. The real-time measurements are first used to determine what climatological region is most representative. Secondly, an improved estimate is determined using an optimisation approach that minimises the difference between the real-time measurements and the final estimate.

AB Helicopters are well-known by their hovering and vertical take-off and landing capabilities. However, the performance of the valuable feature of hovering can be seriously affected by external disturbances such as wind effect. The latter could be even more significant when dealing with small-size helicopters, which are commonly adopted as base platforms for developing unmanned aerial vehicles. In order to address the aforementioned instabilities in hovering maneuvers, it is possible to use an augmented configuration that consists of the unmanned helicopter itself, a tether connecting the helicopter to the ground, and a system in charge of adjusting the tether tension. In this paper, in addition to a detailed model of the system, an analysis on the inherent benefits to the augmented configuration is presented, as well as a general scheme for control design. By way of illustration of previous ideas, several simulations under artificially generated wind influences are presented and compared.

AB Penguin foraging and breeding success depend on broad-scale environmental and local-scale hydrographic features of their habitat. We investigated the effect of local tidal currents on a population of Adelie penguins on Humble Is., Antarctica. We used satellite-tagged penguins, an autonomous underwater vehicle, and historical tidal records to model of penguin foraging locations over ten seasons. The bearing of tidal currents did not oscillate daily, but rather between diurnal and semidiurnal tidal regimes. Adelie penguins foraging locations changed in response to tidal regime switching, and not to daily tidal patterns. The hydrography and foraging patterns of Adelie penguins during these switching tidal regimes suggest that they are responding to changing prey availability, as they are concentrated and dispersed in nearby Palmer Deep by variable tidal forcing on weekly timescales, providing a link between local currents and the ecology of this predator.

AB The past decade has seen a growing interest in ocean sensor networks because of their wide applications in marine research, oceanography, ocean monitoring, offshore exploration, and defense or homeland security. Ocean sensor networks are generally formed with various ocean sensors, autonomous underwater vehicles, surface stations, and research vessels. To make ocean sensor network applications viable, efficient communication among all devices and components is crucial. Due to the unique characteristics of underwater acoustic channels and the complex deployment environment in three dimensional (3D) ocean spaces, new efficient and reliable communication and networking protocols are needed in design of ocean sensor networks. In this paper, we aim to provide an overview of the most recent advances in network design principles for 3D ocean sensor networks, with focuses on deployment, localization, topology design, and position-based routing in 3D ocean spaces.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is an ideal platform that enables a closer approach to the seafloor than other platforms. The AUV provides remarkable advancement not only in imaging small-scale bathymetry with high resolution but also in imaging the spatial distribution of scattering signals within a water column. Acoustic echoes can be recorded continuously by AUVs, potentially providing information related to hydrothermal plumes within a water column. In May 2007, such an AUV, Urashima, of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, captured fantastic acoustic images within the water column above an active hydrothermal field, the Iheya-North field, off Okinawa. Numerous filamentous and hyperbolic echoes were recorded on the side-scan sonar images. According to the temperature and geochemical anomaly, the scattering signals within the water column were hydrothermal plumes upwelling from the vent area. This proof of concept has implications for long-range exploration for vent field with AUVs.

AB Navigation and positioning of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the complex and changeable marine environment are crucial and challenging. For the positioning of AUVs, the integrated navigation of the strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS), Doppler velocity log (DVL), and pressure sensor (PS) has a common application. Nevertheless, in the complex underwater environment, the DVL performance is affected by the current and complex terrain environments. The outliers in sensor observations also have a substantial adverse effect on the AUV positioning accuracy. To address these issues, in this paper, a novel tightly integrated navigation model of the SINS, DVL, and PS is established. In contrast to the traditional SINS, DVL, and PS tightly integrated navigation methods, the proposed method in this paper is based on the velocity variation of the DVL beam by applying the DVL bottom-track and water-track models. Furthermore, a new robust interacting multiple models (RIMM) information fusion algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, DVL beam anomaly is detected, and the Markov transfer probability matrix is accordingly updated to enable quick model matching. By simulating the motion of the AUV in a complex underwater environment, we also compare the performance of the traditional loosely integrated navigation (TLIN) model, the tightly integrated navigation (TTIN) model, and the IMM algorithm. The simulation results show that because of the PS, the velocity and height in the up-change amplitude of the four algorithms are small. Compared with the TLIN algorithm in terms of maximum deviation of latitude and longitude, the RIMM algorithm also improves the accuracy by 39.1243 m and 26.4364 m, respectively. Furthermore, compared with the TTIN algorithm, the RIMM algorithm improves latitude and longitude accuracy by 1.8913 m and 11.8274 m, respectively. A comparison with IMM also shows that RIMM improves the accuracy of latitude and longitude by 1.1506 m and 7.2301 m, respectively. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm suppresses the observed noise and outliers of DVL and further achieves quick conversion between different DVL models while making full use of the effective information of the DVL beams. The proposed method also improves the navigation accuracy of AUVs in complex underwater environments.

AB We present preliminary results of a morphological study of the summit of the Southern Explorer Ridge (SER). The SER is an inflated intermediate-rate spreading center located in the northeast Pacific off the West coast of Canada, that hosts a large hydrothermal vent complex known as '' Magic Mountain ''. A quantitative assessment of faulting on the axial summit graben floor close to the ridge Summit is accomplished through the analysis of high-resolution, near-bottom, bathymetric data. These data were acquired using a multibeam system mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle operated a few tens meters above the seafloor. Structural mapping reveals numerous subvertical fissures and normal faults that nucleated from tension fissures. The ratio between the length and the maximum scarp height of normal faults is not constant contrary to what is generally observed on subaerial faults, highlighting the probable importance of fault segment linkage and fault growth processes within the relatively thin brittle layer. Populations of small faults exhibit an exponential size-frequency distribution that reflects the importance of linkage in the fault growth history and the relatively large amount of tectonic strain (3.7 to 18.4%) accommodated by the normal faults. We propose that the 500 to 600-m wide and similar to 60-in deep asymmetric axial summit graben of the SER formed due to magma chamber deflation as well as normal faulting that initiated on the present eastern border of the graben. We find a well-defined geographic distribution in the types of lava flows, which indicates a general decrease of the eruption rate through time. We also find that the '' Magic Mountain '' hydrothermal field is located in the vicinity of the large eastern axial summit graben bounding fault whose dimensions suggest it may reach to the brittle ductile-transition depth. This fault likely has provided an efficient physical pathway for fluids from the subsurface to the seafloor for a significant period of time thus allowing the hydrothermal system to grow and mature.

AB The geomagnetic field constitutes a massive fingerprint database, and its unique structure provides potential position correction information. In recent years, particle filter technology has received more attention in the context of robot navigation. However, particle degradation and impoverishment have constrained navigation systems' performance. This paper transforms particle filtering into a particle-matching positioning problem and proposes a geomagnetic localization method based on an adaptive fission particle filter. This method employs particle-filtering technology to construct a geomagnetic matching positioning model. Through adaptive particle fission and sampling, the problem of particle degradation and impoverishment in traditional particle filtering is solved, resulting in improved geomagnetic matching positioning accuracy. Finally, the proposed method was tested in a sea trial, and the results show that the proposed method has a lower positioning error than traditional particle-filtering and intelligent particle-filtering algorithms. Under geomagnetic map conditions, an average positioning accuracy of about 546.44 m is achieved.

AB In this article, we examine the effects of flow disturbances resulting from turbulence on the dynamic behavior of an underwater energy-harvesting kite system that executes periodic figure-8 flight. Due to the periodic nature of the kite's operation, we begin by assessing orbital stability using the Floquet analysis and stroboscopic intersection analysis of a Poincare section, with the former analysis performed on a simplified "unifoil" model and the latter performed on a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF)/flexible tether model. With periodic stability established, a frequency-domain analysis based on a linearization about the kite's path is used to predict the quality of flight path tracking as a function of the turbulence frequency. To validate the accuracy of these simulation-based predictions under flow disturbances, we compare the predictions of the kite's behavior against the results of small-scale tow testing experiments performed in a controlled pool environment.

AB A compact and low-weight LIDAR instrument has been developed for laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy sensing of maize fields. Fluorescence LIDAR had to be installed on a small industrial drone so that its mass was <2 kg and power consumption was <5 W. The LIDAR instrument utilized a continuous wave diode laser (405 nm, 150 mW) for inducing fluorescence and a small spectrometer for backscattered photons acquisition. For field testing, the LIDAR instrument was installed on a quadcopter for remote sensing of plants in a maize field in three periods of the plant's life. The obtained fluorescence signal maps have demonstrated that the average chlorophyll content is rather non-uniform over the field and tends to increase through the plant vegetation cycle. Field tests proved the feasibility and perspectives of autonomous LIDAR sensing of agricultural fields from drones for the detection and location of plants under stress.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is an active localization method for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), and it can mainly be used in unknown and complex areas such as coastal water, harbors, and wharfs. This paper presents a practical occupancy grid-based method based on forward-looking sonar for AUV. The algorithm uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the AUV motion states. First, the SLAM method fuses the data coming from the navigation sensors to predict the motion states. Subsequently, a novel particle swarm optimization genetic algorithm (PSO-GA) scan matching method is employed for matching the sonar scan data and grid map, and the matching pose would be used to correct the prediction states. Lastly, the estimated motion states and sonar scan data would be used to update the grid map. The experimental results based on the field data have validated that the proposed SLAM algorithm is adaptable to underwater conditions, and accurate enough to use for ocean engineering practical applications.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; INITIAL TRUST
AB The purpose of this study is to explore how trust in and the service quality of urban air mobility (UAM) relate to the user acceptance of UAM. We hypothesized that trust directly influences the attitude and intention to use UAM, while service quality factors affect its perceived usefulness and ease of use. A survey data of 450 respondents were analysed by using a partial least squares structural equation model. The results show that trust positively influences the intention to use UAM, and safety perception contributes the most to UAM's trustworthiness. In addition, transport service quality factors (i.e., time-saving, availability, flight comfort, and perceived cost) significantly explained the perceived usefulness and/or ease of use. Path coefficients of the structural model indicate that trust has a greater impact on the user's attitude toward UAM than perceived usefulness. The results of this study contribute to increasing the early user adoption of UAM.

AB This study investigated drivers' perceptions of pedestrian crossing behavior at unsignalized crosswalks, which was less fruitful in quantitative and qualitative traffic research. Subjective and snow-ball sampling were used to conduct semi-structured in-depth interviews based on drivers' daily driving experience from qualitative research. A theoretical model of pedestrian behavior at unsignalized crosswalks was constructed using the grounded theory and the theoretical saturation test. The model involved 4 three-level codes and 13 two-level codes (main category) used to obtain seven subcategories. The results show that drivers believe that pedestrian characteristics, driver characteristics, and age factors are the three factors that affect pedestrian crossing safety. Targeted improvement measures are put forward to guide the design of pedestrian crossing facilities, pedestrian management and guidance, and future research on conflicts between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians.

AB The reinforcement learning control of an underground loader was investigated in a simulated environment by using a multi-agent deep neural network approach. At the start of each loading cycle, one agent selects the dig position from a depth camera image of a pile of fragmented rock. A second agent is responsible for continuous control of the vehicle, with the goal of filling the bucket at the selected loading point while avoiding collisions, getting stuck, or losing ground traction. This relies on motion and force sensors, as well as on a camera and lidar. Using a soft actor-critic algorithm, the agents learn policies for efficient bucket filling over many subsequent loading cycles, with a clear ability to adapt to the changing environment. The best results-on average, 75% of the max capacity-were obtained when including a penalty for energy usage in the reward.</p>

AB Ocean waves are widely estimated using physics-based computational models, which predict how energy is transferred from the wind, dissipated, and transferred spatially across the ocean. Machine learning methods offer an opportunity to predict these data with significantly reduced data input and computational power. This paper describes a novel surrogate model developed using the random forest method, which replicates the spatial nearshore wave data estimated by a Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) numerical model. By incorporating insitu buoy observations, outputs were found to match observations at a test location more closely than the corresponding SWAN model. Furthermore, the required computational time reduced by a factor of 100. This methodology can provide accurate spatial wave data in situations where computational power and transmission are limited, such as autonomous marine vehicles or during coastal and offshore operations in remote areas. This represents a significant supplementary service to existing physics-based wave models.

AB A Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System is a recently developed automated, parts-to-picker material handling system. Robots can move storage shelves, also known as inventory pods, between the storage area and the workstations and can continually reposition them during operations. This article shows how to optimize three key decision variables: (i) the number of pods per SKU; (ii) the ratio of the number of pick stations to replenishment stations; and (iii) the replenishment level per pod. Our results show that throughput performance improves substantially when inventory is spread across multiple pods, when an optimum ratio between the number of pick stations to replenishment stations is achieved and when a pod is replenished before it is completely empty. This article contributes methodologically by introducing a new type of Semi-Open Queueing Network (SOQN): cross-class matching multi-class SOQN, by deriving necessary stability conditions, and by introducing a novel interpretation of the classes.

AB Direction-of-arrival (DOA) and range estimation is an important issue of sonar signal processing. In this paper, a novel approach using Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is proposed for joint bearing and range estimation of multiple targets based on a uniform linear array (ULA) of hydrophones. The structure of this ULA based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and thus has attractive features of small size, high sensitivity and low cost, and is suitable for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operations. This proposed target localization method has the following advantages: only a single snapshot of data is needed and real-time processing is feasible. The proposed algorithm transforms a very complicated nonlinear estimation problem to a simple nearly linear one via time-frequency distribution (TFD) theory and is verified with HHT. Theoretical discussions of resolution issue are also provided to facilitate the design of a MEMS sensor with high sensitivity. Simulation results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is happening all around us, whether it is the emergence of self-driving vehicles, autonomous 'healthcare' robots or the transformation of industrial activities and infrastructure. Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and permanent structural monitoring will both be impacted by 4IR and will also be enablers for the transition to 4IR. The UK Research Centre in NDE (RCNDE) is established as a leading academic-industrial collaboration for undertaking industrially-relevant research in the fields of NDE and structural health monitoring. The industrial members of RCNDE produced their first 5-, 10-and 20-year vision for NDE in 2011. This article describes the industrial members' newly-updated vision for NDE, which still includes many of the original priorities relating to future NDE requirements for existing assets and infrastructure. However, this updated industrial vision for NDE also identifies how NDE and monitoring technologies will need to adapt for 4IR and the contributions they will make towards realising this future industrial paradigm.

AB Project AURORA aims at the development of unmanned robotic airships capable of autonomous flight over user-defined locations for aerial inspection and environmental monitoring missions. In this article, the authors report a successful control and navigation scheme for a robotic airship flight path following. First, the AURORA airship, software environment, onboard system, and ground station infrastructures are described. Then, two main approaches for the automatic control and navigation system of the airship are presented. The first one shows the design of dedicated controllers based on the linearized dynamics of the vehicle. Following this methodology, experimental results for the airship flight path following through a set of predefined points in latitude/longitude, along with automatic altitude control are presented. A second approach considers the design of a single global nonlinear control scheme, covering all of the aerodynamic operational range in a sole formulation. Nonlinear control solutions under investigation for the AURORA airship are briefly described, along with some preliminary simulation results. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Agent is an autonomous, computational entity that can be viewed as perceiving its environment and acting upon it. Agents are event-driven objects that can be integrated in automated manufacturing environments to control certain tasks. In this paper a set of agents (a multi-agent system) is introduced to control an automated manufacturing environment. The architecture includes functions at the manufacturing cell level, materials handling and transport level, and factory scheduling level. Communication between these agents is accomplished by using a relational database (blackboard system). The relational database also integrates the requirements of a manufacturing execution system within the multi-agent task structure, which is unique to this architecture. Manufacturing cell and scheduling agents have been previously described in the literature. Here we focus our attention on the functions of the agents of the transport system, which is composed of a set of AGVs. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CHANNELS
AB With the advances in acoustic modem technology that enabled high-rate reliable communications, current research focuses on communication between various remote instruments within a network environment. Underwater acoustic (UWA) networks are generally formed by acoustically connected ocean-bottom sensors, autonomous underwater vehicles, and a surface station, which provides a link to an on-shore control center. While many applications require long-term monitoring of the deployment area, the battery-powered network nodes limit the lifetime of UWA networks. In addition, shallow-water acoustic channel characteristics, such as lon available bandwidth, highly-varying multipath, and large propagation delays, restrict the efficiency of UWA networks. Within such an environment, designing an UWA network that maximizes throughput and reliability while minimizing the power consumption becomes a very difficult task. The goal of this paper is to survey the existing network technology and its applicability to underwater acoustic channels. In addition, we present a shallow-water acoustic network example and outline some future research directions.

ID VISION
AB LiDAR object detection algorithms based on neural networks for autonomous driving require large amounts of data for training, validation, and testing. As real-world data collection and labeling are time-consuming and expensive, simulation-based synthetic data generation is a viable alternative. However, using simulated data for the training of neural networks leads to a domain shift of training and testing data due to differences in scenes, scenarios, and distributions. In this work, we quantify the sim-to-real domain shift by means of LiDAR object detectors trained with a new scenario-identical real-world and simulated dataset. In addition, we answer the questions of how well the simulated data resembles the real-world data and how well object detectors trained on simulated data perform on real-world data. Further, we analyze point clouds at the target-level by comparing real-world and simulated point clouds within the 3D bounding boxes of the targets. Our experiments show that a significant simto-real domain shift exists even for our scenario-identical datasets. This domain shift amounts to an average precision reduction of around 14 % for object detectors trained with simulated data. Additional experiments reveal that this domain shift can be lowered by introducing a simple noise model in simulation. We further show that a simple downsampling method to model real-world physics does not influence the performance of the object detectors.

AB Autonomous drones will play an essential role in human-machine teaming in future search and rescue (SAR) missions. We present a prototype that finds people fully autonomously in densely occluded forests. In the course of 17 field experiments conducted over various forest types and under different flying conditions, our drone found, in total, 38 of 42 hidden persons. For experiments with predefined flight paths, the average precision was 86%, and we found 30 of 34 cases. For adaptive sampling experiments (where potential findings are double-checked on the basis of initial classification confidences), all eight hidden persons were found, leading to an average precision of 100%, whereas classification confidence was increased on average by 15%. Thermal image processing, classification, and dynamic flight path adaptation are computed on-board in real time and while flying. We show that deep learning-based person classification is unaffected by sparse and error-prone sampling within straight flight path segments. This finding allows search missions to be substantially shortened and reduces the image complexity to 1/10th when compared with previous approaches. The goal of our adaptive online sampling technique is to find people as reliably and quickly as possible, which is essential in time-critical applications, such as SAR. Our drone enables SAR operations in remote areas without stable network coverage, because it transmits to the rescue team only classification results that indicate detections and can thus operate with intermittent mini mal-bandwidth connections (e.g., by satellite). Once received, these results can be visually enhanced for interpretation on remote mobile devices.

AB Due to the increasing capability of drones and requirements to monitor remote areas, drone surveillance is becoming popular. In case of natural disaster, it can scan the wide affected-area quickly and make the search and rescue (SAR) faster to save more human lives. However, using autonomous drone for search and rescue is least explored and require attention of researchers to develop efficient algorithms in autonomous drone surveillance. To develop an automated application using recent advancement of deep-learning, dataset is the key. For this, a substantial amount of human detection and action detection dataset is required to train the deep-learning models. As dataset of drone surveillance in SAR is not available in literature, this paper proposes an image dataset for human action detection for SAR. Proposed dataset contains 2000 unique images filtered from 75,000 images. It contains 30000 human instances of different actions. Also, in this paper various experiments are conducted with proposed dataset, publicly available dataset, and stat-of-the art detection method. Our experiments shows that existing models are not adequate for critical applications such as SAR, and that motivates us to propose a model which is inspired by the pyramidal feature extraction of SSD for human detection and action recognition Proposed model achieves 0.98mAP when applied on proposed dataset which is a significant contribution. In addition, proposed model achieve 7% higher mAP value when applied to standard Okutama dataset in comparison with the state-of-the-art detection models in literature.

AB Research with autonomous unmanned aircraft systems is reaching a new degree of sophistication where targeted missions require complex types of deliberative capability integrated in a practical manner in such systems. Due to these pragmatic constraints, integration is just as important as theoretical and applied work in developing the actual deliberative functionalities. In this article, we present a temporal logic-based task planning and execution monitoring framework and its integration into a fully deployed rotor-based unmanned aircraft system developed in our laboratory. We use a very challenging emergency services application involving body identification and supply delivery as a vehicle for showing the potential use of such a framework in real-world applications. TALplanner, a temporal logic-based task planner, is used to generate mission plans. Building further on the use of TAL (Temporal Action Logic), we show how knowledge gathered from the appropriate sensors during plan execution can be used to create state structures, incrementally building a partial logical model representing the actual development of the system and its environment over time. We then show how formulas in the same logic can be used to specify the desired behavior of the system and its environment and how violations of such formulas can be detected in a timely manner in an execution monitor subsystem. The pervasive use of logic throughout the higher level deliberative layers of the system architecture provides a solid shared declarative semantics that facilitates the transfer of knowledge between different modules.

AB Optimisation of route planning is becoming increasingly valuable aspect in agriculture. This study focuses on Agricultural Route Planning (ARP) in multifield areas (with a specific entrance point), incorporating several heterogeneous agricultural machines. The aim of this research is to improve the route planning of (semi -)autonomous machines by producing more efficient route plans. The problem sets of ARP contain both medium and large numbers of tracks consisting of irregular and rectangular fields. This research proposes a Fast Hybrid Algorithm (FHA) to address this problem. FHA incorporates various combinatorial operators into its structure. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to Tabu Search, (Improved) Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimisation, FHA can reduce the distance travelled by an average of 16.21%. Furthermore, the efficiency of FHA is also reflected in its running time, which saves up to 54.23% compared to the other methods.

AB The article adds to the theorisation of temporality within sustainability transitions by introducing the concept of prefiguration. Through two transport-related case studies, one technology experiment and one policy experiment, the article shows how prefiguration might elucidate the temporal aspects of experimentation. By employing the conceptual pair of ends-guided and ends effacing prefiguration, the article shows how the future-orientation characterising much technology experimentation allows for the indeterminate deferment of politics, whereas experiments focusing on present-day transformations must contend with politics from the outset. As such, technology experiments are characterised by a temporal buffer which allows them to elicit considerable support without engaging with possible issues or contestations. In conclusion, the article suggests that more attention should be paid to experiments that practice ends-effacing prefiguration, as to better understand their characteristics and their capability to successfully facilitate meaningful sociotechnical change.

AB Laser scanning, once a niche technology used mainly in the security systems, is now gaining new areas of application mainly in autonomous vehicles, as well as in the systems that allow the construction of precise 3D models of scanned objects. With the development of this technology, there are increasing demands on the precision of distance measurements and the ability to obtain information about properties of objects from which the laser radiation is reflected. These properties are described by the reflectance of the material. The reflectance of a material can be determined by precisely measuring the magnitude of the echo signal. Measuring the magnitude of the echo signal is severely hampered by the dynamics of the signal due to changes in the distance to the object. This paper presents a method for measuring the magnitude of the echo signal in real time even when the echo signal brings the detection channel amplifier to saturation.

AB In this paper, an autonomous navigation strategy is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on consideration of dynamic sampling and field of view (FOV). Compare to search-based motion planning, sampling-based kinodynamic planning schemes can often find feasible trajectories in complex environments. Specifically, a global trajectory is first generated with physical information, and an expansion algorithm is constructed regarding to kinodynamic rapidly-exploring random tree* (KRRT*). Then, a KRRT* expansion strategy is designed to find local collision-free trajectories. In trajectory optimization, bending radius, collision risk function, and yaw angle penalty term are defined by taking into account onboard sensor FOV and potential risk. Then, smooth and dynamic feasible terms are penalized based on initial trajectory generation. Trajectories are refined by time reallocation, and weights are solved by optimization. Effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by both simulation and experiment.

AB In order to support reliability and safety in autonomous driving services, vehicular networks should be able to efficiently and fairly allocate the time-varying and limited resources to multiple vehicles as quickly as possible. In this paper, we adopt the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) as the resource management strategy. However, the resource allocation based on the NBS requires exponentially increasing computational complexity for dynamically changing resources over time. We propose an analytic solution, referred to as the exact computation of the sequential NBS (ECS-NBS), to perfectly compute the NBS sequentially without any iterations. The key idea is to use the axiom of independence of linear transformations in NBS for the design of a transformation matrix that captures the changes in the adjacent feasible utility sets. This enables the NBS to be invariant to the change of utility sets over time, yielding the perfectly accurate NBS with the lowest complexity, as confirmed through simulations.

AB Ship deck landing control of a quadrotor requires certain robustness with respect to ship heave motion. Typical systems only provide relative height, therefore do not have relative heave rate information. In this paper, a linear output feedback control consisting of a full state feedback controller and a Luenberger observer is formulated. Invariant ellipsoid method is used to formulate an estimation of a bound on the response of a linear output feedback-controlled system subjected to external disturbances and measurement noise. The gains that result in a minimum bound are optimized using a gradient descent iterative approach proposed in this paper where the invariant ellipsoid condition is linearized into a tractable LMI condition. This approach is applied to a simulation of a quadrotor landing on a ship deck and results are compared with other gains. The gains selected using the proposed approach exhibits improved robustness to external disturbances and measurement noise.

AB Rising manned air traffic and deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles in complex operations requires integration of innovative and autonomous conflict detection and resolution methods. In this paper, the task of conflict detection and resolution is defined as an optimization problem searching for a heading control for cooperating airplanes using communication. For the optimization task, an objective function integrates both collision penalties and efficiency criteria considering airplanes' objectives (waypoints). The probability collectives optimizer is used as a solver for the specified optimization task. This paper provides two different implementation approaches to the presented optimization-based collision avoidance: 1) a parallel computation using multiagent deployment among participating airplanes and 2) semicentralized computation using the process-integrated-mechanism architecture. Both implementations of the proposed algorithm were implemented and evaluated in a multiagent airspace test bed AGENTFLY. The quality of the solution is compared with a negotiation-based cooperative collision avoidance method-an iterative peer-to-peer algorithm.

AB The precise point cloud ground segmentation is a crucial prerequisite of virtually all perception tasks for LiDAR sensors in autonomous vehicles. Especially the clustering and extraction of objects from a point cloud usually relies on an accurate removal of ground points. The correct estimation of the surrounding terrain is important for aspects of the drivability of a surface, path planning, and obstacle prediction. In this letter, we propose our system GroundGrid which relies on 2D elevation maps to solve the terrain estimation and point cloud ground segmentation problems. We evaluate the ground segmentation and terrain estimation performance of GroundGrid and compare it to other state-of-the-art methods using the SemanticKITTI dataset and a novel evaluation method relying on airborne LiDAR scanning. The results show that GroundGrid is capable of outperforming other state-of-the-art systems with an average IoU of 94.78% while maintaining a high run-time performance of 171 Hz.

AB Topology is a particular feature of road networks. Topology refers to properties, such as the connection of roads, but not only through their axes or reference lines, but also at the level of lanes. The map topology of road networks does not currently have procedures that can be expressed in mathematical formulas (or only to a minimal extent), but can only be implemented by algorithms. Our research, therefore, aimed at observing such topological regularities and then developing a method of investigation, by constructing rules and additional algorithms. To test this work, we used synthetic and real data, focusing on the case of map content embodied in four formats. In this paper, we present the test methods for the data models, the results of our test runs and finally, we point out that topological checks are extensively justified to determine the quality of the produced map. In the future we plan to develop an automatic correction mechanism based on this.

AB The instability of the underwater environment and underwater communication brings great challenges to the coordination and cooperation of the multi-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In this paper, a multi-AUV dynamic maneuver countermeasure algorithm is proposed based on the interval information game theory and fractional-order Differential Evolution (DE), in order to highlight the features of the underwater countermeasure. Firstly, an advantage function comprising the situation and energy efficiency advantages is proposed on account of the multi-AUV maneuver strategies. Then, the payoff matrix with interval information is established and the payment interval ranking is achieved based on relative entropy. Subsequently, the maneuver countermeasure model is presented along with the Nash equilibrium condition satisfying the interval information game. The fractional-order DE algorithm is applied for solving the established problem to determine the optimal strategy. Finally, the superiority of the proposed multi-AUV maneuver countermeasure algorithm is verified through an example.

A 2-D array of square-base pyramids engraved on the plastic radar cover was optimized to achieve minimum reflection for a wide range of incident angles, +/- 40 degrees, and across the operating frequency band of 76-81 GHz. More importantly, we present an alternative radome texture, namely, the inverse-pyramid corrugations, which results in improved structural integrity compared to the pyramidal corrugations. This novel inverse-pyramid radome structure is also much easier to manufacture and achieves similar performance as the more conventional pyramid structure. Both designs are shown to significantly reduce radar cover reflections, which is perhaps the most significant bottleneck in modern mmW automotive radar sensor performance.

ID NAVIGATION
AB With the sharp decrease of land-based resources, ocean resources have become more important to guarantee the sustainable development for human than ever. In recent years, the rapid progress of ocean technology, especially in deep-sea AUV(Autonomous Underwater Vehicle), has made the depth of exploration and exploitation of ocean resources deeper and deeper. Due to there is no DVL(Doppler Velocity Log) product can work in the water depth of 10000 m, the INS(Inertial Navigation System) cannot work well. Thus, we supply a pure geometric Single-Beacon localization algorithm for our full depth ocean AUV. The range between AUV and one calibrated bea-con together with heading are used to estimate the location of AUV. It has less latency than USBL(Ultra Short Base-Line) in the deep sea. Comparing with the LBL(Long Base-Line), less beacons and initialization time are required in this system. It's a simple and yet cost efficient localization mode for our full ocean depth AUV.

AB Most cities have adopted smart city services to solve urban problems. However, an examination of their operations reveals that many of these services have either been discontinued or have failed to advance further since they were not profitable. Therefore, this study reviews and proposes the business models of smart city services at a fundamental level. It defines and classifies the smart city service focusing on transportation and the components. The business model has been constructed for electric vehicles and autonomous shuttle businesses in terms of transportation services. It found that the model was profitable in each business only when various stakeholders were linked for mutual interests. Since various service stakeholders cooperate in smart city service, if one of them is unable to secure profitability, it is difficult to operate the smart city service fully. Therefore, a detailed review of the business model is required before providing a smart city service.

AB Theability to efficiently plan and execute automated and precise search missions using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during emergency response situations is imperative. Precise navigation between obstacles and time-efficient searching of 3D structures and buildings are essential for locating survivors and people in need in emergency response missions. In this work we address this challenging problem by proposing a unified search planning framework that automates the process of UAV-based search planning in 3D environments. Specifically, we propose a novel search planning framework which enables automated planning and execution of collision-free search trajectories in 3D by taking into account low-level mission constrains (e.g., the UAV dynamical and sensing model), mission objectives (e.g., the mission execution time and the UAV energy efficiency) and user-defined mission specifications (e.g., the 3D structures to be searched and minimum detection probability constraints). The capabilities and performance of the proposed approach are demonstrated through extensive simulated 3D search scenarios.

   A design of a sensor applicable to indoor surveying is presented. The sensor is a lightweight module and is suitable for mobile use either installed on a remotely controlled or autonomous mobile unmanned platform. For test purposes a mobile ground based unmanned vehicle was developed by the authors and the sensor was mounted on that platform. In the case of the utilized testbed, the gamma/beta radiological sensor is directly connected to the main processor unit (digital signal processor microcontroller) of the unmanned platform. The latter was developed to prototype stage and is herein described. The presented novel design is compared to previous work while advantages over existing technology are established. Experimental results of measurements of radiation sources are shown and discussed.

AB The light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology is based on irradiating near-infrared light and measuring the time-of-flight of the scattered light in an object. This technology is becoming increasingly important, as the requirement of three-dimensional camera technology for future autonomous vehicles is on the rise. In this study, we propose an ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) optical system for LiDAR that can sequentially scan a beam emitted from a high power laser through a small beam steering system using a liquid lens and a fisheye lens. The proposed optical system consists of a series of liquid lenses for beam steering, a commercial fisheye lens with a wide FOV, and a relay optics to effectively conjugate the intermediate image planes of the two lens systems. To verify theoretical feasibility, we have designed a practical optical system with an FOV of approximately 170 degrees, which is much higher than the FOVs in any other non-rotating LiDAR systems.

AB Road detection is an important task in autonomous navigation systems. In this paper, we propose a road detection framework induced by the inverse depth of LiDAR's point cloud. This framework is a fusion of a 3-D LiDAR and a monocular camera, where the 3-D point cloud of LiDAR is projected onto the camera's image frame, to exploit both range and color information. For the same road detection task, we propose an inverse-depth aware fully convolutional neural network based on image information and a line scanning strategy based on an inverse-depth histogram of LiDAR's point cloud. Finally, a conditional random field fusion method integrates the two road detection results. Our method is evaluated on KITTI-Road benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in road detection among all the referable methods that have ever reported their results on the KITTI-Road benchmark.

   systems; well logging
AB The measurement of fluid and rock properties within oil and gas wells is critical to efficient hydrocarbon production. These data are generally acquired by wireline logging, where sensors are lowered into the well at the end of a long cable. The handling of this cable adds significant cost to downhole data acquisition. In this paper, a proof of concept demonstration of an untethered sensor platform for logging vertical wells is presented. The platform is the size of a golf ball and works based on buoyancy change. The buoyant sensor housing and electronics initially holds a weight such that it sinks in the well. It releases the weight when it reaches a programmed depth and floats back up to the surface, logging data during the whole operation. The data are downloaded after retrieving the sensor. This miniaturized, tetherless platform can reduce the cost of logging operations and pave the way for semipermanent downhole sensors.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB This paper suggests a novelmethod for a mobile robot to plan its path towards a target through an unknown environment, using sensors to discover new obstacles along the way. The method synthesizes an artificial temperature gradient throughout the known environment by numerically solving the heat conduction partial differential equation, where obstacles encountered during the robot navigation are "hot" and the target is "cold." The temperature at all other points on the known environment grid are computed numerically, and are continuously updated to account for new obstacles. This method ensures the creation of navigational potential field with no danger of being trapped in local minima. A computer simulation demonstrates the technique on several environment types. In addition, an experiment was conducted on a mobile robot that can navigate indoors and outdoors in real time using this method. The simulations and experiment show that the temperature gradient method is robust in its ability to find paths, and is practical for online sensor based navigation of mobile robots.

DT Article
AB An onboard navigation system for a space vehicle (satellite) as it is inserted into a geostationary orbit using a low-thrust engine is considered. The navigation system uses optoelectronic Earth, Sun, and star sensors and a multichannel GNSS signal receiver. The purpose of the study is to form a general design of the integrated navigation system, including the justification of its architecture and operation algorithms, based on requirements for the accuracy of the navigation problem solution. To integrate various measurements, a quasilinear Kalman filter and its special "scalar" modification are used. The vector to be estimated onboard the spacecraft consists of the coordinate and velocity components, the attitude of its body axis, and the attitude and actual thrust of its main thruster. Instrument sensor errors are considered as uncontrollable factors. The main tool for the analysis of the navigation system error is simulation, which is performed using dedicated software developed using the object-oriented paradigm.

AB During the past few years, research in the field of cooperative control of swarms of robots and especially UAV has continuously increased. In order to develop research in the field of swarms of UAV, this paper identifies three problems: the development of a testbed for UAV, the implementation of an ad hoc network and a protocol based on network control, and a consensus control algorithm for cooperative control of UAV. The testbed currently enables us to perform waypoint navigation using a Global Positioning System (GPS). The protocol communication designed for the ad hoc network has proved to be reliable for our application and can be expanded to be used with different numbers of agents. The algorithm of consensus control has been analyzed and tested in simulation. Future work will allow implementing the consensus control as a centralized or distributed control.

AB In this paper, proposed is a design of a robust controller for a fish robot. A simple third order model is used to develop the feedback controller. With proper weighting functions augmented for loop shaping, a robust controller is obtained using H-infinity control methodology. Frequency analysis shows that the proposed controller is very robust, having gain margin of 17.3 dB and phase margin of 44.8 degrees, respectively. The stability robustness and performance analysis is done using step input and uncertainties of damping, and natural frequency. The step disturbance and measurement noises are also considered. The simulation results show that the proposed controller keeps the stability and performance even though there are a little degradation of them as uncertainties increase. The experimental result also demonstrates that the controller works well in a real fish robot. Thus it is expected that the proposed controller can be used effectively in real environment with model uncertainties and disturbances.

DE multiple agents; cooperative search; negotiation; autonomous vehicles
AB Because of limited sensor and communication ranges, designing efficient mechanisms for cooperative tasks is difficult. In this article, several negotiation schemes for multiple agents performing a cooperative task are presented. The negotiation schemes provide suboptimal solutions, but have attractive features of fast decision-making, and scalability to large number of agents without increasing the complexity of the algorithm. A software agent architecture of the decision-making process is also presented. The effect of the magnitude of information flow during the negotiation process is studied by using different models of the negotiation scheme. The performance of the various negotiation schemes, using different information structures, is studied based on the uncertainty reduction achieved for a specified number of search steps. The negotiation schemes perform comparable to that of optimal strategy in terms of uncertainty reduction and also require very low computational time, similar to 7 per cent to that of optimal strategy. Finally, analysis on computational and communication requirement for the negotiation schemes is carried out.

TI Autonomy architecture for aerobot exploration of Saturnian moon Titan
SO IEEE AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS MAGAZINE

DT Article
AB The Huygens probe arrived at Saturn's moon, Titan, January 14, 2005, unveiling a world that is radically different from any other in the solar system. The data obtained, complemented by continuing observations from the Cassini spacecraft, show methane lakes, river channels and drainage basins, sand dunes, cryovolcanos and sierras. This has led to an enormous scientific interest in a follow-up mission to Titan, using a robotic lighter-than-air vehicle (or aerobot). Aerobots have modest power requirements, can fly missions with extended durations, and have very long distance traverse capabilities. They can execute regional surveys, transport and deploy scientific instruments and in-situ laboratory facilities over vast distances, and also provide surface sampling at strategic science sites. This describes our progress in the development of the autonomy technologies that will be required for exploration of Titan. We provide an overview of the autonomy architecture and some of its key components. We also show results obtained from autonomous flight tests conducted in the Mojave Desert(1,2).

AB Autonomous navigation in open and dynamic environments is an important challenge, requiring to solve several difficult research problems located on the cutting edge of the state of the art. Basically, these problems may be classified into three main categories: (a) SLAM in dynamic environments; (b) detection, characterization, and behavior prediction of the potential moving obstacles; and (c) online motion planning and safe navigation decision based on world state predictions. This paper addresses some aspects of these problems and presents our latest approaches and results. The solutions we have implemented are mainly based on the followings paradigms: multiscale world representation of static obstacles based on the wavelet occupancy grid; adaptative clustering for moving obstacle detection inspired on Kohonen networks and the growing neural gas algorithm; and characterization and motion prediction of the observed moving entities using Hidden Markov Models coupled with a novel algorithm for structure and parameter learning.

AB Annotated datasets have become crucial for training Machine Learning (ML) models for developing Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and their functions. Generating these datasets usually involves a complex coordination of automation and manual effort. Moreover, most available labelling tools focus on specific media types (e.g., images or video). Consequently, they cannot perform complex labelling tasks for multi-sensor setups. Recently, ASAM published OpenLABEL, a standard designed to specify an annotation format flexible enough to support the development of automated driving features and to guarantee interoperability among different systems and providers. In this work, we present WebLabel, the first multipurpose web application tool for labelling complex multi-sensor data that is fully compliant with OpenLABEL 1.0. The proposed work analyses several labelling use cases demonstrating the standard's benefits and the application's flexibility to cover various heterogeneous requirements: image labelling, multi-view video object annotation, point-cloud view-based labelling for 3D geometries and action recognition.

AB This paper develops a receding horizon optimisation scheme for integrated behaviour decision-making and trajectory tracking to ensure the dynamic collision avoidance of an autonomous surface vessel (ASV). We apply Q-learning to make behaviour decisions because manoeuvring habit requirements and COLREGS must be satisfied in dynamic collision avoidance scenarios. The heading course and vessel speed are considered to transmit the outcome of behaviour decision-making to a trajectory tracking model predictive control (MPC) controller. Next, a trajectory tracking nonlinear controller for the ASV is developed within the MPC framework, in which a set of nonlinear constraints is designed for collision avoidance. Specifically, depending on the heading course and vessel speed, the collision avoidance constraints can be switched to allow the controller to execute the behaviour decision. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed receding horizon optimisation scheme.

AB Dynamical games model interactions between agents that take place in ever-shifting environments. Due to the increasing penetration of autonomous systems to society, understanding and predicting the outcomes of these games has become crucial. In this work, we highlight the importance of nonequilibrium solutions to dynamical games through the lens of bounded rationality. We describe the principles of level-k thinking and cognitive hierarchy - concepts developed in the field of economics - via mathematical tools and formulation of control theory. We describe the main principles of bounded rationality for nonequilibrium differential games in both nonlinear non-zero-sum and linear zero-sum settings. The importance of those approaches is highlighted in problems of pursuit evasion between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, while the core of the bounded rationality principles that we employ are extended to discrete stochastic dynamical games. The versatility of the proposed approach is complemented by rigorous mathematical guarantees that enable predictability of the games' outcomes

AB The research and development of the ocean has been gaining in popularity in recent years, and the problem of target searching and hunting in the unknown marine environment has been a pressing problem. To solve this problem, a distributed dynamic predictive control (DDPC) algorithm based on the idea of predictive control is proposed. The task-environment region information and the input of the AUV state update are obtained by predicting the state of multi-AUV systems and making online task optimization decisions and then locking the search area for the following moment. Once a moving target is found in the search process, the AUV conducts a distributed hunt based on the theory of potential points, which solves the problem of the reasonable distribution of potential points during the hunting process and realizes the formation of hunting rapidly. Compared with other methods, the simulation results show that the algorithm exhibits high efficiency and adaptability.

AB Navigation in an unknown environment without any preexisting positioning infrastructure has always been hard for mobile robots. This paper presents a self-deployable ultra wideband UWB infrastructure by mobile agents, that permits a dynamic placement and runtime extension of UWB anchors infrastructure while the robot explores the new environment. We provide a detailed analysis of the uncertainty of the positioning system while the UWB infrastructure grows. Moreover, we developed a genetic algorithm that minimizes the deployment of new anchors, saving energy and resources on the mobile robot and maximizing the time of the mission. Although the presented approach is general for any class of mobile system, we run simulations and experiments with indoor drones. Results demonstrate that maximum positioning uncertainty is always controlled under the user's threshold, using the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDoP).

AB There is a lot of interest in problems of multivehicle systems (MVSs) in recent years due to their wide range of applications. In this paper, we are closely examining three approaches for dealing with problems of coordination control strategies in (MVSs). First, a distributed control approach is discussed where the controller here is designed using bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) technique. Second, a two-level control approach is provided in which a global controller is used to supervise the overall performance of the (MVSs) by sending corrective signals to the local controllers of the agents. In this approach, there is no direct communication among agents but all of the communication with the global controller. Third, a cloud-based control approach is addressed which benefits of the technological advances in networked control systems theory. Computer simulations are performed on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and comparative studies among the approaches are elucidated throughout the paper. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute.

AB Modern cameras typically use an array of millions of detector pixels to capture images. By contrast, single-pixel cameras use a sequence of mask patterns to filter the scene along with the corresponding measurements of the transmitted intensity which is recorded using a single-pixel detector. This review considers the development of single-pixel cameras from the seminal work of Duarte et al. up to the present state of the art. We cover the variety of hardware configurations, design of mask patterns and the associated reconstruction algorithms, many of which relate to the field of compressed sensing and, more recently, machine learning. Overall, single-pixel cameras lend themselves to imaging at non-visible wavelengths and with precise timing or depth resolution. We discuss the suitability of single-pixel cameras for different application areas, including infrared imaging and 3D situation awareness for autonomous vehicles.

AB In this paper, a novel fixed-time fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed for trajectory tracking of marine surface vessels (MSVs). A fixed-time extended state observer (FXESO) is developed to enhance the robustness. In conjunction with the FXESO, a fixed-time sliding mode control (FXSMC) law is applied to trajectory tracking control. The designed tracking control system can be stabilized to the origin in fixed time in the presence of actuator faults (AF), unmodelled dynamics, unmeasurable system states and exogenous disturbances. Specially, the convergence time of the system is independent of the initial states of an MSV. Meanwhile, a complete proof of closed-loop fixed-time stability is given. Finally, comparative simulations manifest the performance and advantage of the developed fixed-time control method.

AB Multiple two-dimensional laser rangefinders (LRFs) are applied in many applications like mobile robotics, autonomous vehicles, and three-dimensional reconstruction. The extrinsic calibration between LRFs is the first step to perform data fusion and practical application. In this paper, we proposed a simple method to calibrate LRFs based on a corner composed of three mutually perpendicular planes. In contrast to other methods that require a special pattern or assistance from other sensors, the trihedron corner needed in this method is common in daily environments. In practice, we can adjust the position of the LRFs to observe the corner until the laser scanning plane intersects with three planes of the corner. Then, we formed a Perspective-Three-Point problem to solve the position and orientation of each LRF at the common corner coordinate system. The method was validated with synthetic and real experiments, showing better performance than existing methods.

ID VOICE QUALITY
AB Online communities have recently developed a novel genre of performance aimed at triggering Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), a tingling sensation prompted by soft voices and other stimuli. In China, these performances were banned in 2018 due to a rise in sexually charged videos purporting to be ASMR. Through acoustic and content analysis, this study argues that, rather than ASMR being a vehicle for sexual content, conventional and sexual Chinese ASMR performances constitute two separate genres. While all performers index intimate affective stances, conventional ASMR performers construct the persona of a calm, gentle professional, while sexual performers evoke the childish, amateur camgirl and sajiao ("whining") persona. These performances illustrate Chinese content creators' juxtaposition of local and non-local semiotic resources as they participate in transnational online communities. The phenomenon of ASMR also highlights the sensual nature of the voice and underscores the necessity of incorporating sensuality into theorizations of sociolinguistic meaning.

AB The emerging scenarios of cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as autonomous vehicles, require implementing complex functionality with limited resources, as well as high performances. This paper considers a common setup in which multiple control and non-control tasks share one processor, and proposes a dual-mode strategy. The control task switches between two sampling periods when rejecting (coping with) a disturbance. We create an optimisation framework looking for the switching sampling periods and time instants that maximise the control performance (indexed by settling time) and resource efficiency (indexed by the number of tasks that are schedulable on the processor). The latter objective is enabled with schedulability analysis tailored for the dual-mode model. Experimental results show that (i) given a set of tasks, the proposed strategy improves the control performances whilst retaining schedulability; and (ii) given requirements on the control performances, the proposed strategy is able to schedule more tasks.

AB Due to the introduction of robotic applications in the modern society, such as service robots or self-driving cars, it is possible to use this trend as motivating factor in the learning process of robotics. Several possibilities about how to use this motivation to increase learning rate are analysed, focusing on underwater robotic simulators. Moreover, a cloud learning environment able to evaluate the students with a robotic simulator is proposed as key element of the system. These kinds of tools can be used with just an Internet-capable system through a web browser, reaching a virtually unlimited amount of resources. The implemented features are used in a underwater pipe following application, creating a comparison environment on the cloud that immerse students in a competition to reach the best possible result. Finally, a first experience in a real educational environment using the proposed tool is detailed, demonstrating the viability and suitability of the proposed tool.

ID DESIGN
AB There has been increasing interest in a type of underactuated mechanical systems, mobile-wheeled inverted-pendulum (MWIP) models, which are widely used in the field of autonomous robotics and intelligent vehicles. Robust-velocity-tracking problem of the MWIP systems is investigated in this study. In the velocity-control problem, model uncertainties accompany uncertain equilibriums, which make the controller design become more difficult. Two sliding-mode-control (SMC) methods are proposed for the systems, both of which are capable of handling both parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The asymptotical stabilities of the corresponding closed-loop systems are achieved through the selection of sliding-surface parameters, which are based on some rules. There is still a steady tracking error when the first SMC controller is used. By assuming a novel sliding surface, the second SMC controller is designed to solve this problem. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is finally confirmed by the numerical simulations.

ID ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) faces significant challenges in the requirements of sensitive task latency, reasonable resource allocation and reliability for resource transactions. This paper introduces a novel method for road resource allocation in the IoT context of connected and autonomous electric vehicles (CAEVs). The proposed algorithm leverages the ant colony algorithm (ACA) to effectively allocate and coordinate road resources within groups of CAEVs. By considering the energy consumption and pheromone volatilization, the allocation and coordination process of road resources are optimized. To improve the linear packet loss of RED, we adopt the advanced ACA and CRED in the NS2 platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the RED algorithm in packet loss rate and delay time, significantly enhancing system efficiency and performance. Furthermore, the combination of the CRED algorithm and ant colony algorithm successfully mitigates short-term congestion and identifies optimized paths with minimal delay.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID SURFACE-WAVE TOMOGRAPHY; AMBIENT NOISE
AB Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) imaging is an important challenge in many fields ranging from autonomous vehicles and smart cities to defense applications. Several recent works in optics and acoustics tackle the challenge of imaging targets hidden from view (e.g. placed around a corner) by measuring time-of-flight information using active SONAR/LiDAR techniques, effectively mapping the Green functions (impulse responses) from several controlled sources to an array of detectors. Here, leveraging passive correlations-based imaging techniques (also termed 'acoustic daylight imaging'), we study the possibility of acoustic NLoS target localization around a corner without the use of controlled active sources. We demonstrate localization and tracking of a human subject hidden around a corner in a reverberating room using Green functions retrieved from correlations of broadband uncontrolled noise sources recorded by multiple detectors. Our results demonstrate that for NLoS localization controlled active sources can be replaced by passive detectors as long as a sufficiently broadband noise is present in the scene.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
AB This work seeks to capture how an expert interacts with a structure during a facade inspection so that more detailed and situationally-aware inspections can be done with autonomous robots in the future. Eye tracking maps where an inspector is looking during a structural inspection, and it recognizes implicit human attention. Experiments were performed on a facade during a damage assessment to analyze key, visually-based features that are important for understanding human-infrastructure interaction during the process. For data collection and analysis, experiments were conducted to assess an inspector's behavioral changes while assessing a real structure. These eye tracking features provided the basis for the inspector's intent prediction and were used to understand how humans interact with the structure during the inspection processes. This method will facilitate information-sharing and decision-making during the inspection processes for collaborative human-robot teams; thus, it will enable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for future building inspection through artificial intelligence support.

AB The automotive Ethernet is an emerging area for exploiting the high network bandwidth and scalable network design in automated driving systems. Low-latency live video streaming over the automotive Ethernet is a challenging part of this concept because of its significance for driving situation awareness in real time. In order to achieve low-latency live video streaming on resource-constrained automotive electric control units, the streaming needs to be conducted with a fine-grained resource control. This article proposes a raw format live video streaming framework that resiliently controls the number of raw format video packets with consideration of available CPU resources. The evaluation on a testbed demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves low-latency live video streaming by securing available CPU resources.

AB The importance of predictive maintenance (PdM) programs has been recognized across many industries. Seamless integration of the PdM program into today's manufacturing execution systems requires a scalable and generic system design and a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) to make condition monitoring and PdM activities more effective. In this study, a new PdM system and its implementation are presented. KPIs and metrics are proposed and implemented during the design to enhance the system and the PdM performance monitoring needs. The proposed system has been tested in two independent use cases (autonomous transfer vehicle and electric motor) for condition monitoring applications to detect incipient equipment faults or operational anomalies. Machine learning-based data augmentation tools and models are introduced and automated with state-of-the-art AutoML and workflow automation technologies to increase the system's data collection and data-driven fault classification performance.

AB Visual perception is a critical task for autonomous driving. Understanding the driving environment in real time can assist a vehicle in driving safely. In this study, we proposed a multi-task learning framework for simultaneous traffic object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation in an efficient way. Our network encoder extracts features from an input image and three decoders at multilevel branches handle specific tasks. The decoders share the feature maps with more similar tasks for joint semantic understanding. Multiple loss functions are automatically weighted summed to learn multiple objectives simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on a BerkeleyDeepDrive100K (BDD100K) dataset. In the experiment, the proposed method outperforms the competing multi-task and single-task methods in terms of accuracy and maintains a real-time inference at more than 37 frames per second.

AB Deep reinforcement learning has been demonstrated to be an effective solution to the multi-robot collision avoidance problem. However, with existing methods, robots typically generate actions only based on local observations, sometimes augmented with global communication. Their performance deteriorates in limited bandwidth environments and complex scenarios with various obstacles and high robot density. We propose SelComm, a selective communication framework to generate cooperative and collision-free actions for robots in multi-robot navigation tasks. Specifically, we develop a decentralized message selector, enabling each robot to calculate relations with other robots using both agent-level information and sensor-level information, and select the most valuable messages to meet the bandwidth limitation. Then we introduce the attentional communication channel for efficient communication. Our experimental evaluations based on various scenarios demonstrate that SelComm learns more cooperative behaviors and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in limited bandwidth environments and complex scenarios.

AB This paper proposes a method based on the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) dynamic model and complex network theory to effectively monitor the abnormal motion conditions of the AUV on the vertical plane. First of all, we simplify the AUV's dynamic model and use a neural network to identify its parameters. The error between the dynamic model's output and the AUV measurement is employed to build a weighted complex network, which describes the AUV motion condition pattern. Afterwards, the feature matrix is extracted from the complex network. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is introduced to classify the feature matrix, and the three abnormal motion conditions are classified. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively monitor the abnormal motion conditions of AUV. Compared with other advanced methods, the performance of the proposed method is greatly improved.

AB Effectively detecting pedestrians in various environments would significantly improve driving safety for autonomous vehicles. However, the degrpted visibility and blurred outline and appearance of pedestrian images captured during hazy weather strongly limit the effectiveness of current pedestrian detection methods. To solve this problem, this article presents three novel deep learning approaches based on you only look once. The depth wise separable convolution and linear bottleneck skills were used to reduce the computational cost and number of parameters, rendering our network more efficient. We also innovatively developed a weighted combination layer in one of the approaches by combining multiscale feature maps and a squeeze and excitation block. Collected pedestrian images in hazy weather were augmented using six strategies to enrich the database. Experimental results show that our proposed methods can effectively detect pedestrians in hazy weather, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed.

ID VEHICLE
AB In the autonomous sidelink resource scheduling for Cellular V2X (C-V2X), the standard sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) algorithm relies on several mechanisms such as random resource selection, resource utilization pattern monitoring, and probabilistic reselection to minimize packet collisions and to cope with vehicular topology changes. Even so, the collision probability is still not negligible, and its performance is far from the projected requirements for low latency and high reliability applications for future C-V2X communication. In this article, we propose a reservation mechanism that supplements the standard SPS for C-V2X Sidelink Mode 4, which visibly improves the performance in face of congestion and in the fringe of the communication range. In particular, we demonstrate that the reservation achieves the best performance if made much earlier than actual use of the reserved resource at least by an average of one second.

DT Article
DE Aerial systems: applications; motion and path planning; autonomous

AB In this letter, we propose a novel motion planning framework for quadrotor teach-and-repeat applications. Instead of controlling the drone to precisely follow the teaching path, our method converts an arbitrary jerky human-piloted trajectory to a topologically equivalent one, which is guaranteed to be safe, smooth, and kinodynamically feasible with an expected aggressiveness. Our proposed planning framework optimizes the trajectory in both spatial and temporal aspects. In the spatial layer, a flight corridor is found to represent the free space that is topologically equivalent with the teaching path. Then, aminimum-jerk piecewise trajectory is generated within the flight corridor. In the temporal layer, the trajectory is re-parameterized to obtain a minimum-time temporal trajectory under kinodynamic constraints. The spatial and temporal optimizations are both formulated as convex programs and are done iteratively. The proposed method is integrated into a complete quadrotor system and is validated to perform aggressive flights in challenging indoor and outdoor environments.

TI Prophets of Party in American Political History
SO FORUM-A JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; REFORM; RISE
AB This article pursues a developmental understanding of American parties as autonomous and thick collective actors through a comparison of four key historical actors we term "prophets of party": partisans of the nine-teenth-century Party Period; Progressive reformers; mid-twentieth century liberal Democrats; and activists in and around the body popularly known as the McGovern-Fraser Commission. Leading theories portray political parties as the vehicles either of ambitious politicians or of groups eager to extract benefits from the state. Yet such analyses leave underdetermined the path from such actors' desires for power to the parties' wielding of it. That path is mediated by partisan forms and practices that have varied widely across institutional and cultural context. As parties search for electoral majority, they do so in the long shadow of ideas and practices, layered and accreted across time, concerning the role of parties in political life. We analyze four such prophesies, trace their layered contributions to their successors, and reflect on their legacy for contemporary party politics.

AB This paper presents a computational system designed to perform autonomous indoor flights using low-cost equipment. Depending on the mission to be accomplished, one or two Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 quadrotors are supposed to fly in a three-dimensional workspace, guided by the navigation algorithms embedded in the proposed framework, which runs in a ground control computer. The tasks addressed involve positioning, trajectory tracking and leader-follower formation control. The key techniques required to solve such problems are reported in topics, including the mathematic modelling of the quadrotor, a model-based nonlinear flight controller and a state estimation strategy for sensory data fusion. The framework embeds the last two subsystems just mentioned, plus a communication link between the ground computer and the aircraft, to read the sensory data and to send the control signals necessary to guide the vehicle. Some experimental results are also presented and discussed, which allow concluding that the proposed methods are efficient in accomplishing the tasks addressed.

AB Compact fuel cell system was developed for a portable power generator. The power generator features a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) using a chemical hydride as a hydrogen source. The hydrogen generator extracted hydrogen using a catalytic hydrolysis from a sodium borohydride alkaline solution. A novel concept using an all-in-one reactor was proposed in which a catalyst, hydrogen chamber and byproduct separator were combined in a volume. In addition, the reactor as well as a pump, cooling fans, valves and controller was integrated in a single module. A 100W PEMFC stack was connected with the hydrogen generator and was evaluated at various load conditions. It was verified that the stable hydrogen supply was achieved and the developed system can be used to drive fuel cell-powered unmanned autonomous systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The rapid development of scanning technology, especially mobile scanning, gives the possibility to collect spatial data coming from maritime measurement platforms and autonomous manned or unmanned vehicles. Presented solution is derived from the mobile scanning. However we should keep in mind that the specificity of laser scanning at sea and processing collected data should be in the form acceptable in Geographical Information Systems, especially typical for the maritime needs. At the same time we should be aware that data coming from maritime mobile scanning constitutes a new approach to the describing of maritime environment and brings a new perspective that is completely different than air and terrestrial scanning.
   Therefore, the authors, would like to present results of an experiment aimed at testing the possibilities of using mobile scanning at sea. Experiment was conducted in the harbour and the associated environment of neighbouring southern coast of the Baltic Sea.

AB Street lighting is a ubiquitous utility, but sustaining its operation presents a heavy financial and environmental burden. Many schemes have been proposed which selectively dim lights to improve energy efficiency, but little consideration has been given to the usefulness of the resultant street lighting system. This paper proposes a real-time adaptive lighting scheme, which detects the presence of vehicles and pedestrians and dynamically adjusts their brightness to the optimal level. This improves the energy efficiency of street lighting and its usefulness; a streetlight utility model is presented to evaluate this. The proposed scheme is simulated using an environment modelling a road network, its users, and a networked communication system - and considers a real streetlight topology from a residential area. The proposed scheme achieves similar or improved utility to existing schemes, while consuming as little as 1-2% of the energy required by conventional and state-of-the-art techniques.

AB Multibody dynamics (MBD) covers a system of many bodies linked together via kinematic constraints. Thus, EOM (equations of motion) of a multibody system basically contain constraint equations between bodies, which are non-linear equations. Also, the forces acting on the system, such as contact force between bodies or damping forces etc., are usually highly non-linear. In this paper, several MBD applications in design were introduced based on researches carried out in the NRL (National Research Laboratory) of CAE in Korea. ANCF (Absolute nodal coordinate formulation) simulations and experiments, unwinding mechanism of cables, AutoDyn7 (Automobile Dynamics in G7 project) program, PNU (Pusan National University) driving simulator, air-cell seat for passenger cars, optimum speed decision of an unmanned autonomous vehicle, MBD modeling of a drum type washing machine and circuit breaker were introduced. And non-linear mechanics involved in MBD modelings of those systems were also explained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mid-ocean ridge volcanism and extensional faulting are the fundamental processes that lead to the creation and rifting of oceanic crust, yet these events go largely undetected in the deep ocean. Currently, the only means available to observe seafloor-spreading events in real time is via the remote detection of the seismicity generated during faulting or intrusion of magma into brittle oceanic crust. Hydrophones moored in the ocean provide an effective means for detecting these small-magnitude earthquakes, and the use of this technology during the last two decades has facilitated the real-time detection of mid-ocean ridge seafloor eruptions and confirmation of subseafloor microbial ecosystems. As technology evolves and mid-ocean ridge studies move into a new era, we anticipate an expanding network of seismo-acoustic sensors integrated into seafloor fiber-optic cabled observatories, satellite-telemetered surface buoys, and autonomous vehicle platforms.

AB Within the EMOBOT approach to adaptive behaviour, the task of learning to control the behaviour is one of the most interesting challenges. Learned action selection between classically implemented control mechanisms, with respect to internal values and sensor readings, provides a way to modulate a variety of behavioural capabilities. To demonstrate the potential of the learning emotional controller, we chose a 10-5-12 MLP to implement the sigma, alpha controller of the EMOBOT. Since no teacher vector is available for the chosen task, the neural network is trained with a reinforcement strategy. The emotion-value-dependent reinforcement signal, together with the output of the network, is the basis with which to compute an artificial teacher vector. Then, the established gradient descent method (backpropagation of error) is applied to train the neural network. First results obtained by extensive simulations show that a still unrevealed richness in behaviour can be realised when using the neural-network-based learning emotional controller.

AB This paper investigates the distributed optimal formation tracking control problem based on backstepping technique and reinforcement learning for multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Based on the graph theory, we propose a virtual distributed formation tracking controller in the kinematics model while the barrier Lyapunov function is utilized to make sure the connectivity preservation and the collision avoidance. An optimal controller based on the reinforcement learning(RL) is designed to minimize a cost function in the dynamic motion, and critic-actor neural networks (NNs) are further applied for online implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithm. As a result, the optimal control design for the underactuated AUVs with the uncertain Hydrodynamic can be online realized. The command filter is adopted to solve the issue of the explosion of complexity. The simulation results are given to confirm the validity of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents an adaptive trajectory planning approach for nonlinear dynamical systems based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). This methodology is applied to the authors' recently published optimization-based trajectory planning approach named nonlinear model predictive horizon (NMPH). The resulting design, which we call 'adaptive NMPH', generates optimal trajectories for an autonomous vehicle based on the system's states and its environment. This is done by tuning the NMPH's parameters online using two different actor-critic DRL-based algorithms, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC). Both adaptive NMPH variants are trained and evaluated on an aerial drone inside a high-fidelity simulation environment. The results demonstrate the learning curves, sample complexity, and stability of the DRL-based adaptation scheme and show the superior performance of adaptive NMPH relative to our earlier designs.

AB In this article, we propose a decentralized approach to formation control in groups of stochastic mobile robots. Different from existing work, we explicitly model the presence of stochastic perturbations affecting the dynamics and model the multivehicle system through stochastic differential equations. We design a decentralized formation control strategy where only a subset of informed agents is aware of the desired target locations and derive sufficient conditions for almost sure convergence to the desired formation pattern. Specifically, we illustrate how the achievement of the control goal is related to the intensity of the noise and to the topology of the communication graph among the robots. The proposed formation control strategy is tested through extensive numerical analyses and validated experimentally on ground robots.

AB Smart Grid 2.0 is envisaged to automate the operations of the intelligent electricity grid. Blockchain and smart contracts are integrated to facilitate the transformation from DSO-centric operations to consumer-oriented, distributed electricity grid management. The envisaged smart grids, integrated with blockchain would provoke challenges, which would hinder the maximum utilization of Distribute Energy Resources (DERs). This comprehensive review aims at analyzing the applicability of blockchain technology in Smart Grid 2.0, which would facilitate a seamless decentralization process. Further, the paper elaborates the blockchain-based applications of future smart grid operations and the role of blockchain in each scenario. The paper further provides a concise analysis on the blockchain integration challenges, thereby ensure secure and scalable, decentralized operations of future, autonomous electricity networks.

AB Multisensor fusion-based road segmentation plays an important role in the intelligent driving system since it provides a drivable area. The existing mainstream fusion method is mainly to feature fusion in the image space domain which causes the perspective compression of the road and damages the performance of the distant road. Considering the bird's eye views (BEVs) of the LiDAR remains the space structure in the horizontal plane, this article proposes a bidirectional fusion network (BiFNet) to fuse the image and BEV of the point cloud. The network consists of two modules: 1) the dense space transformation (DST) module, which solves the mutual conversion between the camera image space and BEV space and 2) the context-based feature fusion module, which fuses the different sensors information based on the scenes from corresponding features. This method has achieved competitive results on the KITTI dataset.

AB This work focuses on the fixed-time event-triggered formation control problem for multi-AUV systems with external uncertainties, which can significantly reduce energy consumption and the frequency of the controller updates. At the same time, the convergence speed of the system is improved. To tackle with the problem of explosion of differentiation terms in backstepping method, a command filter is introduced to represent the derivative of virtual variables. Moreover, the distributed control strategy is considered and the lumped uncertainties are tackled with the super-twisting sliding mode method. It is proved that under the proposed event-triggered control strategies the Zeno behavior is avoided. Further, fixed-time formation control method can be finished within a fixed settling time with arbitrary initial states of the multi-AUV. Finally, simulation is presented to show the effectiveness and validity of the fixed-time event-triggered formation protocols for the multi-AUV systems.

AB When a crime is committed, the associated site must be preserved and reviewed by a criminal expert. Some tools are commonly used to ensure the total registration of the crime scene with a minimal human interference. As a novel tool, we propose, here, an intelligent system that remotely recognizes and localizes objects considered as important evidences at a crime scene. Starting from a general viewpoint of the scene, a drone system defines trajectories through which the aerial vehicle performs a detailed search to record evidences. A multi-perspective detection approach is introduced by analyzing several images of the same object in order to improve the reliability of the object recognition. To the best of authors' knowledge, it is the first work on remote autonomous sensing of crime scenes. Experiments demonstrated an accuracy increase of 18.2% points, when using multi-perspective detection.

AB In this paper, we demonstrate analytical modeling and experimental verification of simultaneous ranging and velocimetry measurements in multi-tone continuous wave lidars. To assess the ranging performance of the proposed lidar, a comparative experiment of the multi-tone continuous wave and time-of-flight techniques is performed. The average deviation in ranging is similar to 0.75cm with >90% fitting accuracy, which corresponds to the uncertainty of the time-of-flight measurements due to the detector bandwidth. Simultaneous ranging and velocimetry are performed on a moving target. The velocimetry accuracy of the multi-tone continuous wave lidar is dictated by the frequency resolution of the Doppler shift, which is measured as +/- 0.8cm/s. The results indicate that multi-tone continuous wave lidars can be improved to perform remote sensing for oceanography and atmospheric sciences and for autonomous vehicles without using any amplitude, frequency or phase sweeping.

AB The capability of autonomous fault detection and reconstruction is essential for future manned Mars exploration missions. Considering actuator failures and atmosphere uncertainties, we present a new active fault-tolerant control algorithm for Mars entry by use of neural network and structure adaptive model inversion. First, the online BP neural network is adopted to conduct the fault detection and isolation. Second, based on the structure adaptive model inversion, an adaptive neural network PID controller is developed for Mars entry fault-tolerant control. The normal ND controller will be automatically switched into neural network PID controller when an actuator fault is detected. Therefore, the error between the reference model and the output of the attitude control system would be adjusted to ensure the dynamic property of the entry vehicle. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm developed in this paper is confirmed by computer simulation. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article develops the concept of mobile canvassing as an element in the eventual development of on-call driverless transportation. Mobile canvassing is the use of GPS-enabled smartphones to mediate a two-sided real-time interaction between itinerant actors in a meso-area-that is, the area beyond our ability to actually see another actor but not beyond a distance that can be traversed in a few minutes. The article develops the idea of the smartphone as a "meso-scope" (e.g., a device that gives us an overview of the activities, services, and possibilities that are in our proximate, but also somewhat distant, vicinity). The article examines the need for symmetrical criticality (the development of a critical mass on both sides of the interaction) in this development. Further, the article considers the use of mobile canvassing apps to facilitate the development of autonomous vehicles.

AB The multi-AUV hunting problem is one of the key issues in multi-robot system research. In order to hunt the target efficiently, a new hunting algorithm based on a bio-inspired neural network has been proposed in this paper. Firstly, the AUV's working environment can be represented, based on the biological-inspired neural network model. There is one-to-one correspondence between each neuron in the neural network and the position of the grid map in the underwater environment. The activity values of biological neurons then guide the AUV's sailing path and finally the target is surrounded by AUVs. In addition, a method called negotiation is used to solve the AUV's allocation of hunting points. The simulation results show that the algorithm used in the paper can provide rapid and highly efficient path planning in the unknown environment with obstacles and non-obstacles.

AB This paper addresses the leader-follower synchronization problem of uncertain dynamical multiagent systems with nonlinear dynamics. Distributed adaptive synchronization controllers are proposed based on the state information of neighboring agents. The control design is developed for both undirected and directed communication topologies without requiring the accurate model of each agent. This result is further extended to the output feedback case where a neighborhood observer is proposed based on relative output information of neighboring agents. Then, distributed observer-based synchronization controllers are derived and a parameter-dependent Riccati inequality is employed to prove the stability. This design has a favorable decouple property between the observer and the controller designs for nonlinear multiagent systems. For both cases, the developed controllers guarantee that the state of each agent synchronizes to that of the leader with bounded residual errors. Two illustrative examples validate the efficacy of the proposed methods.

AB Human trajectory prediction is a crucial yet challenging problem, which is of fundamental importance to robotics and autonomous driving vehicles. The core challenge lies in effectively modeling the socially aware spatial interaction and complex temporal dependencies among crowds. However, previous methods usually model spatial and temporal information separately and only use individual features, while ignoring group-level motion characteristics. We propose a novel trajectory prediction framework termed GA-STT, a group aware spatial-temporal transformer network to address these issues. Specifically, we first get the individual representations supervised by group-based annotations. Then, we model the complex spatial-temporal interactions with spatial and temporal transformers separately and fuse spatial-temporal embedding through the cross-attention mechanism. Results on the publicly available ETH/UCY datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 19.4% in average displacement error(ADE) and 16.9% in final displacement error(FDE) and successfully predicts complex spatial-temporal interactions.

AB On-demand air transport is an air-taxi service concept that should ideally use small, autonomous, Vertical Short Takeoff and Landing (VSTOL), "green", battery-powered electric aircraft (eVSTOL). In addition, these aircraft should be competitive with modern helicopters, which are exceptionally reliable machines capable of the same task. For certification and economic purposes, mobile tilting parts should be avoided. The concept introduced in this paper simplifies the aircraft and makes it economical to build, certify and maintain. Four contrarotating propellers with eight electric motors are installed. During cruise, only two of the eight rotors available are not feathered and active. In the first step, a commercial, certified, jet-fueled APU and an available back-up battery are used. A second solution uses a CNG APU and the same back-up battery. Finally, the third solution has a high-density dual battery that is currently not available. A conceptual design is shown in this paper.

AB It is difficult for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to recognize targets similar to the environment in lacking data labels. Moreover, the complex underwater environment and the refraction of light cause the AUV to be unable to extract the complete significant features of the target. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes an underwater distortion target recognition network (UDTRNet) that can enhance image features. Firstly, this paper extracts the significant features of the image by minimizing the info noise contrastive estimation (InfoNCE) loss. Secondly, this paper constructs the dynamic correlation matrix to capture the spatial semantic relationship of the target and uses the matrix to extract spatial semantic features. Finally, this paper fuses the significant features and spatial semantic features of the target and trains the target recognition model through cross-entropy loss.

AB This paper numerically investigates the self-propelled swimming of a flexible filament driven by coupled pitching and plunging motions at the leading edge. The influences of bending rigidity and some actuation parameters (including the phase offset between pitching and plunging, and the amplitudes of pitching and plunging motions) on the swimming performance are explored. It is found that with increasing rigidity, the swimming style gradually transits from the undulatory mode to the oscillatory mode. The plunging-pitching actuation is found to be superior to the plunging-only actuation, in the sense that it prevents the decrease of speed at high rigidity and achieves a higher efficiency across a wide range of rigidity. The comparison of the body kinematics with those of animal swimmers, and the classification of the wake structures are discussed. The results of this study provide some novel insights for the bio-inspired design of autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB The papers in this special section examine smart process manufacturing that is driven by artificial intelligence (AI). As a fundamental industry, process industry mainly involves elementary raw material industries, such as petroleum, chemical, steel, nonferrous metal, and building. However, there are a series of problems existing in process industry such as inaccurate perception of industrial data, low production efficiency, high materials consumption and limitations in safety and environment protection. In order to solve these restriction problems, we must pursue the goal of efficient, green, and smart processes in manufacturing and marketing. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI) has powerful strengths in perception, knowledge representation, learning, reasoning and planning, so that it has been successfully utilized in diverse areas, such as autonomous vehicles and so on. It is promising to have deep and tight integration between artificial intelligence and process industry, to achieve "smart process industry".

AB Celestial navigation has remarkable performance in autonomous navigation without error accumulation. For supplying orientation information to a portable vehicle in real time, a compact polarization sensor with high precision and strong robustness was constructed in this study based on the mechanism of insect polarization-opponent neurons structure. The sensor, composed of polarization-dependent module and microcontroller unit, could supply heading angle for real-time navigation. To enhance the robustness of sensor in a complex environment, a self-adaptive algorithm based on information entropy theory was proposed. The algorithm could eliminate the effect of random obstacles in the sensor field under constantly changing light conditions. The laboratory and outdoor tests indicated that the sensor, with +/- 0.1 deg measured error and +/- 0.4 deg fluctuation under natural obstacle, had potential application prospects in polarization navigation.

AB Continuous authentication in the Mobile Internet of Things should be based as broadly as possible, since a wide range of factors continuously reveal unexpected correlations. Such factors may include captured events (e.g., password, fingerprint, application start and end, network connect, and disconnect), continuous time series (e.g., gesture, typing rate, accelerometer, GPS, ambient sound, light levels, and time-of-day), and derived behavioral features (e.g., user sociability, browser and application menus, application choice). All these factors have been shown to correlate with the actual user identity, often in surprising combinations. More and more sensors are being deployed in autonomous devices, smart environments and vehicles, enabling even further behavioral and contextual data to be analyzed. The pegs of this continuous authentication "big tent" are moving out further than ever before, bringing it closer to practical uses in our everyday lives.

ID NAVIGATION
AB Continuous accurate positioning is a key element for the deployment of many advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle navigation. To achieve the necessary performance, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) must be combined with other technologies. A common onboard sensor-set that allows keeping the cost low, features the GNSS unit, odometry, and inertial sensors, such as a gyro. Odometry and inertial sensors compensate for GNSS flaws in many situations and, in normal conditions, their errors can be easily characterized, thus making the whole solution not only more accurate but also with more integrity. However, odometers do not behave properly when friction conditions make the tires slide. If not properly considered, the positioning perception will not be sound. This article introduces a hybridization approach that takes into consideration the sliding situations by means of a multiple model particle filter (MMPF). Tests with real datasets show the goodness of the proposal.

AB The Mediterranean coastal seafloor is littered with man-made objects and materials, including a variety of ammunition in many areas. In addition, sediments in ports, harbors and marinas are contaminated with elevated concentrations of chemicals used as biocides in antifouling paints.
   In order to reach a satisfactory level of environmental security of the coastal sea areas, fast neutron activation analysis with detection of associated alpha particles and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence, both in laboratory and inside an autonomous underwater vehicle for in-situ measurements, has been used for the characterization of the objects on the seafloor.
   Measurements have shown that gamma ray spectra are able to distinguish threat material from the surrounding material. Analysis of more than 700 coastal sea sediment samples has resulted in concentration distribution maps indicating the locations of "hot spots", which might interfere with threat material identification.

AB The design and performance of two prototype microrobots are presented in this paper. The microrobots were implemented by surface micromachining arrays of 270 mu m long, polycrystalline silicon legs across the surface of a silicon chip. The method of motion of the microrobots is designed to mimic the way six-legged insects walk. one microrobot leg design has two degrees-of-freedom motion, and the other leg design has one degree-of-freedom motion. Both microrobot designs an able to transport objects across their bellies while lying on their backs. The microrobot with one degree-of-freedom motion is able to support several times its own weight, making available the option to carry an autonomous power supply (such as a solar cell), microprocessor. control circuitry, test equipment, and sensing or surveillance devices. Results of the self-assembly of the microrobot legs using the surface tension of molten indium are also presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, the research community has become increasingly interested in automated negotiation. It has been used in real-world systems such as autonomous vehicle transportation systems, smart grids, and e-commerce. Considering the broad range of applications, automated negotiation is of great use and interest to engineers, developers, and industry-focused researchers. Therefore, some researchers have developed platforms for automated negotiation. However, these systems do not provide complete control over the development of various protocols or analytic tools. This paper introduces NegoSim, a new negotiation simulator that introduces a new negotiation framework called EUBOA, though it also works on the well-known BOA framework. NegoSim is completely modular, with different APIs allowing users full control over developing and modifying automated negotiation agents, different assessments, protocols, and utility spaces, as well as the ability to create or modify different GUIs. NegoSim also includes predefined agents, protocols, utility space, and analytic tools, making it an ideal platform for researchers.

AB To consider the heterogeneity of sensor nodes (SNs) and further protect the SNs with low residual energy, in this letter, we propose an energy-saving UAV-assisted data collection framework for a heterogeneous wireless sensor network (WSN), where the working mode of each SN is dynamically determined by its residual energy and a certain energy threshold. Our aim is to minimize the WSN's energy consumption by jointly optimizing the energy threshold, SNs' working modes and cluster head (CH) selection, while ensuring successful data transmission and satisfying UAV trajectory length constraint. To address it, we propose a one-dimensional search method to find the optimal energy threshold, and leverage a sequential rank-one constraint relaxation algorithm to select the CHs. Numerical results justify that the performance of our proposed approach is more energy-saving than the existing benchmarks.

AB Hydrodynamic performance plays an important role on energy consuming and safety for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The hydrodynamics of the whole process of AUV free running pushed by a rotating propeller was investigated with physics-based simulations by using multi-block hybrid dynamic grids method, URANS, coupled to 6DOF and UDFs. The AUV had cruised for approximately 14.1 s and 7.105 m from stationary to a constant velocity at 300RPM. The simulation results included an acceleration state and a steady state. In the acceleration state, the thrust decreased quickly and had four periodic cycles in one propeller revolution. The thrust amplitude varied as the velocity increased. The computed velocity history was compared to tests and agreed well. In the steady state, the propulsion factors were compared with that in the literature and agreed well. The flow field variations of pressure and velocity were investigated temporally and spatially for the two states.

AB In recent years, harbour security protection has received extensive attention. For the moving invasion target interception problem in the underwater environment with ocean current, a new interception algorithm with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUV) called prediction planning interception (PPI) method is proposed in this paper. First, the interception position is determined quickly and simply through the movement tracking of target, and then the intercept path of each AUV in the environment is planned by the artificial potential field method. When the target is intercepted by any AUV, it is considered a successful interception. The AUV can rapidly intercept the moving target whose trajectory is dynamically changing along relatively short path in the changeable and complicated underwater environment by PPI method. The simulation results show that the interception efficiency of the prediction planning interception method is greatly improved compared with the traditional tracking interception method under different conditions.

AB This work addresses the problem of experimentally reproducing the orbital relative motion on a planar floating spacecraft simulator testbed. Floating spacecraft simulators are characterized by double-integrator dynamics on their three degrees of freedom. In this paper, the Clohessy-Wiltshire planar dynamics is scaled down, and it is emulated using an autonomous floating vehicle actuated using compressed-air thrusters. The dynamics scaling criteria are determined through the use of the Pi theorem; subsequently, the problem of accurate actuation of the equivalent transport acceleration and Coriolis acceleration is solved. Three different thrust modulation strategies (namely, pulse-width modulation, delta sigma modulation, and hybrid pulse-width delta sigma modulation) have been used to achieve an accurate conversion of the requested continuous-thrust time histories into sequences of actuated fixed-thrust pulses. The performances of the resulting system are evaluated through a set of simulations by comparing the nominal spacecraft trajectories with the correspondent equivalent floating simulator trajectories. Finally, a set of experimental results is presented.

AB This paper presents a simple approach for the acquisition and representation of spatial knowledge needed for controlling a semiautonomous wheelchair. Simplicity is required in the domain of rehabilitation robotics because typical users of assistive technology are persons with severe impairments who are not technical experts. The approach proposed is a combination of carrying out so-called basic behaviors and the analysis of the wheelchair's trade of motion when performing these behaviors. As a result, autonomous navigation in the user's apartment or place of work can be learned by the wheelchair by teaching single routes between potential target locations.
   This paper focuses on the analysis of the motion tracks recorded by the vehicle's dead reckoning system. As a means for unveiling the structure of the environment while the system is moving, an incremental generalization is applied to the motion tracks. In addition, it is discussed how two of such generalized motion tracks are matched to perform a one-dimensional self-localization along the route that is followed.

AB The antidisturbance control scheme for the dynamically positioned ships with ocean environmental disturbances and actuator saturation was presented. The ocean environmental disturbances comprises slowly varying disturbances and additional stochastic disturbances. The stochastic disturbance observer was constructed to online estimate the slowly varying disturbances. Based on estimation, a stochastic antidisturbance controller was proposed by combining the disturbance observer-based control with the stochastic control, where the actuator saturation was dealt with by the polytopic bounding technique. Furthermore, the optimal control allocation method was introduced to distribute control commands into each actuator. Finally, the ship's position and heading are maintained at the desired values and all signals of the closed-loop system are asymptotically mean-square bounded. And comparative simulation under different conditions demonstrates the validity and the superiority of the proposed control scheme.

TI Evaluation of Topology Description Models in Road Network Formats

DT Article
DE road network; topology analysis; autonomous vehicle simulation
AB Topology is a particular feature of road networks. Topology refers to properties, such as the connection of roads, but not only through their axes or reference lines, but also at the level of lanes. The map topology of road networks does not currently have procedures that can be expressed in mathematical formulas (or only to a minimal extent), but can only be implemented by algorithms. Our research, therefore, aimed at observing such topological regularities and then developing a method of investigation, by constructing rules and additional algorithms. To test this work, we used synthetic and real data, focusing on the case of map content embodied in four formats. In this paper, we present the test methods for the data models, the results of our test runs and finally, we point out that topological checks are extensively justified to determine the quality of the produced map. In the future we plan to develop an automatic correction mechanism based on this.

AB Machine vision systems (MVSs) are an important component of intelligent systems, such as autonomous vehicles and robots. However, with the continuous increase in data and new application scenarios, new requirements are put forward for the next generation of MVS. There is an urgent need to find new material systems to complement the existing semiconductor technology based on thin-film materials, and new architectures must be explored to improve efficiency. Because of their unique physical properties, two-dimensional (2D) materials have received extensive attention for use in MVSs, especially in biomimetic ones: the human visual system, which can process complex visual information with low power consumption, provides a model for next-generation MVSs. This review paper summarizes the progress and challenges of applying 2D material photodetectors in sense-memory-computational integration and biomimetic image sensors for machine vision.

AB Industrial companies focus on efficiency and cost reduction, which is very closely related to production process safety and secured environments enabling production with reduced risks and minimized cost on machines maintenance. Legacy systems are being replaced with new systems built into distributed production environments and equipped with machine learning algorithms that help to make this change more effective and efficient. A distributed control system consists of several subsystems distributed across areas and sites requiring application interfaces built across a control network. Data acquisition and data processing are challenging processes. This contribution aims to present an approach for the data collection based on features standardized in industry and for data classification processed with an applied machine learning algorithm for distinguishing exceptions in a dataset. Files with classified exceptions can be used to train prediction models to make forecasts in a large amount of data.

AB This letter presents a self-improving lifelong learning framework for a mobile robot navigating in different environments. Classical static navigation methods require environment-specific in-situ system adjustment, e.g., from human experts, or may repeat their mistakes regardless of how many times they have navigated in the same environment. Having the potential to improve with experience, learning-based navigation is highly dependent on access to training resources, e.g., sufficient memory and fast computation, and is prone to forgetting previously learned capability, especially when facing different environments. In this work, we propose Lifelong Learning for Navigation (LLfN) which (1) improves a mobile robot's navigation behavior purely based on its own experience, and (2) retains the robot's capability to navigate in previous environments after learning in new ones. LLfN is implemented and tested entirely onboard a physical robot with a limited memory and computation budget.

AB Thwaites Glacier is the most rapidly changing outlet of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and adds large uncertainty to 21st century sea-level rise predictions. Here, we present the first direct observations of ocean temperature, salinity, and oxygen beneath Thwaites Ice Shelf front, collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle. On the basis of these data, pathways and modification of water flowing into the cavity are identified. Deep water underneath the central ice shelf derives from a previously underestimated eastern branch of warm water entering the cavity from Pine Island Bay. Inflow of warm and outflow of melt-enriched waters are identified in two seafloor troughs to the north. Spatial property gradients highlight a previously unknown convergence zone in one trough, where different water masses meet and mix. Our observations show warm water impinging from all sides on pinning points critical to ice-shelf stability, a scenario that may lead to unpinning and retreat.

ID SUCCESS FACTORS; INDUSTRY
AB Technologically advanced countries have recently highlighted the responsible research and innovation (RRI) approach, which aims to increase the positive effects of innovations by intervening in the early stages of technological development. It is necessary to prepare for unexpected impacts that might occur as emerging technologies continue to develop. Korea has a newly industrialized economy; therefore, it is important to examine potential RRI implementation in Korea, as RRI remains a controversial topic. Korea also lacks policy experience regarding key RRI elements, which may present barriers to future RRI implementation. This study attempts to advance RRI in Korea by using the analytical hierarchy process approach to identify and prioritize the expected RRI barriers to autonomous vehicles and biotechnology. The results indicate that economic and policy/politics barriers are the most important. Specifically, the increased innovation costs and lack of economic incentives are the most significant barriers facing RRI.

AB This paper presents a novel autonomous environmental monitoring methodology based on collaboration and collective decision-making among robotic agents in a heterogeneous swarm developed within the project subCULTron, tested in a realistic marine environment. The swarm serves as an underwater mobile sensor network for exploration and monitoring of large areas. Different robotic units enable outlier and fault detection, verification of measurements and recognition of environmental anomalies, and relocation of the swarm throughout the environment. The motion capabilities of the robots and the reconfigurability of the swarm are exploited to collect data and verify suspected anomalies, or detect potential sensor faults among the swarm agents. The proposed methodology was tested in an experimental setup in the field in two marine testbeds: the Lagoon of Venice, Italy, and Biograd an Moru, Croatia. Achieved experimental results described in this paper validate and show the potential of the proposed approach.

AB The accuracy of the ML model is essential for the further development of AI-enabled CAVs. With the increasing complexity of on-board sensor systems, the large amount of raw data available for learning can however cause big communication burdens and data security issues. To alleviate the communication cost yet improve the accuracy of machine learning with preserved data privacy is an important issue to address in CAVs. In this article, we survey the existing literature toward efficient and secured learning in a dynamic wireless environment. In particular, a BCL framework for AI-enabled CAVs is presented. The framework enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally and upload to blockchain network to overall utilize the "collective intelligence" of CAVs while avoiding large amounts of data transmission. Blockchain is then applied to protect the distributed learned models. We evaluate the performance of the presented framework by simulations and discuss a range of open research issues that need to be addressed in the future.

AB Traffic congestion is a major source of delays in modern road networks. Motivated by this, we propose two distributed algorithms to reduce delays: a dynamic lane reversal algorithm and a rerouting algorithm. When there is a density imbalance on a road, time can be saved by reallocating lanes from the less dense side to the more dense side, which motivates dynamic lane reversal. When a road has greater density than nearby roads, time can be saved by redirecting flow into the least congested roads, this motivates dynamic rerouting. Given a communication system between infrastructure and vehicles on the road, the local state of the network can be approximated and utilised by the algorithms to minimise travel time. In order to provide a better fundamental understanding of the system dynamics, we analyse equilibrium conditions for the system and prove convergence of the lane reversal algorithm to a critical point. Overall performance is also examined in simulation.

AB Due to the unpleasant and unpredictable underwater environment, designing an energy-efficient routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) demands more accuracy and extra computations. In the proposed scheme, we introduce a mobile sink (MS), i.e., an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and also courier nodes (CNs), to minimize the energy consumption of nodes. MS and CNs stop at specific stops for data gathering; later on, CNs forward the received data to the MS for further transmission. By the mobility of CNs and MS, the overall energy consumption of nodes is minimized. We perform simulations to investigate the performance of the proposed scheme and compare it to preexisting techniques. Simulation results are compared in terms of network lifetime, throughput, path loss, transmission loss and packet drop ratio. The results show that the proposed technique performs better in terms of network lifetime, throughput, path loss and scalability.

AB Underwater wireless communications can enable many scientific, environmental, commercial, safety, and military applications. Wireless signal transmission is also crucial to remotely control instruments in ocean observatories and to enable coordination of swarms of autonomous underwater vehicles and robots, which will play the role of mobile nodes in future ocean observation networks by virtue of their flexibility and reconfigurability. To make underwater applications viable, efficient communication protocols among underwater devices, which are based on acoustic wireless technology for distances over one hundred meters, must be enabled because of the high attenuation and scattering that affect radio and optical waves, respectively. The unique characteristics of an underwater acoustic channel such as very limited and distance-dependent bandwidth, high propagation delays, and time-varying multipath and fading - require new, efficient and reliable communication protocols to network multiple devices, either static or mobile, potentially over multiple hops. In this article, we provide an overview of recent medium access control, routing, transport, and crosslayer networking protocols.

AB Competitive pressures dictate that the mining industry moves to larger mobile underground haulage equipment with more advanced equipment mechanization, higher levels of autonomous operation of machines, and longer periods between access by maintenance personnel. Since such new machines will of necessity be more complex than existing designs, machine reliability has become a key issue in progressing toward advanced mobile underground haulage equipment. Reliability and maintainability models of such equipment are practically non-existent in the literature. This paper addresses the issue of reliability and maintainability of mobile underground haulage equipment on two fronts: reliability modelling to enhance decision making for maintenance planning; and reliability simulation to enable evaluation of more rigorous production planning scenarios. A case study from a gold mine in the Chilean Andes is presented, for which reliability models of mobile underground haulage equipment, specifically load-haul-dump vehicles and underground haul trucks, are developed, and a reliability-based simulation implemented.

AB Action recognition has shown a broad prospect for application in human-computer interaction and autonomous vehicles. According to skeleton data being lightweight and robust to environmental disturbance, skeleton-based methods are increasingly used in action recognition. Existing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have limitations such as Global Average Pooling (GAP) causing information oversmoothing, attention mechanism increasing computational complexity, and fixed spatial configuration partition strategy limiting flexibility. Our model overcomes these limitations by incorporating Temporal Covariance Pooling (TCP) for better feature utilization, Sample-Shared attention for weight sharing, and a Comprehensive Receptive Field strategy for optimal joint connections. Experiments show that the recognition accuracy of our model outperforms baseline 2s-AGCN by 1.1 % and 0.7 % under X-Sub and X-View for NTU RGB + D dataset, 1.8 % and 1.9 % in X-Sub and X-Set for NTU RGB + D 120 dataset, and 1.6 % on Kinetics-Skeleton dataset.

AB This paper proposes a novel Neural Network Adaptive Observer (NNAO) for Nonlinear Systems with Partially and Completely Unknown Dynamics (NSPCUD), subject to variable sampled and delayed output. The method involves designing a neural network observer for partially unknown nonlinear systems with sampled and delayed outputs, using a radial basis function (RBF) neural network to approximate the system's unknown part. A new weight update algorithm is proposed, along with a closed-loop output predictor for coping with variable samples, and a closed-loop integral compensation to handle variable delay. This approach is then extended to cover completely unknown systems as well. Numerical simulations and comparisons between the proposed method and previous methods on autonomous ground vehicle models were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed NNAO.

AB Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) (also referred to as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs), or drones) operations, focused on natural hazards, have experienced rapid expansion in the last decade. UAS uses before, during, and after natural hazard events, provide value for emergency management operations (e.g. Search-and-Rescue (SAR)), and post-event analytics. The Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (DHSES) manages UAS programs for public safety and emergency response activities in New York State. They also have the first FEMA-approved, locally adopted, web-based, interactive Hazard Mitigation Plans (HMPs). With recent advances in communication technologies (e.g. 5G), opportunities are emerging to establish a stewardship role to maximize regionwide UAS operations, including preparing for catastrophic natural hazards (e.g. earthquakes, hurricanes), leveraging existing HMPs, and incorporating new machine-learning techniques to use swarming networks before, during, and after a natural hazard event. A variety of stewardship approaches are discussed.

AB A wireless sensor network assisted by multiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising solution for harvesting data and monitoring the circumstance in various applications. However, the complicated path planning problem of each UAV is still problematic. In this paper, we propose an optimal operation strategy based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to tackle these hurdles. Various parameters such as the number of deployed UAVs, charging start capacity, and charging complete capacity define a multi-UAV system. This approach is applicable without a time-consuming and costly policy control. We also describe how to balance multiple objectives, such as data harvesting, charging, and collision avoidance, using transfer learning. Finally, learning a policy control that generalizes multiple scenario parameters allows us to analyze the performance of individual parameters in a specific scenario, which helps find the macro-level optimal parameter within a particular scenario.

AB Nanorobots hold great promise for integrated drug delivery systems that are responsive to molecular triggers. Herein, we successfully developed an automatic smart bionanorobot that has transport capability and recognizes and removes zinc ions from poisoned cells based on nanoscale polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane molecules. This intelligent bionanorobot can easily move inside and outside the cell and find zinc ions owing to its highly selective recognition to zinc ions and high cell permeability, especially the well-combined high penetration and strong binding energy. More importantly, it was also found that this intelligent bionanorobot can restore round HeLa cells to a normal fusiform cell morphology following high-concentration zinc treatment and does not interfere with cell proliferation and division. It was also shown by in vivo experiments that the bionanorobot can inhibit persistent enlargement of the liver caused by zinc ion poisoning.

AB Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems are finding their way into an increasing number of applications including autonomous vehicles. Image sensors based on single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays have demonstrated great promise for LIDAR, typically using flood illumination or raster-scanning of a small spot. Holographic illumination, based on phase-only liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) spatial light modulators, has been successfully applied to display systems such as automotive head up displays (HUDs). It holds great promise as the method of illumination for a LIDAR system. We present a novel solid-state LIDAR architecture using holographic projection and single-photon detection. We report a simple experiment that demonstrates proof of concept. The results of the experiment show that the novel architecture can improve the depth accuracy of 3D imaging compared to conventional LIDAR systems. We also indicate several key performance advantages of the novel architecture that will increase as the system scales to higher performance.

AB Based on our previous contributions about UAV target tracking and recognition, this paper continues to do the synthesis analysis for the ellipsoidal method for above practical problem. Given a nonlinear system or linear system, corresponding to the motion equation for the considered target, the UAV target tracking and recognition is to identify the unknown but bounded noise, then ellipsoidal method is proposed to achieve this goal. The main step for ellipsoidal method is to compute one intersection operation between one ellipsoid and a strip. Through our own mathematical derivations, this intersection part is also an ellipsoid. The center of the final ellipsoid is deemed as the accurate state estimation from the generated ellipsoidal sequences. To alleviate the deficiency of our previous contributions, synthesis analysis for ellipsoidal method is also derived to complete the efficiency. Finally, one simulation example confirms our ellipsoidal method for UAV target tracking and recognition.

AB Coastal retention zones occur in the lee of headlands and within bays of coastal upwelling environments. Because retention zones can concentrate and retain communities of coastal planktonic organisms that would otherwise be advected offshore by wind-driven transport, they are ecologically significant. While the consequences of these zones for plankton retention and recruitment have been examined, the degree to which they remain retentive under variable upwelling intensity is less well understood. This aspect of coastal plankton ecology was studied during 2012 in the retentive upwelling shadow of northern Monterey Bay, California. Environmental and biological data show that exceptionally strong upwelling can greatly diminish resident plankton populations in the upwelling shadow. Results indicate that wind-driven circulation, essential to primary productivity and the formation of retention zones, can surpass levels that allow accumulation and retention of plankton communities.

The suitable handling equipment listed in the short-listwereselected by the authors of the paper based on the entry requirements and conditions of the enterprise and trends in material/final product handling towards increasing automation, enhancing productivity and maximizing safety. The Analytic Hierarchy Process method was used to support decision making on the appropriate handling equipment and specific calculations were carried out in the Expert Choice program. The Analytic Hierarchy Process as a tool of exact decision-making methods increases the objectivity of decision in general as well as the quality of suitable handling equipment selection in a particular industrial enterprise. One of the conditions of the enterprise for the equipment selection was the use of Intelligent/Smart solutions in the process of finished goods handling from the manufacturing area to warehouse.

AB In this paper we present a reliable method to verify the existence of loops along the uncertain trajectory of a robot, based on proprioceptive measurements only, within a bounded-error context. The loop closure detection is one of the key points in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods, especially in homogeneous environments with difficult scenes recognitions. The proposed approach is generic and could be coupled with conventional SLAM algorithms to reliably reduce their computing burden, thus improving the localization and mapping processes in the most challenging environments such as unexplored underwater extents. To prove that a robot performed a loop whatever the uncertainties in its evolution, we employ the notion of topological degree that originates in the field of differential topology. We show that a verification tool based on the topological degree is an optimal method for proving robot loops. This is demonstrated both on datasets from real missions involving autonomous underwater vehicles and by a mathematical discussion.

AB The Fourth Industrial Revolution incorporates the digital revolution into the physical world, creating a new direction in a number of fields, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, robotics, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things. The artificial intelligence field has encountered a turning point mainly due to advancements in machine learning, which allows machines to learn, improve, and perform a specific task through data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning can be utilized with machining processes to improve product quality levels and productivity rates, to monitor the health of systems, and to optimize design and process parameters. This is known as smart machining, referring to a new machining paradigm in which machine tools are fully connected through a cyber-physical system. This paper reviews and summarizes machining processes using machine learning algorithms and suggests a perspective on the machining industry.

AB A new control method for an electromagnetic unmanned robot applied to automotive testing (URAT) and based on improved Smith predictor compensator, and considering a time delay, is proposed. The mechanical system structure and the control system structure are presented. The electromagnetic URAT adopts pulse width modulation (PWM) control, while the displacement and the current doubles as a closed-loop control strategy. The coordinated control method of multiple manipulators for the electromagnetic URAT, e.g., a skilled human driver with intelligent decision-making ability is provided, and the improved Smith predictor compensator controller for the electromagnetic URAT considering a time delay is designed. Experiments are conducted using a Ford FOCUS automobile. Comparisons between the PID control method and the proposed method are conducted. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve the accurate tracking of the target vehicle's speed and reduce the mileage derivation of autonomous driving, which meets the requirements of national test standards.

AB This work presents the development of a robotic wheelchair that can be commanded by users in a supervised way or by a fully automatic unsupervised navigation system. It provides flexibility to choose different modalities to command the wheelchair, in addition to be suitable for people with different levels of disabilities. Users can command the wheelchair based on their eye blinks, eye movements, head movements, by sip-and-puff and through brain signals. The wheelchair can also operate like an auto-guided vehicle, following metallic tapes, or in an autonomous way. The system is provided with an easy to use and flexible graphical user interface onboard a personal digital assistant, which is used to allow users to choose commands to be sent to the robotic wheelchair. Several experiments were carried out with people with disabilities, and the results validate the developed system as an assistive tool for people with distinct levels of disability.

TI Scan registration for autonomous mining vehicles using 3D-NDT
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Scan registration is an essential subtask when building maps based on range finder data from mobile robots. The problem is to deduce how the robot has moved between consecutive scans, based on the shape of overlapping portions of the scans. This paper presents a new algorithm for registration of 3D data. The algorithm is a generalization and improvement of the normal distributions transform (NDT) for 2D data developed by Biber and Strasser, which allows for accurate registration using a memory-efficient representation of the scan surface. A detailed quantitative and qualitative comparison of the new algorithm with the 3D version of the popular ICP (iterative closest point) algorithm is presented. Results with actual mine data, some of which were collected with a new prototype 3D laser scanner, show that the presented algorithm is faster and slightly more reliable than the standard ICP algorithm for 3D registration, while using a more memory-efficient scan surface representation.

AB Obstacle detection is an essential capability for the safe guidance of autonomous vehicles, especially in urban environments. This paper presents an efficient method to integrate spatial and temporal constraints for detecting and tracking obstacles in urban environments. In order to enhance the reliability of the obstacle detection task, we do not consider the urban roads as rigid planes, but as quasi-planes, whose normal vectors have orientation constraints. Under this flexible road model, we propose a fast, robust stereovision based obstacle detection method. A watershed transformation is employed for obstacle segmentation in dense traffic conditions, even with partial occlusions, in urban environments. Finally a UKF (Unscented Kalman filter) is applied to estimate the obstacles parameters under a nonlinear observation model. To avoid the difficulty of the computation in metric space, the whole detection process is performed in the disparity image. Various experimental results are presented, showing the advantages of this method.

ID MAGNETIC-FIELD DISTRIBUTION; DC MOTORS
AB The design, analysis and performance of a brushless PM motor that is integrated in the structure of a miniature 50 mm diameter propeller thruster is considered; the stator is fitted in the faired thin duct that surrounds the propeller to improve its efficiency and protect it from damage, and the rotor is fitted to the rim of the propeller. Such a thruster is intended for use on small autonomous underwater vehicles that are being developed for defence, scientific and industry applications. Fitting a relatively large airgap motor with protective coating within the volume of a thin propeller duct (< 10 mm thick) imposes extreme constraints on the dimensions of the machine, including a very thin rotor and stator radial thickness and relatively short axial length in addition to the relatively large airgap, which raises theoretical and practical issues that have not been considered in the literature. The design of such a machine is discussed, a demonstrator device is described and FEA and experimental results are reported.

AB This paper reports on the development of a multi-purpose active visual sensor system for real-world application. The Cable-Drive Active-Vision Robot (CeDAR) has been designed for use on a diverse range of platforms, to perform a diverse range of tasks. The novel, biologically inspired design has evolved from a systems based approach. The mechanism is compact and light-weight, and is capable of motions that exceed human visual performance and earlier mechanical designs. The control system complements the mechanical design to implement the basic visual behaviours of fixation, smooth pursuit and saccade, with stability during high speed motions, high precision and repeatability. Real-time vision processing algorithms have been developed that process stereo colour images at 30 Hz, resulting in a suite of basic visual competencies. We have developed a scheme to fuse the results of the visual algorithms into robust task-oriented behaviours by adopting a statistical frame-work. CeDAR has been successfully used for experiments in autonomous vehicle guidance, object tracking, and visual sensing for mobile robot experiments.

TI AUVs and scientific diving: A looming conflict?
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are swimming robots whose use promises to revolutionize our scientific understanding of aquatic ecosystems. AUVs sample the environment at spatial and temporal scales that would be prohibitively expensive using conventional technology. Other tasks well-suited for AUVs include automated gathering of environmental data used for monitoring ecosystem health and marine food resources, facilitating search and recovery operations and drug traffic inter diction, and increasing national security. However, increasing operations of greater numbers and kinds of AUVs in situations where scientific diving occurs pose a potential hazard that needs to be addressed. We review scenarios where AUV/diver conflicts are likely to occur, make estimates of the scope of the problem, and offer some initial thoughts concerning threat mitigation. Ultimately, a 'consensus standard' will be needed with contributions from the emerging AW robotics industry, AW academic R&D centers, military users, the commercial, scientific, and recreational diving community, and civilian agencies concerned with maritime commerce, marine science, and human safety.

AB Fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) consist of the temporary gathering of a large number of fishes at a specific location to spawn. Monitoring of FSA is typically conducted by divers, but surveys are often restricted to a limited area and dependent upon sea conditions, thus our knowledge of FSA dynamics is extremely limited. Fisheries independent research strives for new technology that can help remotely and unobtrusively quantify fish biomass and abundance. Since some fish species, such as groupers, produce sounds during reproductive behaviors, Eulerian passive acoustic monitoring provides information when divers cannot access the FSA site. Fish sounds provide an innovative approach to assess fish presence and potentially their numbers during reproductive events. However, this technology is limited by the sound propagation range, hence the distance between the fish emitting sounds and the hydrophone location. As such, this Eulerian monitoring approach implicitly creates a knowledge gap about what happens beyond the range of the recorders. Furthermore, the large datasets make the detection process by human ears and eyes very tedious and inconsistent. This paper reports on two innovative approaches to overcome these limitations. To facilitate fish call detections, we have developed an algorithm based on machine learning and voice recognition methods to identify and classify the sounds known to be produced by certain species during FSA. This algorithm currently operates on a SV3 Liquid Robotics wave glider, an autonomous surface vehicle which has been fitted to accommodate a passive acoustic listening device and can cover large areas under a wide range of sea conditions. Fish sounds detections, classification results, and locations along with environmental data are transmitted in real-time enabling verification of the sites with high detections by divers or other in situ methods. Recent surveys in the US Virgin Islands with the SV3 Wave Glider are revealing for the first time the spatial and temporal distribution of fish calls surrounding known FSA sites. These findings are critical to understanding the dynamics of fish populations because calling fish were detected several kilometers away from the known FSAs. These courtship associated sounds from surrounding areas suggest that other FSAs may exist in the region.

DT Article
DE Deception attack; Replay attack; Inductive conformal anomaly detection;
   Cyber-physical systems
AB Detection of deception attacks is pivotal to ensure the safe and reliable operation of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Detection of such attacks needs to consider time-series sequences and is very challenging especially for autonomous vehicles that rely on high-dimensional observations from camera sensors. The paper presents an approach to detect deception attacks in real-time utilizing sensor observations, with a special focus on high-dimensional observations. The approach is based on inductive conformal anomaly detection (ICAD) and utilizes a novel generative model which consists of a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is used to learn both spatial and temporal features of the normal dynamic behavior of the system. The model can be used to predict the observations for multiple time steps, and the predictions are then compared with actual observations to efficiently quantify the nonconformity of a sequence under attack relative to the expected normal behavior, thereby enabling real-time detection of attacks using high-dimensional sequential data. We evaluate the approach empirically using two simulation case studies of an advanced emergency braking system and an autonomous car racing example, as well as a real-world secure water treatment dataset. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms other detection methods, and in most experiments, both false positive and false negative rates are less than 10%. Furthermore, execution times measured on both powerful cloud machines and embedded devices are relatively short, thereby enabling real-time detection.

ID PATH PLANNING ALGORITHM; DISINFECTION
AB In this article, we propose the visual application of a navigation framework for a wheeled robot to disinfect surfaces. Since dynamic environments are complicated, advanced sensors are integrated into the hardware platform to enhance the navigation task. The 2D lidar UTM-30LX from Hokuyo attached to the front of the robot can cover a wide scanning area. To provide better results in laser scan matching, an inertial measurement unit was integrated into the robot's body. The output of this combination feeds into a global costmap for monitoring and navigation. Additionally, incremental encoders that obtain high-resolution position data are connected to the rear wheels. The role of the positioning sensor is to identify the existing location of the robot in a local costmap. To detect the appearance of a human, a Kinect digital camera is fixed to the top of the robot. All feedback signals are combined in the host computer to navigate the autonomous robot. For disinfection missions, the robot must carry several ultraviolet lamps to autonomously patrol in unknown environments. To visualize the robot's effectiveness, our approach was validated using both a virtual simulation and an experimental test. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (i) a structure for ultraviolet-based hardware was first established; (ii) the theoretical computations for the robot's localization in the 3D workspace will play a fundamental role in further developments; and (iii) data fusion from advanced sensing devices was integrated to enable navigation in uncertain environments.

TI Adversarial attacks on YOLACT instance segmentation

DE Adversarial attack; Instance segmentation; White-box attack; Deep

AB Adversarial attacks have stimulated research interests in the field of deep learning security. In terms of autonomous driving technology, instance segmentation can help autonomous vehicles identify a drivable area in a driving environment and a traffic accident will happen once instance segmentation is attacked by adversarial examples. However, only few studies have been done on adversarial attacks about instance segmentation. It would be more meaningful and more practical to research adversarial attacks against instance segmentation. In this paper, we propose the improved Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to produce adversarial examples on the total loss of You Only Look At CoefficienT (YOLACT) instance segmentation. Firstly, we design the loss function and calculate the adversarial gradient. Then we propose the improved PGD. Finally, we obtain adversarial examples of YOLACT instance segmentation. Our attack method is efficient and powerful in both white-box and black-box attack settings, and is applicable in a variety of neural network architectures. On COCO 2017, under white-box attacks, our method achieves 1.14% box mean average precision (mAP) and 1.50% mask mAP on YOLACT with ResNet101 backbone. We also compare the similarity between clean images and adversarial examples among three different backbones and compare the operation time among three different backbones. We also find that box regression loss, classification loss and mask loss are also effective separately for generating adversarial examples. Our research will provide inspiration for further efforts in efficient and effective defense methods on instance segmentation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LA English
DT Article
DE Vertical profiling floats; Autonomous marine vehicle; Marine robot;
   Predictive control; Search
AB A methodology is described for control of vertically profiling floats that uses an imperfect predictive model of ocean currents. In this approach, the floats have control only over their depth. This control authority is combined with an imperfect model of ocean currents to attempt to force the floats to maintain position. First, the impact of model accuracy on the ability to station keep (e.g. maintain X-Y position) using simulated planning and nature (ground-truth in simulation) models is studied. In this study, the impact of batch versus continuous planning is examined. In batch planning the float depth plan is derived for an extended period of time and then executed open loop. In continuous planning the depth plan is updated with the actual position and the remainder of the plan re-planned based on the new information. In these simulation results are shown that (a) active control can significantly improve station keeping with even an imperfect predictive model and (b) continuous planning can mitigate the impact of model inaccuracy. Second, the effect of using heuristic path completion estimators in search are studied. In general, using a more conservative estimator increases search quality but commensurately increases the amount of search and therefore computation time. Third are presented results from an April 2015 deployment in the Pacific Ocean that show that even with an imperfect model of ocean currents, model-based control can enhance float control performance.

AB Digital documentation of large interiors of historical buildings is an exhausting task as most of the areas of interest are beyond typical human reach. We advocate the use of fully autonomous teams of cooperating multirotor UAVs to speed up the documentation process by several orders of magnitude while allowing for a repeatable, accurate, and condition-independent solution capable of precise, collision-free operation at great heights. In particular, we present a universal autonomy for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) cooperating aerially within a team while documenting the interiors of historical buildings for the purposes of restoration planning and documentation works as well as for assessing the structural state of aging historical sites. We show that the proposed approach of active multirobot cooperation enables performing documentation tasks requiring dynamic scene illumination in large-scale real-world scenarios, a process previously applicable only manually in areas easily accessible by humans.

AB This work investigates the phase gain of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) covert communication over complex-valued additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. The transmitter Alice intends to transmit covert messages to the legitimate receiver Bob via reflecting the broadcast signals from a radio frequency (RF) source, while rendering the adversary Willie's detector arbitrarily close to ineffective. Our analyses show that, compared to the covert capacity for classical AWGN channels, we can achieve a covertness gain of value 2 by leveraging Willie's uncertainty of phase angles. This covertness gain is achieved when the number of possible phase angle pairs N = 2. More interestingly, our results show that the covertness gain will not further increase with N as long as N = 2, even if it approaches infinity.

ID PREDICTION
AB Due to the complexity of the marine environment, underwater target search and interception is one of the biggest problems faced by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). At present, there is quite a lot of research in terms of the two-dimensional environment. This paper proposes an improved rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm to solve the problem of target search and interception in an unknown three-dimensional (3D) environment. The RRT algorithm is combined with rolling planning and node screening to realize path planning in an unknown environment, and then the improved RRT algorithm is applied to the search and interception process in a 3D environment. Combined with the search decision function and the three-point numerical differential prediction method, the RRT algorithm can search for and effectively intercept the target. Numerical simulations in various situations show the superior performance, in terms of time and accuracy, of the proposed approach.

ID ROBOT NAVIGATION; PART I
AB Robotic navigation is the aspect of cognition related to robot robust mobility. It combines perception, some knowledge on the environment and a set of goal poses to reliably control the robot during a mission that involves displacement. Vision-based autonomous navigation is an instantiation of the latter discipline where visual perception is used to control the robot and to represent the environment. This article presents a vision-based navigation system that uses its onboard camera to navigate and a visual path that represents the scene with a set of images. Being a memory-based system, the navigation is conceived as a concatenation of positioning tasks in the visual servoing scheme. The novelty on the proposed system relies on the generation of the images that compose the visual path. These images are rendered from a preobtained model of the scene. The experiments evaluate the performance of the system over three different scenes, contemplating indoor and outdoor environments, and using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle as testbed.

AB The high demand of efficient large-scale machining operations by concurrently decreasing operating time and costs has led to an increasing usage of mobile robotic systems. This paper introduces a mobile robotic system which is consisted of a hybrid robot named TriMule on an automated guided vehicle, and a fringe-projection-based measurement system. TriMule exhibits desirable performance in terms of rigidity, accuracy, work envelop and reconfigurability. It is therefore suitable to be built on an autonomous platform for multi-station manufacturing in situ. In order to increase the absolute accuracy of the mobile robotic system, the fringe-projection-based measurement system obtains high accuracy and high density cloud to measure the position and orientation of the robot and workpiece in relation to each other. This system is suitable for large-scale manufacturing in situ, drilling, riveting and high-speed milling for example.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can greatly reduce manpower in agricultural plant protection such as watering, sowing, pesticide spraying. It helps in creating an autonomous manufacturing system by executing tasks with less human intervention in time-efficient manner. Consequently, reasonable and efficient planning is one essential component to be focused on; yet to the best of our knowledge, there are few research on practical agricultural plant protection UAV scheduling. This work proposes method to solve the Agricultural Plant Protection UAV scheduling problem in practice such as pesticide spraying, flying and charging. At first, tasks are assigned to UAVs, then schedules are planned for UAVs. To find a near optimal schedule quickly, our method is incorporated with Dragonfly Algorithm. This proposed method is implemented and tested on datasets generated based on a real agricultural plant protection environment. Performance evaluation of our method is discussed in detail and the set of parameters that determining the best solution is reported.

AB Covering about three quarters of the surface area of the earth, the ocean is a critical source of sustenance, medicine, and commerce. However, such vast expanse in both surface area and depth, presents myriad observing challenges for researchers, such as corrosion, attenuation of electromagnetic waves, and high pressure. Ocean observation technologies are progressing from the conventional single node, static and short-term modalities to multiple nodes, dynamic and long-term modalities, to increase the density of both temporal and spatial samplings. Although people's knowledge of the oceans has been still quite limited, the contributions of many nations cooperating to develop the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) have remarkably promoted the development of ocean observing technologies. This paper reviews the typical observing technologies deployed from the sea surface to the seafloor, and discusses the future trend of the ocean observation systems with the docking technology and sustained ocean energy.

TI URLLC Mode Optimal Resource Allocation to Support HARQ in 5G Wireless

DT Article
DE 5G; URLLC; HARQ; queuing delay; latency
AB Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) mode is a promising 5G technology for various real-time applications, such as, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and factory automation. Several papers on URLLC exist, however, most papers only focus on ways to achieve high reliability, and lack mathematical analysis of delay related to packet errors, retransmissions, and bandwidth. In this paper, a M/G/1 queuing model is applied to analyze the erroneous transmission recovery delay of URLLC multi-user services, and using this model the minimum required bandwidth is derived and applied into an adaptive control scheme. The proposed Pollaczek-Khinchine (P-K) formula based quadratic optimization (PFQO) scheme optimizes the bandwidth requirement by controlling the maximum retransmission parameter of the hybrid automatic repeated request (HARQ) mechanism in URLLC. Simulation results show the bandwidth saving effect of the proposed PFQO scheme based on various signal to interference plus noise ratios (SINRs) and packet length distributions.

AB Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning, has gained increasing popularity in autonomous mobile robot path planning recently, due to its self-learning ability without requiring a priori model of the environment. Yet, despite such advantage, Q-learning exhibits slow convergence to the optimal solution. In order to address this limitation, the concept of partially guided Q-learning is introduced wherein, the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is utilized to improve the initialization of Q-learning. Experimental evaluation of the proposed improved Q-learning under the challenging environment with a different layout of obstacles shows that the convergence of Q-learning can be accelerated when Q-values are initialized appropriately using the FPA. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated in a real-world experiment using a three-wheeled mobile robot. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mental workload is an important factor during driving, as both high and low levels may result in driver error. This research examined the mental workload of drivers caused by changes in road environment and how such changes impact upon behaviour, physiological responses, eye movements and brain activity. The experiment used functional near infrared spectroscopy to record prefrontal cortex activation associated with changes in mental workload during simulated driving. Increases in subjective ratings of mental workload caused by changes in road type were accompanied by increases in skin conductance, acceleration signatures and horizontal spread of search. Such changes were also associated with increases in the concentration of oxygenated haemoglobin in the prefrontal cortex. Mental workload fluctuates during driving. Such changes can be identified using a range of measures which could be used to inform the development of in-vehicle devices and partially autonomous systems.

AB The heterogeneity of external systems that can be connected in an e-learning, environment can impose interoperability and performance requirements for recording and storing the learning data. Web-based protocols have been developed to improve e-learning systems' interoperability and capability to perform meaningful analytics. The present paper describes a web-based learning environment aimed at training how to command and control unmanned autonomous vehicles, provided with analytic capabilities. It integrates an external web content management system and a simulation engine that present different performance requirements for recording all significant events that occur during the learning process. Its record store construction, based on standard interoperability protocols, is explored here from the performance viewpoint. The tests that were conducted to assess regular data stores used for learning analytics show that performance should not be overlooked when constructing and deploying learning analytics systems.

AB Two motion planning algorithms for the so-called Dubins Travelling Salesperson Problem are presented, and compared via simulations with existing algorithms from the literature. The first algorithm dubbed "k-step look-ahead algorithm" - stems naturally from the formulation of the Dubins Travelling Salesperson Problem as a minimum-time control problem and is suitable for obtaining short tours when the number of cities is relatively small. The second algorithm is an adaptation of the classic 2-Opt algorithm for the Travelling Salesperson Problem and can be applied to larger instances of the Dubins Travelling Salesperson Problem. In this sense, the two algorithms complement each other in terms of their range of applicability. Instead of being decoupled, the combinatorial and motion planning aspects of the Dubins Travelling Salesperson Problem are treated in an integrated manner by both algorithms and no assumptions are made on the magnitude of the intercity distances.

AB There exists a vast amount of geographic information system (GIS) data that model road networks around the world as polylines with attributes. In this form, the data are insufficient for applications such as simulation and 3D visualization-tools which will grow in power and demand as sensor data become more pervasive and as governments try to optimize their existing physical infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for enhancing a road map from a GIS database to create a geometrically and topologically consistent 3D model to be used in real-time traffic simulation, interactive visualization of virtual worlds, and autonomous vehicle navigation. The resulting representation provides important road features for traffic simulations, including ramps, highways, overpasses, legal merge zones, and intersections with arbitrary states, and it is independent of the simulation methodologies. We test the 3D models of road networks generated by our algorithm on real-time traffic simulation using both macroscopic and microscopic techniques.

AB This article investigates the resilient control problem for nonlinear cyber-physical systems with hybrid cyberattacks and physical constraints, including aperiodic denial-of-service attacks, deception attacks, input saturation, and external disturbances. The underlying system is described by the fuzzy model by decomposing the nonlinear plant into some local linear subsystems. An input saturating integrator and an antiwindup compensator are introduced inside a dynamic output feedback fuzzy controller to handle the input saturation in both amplitude and rate. Within the resulting fuzzy-model-based control framework, a novel adaptive event-triggered-based resilient control method is proposed to ensure that the insecure and imperfect system is stochastically stable with an H(8 )performance level. Simulation results of an autonomous vehicle operating in a wireless network environment are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

AB Game-theoretic motion planners are a potent solution for controlling systems of multiple highly interactive robots. Most existing game-theoretic planners unrealistically assume a priori objective function knowledge is available to all agents. To address this, we propose a fault-tolerant receding horizon game-theoretic motion planner that leverages inter-agent communication with intention hypothesis likelihood. Specifically, robots communicate their objective function which incorporates their intentions. A discrete Bayesian filter is designed to infer the objectives in real-time based on the discrepancy between observed trajectories and predicted solutions to non-cooperative games under available hypotheses. In simulation, we consider three safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios of overtaking, lane-merging and intersection crossing, to demonstrate our planner's ability to capitalize on alternative intention hypotheses to generate safe trajectories in the presence of faulty transmissions in the communication network.

DE Lane detection; deep learning; semantic segmentation; IBN-Net; attention

AB Lane detection is an indispensable technology for environmental perception and is a function of autonomous vehicles. Although many researchers have applied deep learning to lane detection and achieved good results, their application scenarios were relatively simple. When a lane is blocked, lost, or met with other challenges, the accuracy of lane detection decreases tremendously. This paper proposes a novel semantic segmentation network for lane detection that includes IBN-Net, an attention module, and an encoder-decoder structure called IAED. IBN-Net improves the modelling and generalisation capability with little computational complexity. The attention module can better capture context information and improve the performance of the network. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method, which improved by 6.3% over ResNet34 on the TuSimple datasets. Tests on the CULane datasets showed that our method is at least 3% better than existing methods. Experimental results showed that the proposed method has strong robustness under complex conditions such as insufficient illumination and shadow occlusion.

AB This conceptual paper focuses on understanding the interactions between art, science, and technology as a forms of wide interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary collaboration. There is scarce knowledge about how the wide interdisciplinary interaction between artists, scientists, and technologists can be conceptualized through a shared framework for collaboration. The ecology of collaboration involves a complex set of social structures varying between autonomous individually organized teams and institutional programmes. By using a social ecological approach, integrating social, organizational, and cultural factors, art, science, and technology (AST) collaborations can be characterized by a sequence of antecedent, process, and outcome conditions. These elements are organized to form a conceptual framework for art-science collaborations, elaborating on AST in its relationship to knowledge, aesthetics, interdependence, and experimentalism as antecedent conditions, while outlining the process elements and possible outcomes of the collaborations. The framework can be a vehicle for evaluation and reflection for practitioners, researchers, educators, and policymakers.

ID INFORMATION; SUBJECT
AB The present paper proposes a distributed fault-tolerant consensus control protocol strategy for leaderless multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems, where actuators have a partial break-down. Instead of the global information, this strategy applies the relative state of the topology. Also, the topology graph can be any heterogeneous condensation digraph with a spanning tree in the communication network. The linear feedback technique is used to linearize the system model into a second-order multi-AUV system. Then, the Lyapunov functional method is used to prove the system's stability and astringency and the algorithm's effectiveness is simulated numerically. It was found that the actuator efficiency could not be the same in each AUV. Also, the partial actuator loss of effectiveness faults is more typical and complicated. In addition, each AUV's state can converge to the same asymptote, and the consensus error can converge to zero.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE METHOD; TASK ASSIGNMENT; ALGORITHM
AB This paper proposes a cooperative search algorithm to enable swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to capture moving targets. It is based on prior information and target probability constrained by inter-UAV distance for safety and communication. First, a rasterized environmental cognitive map is created to characterize the task area. Second, based on Bayesian theory, the posterior probability of a target's existence is updated using UAV detection information. Third, the predicted probability distribution of the dynamic time-sensitive target is obtained by calculating the target transition probability. Fourth, a customized information interaction mechanism switches the interaction strategy and content according to the communication distance to produce cooperative decision-making in the UAV swarm. Finally, rolling-time domain optimization generates interactive information, so interactive behavior and autonomous decision-making among the swarm members are realized. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm can effectively complete a cooperative moving-target search when constrained by communication distance yet still cooperate effectively in unexpected situations such as a fire.

AB A suite of grounding-line landforms on the Antarctic seafloor, imaged at submeter horizontal resolution from an autonomous underwater vehicle, enables calculation of ice sheet retreat rates from a complex of grounding-zone wedges on the Larsen continental shelf, western Weddell Sea. The landforms are delicate sets of up to 90 ridges, <1.5 meters high and spaced 20 to 25 meters apart. We interpret these ridges as the product of squeezing up of soft sediment during the rise and fall of the retreating ice sheet grounding line during successive tidal cycles. Grounding-line retreat rates of 40 to 50 meters per day (>10 kilometers per year) are inferred during regional deglaciation of the Larsen shelf. If repeated today, such rapid mass loss to the ocean would have clear implications for increasing the rate of global sea level rise.

AB Operation of underwater vehicles and autonomous systems is currently limited by the lack of long-lasting power sources. These systems could potentially be powered using underwater solar cells, but the material requirements to achieve their full potential are not well understood. Using detailed-balance calculations, we show that underwater solar cells can exhibit efficiencies from similar to 55% in shallow waters to more than 65% in deep waters, while maintaining a power density >5mWcm(-2). We show that the optimumband gap of the solar cell shifts by similar to 0.6 eV between shallow and deep waters and plateaus at similar to 2.1 eV at intermediate depths, independent of geographical location. This wide range in optimum band-gap energies opens the potential for a library of wide-band-gap semiconductors to be used for high-efficiency underwater solar cells. Our results provide a roadmap for proper choice of underwater solar cell materials, given the conditions at points of use.

With the development of functional semiconductor devices with complicated structure, strong needs have been required to have advanced fabrication method with high accuracy and low cost. As emerging areas, Internet of things (IoT) have focused on the unique design with additionally functional structure for future applications. Thus, future electronic industries such as touch panel devices, autonomous navigation vehicles, flexible printed circuit boards have been developed very rapidly and fiercely. Therefore, there have been strong demands to develop an advanced fabrication method such as direct patterning which can be applied to more complicated structure with simple process. As an alternative advanced fabrication process, 3-dimensional direct patterning method was prepared and discussed. The schematic structure and functions will be explained and discussed.

AB This paper addresses the leader tracking control problem for heterogeneous uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems sharing information via a communication network, modeled as a directed graph. To solve the problem, we propose a novel distributed PID-like control strategy which, enhanced with a Lyapunov-based adaption mechanism for the control parameters, is able to counteract the uncertainties acting on the agents dynamics. The stability analysis analytically proves the effectiveness of the proposed PID protocol in ensuring the leader-tracking as well as the boundedness of the adaptive control gains. Numerical simulations, involving both the synchronization control problem for nonlinear harmonic oscillators and the practical engineering problem of the cooperative driving for autonomous connected vehicles, confirm the theoretical derivation and disclose the capability of the proposed strategy in achieving the control objective.

AB To prevent traffic congestion, drivers always adjust the driving behavior with their driving information. By considering the self-anticipation effect and the optimal current difference effect on traffic flow stability, a novel two-lane lattice hydrodynamic model is proposed. Compared with Peng's model, the linear stability analysis results reveal that the self-anticipation term can effectively enlarge the stable region on the phase diagram. Then, a reductive perturbation method is used to derive the mKdV equation describing traffic congestion near the critical point. Nonlinear analyses show that the traffic congestions can be effectively suppressed by taking the coefficient of lane-changing behaviors gamma and the anticipation time tau into account. These results further indicate that the driver's self-anticipation current difference effect can efficiently alleviate traffic jams. Furthermore, the numerical simulations with periodic boundary conditions also confirm the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB There has been a renewed interest in recent times in airship technology owing to its potential usage for applications ranging from defense, scientific exploration, advertising to even remote monitoring. For airships to expand operational profile, further enhancement of configurational features and control development for full autonomy are key technologies gaining attention. In this paper, beginning with the mathematical modeling of a thrust-vectored airship, the integrated motion planning and controller development for vehicle autonomy, taking into account various uncertainties, are dealt with. A rapidly exploring random tree-based obstacle avoidance path planning exercise is carried out to chart out a trajectory in the presence of obstacles. Then, a neural network-based sliding mode controller is subsequently designed that learns the unknown equivalent control in sliding mode control framework to track the reference trajectory. Simulation results presented at the end demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

TI A regression-based methodology to improve estimation of inertial sensor
   errors using Allan variance data
SO NAVIGATION-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This research proposes a novel, autonomous, regression-based methodology for Allan variance analysis of inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. Current methods for Allan variance analysis have been rooted in the human-based interpretation of linear trends, referred to as the slope method. The slope method is so prolific; it is referenced among electrical and electronics engineering standards for IMU error analysis. However, the graphical nature and visual-inspection-based use of the method limit its ability to be programmed as a generalized algorithm, which hinders the autonomy desired in modern-day navigation computations. Using nonlinear regression with a ridge-regression initial guess, the proposed method is shown to produce comparable results to the gold standard slope method when using standard-length data collections and outperforms the slope method when the amount of available data is limited. This development directly enables accurate navigation solutions for all vehicles in land, air, sea, and space operations.

AB An energy efficient channel aware and depth based scalable and multipath agent based routing protocol is proposed in this paper. We consider a scenario consisting of underwater sensor nodes, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), underwater gateways, and surface gateways deployed at the territory to monitor the ocean environment (temperature, salinity and pressure) and detect the intruder (moving or static object). Dynamic clustering process is initiated on occurrence of an event; sensor nodes in the event affected area facilitate collection and aggregation of data by the cluster head. The cluster head initiates routing scheme by using mobile agent and its clones to discover multiple paths to a surface gateway based on parameters such as node energy, hop count, propagation delay and channel quality. In order to improve network connectivity and reliability in case of network partitions, an agent based dynamic AUV traversal algorithm is proposed to reorient direction of AUV movement.

AB Motion sickness is a common response in humans and some species of farm livestock during transport, but research on the impact of motion has been primarily focused on the use of animal models for humans. During livestock transportation, animals seek to minimise uncontrolled movements to reduce energy consumption and maintain posture. Road and sea transport of livestock can produce motion sickness and stress responses. Clinical signs are the result of autonomous nervous system activation. Studies conducted on road transportation effects in domestic animals showed several motion sickness behaviours including vomiting and, in ruminants, a reduction in rumination. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the impact of sea transport motion. Despite the paucity of data on livestock, there is sufficient evidence to believe that motion might affect animal welfare when animals are transported by road or sea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents an efficient approach for safe landing trajectory generation of an airplane with structural damage to its wing flying in proximity to local terrain. A damaged airplane maneuvering flight envelope is estimated by analyzing the local stability and flying quality at each trim condition. Trim state distance to a flight envelope boundary provides a novel criterion defined as the safety value index to prioritize choice of trim conditions for postdamage flight. A library of trajectory segments including trim states and transition maneuvers between trim conditions in the local neighborhood are generated using a linear quadratic regulator controller. A potential field strategy is used to rapidly define emergency landing trajectories composed as trim state sequences based on criteria including terrain avoidance, safety value index, and safe landing requirements such as touchdown heading and position, airspeed, glide slope, and bank angle. Cost criteria are balanced by adjusting weights. Landing scenarios are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to autonomously plan safe landing trajectories.

AB Remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicle technologies were used to image and sample exceptional deep sea outcrops where an similar to 100-m-thick section of turbidite beds is exposed on the headwalls of two giant submarine scours on Eel submarine fan, offshore northern California (USA). These outcrops provide a rare opportunity to connect young deep-sea turbidites with their feeder system. C-14 measurements reveal that from 12.8 ka to 7.9 ka, one turbidite was being emplaced on average every 7 yr. This emplacement rate is two to three orders of magnitude higher than observed for turbidites elsewhere along the Pacific margin of North America. The turbidites contain abundant wood and shallow-dwelling foraminifera, demonstrating an efficient connection between the Eel River source and the Eel Fan sink. Turbidite recurrence intervals diminish fivefold to similar to 36 yr from 7.9 ka onward, reflecting sea-level rise and re-routing of Eel River sediments.

SO JOURNAL OF TERRAMECHANICS

DT Article
DE Mobile robots; Maneuvering spaces; Predictive dynamics
AB As the operational uses of mobile robots continue to expand, it becomes useful to be able to predict the admissible maneuvering space to prevent the robot from executing unsafe maneuvers. A novel method is proposed to address this need by using force-moment diagrams to characterize the robot's maneuvering space in terms of path curvature and curvature rate. Using the proposed superposition techniques, these diagrams can then be transformed in real-time to provide a representation of the permissible maneuvering space while allowing for changes in the robot's loading and terrain conditions. Simulation results indicate that the technique can be applied to determine the appropriate maneuvering space for a given set of loading conditions, longitudinal acceleration, and tire-ground coefficient of friction. This may lead to potential expansion in the ability to integrate predictive vehicle dynamics into autonomous controllers for mobile robots and a corresponding potential to safely increase operating speeds.

AB Harbor security and protection of maritime assets are issues of increasing concern. Outstanding research questions exist in terms of the optimal protection methodology needed for the wide variety of surface and submerged threats and diverse geographical locations. Economic costs and environmental concerns are also significant overriding issues. Acoustic methods have the advantage of being amenable to tracking and detecting targets both above and below the ocean surface. Moreover, passive acoustic methods are nonintrusive and capable of covering extensive ranges. Acoustic arrays offer significant advantages in terms of gain and signal processing capabilities over discrete, single hydrophones. We investigate the use of horizontal and vertical arrays for the detection and tracking of a remote environment monitoring system (REMUS) autonomous underwater vehicle as well as open-circuit divers in a noisy, shallow water environment. Using conventional beamforming techniques, we obtain positive preliminary results for detection and tracking, which highlight the overall merits of an acoustic array implementation.

SO MATHEMATICS OF CONTROL SIGNALS AND SYSTEMS

DE Rigid body motion; Optimal control; Elastic curves; Helical motions
AB This paper tackles the problem of computing smooth, optimal trajectories on the Euclidean group of motions SE(3). The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem where the cost function to be minimized is equal to the integral of the classical curvature squared. This problem is analogous to the elastic problem from differential geometry and thus the resulting rigid body motions will trace elastic curves. An application of the Maximum Principle to this optimal control problem shifts the emphasis to the language of symplectic geometry and to the associated Hamiltonian formalism. This results in a system of first order differential equations that yield coordinate free necessary conditions for optimality for these curves. From these necessary conditions we identify an integrable case and these particular set of curves are solved analytically. These analytic solutions provide interpolating curves between an initial given position and orientation and a desired position and orientation that would be useful in motion planning for systems such as robotic manipulators and autonomous-oriented vehicles.

DT Article
AB A self-calibration technique is proposed in this paper to estimate extrinsic parameters of a stero camera system. This technique does not require external 3D measurements of precision calibration points. Furthermore, it is conceptually simple and easy to implement. It has applications in such areas as autonomous vehicle navigation, robotics and computer vision.
   The proposed approach relies solely on distance measurements of a fixed-length object, say a stick. While the object is moved in the 3D space, the image coordinates of the end points of the object are extracted from the image sequence. A cost function that relates the unknown parameters to the measurement residuals is formulated. A nonlinear least squares algorithm is then applied to compute the parameters by minimizing the cost function, using the measured image coordinates and the known length of the object. Simulation studies in this papers answer questions such as the number of iterations needed for the algorithm to converge, the number of measurements needed for a robust estimation, and noise sensitivities of the algorithm.

AB Shared autonomous vehicle services (i. e., automated shuttles, AS) are being deployed globally and may improve older adults (>65 years old) mobility, independence, and participation in the community. However, AS must be user friendly and provide safety benefits if older drivers are to accept and adopt this technology. Current potential barriers to their acceptance of AS include a lack of trust in the systems and hesitation to adopt emerging technology. Technology readiness, perceived ease of use, perceived barriers, and intention to use the technology, are particularly important constructs to consider in older adults' acceptance and adoption practices of AS. Likewise, person factors, i.e., age, life space mobility, driving habits, and cognition predict driving safety among older drivers. However, we are not sure if and how these factors may also predict older adults' intention to use the AS. In the current study, we examined responses from 104 older drivers (M-age = 74.3, SDage = 5.9) who completed the Automated Vehicle User Perception Survey (AVUPS) before and after riding in an on-road automated shuttle (EasyMile EZ10). The study participants also provided information through the Technology Readiness Index, Technology Acceptance Measure, Life Space Questionnaire, Driving Habits Questionnaire, Trail-making Test Part A and Part B (TMT A and TMT B). Older drivers' age, cognitive scores (i.e., TMT B), driving habits (i.e., crashes and/or citations, exposure, and difficulty of driving) and life space (i.e., how far older adults venture from their primary dwelling) were entered into four models to predict their acceptance of AVs-operationalized according to the subscales (i.e., intention to use, perceived barriers, and well-being) and the total acceptance score of the AVUPS. Next, a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) elucidated the relationships between, technology readiness, perceived ease of use, barriers to AV acceptance, life space, crashes and/or citations, driving exposure, driving difficulty, cognition, and intention to use AS. The regression models indicated that neither age nor cognition (TMT B) significantly predicted older drivers' perceptions of AVs; but their self-reported driving difficulty (p = 0.019) predicted their intention to use AVs: R-2 = 6.18%, F (2,101) = 4.554, p = 0.040. Therefore, intention to use was the dependent variable in the subsequent PLS-SEM. Findings from the PLS-SEM (R-2 = 0.467) indicated the only statistically significant predictors of intention to use were technology readiness (beta = 0.247, CI = 0.087-0.411) and barriers to AV acceptance (beta = -0.504, CI = 0.285-0.692). These novel findings provide evidence suggesting that technology readiness and barriers must be better understood if older drivers are to accept and adopt AS.

AB Purpose - The following article is a "Q&A interview" conducted by Joanne Pransky of Industrial Robot Journal as a method to impart the combined technological, business and personal experience of a prominent, robotic industry PhD and inventor regarding his pioneering efforts and the commercialization of bringing a technological invention to market. This paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - The interviewee is Dr Raffaello D'Andrea, a highly successful entrepreneur and proven business leader and one of the world's foremost leaders in robotics and machine learning. D'Andrea is Founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board at Verity, the world's leading autonomous indoor drone company, as well as a Professor of Dynamic Systems and Control at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. D'Andrea is also one of the co-founders and advisors of Robo-Global, an index and research company focused on investments in robotics, automation and artificial intelligence. In this interview, D'Andrea shares some of his business and personal experiences of working in industry and academia and his criteria for turning his ideas into successful working systems.
   Findings - Raffaello D'Andrea's entire career is built on his ability to bridge theory and practice. D'Andrea combined his love for science with his need to create and received a BS degree in engineering science at the University of Toronto, where he was awarded the Wilson Medal as the top graduating student in 1991. He obtained both his MS and PhD degrees in electrical engineering at Caltech, and then he joined the Cornell faculty as an assistant professor. While on leave from Cornell, from 2003 to 2007, he co-founded the disruptive warehouse automation company Kiva Systems, where he led the systems architecture, robot design, robot navigation and coordination, and control algorithms efforts. In 2014, D'Andrea took robotics technology into the air and founded Verity, the world's first company to deliver a fully integrated autonomous, indoor drone-based system solution.
   Originality/value - Raffaello D'Andrea combines academia, business and the arts to reinvent autonomous systems. D'Andrea was a founding member of the Systems Engineering Program at Cornell, where he established robot soccer as the flagship, multidisciplinary team project. In addition to pioneering the use of semi-definite programming for the design of distributed control systems, he went on to lead the Cornell Robot Soccer Team to win four world international RoboCup championships. Kiva Systems, co-founded by D'Andrea and acquired by Amazon in 2012, helped the re-branded Amazon Robotics to disrupt the entire warehousing and logistics systems industry. Additionally, D'Andrea is an internationally-exhibited new media artist, best known for the Robotic Chair (Ars Electronica, ARCO, London Art Fair, National Gallery of Canada) and Flight Assembled Architecture (FRAC Centre). With his team at Verity, he created the drone design and choreography for Cirque Du Soleil's Paramour on Broadway, Metallica's WorldWired Tour and Celine Dion's Courage Tour. Other D'Andrea creations include the Flying Machine Arena, where flying robots perform aerial acrobatics, juggle balls, balance poles and cooperate to build structures; the Distributed Flight Array, a flying platform consisting of multiple autonomous single propeller vehicles that are able to drive, dock with their peers and fly in a coordinated fashion; the Balancing Cube, a dynamic sculpture that can balance on any of its edges or corners and its little brother Cubli, a small cube that can jump up, balance and walk; Blind Juggling Machines that can juggle balls without seeing them, and without catching them. D'Andrea is also collaborating with scientists, engineers, and wingsuit pilots to create an actively controlled suit that will allow humans to take off and land at will, to gain altitude, even to perch, while preserving the intimacy of wingsuit flight. D'Andrea has received the IEEE Robotics and Automation Award, the Engelberger Robotics Award, the IEEE/IFR Invention and Entrepreneurship Award in Robotics and Automation and the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. In 2020, he was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame and elected to the National Academy of Engineering.

AB In this paper, we investigate a problem associated with transferring a set of containers from the storage to the loading area of a warehouse using autonomous robots. In addition to assigning robots to containers, the special topology considered in this paper requires coordinated planning of the robots' movement to avoid conflicts. We formulate the joint problem of robot assignment and movement coordination with the objective of minimizing the time required for all robots to carry their assigned containers to the destination, subject to conflict-free movement of all robots. We use the concept of abstract time windows (ATWs) to represent the movement of robots. The conditions for detecting conflicts in the ATW representation are introduced along with the necessary operations for resolving conflicts. For the solution of the problem, two approaches are developed. The first is a mathematical programming approach that formulates the problem as a mixed-integer linear program that allows optimal solution using appropriate solvers, while the second is a heuristic approach that allows fast, close-to-optimal solutions. Even though the proposed approaches focus on the case where the number of robots is equal to the number of containers, we also discuss how to solve the problem when having unequal number of robots and containers. Simulation results show that the heuristic approach provides a solution within 5% of the optimal solution with the minimum time of completion of all tasks being the performance metric, and executes six orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art mathematical programming solver.
   Note to Practitioners-Robotic systems are increasingly used in logistics facilities, such as warehouses and container terminals. Nonetheless, achieving improved efficiency in this context poses several challenges in terms of real-time execution, coordinated resolution of robot conflicts, and adaptation to unpredictable events in operational environments. This paper examines a problem related to the coordination of a team of autonomous robots operating in a container handling facility, where containers need to be transferred from the storage area to a loading station. The considered topology involves containers arranged in lanes for efficient storage, but imposes limitations on the movement of autonomous robots. Such a topology is commonly found in container terminals where straddle carriers have to transfer containers from a storage yard to quay cranes or trucks and vice versa, but have limitations on moving on the same or even adjacent container lanes. To address this problem, we develop a novel method that efficiently assigns containers to robots and defines appropriate timings for collective coordination of robot movements. We illustrate that the proposed method provides very efficient results (within 5% from the optimal) for multiple configuration scenarios. Even more importantly, the method is suitable for real-time execution as it solves problems with hundreds of robots/containers within a few milliseconds; this further offers the ability for solution adaptation in dynamically varying environments, e.g., in situations of robot delays or breakdowns.

AB Accurate dynamic modeling is essential for precise prediction of six degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) motion and model-based controller design of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The accuracy of dynamic model of an AUV largely depends upon the precise estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients. Accordingly, to establish the dynamic model based on ASE-estimated hydrodynamic coefficients of the novel flight-style AUV and experimental validations, the study is presented in two parts (Part I: ASE and CFD based estimations of hydrodynamic coefficients and Part II: Nonlinear dynamic modeling and experimental validations).
   Part I: In this part complete set of nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients including, added mass, drag, and lift forces and moment coefficients are estimated using ASE technique, which is specifically developed to accurately comprehend the novel AUV design including, AUV hull, fixed wings, control fins, and appendages. Additionally, an improved ASE approach is also proposed to estimate cross flow drag force coefficients. In proposed improved ASE technique, (C-dc) in mathematical formulation is taken from the experimental results of 3D flow past over circular cylinder instead of 2D, as followed previously to estimate the nonlinear cross-flow drag force and moment coefficients (Y-v|v|,Z(w|w|),M-w|w|,N-v|v|,Y-r|r|,Z(q|q|),M-q|q|&N-r|r|). The proposed ASE technique is verified and validated in two stages: first, by comparing the ASE-estimated results with CFD-based estimations, and second, by investigating the 6-DOF motion response of the AUV. When compared ASE-estimations with the CFD results for the cross-flow drag force and moment coefficients, the proposed ASE technique has shown a significant improvement (approximately 20%) over the previously employed ASE method. The ASE-estimated results are validated through 6-DOF motion response of AUV during free-running underwater experiments, provided in 'Part II'. Overall, the proposed ASE technique is considered more effective, direct, and less costly in terms of time and computational efforts, compared to CFD-based or experimental-based estimations of hydrodynamic coefficients of AUVs, particularly torpedo-shaped AUVs.
   Part II: This part presents a nonlinear dynamic model for a newly designed torpedo-shaped flight-style AUV having complex bow and stern fixed wings and control fins configuration. The model includes precise mathematical formulations to accurately represent the physics of the AUV and underwater environment in terms of hydrodynamic derivatives such as added mass, drag, and lift forces and moment coefficients. These coefficients have been estimated using an ASE method provided in 'Part I'. The 6-DOF motion response of the AUV has been simulated in both horizontal and vertical planes which includes, zigzag yaw, circle, zigzag pitch, and spiral maneuvers. The lift generated by the bow and stern control fins has been investigated both separately and collectively, especially during complex spiral ascending maneuvers. Moreover, improved ASE technique for cross flow drag coefficients has also been validated through 6-DOF free-running underwater experiments of AUV and insights on impact of cross flow drag coefficients on 6-DOF motion response of AUV has also been provided. Overall, the comparison between the simulated AUV motion and free-running underwater experiments demonstrated consistency, thereby validating the accuracy of the nonlinear dynamic modeling, ASE-based hydrodynamic coefficient predictions, and effectiveness of the newly designed flight-style AUV for underwater operations.

AB We perform a systematic literature review on testing, validation, and verification of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS). The scope of this review covers peer-reviewed research papers proposing, improving, or evaluating testing techniques, processes, or tools that address the system-level qualities of RAS.
   Our survey is performed based on a rigorous methodology structured in three phases. First, we made use of a set of 26 seed papers (selected by domain experts) and the SERP-TEST taxonomy to design our search query and (domain-specific) taxonomy. Second, we conducted a search in three academic search engines and applied our inclusion and exclusion criteria to the results. Respectively, we made use of related work and domain specialists (50 academics and 15 industry experts) to validate and refine the search query. As a result, we encountered 10,735 studies, out of which 195 were included, reviewed, and coded.
   Our objective is to answer four research questions, pertaining to (1) the type of models, (2) measures for system performance and testing adequacy, (3) tools and their availability, and (4) evidence of applicability, particularly in industrial contexts. We analyse the results of our coding to identify strengths and gaps in the domain and present recommendations to researchers and practitioners.
   Our findings show that variants of temporal logics are most widely used for modelling requirements and properties, while variants of state-machines and transition systems are used widely for modelling system behaviour. Other common models concern epistemic logics for specifying requirements and belief-desireintention models for specifying system behaviour. Apart from time and epistemics, other aspects captured in models concern probabilities (e.g., for modelling uncertainty) and continuous trajectories (e.g., for modelling vehicle dynamics and kinematics).
   Many papers lack any rigorous measure of efficiency, effectiveness, or adequacy for their proposed techniques, processes, or tools. Among those that provide a measure of efficiency, effectiveness, or adequacy, the majority use domain-agnostic generic measures such as number of failures, size of state-space, or verification time were most used. There is a trend in addressing the research gap in this respect by developing domainspecific notions of performance and adequacy. Defining widely accepted rigorous measures of performance and adequacy for each domain is an identified research gap.
   In terms of tools, the mostwidely used tools arewell-establishedmodel-checkers such as Prism and Uppaal, as well as simulation tools such as Gazebo; Matlab/Simulink is another widely used toolset in this domain.
   Overall, there is very limited evidence of industrial applicability in the papers published in this domain. There is even a gap considering consolidated benchmarks for various types of autonomous systems.

ID SITUATION AWARENESS; ATTENTION
AB Recently, research on augmented reality-based head-up displays (AR-HUDs) for driving assistance has been widely conducted in the automotive industry. The disadvantage of having to look away from the road while driving can be compensated by using AR-HUD-based visualization instead of an auxiliary display on the central dashboard. As the number of personal mobility users on the road increases, and their moving speed is considerably faster than pedestrians, personal mobility makes it more difficult for the driver to cope with dangerous situations. However, there is little research work for considering personal mobility users for driving assistance. This study aims to enhance the driver's situational awareness to respond to unexpected situation by providing driver assistance information on the AR-HUD by combining deep learning and AR. In particular, the deep learning-based anomaly detection method can recognize personal mobility users effectively. This study also investigates the driver's understanding of the relationship between the amount of prioritized information provided to AR-HUD and situational cognitive ability. This understanding can be used to adjust the amount of information displayed on the AR-HUD to maintain drivers' situational awareness. The proposed approach was evaluated through an online study. The results showed that the proposed deep learning-based AR-HUD system improved the driver's situational awareness and showed advantages in driving assistance compared to the typical system.

AB In existing computing systems, such as edge computing and cloud computing, several emerging applications and practical scenarios are mostly unavailable or only partially implemented. To overcome the limitations that restrict such applications, the development of a comprehensive computing paradigm has garnered attention in both academia and industry. However, a gap exists in the literature, owing to the scarce research, and a comprehensive computing paradigm is yet to be systematically designed and reviewed. This study introduces a novel concept, called aerial computing, via the amalgamation of aerial radio access networks and edge computing, which attempts to bridge the gap. Specifically, first, we propose a novel comprehensive computing architecture that is composed of low-altitude computing (LAC), high-altitude computing (HAC), and satellite computing platforms, along with conventional computing systems. We determine that aerial computing offers several desirable attributes: global computing service, better mobility, higher scalability and availability, and simultaneity. Second, we comprehensively discuss key technologies that facilitate aerial computing, including energy refilling, edge computing, network softwarization, frequency spectrum, multiaccess techniques, artificial intelligence, and big data. In addition, we discuss vertical domain applications (e.g., smart cities, smart vehicles, smart factories, and smart grids) supported by aerial computing. Finally, we highlight several challenges that need to be addressed and their possible solutions.

AB In this paper, we propose a new distance metric for the K-means clustering algorithm. Applying this metric in clustering a dataset, forms unequal clusters. This metric leads to a larger size for a cluster with a centroid away from the origin, rather than a cluster closer to the origin. The proposed metric is based on the Canberra distances and it is useful for cases that require unequal size clusters. This metric can be used in connected autonomous vehicle wireless networks to classify mobile users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles. We use a combination of mathematical and exhaustive search to establish its validity as a true distance metric. We compare the K-Means algorithm using the proposed distance metric with five other distance metrics for comparison. These metrics include the Euclidean, Manhattan, Canberra, Chi-squared, and Clark distances. Simulation results depict the effectiveness of our proposed metric compared with the other distance metrics in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional randomly generated datasets. In this paper, we use three internal evaluation measures namely the Compactness, Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), and Silhouette measures. These measures are used to study the proper number of clusters for each of the K-Means algorithms and also select the best run among multiple centroid initializations. The elbow method and the local maximum approach are used alongside the evaluation measures to select the optimal number of clusters.

AB BACKGROUND The fruit fly Drosophila suzukii, or spotted wing drosophila (SWD), is a serious pest worldwide, attacking many soft-skinned fruits. An efficient monitoring system that identifies and counts SWD in crops and their surroundings is therefore essential for integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. Existing methods, such as catching flies in liquid bait traps and counting them manually, are costly, time-consuming and labour-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we studied insect trap monitoring using image-based object detection with deep learning.
   RESULTS Based on an image database with 4753 annotated SWD flies, we trained a ResNet-18-based deep convolutional neural network to detect and count SWD, including sex prediction and discrimination. The results show that SWD can be detected with an area under the precision recall curve (AUC) of 0.506 (female) and 0.603 (male) in digital images taken from a static position. For images collected using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the algorithm detected SWD individuals with an AUC of 0.086 (female) and 0.284 (male). The lower AUC for the aerial imagery was due to lower image quality caused by stabilisation manoeuvres of the UAV during image collection.
   CONCLUSION Our results indicate that it is possible to monitor SWD using deep learning and object detection. Moreover, the results demonstrate the potential of UAVs to monitor insect traps, which could be valuable in the development of autonomous insect monitoring systems and IPM.

AB Acoustic emissions from cargo ships transiting coastal waterways, measured by a single hydrophone, can be exploited to estimate both the time-varying source-receiver range and receiver location. In this paper, two parameter-search-based maximum-likelihood estimators are presented: one for $\beta$, the waveguide invariant parameter, and one for source range. $\beta$ characterizes the interference structure inherent to ducted acoustic propagation and is central to the spectral analysis involved in the range estimation. The source ranging method extends prior work by the authors and focuses on the strong narrowband tonals that typically dominate the acoustic spectra of cargo ships. Source ranging results are presented using real data from the SWellEx-96 experiment and are shown to be in close agreement with simulation results obtained using the KRAKEN normal mode program. A technique for estimating the position of a receiver, which can be stationary or moving, is also proposed. The localization technique requires knowledge of the source track, hydrophone data, and an initial estimate of the receiver's position. An application to autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation is included in which the waveguide-invariant-based range estimates are used to mitigate the position estimation error due to drift in inertial measurement units on submerged AUVs. A specific scenario is examined, using SWellEx-96 data, in which an initial position error of 3 km is reduced to under 1 km using the proposed technique.

AB Quantifying human impact on the environment is increasingly important and particularly so in complex mosaic landscapes. Such landscapes are prolific in the developing world, notably in West African, small holder cocoa farming communities. Human Appropriated Net Primary Productivity (HANPP) is a metric which has been developed to quantify the human impact on the environment and has been used in a number of studies globally. However, most operationalization's of HANPP have been done on a coarse global scale or a very local scale, and few studies exist of complex mosaic landscapes. This study utilizes Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAV), or drones, to classify land use and HANPP for three cocoa farming regions in Ghana's Central Region. The results of the study indicate while all regions differ in land use composition, the primary crop for all is cocoa, followed by palm and then land that was previously cultivated which has been left fallow. The average HANPP was 44% for all measured regions, calculated using net primary productivity (NPP) values of an adjacent natural tropical forest. The HANPP for the three regions studied was found to be approximately 6.69, 8.00, and 9.85 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). These values are higher than those that have been reported in some widely accepted global studies, and highlight the need for more regional and landscape scale studies to supplement global assessments of HANPP.

AB The study of car-following dynamics is useful for capacity analysis, safety research, and traffic simulation. There is also growing interest in its applications in intelligent transportation systems, such as advanced vehicle control and safety systems and autonomous cruise control systems. A large number of car-following models have been developed in the past five decades. Some of them were investigated and validated against experimental data; nevertheless, the results were not that consistent for some models, e.g., those for the General Motors (GM) model. As a part of the problem, the data acquisition and calibration techniques were not advanced then. The past few decades have seen remarkable advancements in these techniques, e.g., the use of the differential Global Positioning System (GPS) for position measurement, the use of Doppler's principle for speed measurements, and the use of genetic algorithms for optimization. It might be useful to reassess some outstanding issues in car-following dynamics in light of the latest technological advancements. This paper attempts to investigate car-following dynamics on the basis of the real-time kinematic GPS data collected from test track experiments. The GM model was evaluated along with some well-known simulation models, including the Gipps model and the Leutzbach and Wiedemann model. A genetic algorithm-based optimization technique was adapted for calibration. The sensitivities of drivers to their speeds and spacings from the vehicle ahead were found to vary among drivers. The interpersonal variations in model performance were significant. The GM model parameters were identified with improved reliability. The stability of traffic now was analyzed experimentally.

AB In this paper, we investigate the optimal resource allocation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless-powered two-way communications. The communication process considered here consists of two steps. First, the UAV transmits a control signal over wireless links while ground terminals (GTs) receive information and harvest energy simultaneously, with each GT then using the harvested energy to send data to the UAV. We aim to maximize the minimum uplink throughput among GTs while ensuring the minimum requirement of the downlink throughput for each GT by optimizing the time allocation, the transmit power and the trajectory of the UAV along with the energy harvesting ratio of GTs. First, we propose an effective optimization-based approach to address the non-convexity of the formulated problem, which is difficult to solve. Specifically, we apply a successive convex optimization technique to approximate the convex problem for each optimization variable and find the optimal resource management strategy through a block coordinate descent algorithm. To reduce the high computational complexity of the optimization-based approach, we also develop a deep learning (DL)-based approach consisting of an efficient deep neural network framework and a novel training methodology. Simulation results confirm that the proposed schemes show significant performance improvements over existing baseline schemes. We also confirm that the DL-based scheme achieves performance comparable to the optimization-based scheme with a much shorter computation time.

AB We present results from a field campaign to measure seasonal snow depth at Cameron Pass, Colorado, using a synthetic ultrawideband software-defined radar (SDRadar) implemented in commercially available Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) software-defined radio hardware and flown on a small hexacopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We coherently synthesize an ultrawideband signal from stepped frequency 50-MHz subpulses across 600-2100-MHz frequency bands using a novel nonuniform nonlinear synthetic wideband waveform reconstruction technique that minimizes sweep time and completely eliminates problematic grating lobes and other processing artifacts traditionally seen in stepped waveform synthesis. We image seasonal snow across two transects: a 400-m open Meadow Transect and a 380-m forested transect. We present a surface detection algorithm that fuses data from LiDAR, global navigation satellite system (GNSS)/global positioning system (GPS), and features in the radargram itself to obtain high precision estimates of both snow and ground surface reflections, and thus total snow depth, represented as two-way travel time. The measurements are validated against independent ground-based ground-penetrating radar measurements with correlations coefficients as high as rho = 0.9 demonstrated. Finally, we compare backscattered radar data collected by the UAV-SDRadar while hovering proximal to a known snow pit with in situ measured snow dielectric profiles and demonstrate imaging of snow stratigraphy.

AB This paper evaluates the impact of vehicle automation and electrification on the applicability of fixed routes and door-to-door services to supply a feeder transit solution in suburban areas. These technologies will modify the current cost structure of the bus system depending on how mature they are, reducing operating costs and increasing capital costs. By means of a continuum approximation model, we evaluate the performance for users and agency of the two feeder strategies in different scenarios of technological development. The results show that automation has the main impact on the applicability between the two feeder alternatives while the effects of electrification are considerably smaller. The future applicability of door-to-door trips reaches wider ranges, although this change is especially significant under some circumstances of technology, service area and users. The expansion of this range is relevant in case the automated bus is mature enough (high reduction of operating cost and low vehicle acquisition price), the areas are small, the trips are short and the value of time is high. However, the results reveal that fixed routes will remain a competitive feeder solution in a wide range of scenarios. We identify that the demand density threshold grows sharply in front of any reduction of agency costs once its value is around 200-300 pax/km2-h. Therefore, flexible services will gain applicability especially in environments that allow reaching this threshold.

AB Living organisms have either innate or acquired mechanisms for reacting to percepts with an appropriate behavior e.g., by escaping from the source of a perception detected as threat, or conversely by approaching a target perceived as potential food. In the case of artifacts, such capabilities must be built in through either wired connections or software. The problem addressed here is to define a neural basis for such behaviors to be possibly learned by bio-inspired artifacts. Toward this end, a thought experiment involving an autonomous vehicle is first simulated as a random search. The stochastic decision tree that drives this behavior is then transformed into a plastic neuronal circuit. This leads the vehicle to adopt a deterministic behavior by learning and applying a causality rule just as a conscious human driver would do. From there, a principle of using synchronized multimodal perceptions in association with the Hebb principle of wiring together neuronal cells is induced. This overall framework is implemented as a virtual machine i.e., a concept widely used in software engineering. It is argued that such an interface situated at a meso-scale level between abstracted micro-circuits representing synaptic plasticity, on one hand, and that of the emergence of behaviors, on the other, allows for a strict delineation of successive levels of complexity. More specifically, isolating levels allows for simulating yet unknown processes of cognition independently of their underlying neurological grounding.

AB Intelligent systems and advanced automation are involved in information collection and evaluation, decision-making, and the implementation of chosen actions. In such systems, human responsibility becomes equivocal. Understanding human causal responsibility is particularly important when systems can harm people, as with autonomous vehicles or, most notably, with autonomous weapon systems (AWSs). Using information theory, we developed a responsibility quantification (ResQu) model of human causal responsibility in intelligent systems and demonstrated its applications on decisions regarding AWS. The analysis reveals that comparative human responsibility for outcomes is often low, even when major functions are allocated to the human. Thus, broadly stated policies of keeping humans in the loop and having meaningful human control are misleading and cannot truly direct decisions on how to involve humans in advanced automation. The current model assumes stationarity, full knowledge regarding the characteristic of the human and automation, and ignores temporal aspects. It is an initial step toward the development of a comprehensive responsibility model that will make it possible to quantify human causal responsibility. The model can serve as an additional tool in the analysis of system design alternatives and policy decisions regarding human causal responsibility, providing a novel, quantitative perspective on these matters. Note to Practitioners-We developed a theoretical model and a quantitative measure for computing the comparative human causal responsibility in the interaction with intelligent systems and advanced automation. Our responsibility measure can be applied by practitioners (system designers, regulators, and so on) to estimate user responsibility in specific system configurations. This can serve as an additional tool in the comparison between alternative system designs or deployment policies, by relating different automation design options to their predicted effect on the users' responsibility. To apply the model (which is based on entropy and mutual information) to real-world systems, one must deduce the underlying distributions, either from known system properties or from empirical observations, taken over time. The initial version of the model we present here assumes that the combined human-automation system is stationary and ergodic. Real-world systems may not be stationary and ergodic or cannot be observed sufficiently to allow accurate estimates of the required input of multivariate probabilities, in which case the computed responsibility values should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, the construction of a ResQu information flow model, combined with sensitivity analyses of how changes in the input probabilities and assumptions affect the responsibility measure, will often reveal important qualitative properties and supply valuable insights regarding the general level of meaningful human involvement and comparative responsibility in a system.

AB The increasing adoption of automation will likely replace the tasks performed in many jobs, resulting in new challenges for workers. Yet, little is known regarding how workers perceive automation, including how it may influence their job attitudes and turnover intentions. Automated vehicles (AVs) are one example of new technology poised to alter the job of truck driving, which is overwhelmingly populated by older workers. In this study, we examined truck drivers', supervisors', and managers' attitudes and concerns about AV adoption and its effects on driving jobs to help the transportation industry prepare for automation with minimal workforce disruption. We drew from theorizing on self-interest in economics and lifespan coping theories to contextualize workers' reactions to automation. We conducted focus groups and interviews with truck drivers (N=18), supervisors of drivers (N=8), and upper-level managers of trucking companies (N=25). Two themes emerged from the thematic analysis: the unknown, and proficiency. AVs may be viewed as threatening by drivers, causing anxiety due to widespread uncertainty and the fear of job loss and loss of control. At the same time, there will be a greater need for drivers to be adaptable for the era of AVs. AVs are also likely to result in other changes to the role of driving, which may have implications for driver recruitment and selection. We interpret our findings together with lifespan theories of control and coping and provide recommendations for organizations to effectively prepare for automation in the trucking industry.

AB High-resolution terrain models of open-pit mine highwalls and benches are essential in developing new automated slope monitoring systems for operational optimization. This paper presents several contributions to the field of remote sensing in surface mines providing a practical framework for generating high-resolution images using low-trim Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). First, a novel mobile application was developed for autonomous drone flights to follow mine terrain and capture high-resolution images of the mine surface. In this article, case study is presented showcasing the ability of developed software to import area terrain, plan the flight accordingly, and finally execute the area mapping mission autonomously. Next, to model the drone's battery performance, empirical studies were conducted considering various flight scenarios. A multivariate linear regression model for drone power consumption was derived from experimental data. The model has also been validated using data from a test flight. Finally, a genetic algorithm for solving the problem of flight planning and optimization has been employed. The developed power consumption model was used as the fitness function in the genetic algorithm. The designed algorithm was then validated using simulation studies. It is shown that the offered path optimization can reduce the time and energy of high-resolution imagery missions by over 50%. The current work provides a practical framework for stability monitoring of open-pit highwalls while achieving required energy optimization and imagery performance.

TI Design, Implementation, and Characterization of Precision Timing for
   Bistatic Acoustic Data Acquisition
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Acoustic sensors; data acquisition; timing
AB One of the challenges presented in using autonomous underwater vehicles ( AUVs) for remote data collection is accurate time synchronization. In the case of bistatic acoustics, synchronization is required between AUV and source so that the time in which each ping is sent out is exactly known. There are three key obstacles to achieving this. First, the vehicle is submerged and therefore unable to access common time references directly. Second, the required accuracy in data acquisition far exceeds that possible using a computer clock to trigger data collection. Finally, to achieve accuracy in microseconds, the system must be characterized to eliminate delays introduced by filtering and analog-to-digital conversion. This paper describes the implementation and characterization of an accurate and precise timing and data acquisition system used on an AUV to collect acoustic array data. The timing was achieved using a combination of global positioning system ( GPS) pulse-per-second ( PPS) for synchronization on the surface and the Microsemi ( Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) chip scale atomic clock ( CSAC) for timing while submerged, with a PPS triggered data acquisition system. Characterization and calibration procedures were developed to ensure that the system met the experiment requirements, which included less than one percent of a wavelength error in phase, and one tenth of a meter accuracy in range. Analog and digital delays in the system were determined, and a method was demonstrated to further improve accuracy by dynamically estimating digital delays. The steps outlined in this paper for achieving precision data acquisition could be applied to many other remote systems that require similar microsecond accuracy.

AB Future vehicular wireless applications, such as autonomous and remote driving, will demand High Throughput Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (HT-URLLC) unsupported by current wireless standards. Hybrid network designs that combine Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) and Sub-6 GHz communications were recently proposed to establish HT-URLLC in Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) networks. To enable such integration, new Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols must be developed. As such, we consider a linear vehicular network, in which vehicles driving closely in the same lane utilize both front and rear directional mmWave antennas to form a Lane Cluster (LC). Data packets, then, propagate forwards and backwards along the LC towards its terminals in a multi-hop fashion. In turn, the LC terminals utilize omnidirectional antennas at Sub-6 GHz frequencies to disseminate the cluster's packets to nearby LCs, Road Side Units (RSUs), and cellular base stations. To resolve the channel contention between subsequent LC members, we devised a two-timeslot MAC scheme with a schedule alignment mechanism. Additionally, we developed centralized and distributed schedule coordination protocols aligning the schedules of adjacent LCs to mitigate cross-lane interference due to antenna beam misalignment. The proposed protocols were evaluated using VEINS (extension of OMNET++ network simulator) and compared against the CSMA-CA scheme of IEEE 802.11p under different parameters and scenarios. The results show that the proposed linear topology along with the scheduling protocols can potentially achieve HT-URLLC while addressing the mmWave practicality issues.

ID INDOOR LOCALIZATION
AB Generally unmanned aerial vehicles are currently equipped with multiple sensors to help them in their navigation. However, the acquisition of the position at every moment is a hard task to be achieved mainly in crowded scenarios where multiple obstacles make difficult the reception of signal coming from satellites (for global navigation systems) or base stations which perform the functions of anchors in some localization systems. Another issue in this kind of scenarios is the low probability to obtain redundancy systems due to the poor received signal associated to obstructions. For the case where there is only the minimum information required to estimate the position, the named radical axis Gauss Newton (RA-GN) algorithm was previously proposed and successfully evaluated by simulation. Now, in this paper, the RA-GN algorithm is applied to a localization system and evaluated experimentally from a measurement campaign conducted in a semi-forest test field. Moreover, we assess the effect of rotating the tag taken as the representation of the vehicle and found that this rotation introduces changes in the position estimation. All our results in terms of root mean square error are compared with those given by a commercial system. Results reported here show that the RA-GN algorithm is able to improve the accuracy of estimation of the commercial system in real conditions of crowded environments, even under complicated situations where the signal is perturbed by the obstacles and under different angular positions of the tag relative to the anchors.

AB The PPP-RTK method, which combines the concepts of Precise of Point Positioning (PPP) and Real-Time Kinematic (RTK), is proposed to provide a centimeter-accuracy positioning service for an unlimited number of users. Recently, the PPP-RTK technique is becoming a promising tool for emerging applications such as autonomous vehicles and unmanned logistics as it has several advantages including high precision, full flexibility, and good privacy. This paper gives a detailed review of PPP-RTK focusing on its implementation methods, recent achievements as well as challenges and opportunities. Firstly, the fundamental approach to implement PPP-RTK is described and an overview of the research on key techniques, such as Uncalibrated Phase Delay (UPD) estimation, precise atmospheric correction retrieval and modeling, and fast PPP ambiguity resolution, is given. Then, the recent efforts and progress are addressed, such as improving the performance of PPP-RTK by combining multi-GNSS and multi-frequency observations, single-frequency PPP-RTK for low-cost devices, and PPP-RTK for vehicle navigation. Also, the system construction and applications based on the PPP-RTK method are summarized. Moreover, the main issues that impact PPP-RTK performance are highlighted, including signal occlusion in complex urban areas and atmosphere modeling in extreme weather events. The new opportunities brought by the rapid development of low-cost markets, multiple sensors, and new-generation Low Earth Orbit (LEO) navigation constellation are also discussed. Finally, the paper concludes with some comments and the prospects for future research.

AB The long baseline (LBL) underwater navigation paradigm relies on the conversion of travel times into pseudoranges to trilaterate position. For real-time autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operations, this conversion assumes an isovelocity sound speed. For re-navigation, computationally and/or labor-intensive acoustic modeling may be employed to reduce uncertainty. This work demonstrates a real-time ray-based prediction of the effective sound speed along a path from source to receiver. This method was implemented for an AUV-LBL system in the Beaufort Sea in an ice-covered and a double-ducted propagation environment. Given the lack of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) data throughout the vehicle's mission, the pseudorange performance is first evaluated on acoustic transmissions between GNSS-linked beacons. The mean real-time absolute range error between beacons is roughly 11 m at distances up to 3 km. A consistent overestimation in the real-time method provides insights for improved eigenray filtering by the number of bounces. An operationally equivalent pipeline is used to reposition the LBL beacons and re-navigate the AUV, using modeled, historical, and locally observed sound speed profiles. The best re-navigation error is 1.84 +/- 2.19 m root mean square. The improved performance suggests that this approach extends the single meter accuracy of the deployed GNSS units into the water column.(c) 2022 Author(s).All article content, except where otherwise noted, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

AB User proficiency in manual operation of autonomous systems is crucial to the performance of these systems because users are often the final barrier in detecting and correcting abnormal behavior in autonomy. This letter presents a new approach to identifying user proficiency in piloting small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) by first extracting meaningful features and then using a clustering method to generate ground truth. Pilot performance has been broadly explored in the field of aviation, but not for operation of sUAVs, and both are inherently different due expectations for training, location of user, and subsequent change in user's point-of-view. We propose a novel, hybrid approach to evaluate UAV pilot performance: combining human-rater data and computational methods that incorporate performance metrics to tune and homogenize the process (of applying controls) and the product (UAV flight path) of piloting sUAVs. The results reveal a spectrum of user skills that designers of these systems need to account for and the ways that users at different skill levels can be expected to respond, informing future autonomy design. In a 20 participant study, users were asked to fly a sUAV along 8 different flight paths of varying difficulty while the flight trajectory and user control inputs were recorded. We utilized unsupervised learning techniques to group pilots into proficiency groups and analyzed the clusters with respect to the features built. We also identified possible factors based on groupings to target training of these users. We validated our approach using new set of data from 12 participants.

AB In this article, the problem of video inpainting combines multiview spatial information and interframe information between video sequences. A vision system is an important way for autonomous vehicles to obtain information about the external environment. Loss or distortion of visual images caused by camera damage or pollution seriously makes an impact on the vision system ability to correctly perceive and understand the external environment. In this article, we solve the problem of image restoration by combining the optical flow information between frames in the video with the spatial information from multiple perspectives. To solve the problems of noise in the single-frame images of video frames, we propose a complete two-stage video repair method. We combine the spatial information of images from different perspectives and the optical flow information of the video sequence to assist and constrain the repair of damaged images in the video. This method combines the interframe information of the front and rear image frames with the multiview image information in the video and performs video repair based on optical flow and a conditional generation adversarial network. This method regards video inpainting as a pixel propagation problem, uses the interframe information in the video for video inpainting, and introduces multiview information to assist the repair based on a conditional generative adversarial network. This method was trained and tested in Zurich using a data set recorded by a pair of cameras mounted on a mobile platform.

AB With the mining of polymetallic nodules from the deep-sea seafloor once more evoking commercial interest, decisions must be taken on how to most efficiently regulate and monitor physical and community disturbance in these remote ecosystems. Image-based approaches allow nondestructive assessment of the abundance of larger fauna to be derived from survey data, with repeat surveys of areas possible to allow time series data collection. At the time of writing, key underwater imaging platforms commonly used to map seafloor fauna abundances are autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and towed camera "ocean floor observation systems" (OFOSs). These systems are highly customisable, with cameras, illumination sources and deployment protocols changing rapidly, even during a survey cruise. In this study, eight image datasets were collected from a discrete area of polymetallic-nodulerich seafloor by an AUV and several OFOSs deployed at various altitudes above the seafloor. A fauna identification catalogue was used by five annotators to estimate the abundances of 20 fauna categories from the different datasets. Results show that, for many categories of megafauna, differences in image resolution greatly influenced the estimations of fauna abundance determined by the annotators. This is an important finding for the development of future monitoring legislation for these areas. When and if commercial exploitation of these marine resources commences, robust and verifiable standards which incorporate developing technological advances in camera-based monitoring surveys should be key to developing appropriate management regulations for these regions.

AB This study proposes a uniform passive fault-tolerant control (FTC) method for a quadcopter that does not rely on fault information subject to one, two adjacent, two opposite, or three rotor failure. The uniform control implies that the passive FTC is able to cover the condition from quadcopter fault-free to rotor failure without the need for controller switching. To achieve the purpose of passive FTC, the fault of rotors is modeled as a lumped disturbance acting on the virtual control of the quadcopter system. The estimated disturbance is used directly in the passive FTC. At the same time, a modified controller structure is designed to achieve the passive FTC ability for two and three rotor failure. To avoid the control allocation switching from the fault-free control to the FTC, a dynamic control allocation is used. In addition, the closed-loop stability is analyzed in the presence of up to three rotor failure. To validate the proposed uniform passive FTC method, outdoor experiments are performed for the first time, which have demonstrated that the hovering quadcopter is able to recover from one rotor failure using the proposed controller and resume its mission even if two adjacent, two opposite, or three rotors fail, without the need for any rotor fault information or controller switching.

AB Coral reefs are under increasing threat, and the loss of reef-associated fishes providing valuable ecosystem services is accelerating. The monitoring of such rapid changes has become a challenge for ecologists and ecosystems managers using traditional approaches like scuba divers performing underwater visual censuses (UVC) or diver operated video recording (DOV). However, the use of small, low-cost robots could help tackle the challenge of such monitoring, provided that they perform at least as well as diver-based methods. To address this question, tropical fish assemblages from 13 fringing reefs around Mayotte Island (Indian Ocean) were monitored along 50 m-long transects using stereo videos recorded by a semi-autonomous underwater vehicle (SAUV) and by a scuba diver (Diver Operated stereo Video system, DOV). Differences between the methods were tested for complementary fish assemblage metrics (species richness, total biomass, total density, Shannon diversity and Pielou evenness) and for the number and size of nine targeted species. SAUV recorded on average 35% higher biomass than DOV which in turn recorded on average 12% higher species richness. Biomass differences were found to be due to SAUV monitoring larger fishes than DOV, a potential marker of human-related fish avoidance behaviour. This study demonstrates that SAUV provides accurate metrics of coral reef fish biodiversity compared to diver-based procedures. Given their ability to conduct video transects at high frequency, 100 m depth range and at a moderate cost, SAUV is a promising tool for monitoring fish assemblages in coral reef ecosystems.

AB In the modern era, characterized by intense urbanization and frequent travel between interconnected communities, the constant expansion of cities, associated with high densities and growing need for traveling, has led to a significant increase in road traffic volumes. More than ever, road traffic today requires effort to be managed effectively in order to improve performance and safety conditions, given the greater probability of unpleasant events such as accidents or road congestion with related delays and the increased stress levels of the user and infrastructure. Fortunately, there are already various engineering tools, such as ramp metering, that can be used for this purpose. Ramp metering allows for achieving the aforementioned desired benefits, including improving mobility, reliability, efficiency, and safety, and even reducing environmental impact. It also has been shown to be cost-effective from the existing literature. Further research will be necessary to strengthen the quality, efficacy, and efficiency of ramp metering, especially considering the fast-paced progress in technology (e.g., connected autonomous vehicles and drones used for surveys) and new challenging scenarios (e.g., congested industrial areas and emergency vehicles). This review's scope is to present a general overview of principal ramp metering solutions, focusing on current research studies in the last couple of years and highlighting some of the main algorithms used for this purpose, depending on diverse scenarios. With this article, the authors desire to present the subject of ramp metering, providing a general overview of its story, evolution, and recent analytical models.

AB Coral reefs worldwide are declining at an accelerating rate due to multiple types of human impacts. Meanwhile, new technologies with applications in reef science and conservation are emerging at an ever faster rate and are simultaneously becoming cheaper and more accessible. Technology alone cannot save reefs, but it can potentially help scientists and conservation practitioners study, mitigate, and even solve key challenges facing coral reefs. We examine how new and emerging technologies are already being used for coral reef science and conservation. Examples include drones, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), 3D mapping and modeling tools, high resolution and nano satellite imagery, and a suite of monitoring and surveillance tools that are revolutionizing enforcement of sustainable reef fisheries. We argue that emerging technologies can play a pivotal role in tackling many of the critical issues facing coral reef conservation science and practice, but maximizing the impact of these technologies requires addressing several significant barriers. These barriers include lack of awareness of technologies and tools, prohibitive cost, lack of transferability across systems and/or scales, lack of technical expertise, and lack of accessibility. We discuss where analogous challenges have been overcome in another system and identify insights that can provide guidance for wise application of emerging technologies to coral reef science and conservation. Thoughtful consideration of, and adaptation to, these challenges will help us best harness the potential of emerging and future technological innovations to help solve the global coral reef crisis.

AB In real transportation environments for semi-conductor manufacturing, unexpected disturbances such as motion delays and/or sudden requests for transportation may cause collisions among AGVs increasing total transportation time. It is required to generate a collision-free routing for multiple automated guided vehicles (AGVs) within a few seconds. In this paper, we propose a distributed routing method under motion delay disturbance for multiple AGVs. The proposed method features a characteristic that each AGV subsystem derives its optimal route to minimize the sum of the transportation time and the penalties with respect to collision probability with other AGVs. The penalties reflect the collision probability distribution function for motion delay disturbances. The proposed method is applied to a routing problem for transportation in the semiconductor fabrication bay with 143 nodes and 20 AGVs. The computational results show that the total transportation time obtained by the proposed method is shorter than that of the conventional method. For dynamic transportation environments, an optimal timing for re-routing multiple AGVs under motion delay disturbance is systematically determined by the tradeoff relationship between the total computation time to derive a solution and the uncertainties for re-routings. Markov chain is used to represent uncertainty distribution for re-routings. The proposed method is implemented in an experimental transportation system with 51 nodes and 5 AGVs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is applicable to real transportation environments. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In most cities, transit consists solely of fixed-route transportation, whence the inherent limited Quality of Service for travellers in suburban areas and during off-peak periods. On the other hand, completely replacing fixed-route (FR) with demand-responsive (DR) transit would imply a huge operational cost. It is still unclear how to integrate DR transportation into current transit systems to take full advantage of it. We propose a Continuous Approximation model of a transit system that gets the best from fixed-route and DR transportation. Our model allows deciding whether to deploy a FR or a DR feeder, in each sub-region of an urban conurbation and each time of day, and to redesign the line frequencies and the stop spacing of the main trunk service. Since such a transit design can adapt to the spatial and temporal variation of the demand, we call it Adaptive Transit. Numerical results show that, with respect to conventional transit, Adaptive Transit significantly improves user-related cost, by drastically reducing access time to the main trunk service. Such benefits are particularly remarkable in the suburbs. Moreover, the generalized cost, including agency and user cost, is also reduced. These findings are also confirmed in scenarios with automated vehicles. Our model can assist in planning future-generation transit systems, able to improve urban mobility by appropriately combining fixed and DR transportation.

AB Overhead transmission lines suffer from extended exposure to harsh weather conditions. Metal dampers, a crucial protective fitting in the line, can effectively suppress the conductor's vibration energy and prevent Aeolian vibration and ice shedding. To ensure the safety of operation of the damper, we are proposing a detection method for structural defect damper based on spatial relationship. First, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial damper images are processed with relative total variation (RTV) transform to obtain an enhanced image with a smooth texture and prominent foreground main structure. Second, the enhanced image is corrected by rotation so that the conductor remains horizontal. Next, based on the endpoint coordinates of the conductor, a foreground preselection box for improved GrabCut segmentation is automatically generated to extract the object dampers. Finally, the spatial relationship between the damper components in the segmentation results is regarded as the motive force of the damper structural defect diagnosis model to detect damage, inversion, slight, and serious deformation defects in sequence. We analyzed the performance of the proposed method through actual field tests, and the results demonstrated that the identification accuracy of the method is 95.76% when applied to a small sample set, which is higher than other existing methods based on traditional image techniques and deep learning defect detection, and can effectively identify different structural defects of dampers and provide reliable data for transmission line condition monitoring.

AB This paper presents SVIn2, a novel tightly-coupled keyframe-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system, which fuses Scanning Profiling Sonar, Visual, Inertial, and water-pressure information in a non-linear optimization framework for small and large scale challenging underwater environments. The developed real-time system features robust initialization, loop-closing, and relocalization capabilities, which make the system reliable in the presence of haze, blurriness, low light, and lighting variations, typically observed in underwater scenarios. Over the last decade, Visual-Inertial Odometry and SLAM systems have shown excellent performance for mobile robots in indoor and outdoor environments, but often fail underwater due to the inherent difficulties in such environments. Our approach combats the weaknesses of previous approaches by utilizing additional sensors and exploiting their complementary characteristics. In particular, we use (1) acoustic range information for improved reconstruction and localization, thanks to the reliable distance measurement; (2) depth information from water-pressure sensor for robust initialization, refining the scale, and assisting to limit the drift in the tightly-coupled integration. The developed software-made open source-has been successfully used to test and validate the proposed system in both benchmark datasets and numerous real world underwater scenarios, including datasets collected with a custom-made underwater sensor suite and an autonomous underwater vehicle Aqua2. SVIn2 demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of accuracy and robustness on those datasets and enabled other robotic tasks, for example, planning for underwater robots in presence of obstacles.

AB The sustainable and continuous development of public transport systems is crucial to ensuring robust and resilient transport and economic activity whilst improving the urban environment. Through technological improvement, cities can increase the competitiveness of public transport, promote equality and pursue a multimodal shift to greener solutions. The introduction of vehicle automation technology into existing public transport systems has potential impacts on mobility behaviours and may replace conventional bus service in the future. This study examines travellers? preferences for automated buses versus conventional buses, using a contextdependent stated choice experiment. This experiment measured the effects of context variables (such as trip purpose, travel distance, time of day, weather conditions and travel companion) on the choice of automated buses versus conventional buses. The results were analysed using mixed logit models, and the findings indicate that, in general, choice behaviours do not diverge much between the choice of automated bus and conventional bus. However, individuals? choices are more elastic towards the changes in automated bus service levels compared to conventional bus service. The results show that poor weather conditions may lower the quality and reliability of public transport service, and the probability of choosing an automated bus over a conventional bus is reduced due to such disruptions. In addition, passengers travelling for work purposes, covering long distances, or travelling with companions are more likely to choose conventional buses than automated buses.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle; Terrain-aided navigation; Deep-sea

AB Initial positioning errors and the low adaptability of a priori digital elevation maps result in large positioning uncertainty intervals in the initial stage of terrain-aided navigation (TAN). This produces pseudo-peaks and mismatches in the initial position likelihood function and renders the convergence of the particle filter (PF) slow and unstable, while even causing divergence. Thus, the occurrence of the "kidnapped robot problem'' is highly probable during the initial stage of TAN and is a scenario frequently faced by deep-sea and ultra-long-range underwater vehicles. In this study, a PF initialization method based on non-linear multi-terrain aided fusion position (NLMTP) is proposed to improve the stability and accuracy of TAN. NLMTP uses the terrain-aided position (TAP) information during the initial stage of TAN to estimate the high-precision probability distribution of the starting position via backward smoothing. Accordingly, a PF initialization method for non-Gaussian prior distribution probability is proposed to improve the convergence speed of the PF during the initial stage of underwater TAN. Finally, a performance comparison of PF initialized via the NLMTP, TAP confidence interval, and TERCOM methods was performed using the survey data obtained via onboard sensors. The experimental results show that NLMTP initialization improves the convergence speed and positioning accuracy of PF in the initial TAN phase; this improvement is clear in the low terrain-adaptability area.

DE Game theoretic motion planning; Nash equilibrium; Multi-robot systems
AB This paper presents a real-time game theoretic motion planning approach that enables an autonomous drone to race competitively against an arbitrary number of opponent drones along a 2D or 3D racecourse. Our method computes an approximate Nash equilibrium in the space of robot trajectories to maximally advance the ego robot while taking into account the opponents' intentions and responses. The core of our solution is a "sensitivity enhanced" iterative best response algorithm that the ego robot uses to repeatedly plan its own trajectory and infer opponents' trajectories, ultimately seeking a Nash equilibrium in the joint space of trajectories for all the drones. The algorithm includes a term that allows the ego vehicle to gain advantage by exploiting the influence of the ego drone's trajectory on the adversaries' objectives through the shared collision avoidance constraints among the vehicles. We also propose two methods for accelerating this computationally intensive iterative algorithm using (i) parallel computing with multiple CPU cores, and (ii) a neural network model that learns to predict trajectories close to the Nash equilibrium through offline training examples. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to benchmark the performance of our game theoretic planner and the statistical results show that our approach largely outperforms a baseline model predictive control algorithm that does not account for the opponents' reactions. Hardware experiments with 4 quadrotor robots on a 3D racecourse are performed to show the applicability of our method in real-time robotic systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID IMPACT
AB The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) will suffer severe impact load during the water entry, and its shell structure will undergo elastoplastic deformation, even breakage or damage, which seriously threatens the safety and reliability of the AUV. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out research on the buffering technology of the impact load of the vehicle into the water to ensure that the AUV can enter the water safely and reliably. In this paper, a mitigator is designed to reduce the impact load of the AUV entering the water. Numerical simulations based on the explicit finite element method with an Arbitrary-Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) solver are carried out to study the mitigation characteristic of the designed mitigator. The accuracy of the model was verified by the experimental results of the water-entry of the small sphere, and the mesh independence was verified to determine the mesh size. Then, the effects of initial conditions such as buffer length, buffer material density, entry velocity and entry angle on the cushioning effect of the buffer head cap were studied. When the vertical water entry velocity is 50 m/s, the impact load reduction ratio is 42.2%; while the water entry angle is 60 degrees and the water entry velocity is 50 m/s, the axial load reduction ratio is 28.8%, and the normal load reduction ratio is 27.8%. These conclusions will be useful for the designing of the crashworthy structural and the analysis of underwater weapon impact.

AB A compact field-deployable optical instrument using fluorescence, absorbance, and scattering to identify and quantify contaminants and natural substances in water bodies is described. The instrument is capable of deployment on autonomous underwater and surface vehicles, manned vehicles, fixed platforms such as buoys, or access points in water supply or drainage networks. The instrument comprises (1) a flowcell, (2) multiple optical systems, (3) a data logger, (4) a power control board and computer, and (5) a battery. The instrument has been packaged in a cylindrical pressure case of 200 mm diameter and 300 mm length for electrically and mechanically seamless insertion as a STARFISH AUV payload module. The same module can be fitted with watertight end caps for use aboard other platforms, or simpler packaging can be employed for use in less demanding environments. For spectrofluorometry, the system uses six (expandable to twelve) electronically switchable excitation sources, allowing the construction of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). A deuterium-tungsten light source (185 to 1100 nm) is used in making UV-VIS absorbance measurements. Turbidity can be measured by nephelometry, using observations of light scattering at each excitation wavelength. The absorbance and turbidity capabilities provide useful water quality information and can also be used for correction of inner shielding effects. Validation of the instrument includes (1) comparison with a commercial luminescence spectrometer in measuring both standards and field samples, (2) comparisons of observed spectra with published optical characteristics for several chemicals, and (3) field demonstration aboard an AUV.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose an efficient algorithm for trajectory planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in 2D spaces. This paper has been motivated by the challenge to develop a fast trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous UAVs through mid-course waypoints (WPs). It is assumed that there is no prior knowledge of these WPs, and their configuration is computed as in-flight procedure.
   Design/methodology/approach - Since the off-line techniques cannot be applied, it is required to apply an online trajectory planning algorithm. For this reason, based on the optimal control and the geometry, each segment of trajectory is designed with respect to a local frame. The algorithm is implemented as a real-time manner in terms of the down-range variable.
   Findings - The proposed algorithm tries to find not only a feasible trajectory (the constraint includes the maximum heading angle rate) but also an optimal trajectory (the objective locally is to minimize the length of the path). This online trajectory planning algorithm gradually produces a smooth 2D trajectory aiming at reaching the mid-course WPs and the final target so that they are smoothly connected with each other. The mid-course WPs are described through the given down-range, cross-range, and heading angle.
   Originality/value - Based on geometrical principles, this algorithm is capable of re-planning the trajectory as in-flight manner, and the computational burden approaches the online capabilities for UAVs with high velocity.

AB Autonomous dynamic obstacle avoidance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on collision prediction is critical for stable flight missions. UAVs must deal with high-speed and nonlinearly moving obstacles that obey nonlinear dynamics, which are one of the numerous objects affecting stable flight. To satisfy the requirements of smooth flight and attitude stability, a novel dynamic smooth obstacle avoidance (QVA) method based on obstacle trajectory prediction is proposed. To predict the dynamic obstacle trajectories, a trajectory prediction (QLTP) method using a quasi-linear parameter varying representations is proposed. The proposed QVA integrates the QLTP approach, velocity obstacle (VO) approach, and artificial potential field (APF) methods. The QVA detects an imminent collision based on the QLTP method, and then replans the UAV path based on the VO method at the time of the predicted collision. The UAV tracks planned waypoints for collision avoidance. To ensure the flight safety of the UAV, a virtual APF is constructed with waypoints as local targets and obstacles. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs better than the improved APF and VO methods in terms of the smoothness of the obstacle avoidance path and the stability of the UAV attitude.
   The prediction of obstacle trajectories is a critical step in the smooth avoidance of high-speed and non-linearly moving obstacles. The collision detection and the velocity obstacle are the basis for the adaptive path planning. Track the planned waypoints and build the artificial potential fields as the safety mechanism.image

AB Integrating low-altitude earth orbit (LEO) satellites (SATs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within a non-terrestrial network (NTN), we investigate the problem of forwarding packets between two faraway ground terminals through SAT and UAV relays using either radio-frequency (RF) or free-space optical (FSO) link. Towards maximizing the communication efficiency, the associations with orbiting SATs and the trajectories of UAVs should be optimized, which is challenging due to the time-varying network topology and a huge number of possible control actions. To overcome the difficulty, we lift this problem to multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with a novel action dimensionality reduction technique. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed SAT-UAV integrated scheme achieves 1.99x higher end-to-end sum throughput compared to a benchmark scheme with fixed ground relays. While improving the throughput, our proposed scheme also aims to reduce the UAV control energy, yielding 2.25x higher energy efficiency than a baseline method only maximizing the throughput. Lastly, thanks to utilizing hybrid FSO/RF links, the proposed scheme achieves up to 62.56x higher peak throughput and 21.09x higher worst-case throughput than the cases utilizing either RF or FSO links, highlighting the importance of co-designing SAT-UAV associations, UAV trajectories, and hybrid FSO/RF links in beyond-5 G NTNs.

AB The rapid growth in Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology endeavors increased attention towards road safety in recent days. Particularly, a higher number of road accidents occurs when the AV tries to overtake or change the lane. To cut down the number of accidents and improve traffic reliability, the AV should be capable of making intelligent decisions and communicating those to other AVs. Therefore, in this paper, a Cooperative Collision avoidance scheme for AVs at Overtaking and Lane Changing maneuver (CCAV-OLC) is proposed. The Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) in the CCAV-OLC scheme, processes on the given number of expert demonstrations for automatically acquiring the reward function, and thereby imitating actual human driving strategy and decisions. However, the adaptability of IRL to a high-dimensional AV environment restricts the performance of the CCAV-OLC scheme. To overcome this, the IRL in CCAV-OLC leverages the Gaussian Process (GP) regression model (IRL-GP), which enables data-efficient Bayesian prediction even when the number of demonstrations is very low. After taking intelligent decisions in overtaking and lane changing maneuvers, the AVs cooperatively communicate and exchange the decisions with each other by 6th Generation Vehicle-to-Everything (6G-V2X) communications, which further improves the accuracy and lessens the time taken for making optimal decisions. The experimental results show that the AVs clone the expert's optimal driving strategy and avoid the collisions to a greater extent.

AB Accessing the world's oceans is essential for monitoring and sustainable management of the maritime domain. Difficulty in reaching remote locations has resulted in sparse coverage, undermining our capacity to deter illegal activities and gather data for physical and biological processes. Uncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) have existed for over two decades and offer the potential to overcome difficulties associated with monitoring and surveillance in remote regions. However, they are not yet an integral component of maritime infrastructure. We analyse 15 years of non-autonomous and semi-autonomous USV-related literature to determine the factors limiting technological diffusion into everyday maritime operations. We systematically categorised over 1,000 USV-related publications to determine how government, academia and industry sectors use USVs and what drives their uptake. We found a striking overlap between these sectors for 11 applications and nine drivers. Low cost was a consistent and central driver for USV uptake across the three sectors. Product 'compatibility' and lack of 'complexity' appear to be major factors limiting USV technological diffusion amongst early adopters. We found that the majority (21 of 27) of commercially available USVs lacked the complexity required for multiple applications in beyond the horizon operations. We argue that the best value for money to advance USV uptake is for designs that offer cross-disciplinary applications and the ability to operate in an unsheltered open ocean without an escort or mothership. The benefits from this technological advancement can excel under existing collaborative governance frameworks and are most significant for remote and developing maritime nations.

AB Recognizing traffic command gestures with high accuracy and quick response at a low computational cost is a requisite for driver assistance or autonomous driving. However, it has been understudied for a long time. Existing research takes advantage of increasing development in human action recognition but pays little attention to onboard conditions. In this article, we propose a simple but effective recognition model based on human upper-body geometric features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The handcrafted geometric features can easily be calculated with estimated 2-D human keypoints at a low computational cost but are discriminative and sufficient in classification. Offline and online inferences are implemented to comprehensively evaluate the proposed model. For the sake of robustness required in the automotive domain, dual voting is designed to filter the output in online inference. On the recently published Chinese traffic police gesture (CTPG) dataset, the presented approach is the best with a remarkable improvement of approximately 8% compared to previous LSTM-based methods with handcrafted spatial features and is competitive with advanced GCN-based deep learning methods. The tradeoff pattern is explored to demonstrate how accuracy and response time alter with different training and inference strategies so that a balanced setup can be manually chosen under various application scenarios. Field tests are also carried out with an experimental vehicle, and the results uncover the present gap between research and practical application to some extent, moving a step closer to real-life traffic command gesture recognition.

AB The sea-state estimation is a fundamental problem in the development of autonomous ships. Traditional methods such as wave buoy, satellites, and wave radars are limited by locations, clouds, and costs, respectively. Model-based methods are prone to incorrect estimations due to their high dependence on mathematical models of ships. As previous data-driven studies for sea-state estimation consider only wave height and use the motion data from dynamic positioning (DP) vessels, this article introduces a new, deep neural network (SSENET) to estimate sea state in light of both wave height and wave direction and extends the generality of sensor data from ship motion with forward speed. SSENET is built on the basis of stacked convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks with dense connections between different blocks, channel attention modules, and a feature attention module. The dense connections build short-cut paths between input and all subsequent convolutional blocks, which can make full use of all the hierarchical features from the original time-series sensor data. The channel attention modules aim to enhance the features extracted by each convolution block. The feature attention module focuses on combining the feature fusion of hierarchical features in an adaptive manner. Benchmark experiments show the competitive performance against the state-of-the-art approaches. Applying the SSENET on two data sets of a zigzag motion for comparative studies shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Mobility affords a range of benefits, but there are environmental, social and economic problems associated with current transport systems. Innovations to address these issues include novel technologies (e.g., electric and autonomous vehicles; EVs, AVs), and new business models and social practices (e.g., shared mobility). Yet, far more attention by policy-makers and researchers has been paid to the technical aspects of a low-carbon mobility transition than to social or psychological aspects, or the role of the user. In this paper, we integrate insights from the multi-level perspective on transitions and socio-psychological literature and draw on transport expert interview (N = 11) data, to examine (a) what influences current attitudes and behaviours in respect of EVs and AVs, and shared mobility, and (b) how this may change in the years to come. We argue that technological change may be most compatible with the transport regime (dominated by personal car-based mobility) but potentially affords a narrower range of sustainability benefits, while mobility substitution (e.g., reducing the need to travel through tele-working or -shopping) may be most challenging for both policy-makers and publics, while potentially addressing a wider range of sustainability problems associated with the transport regime. Shared mobility options sit somewhere in between and challenge certain aspects of the regime (e.g., status associated with car ownership) while offering certain environmental, social and economic benefits. For all three areas of innovation, policy interventions need to address the needs, preferences, experiences and identities of users if they are to be effective and sustainable.

AB This paper investigates capability and efficiency of utilizing the inverse dynamics in the virtual domain (IDVD) method to provide the real-time updates of feasible trajectory for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during underwater docking operations. The applicability of the IDVD method is examined for two scenarios. For the first scenario, referred to as an offline scenario, a nominal trajectory may be generated ahead of time based on a priori knowledge about the docking station (DS) pose (position and orientation). The second scenario, referred to as an online scenario, assumes some uncertainty in the DS pose; hence, the reference trajectory needs to be constantly recomputed in real time based on the updates about the DS pose. The offline scenario solution serves as a benchmark solution to check feasibility and optimality of generated trajectory subject to constraints on the states and controls. In particular, the offline solution can assist in making informed trade-off decisions between optimality of solution and computational efficiency. For the relatively simple offline scenario, the IDVD-method solution is compared with the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto pseudo-spectral (LGLPS) method solution. The software-in-the-loop simulations and Monte Carlo trials are run for robustness assessment. Finally, the potential for the IDVD method to work online, in a closed-loop guidance system, is explored using a realistic cluttered operational simulation environment. Simulation results show that the IDVD-method based guidance system guarantees a reliable and efficient docking process by generating computationally efficient, feasible and ready to be tracked trajectories.

AB Managing the dynamic regions in the photometric loss formulation has been a main issue for handling the self-supervised depth estimation problem. Most previous methods have alleviated this issue by removing the dynamic regions in the photometric loss formulation based on the masks estimated from another module, making it difficult to fully utilize the training images. In this letter, to handle this problem, we propose an isometric self-sample-based learning (ISSL) method to fully utilize the training images in a simple yet effective way. The proposed method provides additional supervision during training using self-generated images that comply with pure static scene assumption. Specifically, the isometric self-sample generator synthesizes self-samples for each training image by applying random rigid transformations on the estimated depth. Thus both the generated self-samples and the corresponding training image always follow the static scene relation. Our method can serve as a plug-and-play module for two existing models without any architectural modifications. It provides additional supervision during training phase only. Thus, there is no additional overhead on base model parameters and computation during inference phase. These properties fit well with models oriented to real-time applications. We show that plugging our ISSL module into two existing models consistently improves the performance by a large margin. In addition, it also boosts the depth accuracy over different types of scene, i.e., outdoor scenes (KITTI and Make3D) and indoor scene (NYUv2), validating its high effectiveness.

AB With the advent of self-driving vehicles, autonomous driving systems will have to rely on a vast number of heterogeneous sensors to perform dynamic perception of the surrounding environment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems increase the resolution of conventional mass-market radars by exploiting the vehicle's ego-motion, requiring very accurate knowledge of the trajectory, usually not compatible with automotive-grade navigation systems. In this setting, radar data are typically used to refine the navigation-based trajectory estimation with so-called autofocus algorithms. Although widely used in remote sensing applications, where the timeliness of the imaging is not an issue, autofocus in automotive scenarios calls for simple yet effective processing options to enable real-time environment imaging. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the autofocus requirements in typical automotive scenarios. We analytically derive the effects of navigation-induced trajectory estimation errors on SAR imaging, in terms of defocusing and wrong targets' localization. Then, we propose a motion estimation and compensation workflow tailored to automotive applications, leveraging a set of stationary Ground Control Points (GCPs) in the low-resolution radar images (before SAR focusing). We theoretically discuss the impact of the GCPs position and focusing height on SAR imaging, highlighting common pitfalls and possible countermeasures. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed technique employing experimental data gathered during open road campaign by a 77 GHz multiple-input multiple-output radar mounted in a forward-looking configuration.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) installed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has drawn increasing attention in the area of remote sensing due to its high spatial resolution and low energy consumption. However, due to the sensitivity toward atmospheric turbulences, strong motion errors can defocus the image in both azimuth and range directions. In this article, based on symmetric triangular linear frequency-modulation continuous microwave (STLFMCW) signals, a novel motion error estimation method is proposed. The core concept is to eliminate the effect of residual range cell migration (RCM) and investigate the motion parameters from azimuth phase history by range-frequency-domain interferometry between the up-ramp and down-ramp chirp sections. With preknowledge of the structural characteristics of the differential signal, we first obtain the high-order component, then estimate the quadratic term with an azimuth profile width minimization (APWM) algorithm on the basis of bisection search, and subsequently remove the linear part through phase gradient matching and joining. Consequently, the desired motion errors can be achieved purely based on raw data. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve high accuracy with or without standard prominent point targets. Experimental results on a W-band UAV SAR system in strip-map mode indicate that this approach also outperforms other existing postprocessing autofocus methods.

AB Due to the recent advancements in the manufacturing process of solar photovoltaics (PVs) and electronic converters, solar PVs has emerged as a viable investment option for energy trading. However, distribution system with large-scale integration of rooftop PVs, would be subjected to voltage upper limit violations, unless properly controlled. Most of the traditional solutions introduced to address this problem do not ensure fairness amongst the on-line energy sources. In addition, other schemes assume the presence of communication linkages between these energy sources. This paper proposes a control scheme to mitigate the over-voltages in the distribution system without any communication between the distributed energy sources. The proposed approach is based on artificial neural networks that can utilize two locally obtainable inputs, namely, the nodal voltage and node voltage sensitivity and control the PV power. The controller is trained using extensive data generated for various loading conditions to include daily load variations. The control scheme was implemented and tested on a 12.47 kV feeder with 85 households connected on the 220 V distribution system. The results demonstrate the fair control of all the rooftop solar PVs mounted on various houses to ensure the system voltage are maintained within the allowed limits as defined by the ANSI C84.1-2016 standard. Furthermore, to verify the robustness of the proposed PV controller, it is tested during cloudy weather condition and the impact of integration of electric vehicles on the proposed controller is also analyzed. The results prove the efficacy of the proposed controller.

AB Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) play an important role for providing the means to collect and exchange spatio-temporal data via V2X-based communication between vehicles and the infrastructure, which will become a central enabler for road safety of (semi)-autonomous vehicles. The Local Dynamic Map (LDM) is a key concept for integrating static and streamed data in a spatial context. The LDM has been semantically enhanced to allow for an elaborate domain model that is captured by a mobility ontology, and for queries over data streams that cater for semantic concepts and spatial relationships. Our approach for semantic enhancement is in the context of ontology-mediated query answering (OQA) and features conjunctive queries over DL-LiteA ontologies that support window operators over streams and spatial relations between spatial objects. In this paper, we show how this approach can be extended to address a wider range of use cases in the three C-ITS scenarios traffic statistics, traffic events detection, and advanced driving assistance systems. We define for the mentioned use cases requirements derived from necessary domain-specific features and report, based on them, on extensions of our query language and ontology model. The extensions include temporal relations, numeric predictions and trajectory predictions as well as optimization strategies such as caching. An experimental evaluation of queries that reflect the requirements has been conducted using the real-world traffic simulation tool PTV Vissim. It provides evidence for the feasibility/efficiency of our approach in the new scenarios.

AB Analysis of Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite images in combination with water column and seafloor investigations documented natural oil seepage from Pechori Mound and Colkheti Seep in 1000-1200 m water depth in the eastern Black Sea offshore Georgia. Hydroacoustic imaging of the water column using multibeam echosounder evidenced numerous gas emissions from both structures. Gas bubbles rose as high as 45 m below sea surface. It is proposed that oil coatings around gas bubbles hamper their dissolution allowing them to reach the sea surface where widespread oil slicks are formed. Slow rise velocities (14 +/- 1 cm s(-1)) of bubbles with radii of 2.6 +/- 0.3 mm (n = 101) derived from video data obtained with the remotely operated vehicle MARUM QUEST4000, corroborate the assumption that bubbles are oil-coated. High resolution seafloor mapping with the autonomous underwater vehicle MARUM SEAL5000 at Colkheti Seep revealed a crater-strewn morphology whose formation is explained by frequent rafting of shallow gas hydrate deposits. Satellite imaging of oil slicks on the sea surface above both sites indicates that oil seepage is rather persistent since 2003. An order-of-magnitude estimation of minimum oil seepage rates suggests discharge rates of similar to 40 liters per hour from both sites. The data presented are the first comprehensive description of oil seepage in the Black Sea. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many of the devices used in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications are energy-limited, and thus supplying energy while maintaining seamless connectivity for IoT devices is of considerable importance. In this context, we propose a simultaneous wireless power transfer and information transmission scheme for IoT devices with support from the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. In particular, in the first phase, IoT devices harvest energy from the UAV through wireless power transfer; and then in the second phase, the UAV collects data from the IoT devices through information transmission. To characterise the agility of the UAV, we consider two scenarios: a hovering UAV and a mobile UAV. Aiming at maximising the total network sum-rate, we jointly optimise the trajectory and the power allocation of the UAV, the energy harvesting scheduling of IoT devices, and the phase-shift matrix of the RIS. We formulate a Markov decision process and propose two deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the optimisation problem of maximising the total network sum-rate. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the UAV's flying path optimisation and the network's throughput of our proposed techniques compared with other benchmark schemes. Given the strict requirements of the RIS and UAV, the significant improvement in processing time and throughput performance demonstrates that our proposed scheme is well applicable for practical IoT applications.

AB This paper designs and implements a robust and Time-varying Constrained Model Predictive Controller (TCMPC) for the translational and attitude control of a real quadrotor. The proposed approach considers online optimization to find solutions through the hard and soft constraints. All the controller parameters were derived from the experimental test setup and took into consideration the various restrictions and physical constraints associated with the hand-made quadrotor. The proposed controller can possibly linearize and discretize the nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor at every sampling time if all constraints and physical restrictions are considered. The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using both a simulation study and a practical implementation. The simulation study considered a quadrotor hovering mode in the presence of wind gusts and encompassed a comparison analysis with a well-tuned Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, an Advanced Error model predictive control (AEMPC), and an Efficient MPC (EMPC) approach. For the real-time implementation, an online optimization algorithm was used and tested on the high clock processor ARM A53 on a new attitude test setup. The experimental results, showed that the proposed controller outperformed the unconstrained MPC, the well-tuned PID controller, and EMPC, especially in terms of rejecting the external wind disturbances. The proposed method real-time TCMPC) approach has the advantages of greater robustness and is not heavily dependent upon the accurate dynamics of the model.

AB Collision avoidance algorithms are essential for safe and efficient robot operation among pedestrians. This work proposes using deep reinforcement (RL) learning as a framework to model the complex interactions and cooperation with nearby, decision-making agents, such as pedestrians and other robots. Existing RL-based works assume homogeneity of agent properties, use specific motion models over short timescales, or lack a principled method to handle a large, possibly varying number of agents. Therefore, this work develops an algorithm that learns collision avoidance among a variety of heterogeneous, non-communicating, dynamic agents without assuming they follow any particular behavior rules. It extends our previous work by introducing a strategy using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) that enables the algorithm to use observations of an arbitrary number of other agents, instead of a small, fixed number of neighbors. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform a classical collision avoidance algorithm, another deep RL-based algorithm, and scales with the number of agents better (fewer collisions, shorter time to goal) than our previously published learning-based approach. Analysis of the LSTM provides insights into how observations of nearby agents affect the hidden state and quantifies the performance impact of various agent ordering heuristics. The learned policy generalizes to several applications beyond the training scenarios: formation control (arrangement into letters), demonstrations on a fleet of four multirotors and on a fully autonomous robotic vehicle capable of traveling at human walking speed among pedestrians.

AB Advancement of computing and communication techniques transforms the traditional transport system into the intelligent transportation system (ITS). The development of distributed computing in a vehicular network platform also called Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) promise to address most of the challenges faced by the ITS. Localization is important in these vehicular networks because of its key contribution in autonomous driving, smart traffic monitoring, and collision avoidance services. For localization, current GPS and hybrid methods are in-efficient because of GPS outage in urban infrastructure and dynamic nature of the vehicular networks. The cooperative localization approaches, on the other hand, use dedicated short range communication to broadcast messages and estimate location. However, these messages are un-encrypted and periodic which gives a privacy risk for vehicles. This article presents a privacy-preserving cooperative localization in vehicular network based upon dynamic pseudonym changing strategy. First, the localization delay is addressed with the implementation of dynamic vehicular edge assignment for computational task management. In the next step, the localization is estimated from the neighbor and road side unit ranging measurement followed by a real-time prediction of the vehicle. The performance of the proposed algorithms is analyzed in terms of localization accuracy and privacy preservation strength. Furthermore, the proposed method is simulated in a real city scenario followed by localization accuracy and privacy analysis. Finally, the localization accuracy and privacy strength of the proposed approach are compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

ID STRATEGY
AB Automatic optimization of robotic behavior has been the long-standing goal of Evolutionary Robotics. Allowing the problem at hand to be solved by automation often leads to novel approaches and new insights. A common problem encountered with this approach is that when this optimization occurs in a simulated environment, the optimized policies are subject to the reality gap when implemented in the real world. This often results in sub-optimal behavior, if it works at all. This paper investigates the automatic optimization of neurocontrollers to perform quick but safe landing maneuvers for a quadrotor micro air vehicle using the divergence of the optical flow field of a downward looking camera. The optimized policies showed that a piece-wise linear control scheme is more effective than the simple linear scheme commonly used, something not yet considered by human designers. Additionally, we show the utility in using abstraction on the input and output of the controller as a tool to improve the robustness of the optimized policies to the reality gap by testing our policies optimized in simulation on real world vehicles. We tested the neurocontrollers using two different methods to generate and process the visual input, one using a conventional CMOS camera and one a dynamic vision sensor, both of which perform significantly differently than the simulated sensor. The use of the abstracted input resulted in near seamless transfer to the real world with the controllers showing high robustness to a clear reality gap. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flexible single-link underwater manipulator (FSLUM) can be installed in autonomous underwater vehicles, it can carry out underwater tasks such as offshore oil and gas exploration, underwater cable maintenance as well as fishery farming and fishing. The design and development of the FSLUM are of great significance for ocean exploration and development. The FSLUM is affected by the underwater interference torque during underwater tasks in the flowing water environment, which will greatly affect the operational accuracy. In addition, many nonlinear factors such as the flexibility of the transmission system and the two-dimensional deformation of flexible links will aggravate the control difficulty of the FSLUM. An improved sliding mode control (SMC) strategy based on neural network identification is proposed to enhance the FSLUM's control accuracy. Neural networks are proposed to identify uncertain components including underwater interference and flexible nonlinear terms, so as to advance the control law design accuracy. Firstly, the FSLUM dynamic equations coupled with underwater interference torque considering multiple nonlinear factors are established according to the assumed mode method (AMM). A modified Morison equation is proposed to abbreviate the underwater interference torque in flowing water environments. Next, the control law of improved neural network sliding mode control (NNSMC) strategies are proposed according to the Lyapunov stability theorem, so as to ensure closed -loop stability of the FSLUM. Finally, the results of simulation and prototype tracking control experiments show that the improved NNSMC strategy has high tracking accuracy.

ID SELF-PROPULSION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric simulation is an efficient and time-saving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique when the body is axisymmetric, and the flow is along the length of the body. In the present paper, this technique is used to investigate turbulent flow around the bare hull configuration of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency submarine model. Verification and validation of the results are done at three levels. The values of the total resistance, the distribution of the wall shear stress and the pressure on the surface, and the velocity profiles at various distances from the nose are compared with results obtained by using three-dimensional (3D) simulations and experimental results from the literature. The uncertainty in CFD results due to meshing is reported using Richardson Extrapolation. It is shown that the errors are minor, and the savings in computer memory and computation time are tremendous using 2D axisymmetric simulations. Good CFD practices essential for 2D axisymmetric simulations are also presented in this article, which will be helpful for the CFD community to conduct numerical investigations on any other axisymmetric bare hull bodies, such as torpedoes, missiles, submarines, and autonomous underwater vehicles in the future. Finally, the components of drag, coefficient of pressure, and wall shear stress at the highest speed (9.26 m/s) are also obtained using 2D axisymmetric simulation, which has not been previously reported in any other literature. The level of rigor in the 2D axisymmetric simulation reported here is rarely seen in recent literature.

TI Points Registration for Roadside LiDAR Sensors

DT Article
ID CONNECTED VEHICLES; IMPROVEMENT
AB Roadside LiDAR deployment provides a solution to obtain the real-time high-resolution micro traffic data of unconnected road users for the connected-vehicle road network. Single roadside LiDAR sensor has a lot of limitations considering the scant coverage and the difficulty of handling object occlusion issue. Multiple roadside LiDAR sensors can provide a larger coverage and eliminate the object occlusion issue. To combine different LiDAR sensors, it is necessary to integrate the point clouds into the same coordinate system. The existing points registration methods serving mapping scans or autonomous sensing systems could not be directly used for roadside LiDAR sensors considering the different feature of point clouds and the spare points in the cost-effective roadside LiDAR sensors. This paper developed an approach for roadside LiDAR points registration. The developed points-aggregation-based partial iterative closest point algorithm (PA-PICP) is a semi-automatic points registration method, which contains two major parts: XY data registration and Z adjustment. A semi-automatic key point selection method was introduced. The partial iterative closest point was applied to minimize the difference between different LiDARs in the XY plane. The intersection of ground surface between different LiDARs was used for Z-axis adjustment. The performance of the developed procedure was evaluated with field-collected LiDAR data. The results showed the effectiveness and accuracy of data integration using PA-PICP was greatly improved compared with points registration using the traditional iterative closest point. The case studies also showed that the occlusion issue can be fixed after PA-PICP points registration.

AB Agricultural production has become a key factor for the stability of the world economy. The use of pesticides provides a more favorable environment for the crops in agricultural production. However, the uncontrolled and inappropriate use of pesticides affect the environment by polluting preserved areas and damaging ecosystems. In the precision agriculture literature, several authors have proposed solutions based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for developing spraying processes that are safer and more precise than the use of manned agricultural aircraft. However, the static configuration usually adopted in these proposals makes them inefficient in environments with changing weather conditions (e.g. sudden changes of wind speed and direction). To overcome this deficiency, this paper proposes a computer-based system that is able to autonomously adapt the UAV control rules, while keeping precise pesticide deposition on the target fields. Different versions of the proposal, with autonomously route adaptation metaheuristics based on Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing and Hill-Climbing for optimizing the intensity of route changes are evaluated in this study. Additionally, this study evaluates the use of a ground control station and an embedded hardware to run the route adaptation metaheuristics. Experimental results show that the proposed computer-based system approach with autonomous route change metaheuristics provides more precise changes in the UAV's flight route, with more accurate deposition of the pesticide and less environmental damage.

AB This paper describes a novel approach for vision-based passive navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) suitable for use in outdoor environments. The researchers chose a number of coordinate points on a flat earth model as waypoints. At each waypoint, a number of objects were chosen as landmarks which provided a unique polygonal constellation. Features of these landmarks and waypoints were computed in advance and stored in the database. A 6 degree of freedom kinematic model of a UAV flew from one waypoint to the next waypoint in a detailed simulation which included real aerial imagery. An image of the terrain was captured while approaching the waypoint. An illumination, scale, and rotation invariant algorithm was used to extract landmarks and waypoint features. These features were compared with those in the database. Position drift was computed at each waypoint and used to update the current position of the UAV prior to heading towards the next waypoint. The drift calculated by the vision-based algorithm was used to estimate the error caused primarily by wind and thus estimate the wind speed and direction. Experiments with both computer generated images and real images taken from the UAV flight trial have demonstrated the technique in the presence of wind and Gaussian noise. These results show accuracy of the drift computation algorithm and reliability of the feature matching algorithm under various environmental conditions. These algorithms were compared against other popular algorithms in the field and demonstrate higher performance. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Advanced propulsors are required to help unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) overcome major challenges associated with energy and autonomy. The fins of ray-finned fish provide an excellent model from which to develop propulsors that can create forces efficiently and drive a wide range of behaviors, from hover to low-speed maneuvers to high-speed travel. Although much is known about the mechanics of fins, little is known about the fin's sensorimotor systems or how fins are regulated in response to external disturbances. This information is crucial for implementing propulsive and control systems that exploit the same phenomena as the biological fins for efficiency, effectiveness, and autonomous regulation. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the in vivo response of the sunfish and its pectoral fins to vortex perturbations applied directly to the fish and to the fins. The fish and the fins responded actively to perturbations that disturbed the motion of the fish body. Surprisingly, perturbations that deformed the fins extensively did not cause a reaction from either the fins or the body. These results indicate that the response of the pectoral fins to large deformations is not reflexive and that fin motions are regulated when it is necessary to correct for disturbances to the motion of the fish. The results also demonstrate a benefit of compliance in propulsors, in that external perturbations can disturb the fins without having its impact be transferred to the fish body.

AB The cruising of ride-hailing vehicles generates negative externalities such as traffic congestion and vehicular emissions. These externalities can be mitigated by reducing cruising driving via operating book-ahead ride-hailing services, where the platform dispatches and routes drivers based on precise information on travelers' departure time and origin-destination (OD). However, the effects of factors influencing book-ahead ride-hailing trips have rarely been empirically examined with real data. Using six-month trip data from China, this study employs a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) method with hyperparameters optimized by the Bayesian optimization algorithm to examine the factors associated with book-ahead ride-hailing trips across OD pairs (hexagon cells-to-hexagon cells) at various spatial scales. The relative importance rankings generated from this study indicate that trip features, weather conditions, and accessibility to transportation hubs are significant determinants correlated with the usages of bookahead ride-hailing. The partial dependence plots demonstrate the nonlinear threshold effects of these determinants on the hourly number of book-ahead ride-hailing per OD pair. Moreover, this study compares the differences in associations between peak and non-peak hours as well as weekdays and weekends. The disparity in the nonlinear threshold effects between weekdays and weekends is only observable during the evening peak period and not at other times. These findings provide valuable insights into developing practical strategies for promoting book-ahead ride-hailing services.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB The reliability and safety of advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles are highly dependent on the accuracy of automotive sensors such as radar, lidar, and camera. However, these sensors can be misaligned compared to the initial installation state due to external shocks, and it can cause deterioration of their performance. In the case of the radar sensor, when the mounting angle is distorted and the sensor tilt toward the ground or sky, the sensing performance deteriorates significantly. Therefore, to guarantee stable detection performance of the sensors and driver safety, a method for determining the misalignment of these sensors is required. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the vertical tilt angle of the radar sensor using a deep neural network (DNN) classifier. Using the proposed method, the mounting state of the radar can be easily estimated without physically removing the bumper. First, to identify the characteristics of the received signal according to the radar misalignment states, radar data are obtained at various tilt angles and distances. Then, we extract range profiles from the received signals and design a DNN-based estimator using the profiles as input. The proposed angle estimator determines the tilt angle of the radar sensor regardless of the measured distance. The average estimation accuracy of the proposed DNN-based classifier is over 99.08%. Therefore, through the proposed method of indirectly determining the radar misalignment, maintenance of the vehicle radar sensor can be easily performed.

AB Purpose This paper aims to propose an environmentally adaptive trajectory planning system considering the dynamic characteristics of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the distance between obstacles and the UAV. The system generates a smooth and safe flight trajectory online. Design/methodology/approach First, the hybrid A* search method considering the dynamic characteristics of the quadrotor is used to find the collision-free initial trajectory. Then, environmentally adaptive velocity cost is designed for environment-adaptive trajectory optimization using environmental gradient data. The proposed method adaptively adjusts the autonomous flight speed of the UAV. Finally, the initial trajectory is applied to the multi-layered optimization framework to make it smooth and dynamically viable. Findings The feasibility of the designed system is validated by online flight experiments, which are in unknown, complex situations. Practical implications The proposed trajectory planning system is integrated into a vision-based quadrotor platform. It is easily implementable onboard and computationally efficient. Originality/value A hybrid A* path searching method is proposed to generate feasible motion primitives by dispersing the input space uniformly. The proposed method considers the control input of the UAV and the search time as the heuristic cost. Therefore, the proposed method can provide an initial path with the minimum flying time and energy loss that benefits trajectory optimization. The environmentally adaptive velocity cost is proposed to adaptively adjust the flight speed of the UAV using the distance between obstacles and the UAV. Furthermore, a multi-layered environmentally adaptive trajectory optimization framework is proposed to generate a smooth and safe trajectory.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) control information delivery is a critical communication with stringent requirements in terms of reliability and latency. In this context, link adaptation plays an essential role in the fulfillment of the required performance in terms of decode error probability and delay. Link adaptation is usually based on channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback information from the user equipment that should represent the current state of the channel. However, measurement, scheduling and processing delays introduce a CQI aging effect, that is a mismatch between the current channel state and its CQI representation. Using outdated CQI values may lead to the selection of a wrong modulation and coding scheme, with a detrimental effect on performance. This is particularly relevant in ultra reliable and low latency communications (URLLC), where the control of the reliability can be negatively impacted, and it is more evident when the channel is fast varying as the case of UAVs. This paper analyzes the effects of CQI aging on URLLCs, considering transmissions under the finite blocklength regime, that characterizes such communications type. A deep learning approach is investigated to predict the next CQI from the knowledge of past reports, and performance in terms of decode error probability and throughput is given. The results show the benefit of CQI proposed prediction mechanism also in comparison with previously proposed methods.

AB As a significant active safety technology towards fully autonomous driving, driver-automation co-piloting provides a new thinking for enhancing vehicle active safety and relieving driver's workload. However, the preview pattern divergence between driver and steering assistance system (SAS) may give rise to serious steering conflicts, which reduces driver's faith in SAS, cause him/her to turn off it, and even result in fatal traffic accidents. Focusing on mimicking the driver's steering behaviour, this paper proposes a human-like steering assistance scheme by adaptively varying the preview time and assistance gain of the SAS controller. Driver's preview behaviour of the road curvature is numerically identified using simulator tests along a multi-curves road, based on which a nominal preview-scheduled driver model is established. Based on the nominal driver model, a co-piloting system featuring human-like preview behaviour and a time-varying assistance penalty is proposed to formulate the steering torque-overlay dynamics of both agents in path-tracking. Next, a linear parameter varying (LPV)/H infinity controller satisfying pole placement is integrated to ensure the robustness and stability within the entire parameter space. This enables the steering assistance scheme to have a scheduled preview pattern like a human driver. Results of driving simulator experiment indicate that the proposed steering assistance scheme is able to mitigate driver-SAS conflicts and improve driver's path-tracking performance.

AB Simultaneous and collocated spatial measurements of turbulence, fine structure, and chlorophyll a fields were made from the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle T-REMUS as a part of the Layered Organization in the Coastal Ocean (LOCO) experiment. The T-REMUS was operated in a cycling 5 degrees yo-yo mode. Deployments were of 8 h duration and consisted of a series of across isobath legs, each of 2.5 km in extent. From the suite of sensors onboard the T-REMUS vehicle we are able to measure directly the turbulent eddy velocity, w(e) - root epsilon/N, and turbulent Reynolds number, Re(b) - (epsilon/nu N(2)), in the vicinity of a thin chlorophyll a layer. Using the turbulent eddy velocity, we develop criteria for when phytoplankton will behave as passive Lagrangian tracers. The turbulent Reynolds number is used as an indicator of turbulence strength, with the criterion of Re(b) 200 the boundary between weak and strong turbulence. We present data for the case of a spatially extensive thin layer being advected into the T-REMUS LOCO site. Using the above criterion, we observe that thin chlorophyll a layers can exist and be embedded as passive Lagrangian tracers in both weak and strong turbulent conditions. During a time period of weak turbulence Re(b) < 200 little diffusion occurs and the thin layer remains compact. Under strong turbulence Re(b) > 200 the thin layer weakens and diffuses as it is advected through the experimental site. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The traditional detection process of deformation or crack of crane main girder structure is tedious, inefficient and difficult to control safety risk. In this work, combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images with photogrammetry technology, an efficient and high-precision method for crane main girder defect detection and identification based on UAV 3D reconstruction is proposed. Firstly, the flight path, suitable for the chamfered rectangular section is selected, according to the structural characteristics of the main girder and the flight requirements of the UAV photography, and the calculation equation of flight strategy parameters is deduced. Secondly, based on 3D reconstruction methods and crucial techniques, the influence of image number, marker points and structure size effects on the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction model are investigated, separately, thus comprehensively verifying the accuracy of the 3D reconstructed model. Finally, the proposed method is tested and evaluated by the experiments for deformation detection of crane main girder structure and crack identification of scaled carton, obtaining millimeter-level accurate results, and the high precision deformation detection and crack identification using non-contact 3D reconstruction are realized. The results demonstrate that the combination of UAV and photogrammetry show potential in the deformation detection of crane main girder structure, it also has a prospect in accurately evaluating the geometry of cracks and helping structural engineers to assess the health status of structures.

AB With the development of Internet of things (IoT) technology and smart grid infrastructure, edge computing has become an effective solution to meet the delay requirements of the electric power IoT. Due to the limitation of battery capacity and data transmission mode of IoT terminals, the business collaboration computing must consider the energy consumption of the terminals. Since delay and energy consumption are the optimization goals of two co-directional changes, it is difficult to find a business collaboration computing mechanism that simultaneously minimizes delay and energy consumption. This paper takes the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection business scenario in the electric power IoT based on edge computing as the representative, and proposes a two-stage business collaboration computing mechanism including resources allocation and task allocation to optimize the business delay and energy consumption of UAV by decoupling the complex correlation between resource allocation and task allocation. A steepest descent resource allocation algorithm is proposed. On the basis of resource allocation, an improved multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition by dynamically adjusting the size of neighborhood and the cross distribution index is proposed as a task allocation algorithm to minimize energy consumption and business delay. Simulation results show that our algorithms can respectively reduce the business delay and energy consumption by more than 6.4% and 9.5% compared with other algorithms.

AB At present times, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular owing to the advantages such as scalable, versatile, autonomous, and inexpensive. The aerial image classification process has attracted more attention among the UAV-enabled surveillance system facilitating objective recognition, tracking process and considerably improving the visual surveillance results. This paper introduces effective deep learning-based aerial image classification using Inception with Residual Network v2 and multilayer perceptron (DLIRV2-MLP). The presented DLIRV2-MLP method includes a series of operations such as pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Primarily, the UAVs are used for the collection of aerial images by the use of imaging sensors exist in it. Followed by, the Inception with ResNet v2 based feature extractor is utilized to derive a useful set of feature vectors from the aerial image. Finally, the classification of aerial images using the derived feature vectors takes place by the use of MLP model. Here, the MLP classifier is used as the final layer of the Inception with ResNet v2 model in place of the softmax layer to improve the classification performance. The efficacy of the DLIRV2-MLP method is validated using a benchmark aerial image dataset and the resultant experimental values highlighted the effectiveness of the DLIRV2-MLP method with 90% and above in accuracy and precision. The problem of existing method faces some issues in computation whereas the aerial image classification with DLIRV2-MLP gives efficient computation while comparing with the existing method.

AB In nature, creatures such as birds, insects, and fish have excellent flight and mobility capabilities. The prominent flight performance of many creatures employing flapping wings has attracted researchers to study the aerodynamics of bionic flapping wings, which has potential application in designing micro air vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles. Bionic movements usually have to adapt to the low Reynolds number environment. It is noteworthy that the flow field of a flapping wing at low Reynolds numbers flow state is closely related to the complex non-linear shedding and viscous phenomenon, especially in a three-dimensional (3D) flapping wing. In order to observe the influence of the viscous phenomenon on flapping wing propulsive performance at low Reynolds numbers, the flow field characteristics of the 3D flapping wing under different Reynolds numbers are discussed using the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method with the Chinese supercomputer TianHe-II in this paper. The influence of kinematic parameters on the flow characteristics at low Reynolds number is particularly emphasized, considering that the biological movement involves many kinematic parameters, the unsteady flow field and vortex structure around the flapping wing are analyzed in detail. This study reports that the law of the flapping wing propulsive performance strongly depends on kinematic parameters that affect the vortex changes. The underlying flow mechanism behind flapping wing performance at low Reynolds numbers has been explored, which will make it possible to apply superior kinematic parameters to improve the propulsive performance of a flapping-like new airplane.

AB In metropolitan regions, the quick increase in vehicles has caused gridlock, pollutants, and problems in the transportation of products. IoT is a breakthrough advancing the development of intelligent management systems and automated processes throughout the universe. For automatic and intelligent cultures, this is a crucial contribution. Effective management and prevention of traffic congestion are reliable strategies that contribute to conserving numerous valuable resources. Autonomous vehicles and smart devices are equipped with an IoT-based ITM system of sensors that can understand, collect, and transfer information. Another method to enhance the transportation system is deep learning (DL). Traffic jams, delays, and a high death rate result from the numerous problems of conventional transportation management systems. An adaptive traffic management system (ATM) built on DL and IoT is designed and implemented in this study's efforts. The suggested system's architecture is built on the automobile, the framework, and the events. To account for all potential problems with the transportation system, the design uses a variety of situations. The proposed methodology uses a Quantum Optical Communication (QOC) system for Traffic monitoring and enhanced data communication. The suggested adaptive traffic management-based QOC model continuously modifies the timing of traffic signals based on traffic volume and anticipated movements from neighbouring junctions. By progressively allowing cars to cross green lights, it considerably reduces the duration of travel. It also reduces congestion in traffic by creating a smoother transition within 38 s, which is less than all other techniques.

AB This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI) aware radio resource management for a platooning system. Multiple autonomous platoons exploit the cellular wireless vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication technology to disseminate the cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) to their followers while ensuring timely delivery of safety-critical messages to the Road-Side Unit (RSU). To lower the computational load at the RSU and cope with the challenges of dynamic channel conditions, we exploit a distributed resource allocation framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where each platoon leader (PL) acts as an agent and interacts with the environment to learn its optimal policy. Motivated by the existing literature in RL, we propose two novel MARL frameworks based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), named Modified MADDPG, and Modified MADDPG with task decomposition. Both algorithms train two critics with the following goals: A global critic which estimates the global expected reward and motivates the agents toward a cooperating behavior and an exclusive local critic for each agent that estimates the local individual reward. Furthermore, based on the tasks each agent has to accomplish, in the second algorithm, the holistic individual reward of each agent is decomposed into multiple sub-reward functions where task-wise value functions are learned separately. Numerical results indicate our proposed algorithms' effectiveness compared with other contemporary RL frameworks, e.g., federated reinforcement learning (FRL) in terms of AoI performance and CAM message transmission probability.

AB Intelligent transportation systems have recently become a promising technology for future industry to provide safe, green, and automated driving. In this regard, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has proposed to utilize cellular communication to enable direct communication between vehicles with and without cellular infrastructure assistance. 3GPP has introduced the Sensing-Based Semi-Persistent Scheduling (S-SPS) technique when coverage of the cellular system is absent. S-SPS faces resource collision and performance degradation problems when channel load increases in the network. This paper suggests a decentralized congestion control and transmission power control mechanism (TPC-DCC) with an adaptive threshold for the received signal as a combination method to decrease channel load in the network. Furthermore, this work introduces a novel channel load adjustment. The new adjusting algorithm is based on a constant difference between the upper and lower boundaries of channel load at each level to handle channel overload and provide more flexibility using DCC mechanisms. The interactions of the proposed algorithm with S-SPS and the Extended-Estimation Reservation Resource Allocation (E-ERRA) algorithms that the authors previously proposed are investigated. The results indicate that system performance can be substantially improved when the transmission power and reception threshold are adaptively adjusted to the proposed channel load adjustment. The results of E-ERRA with the proposed channel load adjustment method show promising results compared to S-SPS.

AB With the development of the fifth-generation wireless network, autonomous moving platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used in modern smart cities. In some applications, the UAVs need to perform certain monitoring tasks within a specified time. However, due to the energy constraints of UAVs, such tasks require using multiple UAVs to monitor multiple points. To solve this practical problem, this paper proposes a multi-UAV path planning model with the energy constraint (MUPPEC). The MUPPEC considers the energy consumption of a UAV in different states, such as acceleration, cruising speed, deceleration, and hovering, and the main objective of the MUPPEC is to minimize the total monitoring time. Also, a hybrid discrete intelligence algorithm based on the grey wolf optimizer (HDGWO) is proposed to solve the MUPPEC. In the HDGWO, the discrete grey wolf update operators are implemented, and the integer coding and greedy algorithms are used to transform between the grey wolf space and discrete problem space. Furthermore, the central position operation and stagnation compensation grey wolf update operation are introduced to improve the global convergence ability, and a two-opt with azimuth is designed to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the HDGWO can solve the MUPPEC effectively, and compared to the traditional grey wolf optimizer(GWO), the discrete operators and the two-opt local search strategy with azimuth can effectively improve the optimization ability of the GWO.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and related technologies have played an active role in the prevention and control of novel coronaviruses at home and abroad, especially in epidemic prevention, surveillance, and elimination. However, the existing UAVs have a single function, limited processing capacity, and poor interaction. To overcome these shortcomings, we designed an intelligent anti-epidemic patrol detection and warning flight system, which integrates UAV autonomous navigation, deep learning, intelligent voice, and other technologies. Based on the convolution neural network and deep learning technology, the system possesses a crowd density detection method and a face mask detection method, which can detect the position of dense crowds. Intelligent voice alarm technology was used to achieve an intelligent alarm system for abnormal situations, such as crowd-gathering areas and people without masks, and to carry out intelligent dissemination of epidemic prevention policies, which provides a powerful technical means for epidemic prevention and delaying their spread. To verify the superiority and feasibility of the system, high-precision online analysis was carried out for the crowd in the inspection area, and pedestrians' faces were detected on the ground to identify whether they were wearing a mask. The experimental results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the crowd density detection was less than 8.4, and the mean average precision (mAP) of face mask detection was 61.42%. The system can provide convenient and accurate evaluation information for decision-makers and meets the requirements of real-time and accurate detection.

AB Technological innovations in sociotechnical transitions are usually found in market or spatial niches. These novel niches may sometimes emerge and expand, and eventually may erode an established sociotechnical system regime. In this paper, we redefined niche emergence as potentially consequent from the convergence of different regimes. That is, it is proposed that innovative niches may be grounded in established regimes but subsequently expand or bridge to previously distinct and separate other sociotechnical system regimes. However, the extension of overlapping regimes creates new forms of "external" competition for industrial participants inside each regime. This paper therefore proposes that regime-regime confluence may be observed in (1) the boundaries between regimes potentially being broken via emergent new niches; (2) pre-existing local networks being fragmented and reformed into exclusive and/or wider networks; and (3) competitive challenges and pressures arising both from inside and outside the traditional industry. These outcomes are illustrated in this paper with the case of automobility transitions arising from the combination of C (connected), A (autonomous), S (shared), and E (electric) cars. The paper presents an analysis of 340 instances of regime-regime boundary crossing examples over 10 years of data drawn from specialist industry journals and websites. The number and diversity of the validated results show that CASE vehicles are both a cause and consequence of automobile industry transition, and hence that regime-regime confluence is an important neglected source of innovation and structural change.

AB Recently, Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANET) have been proposed to empower 5G networks to support complex missions and provide ubiquitous connectivity to heterogeneous devices. However, it is needed to cope with the limited UAV capabilities (e.g., limited available energy to supply engines and computing elements, limited computing capabilities), as well as with the need to provide network and application services as foreseen in highly dynamic and time varying 5G ecosystems. This paper presents for the first time a comprehensive framework that integrates a FANET with a 5G network, with the aim of providing services that can be even chained with each other. This model is comprehensive in the sense that it takes into account physical constraints of the devices, as well as features and requirements of traffic flows. For this framework, the paper proposes a mathematical optimization model, allowing Virtual Function (VF) placement and chaining, aimed at minimizing energy consumption and service unsatisfaction probabilities of the FANET as a whole without employing heuristics for the solution of the problem. Two placement strategies named MLP and WMP are introduced and compared with the standard placement strategy named NoShP. An extensive numerical analysis shows that MLP and WMP allow us to well catch network dynamics and to reduce the number of virtual functions needed while decreasing the power consumption, so increasing UAV flight time and network lifetime.

AB The real-time monitoring and autonomous decision making through unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the potential applications of future networks. Vertical handover in future networks is a mechanism to switch communication between different network access technologies like Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Wireless Microwave Access (WiMAX), Third-Generation (3G), Fourth-Generation (4G), and Fifth-Generation (5G) mobile technologies. These technologies have significant importance in providing fast, reliable, and timely communication. However, during a vertical handover, an inadequate delay and packet loss can cause considerable disruption in maintaining communication sessions and results in intolerable end-to-end delay, disconnectivity, and poor packet delivery ratio. The proposed work addresses the vertical handover method in UAVs communication by designing a relay-based vertical handover technique. The relay UAVs is an assistant node, requiring an organized and intelligent deployment that assists in vertical handover and communication by minimizing the average packet loss and average delay from source to destination. Moreover, a multicriteria handover parameter triggering is used for seamless and more extended network coverage. Extensive simulations using S-shaped and U-shaped trajectories are designed and simulated for relay-based vertical handover performance evaluation. The results obtained show that our proposed relay-based handover method offers seamless connectivity and high-performance experienced during the vertical handover process. The extensive comparison with state-of-the-art techniques proves that the proposed method is better in terms of 18% handover success rate, 21% end-to-end delay, and 29% packet loss.

AB Automatic traffic sign recognition is essential for autonomous driving, assisted driving, and driver safety. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely used deep learning algorithm for traffic signs recognition. This research presents an effective technique for automatically recognizing traffic signs images. This technique mainly uses four GTSRB, GTSDB, BTSC, and TSRD standard traffic signs images datasets of different traffic sign images and provides the best result using our CNN model architecture. It helps to assists the driver in driving the motor vehicle safely. Drivers devote too much attention and effort to recognizing traffic signs by manually analyzing and recognizing their aspects. This study presents an automatic traffic sign recognition system to minimize motor vehicle accidents using representation to identify signs-this task utilizing a deep convolutional neural network. Here, our work presents a novel CNN architecture (.001) with Adam optimizer, batch size 128, and multi-interconnect layers to improve the performance of traffic signs detection. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieved more accuracy, results based on a complex network. Our model learns from the GTSDB dataset, which contains 43 traffic classes, and uses this information to predict the proper class of an anonymous traffic sign with 99.81% accuracy and minimum losses. Contradictory, the result is improved than the earlier study, which examined 98.20% accuracy that the approach can still detect traffic signs with extreme weather conditions and blur image conditions.

AB Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) robots can replace humans that work in hazardous environments to ensure worker safety. Thus, they have been widely developed and deployed. However, existing EOD robots have some limitations in environmental adaptation, such as a single function, slow action speed, and limited vision. To overcome these shortcomings and solve the uncertain problem of bomb disposal on the firing range, we have developed an intelligent bomb disposal system that integrates autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation, deep learning, and other technologies. For the hardware structure of the system, we design an actuator constructed by a winch device and a mechanical gripper to grasp the unexploded ordnance (UXO), which is equipped under the six-rotor UAV. The integrated dual-vision Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) pod is applied in the system to monitor and photograph the deployment site for dropping live munitions. For the software structure of the system, the ground station exploits the YOLOv5 algorithm to detect the grenade targets for real-time video and accurately locate the landing point of the grenade. The operator remotely controls the UAV to grasp, transfer, and destroy grenades. Experiments on explosives defusal are performed, and the results show that our system is feasible with high recognition accuracy and strong maneuverability. Compared with the traditional mode of explosives defusal, the system can provide decision-makers with accurate information on the location of the grenade and at the same time better mitigate the potential casualties in the explosive demolition process.

AB By means of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, we have investigated into the maximum vehicular flow rate of traffic processing bottlenecks. The evaluated analytical form of this flow rate is found to give quantitative insights into the underlying physics of collective vehicular motions constrained by these bottlenecks. Our analysis shows that for large-scale expansion, a new class of processing bottleneck known as the serial bottleneck is more efficient than the conventional parallel bottleneck in the absence of human driving behavior. When characteristics such as slow-to-start is considered in the model, the consequential delay due to human reaction time not only degrade the overall efficiency, it also diminishes the efficacy of serial processing such that a serial bottleneck is no longer tenable for traffic processing. These results point to the fundamental importance of optimizing traffic efficiency, which we illustrate by elucidating the detailed mechanisms with which vehicles interact collectively in the bottlenecks. In particular, we demonstrate that by constructing combinations of serial and parallel bottlenecks, optimal efficiencies are achieved via configurations with few (many) lanes of a large (small) number of serial units when the processing time is short (long). A direct implication of these results is that autonomous self-driving vehicles could serve to improve the transportation capacity for the densely populated urban cities of the future, due to the intrinsically more efficient collective vehicular motions through these bottlenecks.

AB Subsea navigation by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is a demanding task that involves the integration of inertial sensors, gyrocompasses, Doppler velocity loggers, and reference from acoustic beacons. In this paper, we propose to augment this information by providing an external measurement of heading change. We rely on the direction of sand ripples, which are abundant on the seabed near the shore and whose direction is, locally, constant. Thus, any apparent change in their directivity, as detected by the AUV, would reflect as a change in the vehicle's heading. Considering this, we developed a mechanism that detects regions of interest (ROIs) containing sand ripples within a synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) image, segments the ROI into highlight and shadow, and evaluates the angle difference between ROIs within two consecutive SAS images. For detection of sand ripples and estimation of angle difference, we employ two deep neural networks, while for segmentation we formulate a fuzzy-logic clustering. Taking advantage of a transfer learning approach, we trained the deep networks on simulated SAS images and on a large database of 2088 real SAS images, which we share for reproducibility. Results from real SAS images from three different sites show a good trade-off between precision and recall for sand-ripple detection, and an error of a few degrees in the heading change estimation, which well exceeds a geometrical-based benchmark. We also show performance from a real-time experiment for which we implemented our method on an AUV and estimated its heading change on-the-fly.

Specifically, it considers a successive interference cancellation-capable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that collects data from ground devices operating in an Internet of Things network. Its objective is to maximize the minimum flow rate to a terrestrial gateway over a fixed time horizon. It outlines a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to optimize in each time slot: the routing from the UAV to the gateway, the set of links from ground devices to the UAV, and the flow rate over links. It also proposes a novel algorithm, called iterative flow and path reservation (IFPR), for use by the UAV to select paths. Further, IFPR uses two methods to schedule communications between ground devices and the UAV. The first method, called simplified MILP (SMILP), aims to maximize the sum rate from ground devices. The second method, called less data schedule first, prioritizes ground devices that have uploaded the least amount of data to the gateway. Numerical results show satellite links help the UAV collects 61% more data from ground devices. Moreover, as compared to the MILP, IFPR collects 23% less data. Further, for both MILP and IFPR, their Jain's fairness index reaches around one when the number of time slots is sufficiently large. Finally, when IFPR uses SMILP, the gateway collects more data but at the expense of fairness.

AB Air pollution is one of the greatest risks for the health of people. In recent years, platforms based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for the monitoring of pollution in the air have been studied to deal with this problem, due to several advantages, such as low-costs, security, multitask and ease of deployment. However, due to the limitations in the flying time of the UAVs, these platforms could perform monitoring tasks poorly if the mission is not executed with an adequate strategy and algorithm. Their application can be improved if the UAVs have the ability to perform autonomous monitoring of the areas with a high concentration of the pollutant, or even to locate the pollutant source. This work proposes an algorithm to locate an air pollutant's source by using a UAV. The algorithm has two components: (i) a metaheuristic technique is used to trace the increasing gradient of the pollutant concentration, and (ii) a probabilistic component complements the method by concentrating the search in the most promising areas in the targeted environment. The metaheuristic technique has been selected from a simulation-based comparative analysis between some classical techniques. The probabilistic component uses the Bayesian methodology to build and update a probability map of the pollutant source location, with each new sensor information available, while the UAV navigates in the environment. The proposed solution was tested experimentally with a real quadrotor navigating in a virtual polluted environment. The results show the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm.

AB The stationary average consensus problem is studied for high-order multi-agent systems (MASs) under balanced directed networks. The objective is to bring the positions of agents to the average of their initial positions while allowing all the remaining states (e.g., velocity, acceleration, and higher-order states) to converge to zero. To this end, the authors propose two consensus protocols for high-order MASs in two cases: (i) state-feedback control, which assumes that each agent has access to its own states as well as the relative positions of its neighbours; and (ii) output-feedback control, where each agent measures only its own position and the relative positions of its neighbours. Two case studies are given to illustrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed protocols. In the first case study, a state-feedback controller is designed for consensus-based formation control of a team of vertical take-off and landing aircraft. In the second case study, an output-feedback consensus protocol is designed for a third-order MAS and compare it with a recent technique from the literature.

AB The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for collecting data from remotely located sensor systems is emerging. The data can be time-sensitive and require to be transmitted to a data processing center. However, planning the trajectory for a swarm of UAVs depends on multi-fold constraints, such as data collection requirements, UAV maneuvering capacities, and budget limitations. Since a UAV may fail or be compromised, it is important to provide necessary resilience to such contingencies, thus ensuring data security. It is important to provide the UAVs with efficient spatio-temporal trajectories so that they can efficiently cover necessary data sources. In this work, we present Synth4UAV, a formal approach for automated synthesis of efficient trajectories for a UAV swarm by logically modeling the aerial space and data point topology, UAV moves, and associated constraints in terms of the turning and climbing angle, fuel usage, data collection point coverage, data freshness, and resiliency properties. We use efficient, logical formulas to encode and solve the complex model. The solution to the model provides the routing and maneuvering plan for each UAV, including the time to visit the points on the paths and corresponding fuel usage such that the necessary data points are visited while satisfying the resiliency requirements. We evaluate the proposed trajectory synthesizer, and the results show that the relationship among different parameters follows the requirements while the tool scales well with the problem size.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a disruptive technology that has a great impact on people's lifestyle and activities. Fully autonomous vehicles are the next generation of connected cars. However, IoV systems suffer from several security threats that could offset the intended advantages. To address the security and privacy issues, several cryptographic and non-cryptographic security solutions should be adopted. However, traditional security solutions might burden the IoV network with further complexity and computational overhead. This would translate into additional performance issues in a network already suffering from big data and large-scale challenges. In this context, lightweight security solutions are needed to reduce the required resources in terms of computations, power and memory, and to optimize the network performance in terms of latency and bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight cipher scheme, LoRCA, with dynamic key-dependent structure to provide data confidentiality with minimum resources' requirements. To validate our solution's robustness and efficiency within the IoV context, several performance and security tests were performed. The results show that the proposed solution strikes a good balance between the security level and performance. The proposed LoRCA ciphers achieve a high throughput with an enhancement of at least 100% improvement as compared to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), 358% compared to Simon, 388% improvement for Speck and 24% improvement compared to our previous one round cipher scheme.

AB Due to distortion, limitations of vision, and occlusion, most of the existing vacant parking slot detection methods with a standalone around view monitor (AVM) are prone to miss some parking slots and incorrectly identify whether the parking slot is vacant. To overcome this problem, we propose a complete method for vacant parking slot detection and tracking during driving and parking. Considering the different conditions of driving and parking, two different deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are used to detect parking slots, of which the vacant parking slot detection network (VPS-Net) is used to detect vacant parking slots during driving, and the directional marking point detection network (DMPR-PS) is used to detect the directional marking points of the target parking slot during parking. Furthermore, in the driving process, we design a new matching rule and tracking management rule based on the Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to track the parking slots, and fuse classification results of multiple frames to determine the occupancy status. In the parking process, since the parking slot is easily blocked by the vehicle, we design another new tracker to track the directional marking points and infer the complete parking slot using tracking results and prior geometric information. To evaluate the proposed method, a labeled video sequence dataset is established. Experiments show that the proposed method has improved the accuracy and continuity of vacant parking slots detection and positioning whether in the driving process or parking process.

AB Crustal deformation of the seafloor is difficult to observe solely using global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The GNSS-acoustic (GNSS-A) technique was developed to observe seafloor crustal deformation, and it has produced a steady series of successful observations with remarkable results related to crustal deformation associated with huge earthquakes around the Japanese Islands. However, utilizing GNSS-A incurs very large financial and human costs as it requires the use of a research vessel as a surface platform and has a limited observation frequency, which is less than once a year at seafloor stations along the Japan Trench. To conduct frequent observations, an automatic GNSS-A data acquisition system was developed that operates via an unmanned surface vehicle (wave glider). The first observations using this system were performed at a seafloor station off Aomori Prefecture in July 2019. The wave glider was equipped with two GNSS antennas, an acoustic transducer, a microelectromechanical system gyroscope, and associated control and logging units. Data acquisition and autonomous activation of the seafloor stations were successfully executed by controlling the power supply to the payload via satellite communication with the wave glider. The glider rarely strayed off the configured course and the solar panels generated sufficient power to perform the observations although the weather was mostly cloudy. The GNSS-A data processing results show that the position of the station was determined with the same accuracy and precision as in previous observations performed using a research vessel.

AB Localization is a critical issue for many location-based applications in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). Nevertheless, the asynchronous time clock, stratification effect, and mobility properties of the underwater environment make it much more challenging to solve the localization issue. This article is concerned with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided localization issue for IoUT. We first provide a hybrid network architecture that includes surface buoys, AUVs, and active and passive sensor nodes. On the basis of this architecture, an asynchronous localization protocol is designed, through which the localization problem is provided to minimize the sum of all measurement errors. In order to make this problem tractable, a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based localization algorithm is developed to estimate the locations of AUVs, and active and passive sensor nodes, where an online value iteration procedure is performed to seek the optimization locations. It is worth mentioning that the proposed localization algorithm adopts two neural networks to approximate the increment policy and value function, and more importantly, it is much preferable for the nonsmooth and nonconvex underwater localization problem due to its insensitivity to the local optimal. Performance analyses for the RL-based localization algorithm are also provided.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the automotive industry allows car manufacturers to produce intelligent and autonomous vehicles through the integration of AI-powered Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and/or Automated Driving Systems (ADS) such as the Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) system. Existing TSR solutions focus on some categories of signs they recognise. For this reason, a TSR approach encompassing more road sign categories like Warning, Regulatory, Obligatory, and Priority signs is proposed to build an intelligent and real-time system able to analyse, detect, and classify traffic signs into their correct categories. The proposed approach is based on an overview of different Traffic Sign Detection (TSD) and Traffic Sign Classification (TSC) methods, aiming to choose the best ones in terms of accuracy and processing time. Hence, the proposed methodology combines the Haar cascade technique with a deep CNN model classifier. The developed TSC model is trained on the GTSRB dataset and then tested on various categories of road signs. The achieved testing accuracy rate reaches 98.56%. In order to improve the classification performance, we propose a new attention-based deep convolutional neural network. The achieved results are better than those existing in other traffic sign classification studies since the obtained testing accuracy and F1-measure rates achieve, respectively, 99.91% and 99%. The developed TSR system is evaluated and validated on a Raspberry Pi 4 board. Experimental results confirm the reliable performance of the suggested approach.

AB Using highly maneuverable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to collect data is a fast and efficient method that is widely studied. In most studies, they assume that the UAVs can obtain the location of the Cluster Head (CH) before take-off, allocate CHs, and optimize the trajectory in advance. However, in many real scenarios, many sensing devices are deployed in areas with no basic communication infrastructure or cannot communicate with the Internet due to emergencies such as disasters. In this kind of sensing network, the surviving devices often change, and the CHs cannot be known and allocated in advance, thus bringing new challenges to the efficient data collection of the networks by using UAVs. In this paper, a UAV path planning scheme for IoT networks based on reinforcement learning is proposed. It plans hover points for UAV by learning the historical location of CHs and maximizes the probability of meeting CHs and plans the shortest UAV path to visit all hover points by using the simulated annealing method. In addition, an algorithm to search for the location of CHs is proposed which is named Cluster-head Searching Algorithm with Autonomous Exploration Pattern (CHSA-AEP). By using CHSA-AEP, our scheme enables the UAV to respond to the position change of the CHs. Finally, we compare our scheme with other algorithms (area coverage algorithms and random algorithm). It is found that our proposed scheme is superior to other methods in energy efficiency and time utilization ratio.

AB The next generation of wireless communications networks, namely 6G, will be aimed at realizing a fully connected world, and at providing ubiquitous connectivity to people and objects even in remote areas that are very far from the structured Internet core network. These goals include the definition and the design of intelligent communications environments mainly characterized by pervasive artificial intelligence and large-scale automation. The target of this paper is the design of a management framework for edge networks realized with Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANET) consisting of a set of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide a remote geographic area with computing and networking facilities for delay-sensitive applications. To this purpose, each UAV is equipped with a Computing Element (CE) to process jobs received through vertical offloading from ground devices. In addition, horizontal offload among UAVs of the FANET is introduced for load balancing purposes, to guarantee that the FANET computation delay for each received job is minimized and is almost independent of the activity state of the area covered by the UAV receiving that job. The proposed FANET management framework is based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to allow zero-touch adaptation to the time-variant activity state of the area covered by each UAV. Numerical results demonstrate the power of the proposed framework and the enhancements achieved with respect to the current literature.

AB This paper proposes a novel three-dimensional (3D) mixed-bouncing based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) channel model with space-time-frequency (S-T-F) non-stationarity for sixth generation (6G) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless communication systems. In the proposed mixed-bouncing based model, the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission, single-bouncing transmission, and multi-bouncing transmission are simultaneously modeled. A new parameter, i.e., cluster density index, is defined and developed. The influence of communication scenarios, frequency, UAV's height, and distance between transceivers on cluster density index is also analyzed. To capture the S-T-F non-stationarity, a mixed-bouncing based S-T-F non-stationary algorithm is developed based on the birth-death (BD) process and frequency-dependent factor for the first time. In the developed algorithm, the non-stationarity is captured from the perspectives of both single-clusters and twin-clusters. Meanwhile, the impact of UAV-related parameters, such as the UAV's height and 3D moving velocity, on the non-stationary modeling is considered. Based on the simulation results, the impact of cluster density index on the important channel statistical properties, such as S-T-F correlation function (STF-CF) and Doppler power spectral density (PSD), is explored. Finally, the simulation results match well with the measurement and ray-tracing (RT)-based results, validating the accuracy of the proposed model.

   sparsely sampled two-dimensional surface with high levels of variance,

SO MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE velocity; correlation velocity log; peak estimation; autonomous

AB A correlation velocity log (CVL) is an acoustic navigation aid that estimates the velocity of a maritime vehicle using a transmitter and a receiving array. The CVL discussed here operates by calculating the correlation coefficient between the echoes from a pair of consecutive acoustic pulses transmitted towards the seafloor, across all combinations of receiver pairings in the array. A correlation surface is constructed by plotting the correlation coefficients versus the spatial separation vector of all the receiver pairings. The coordinates of the peak of this surface provide an estimate of the velocity vector of the vessel. However, the correlation coefficient surface exhibits high variance within a modest distance from the peak position, and individual datasets tend to be asymmetric about the peak position. Since each dataset consists of a sparsely sampled set of discrete measurements, the variance makes the task of peak estimation very challenging. This paper outlines the operating principles of CVLs and describes peak-finding techniques that are used to improve the accuracy and precision of the instrument. Three peak estimation techniques are considered, namely the highest point, and fitting of an axisymmetric quadratic model using either least squares or a nonlinear implementation of maximum likelihood estimation. It is shown that the maximum likelihood approach offers some advantages when the peak is controlled to lie near the centre of the receiver array, but the advantages are small compared to the additional computational load required.

AB Flight-by-feel is an emerging approach to flight control that uses distributed arrays of pressure, strain, and flow sensors to guide aircraft. Among these, hair-type flow sensors have received the least attention yet hold some advantages over conventional sensors. This paper reviews hair-like flow microsensors developed since 2013, focusing on developments in design, construction, and application. Hair-like flow sensors can be found in artificial cochleae, submersible navigation, terrestrial robots, and, rarely but increasingly, on aircraft. In this survey, we categorize hair-like flow sensors into three types (long whisker-like hairs, ultrasensitive microscale hairs, and short trichoid-like hairs), and primarily cover sensors that may be suitable for use on aircraft. The recent progress in flow-based flight control using distributed sensing is also discussed, along with the optimization of sensor placement and the potential for flight-by-feel in sixth-generation military and civilian aircraft designs. This survey aims to provide a consolidated account of the history and state-of-the-art of artificial hair-cell flow sensors, motivate consideration of flight-by-feel as a viable flight control paradigm, and define avenues for future research. As engineering and biological science continue to converge, we hope that researchers in both fields find this survey an inspirational and useful resource.

AB in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) tech-nology and the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) network will dawn a new era for vehicular services with enhanced communication capabilities. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are ex-pected to deliver a new transportation experience, increasing the safety and efficiency of road networks. The use of millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies guarantees a huge amount of bandwidth (>1 GHz) and a high data rate (>10 Gbit/s), which are required for CAVs applications. However, high frequency is impaired by severe path loss, and line of sight (LoS) propagation can be easily blocked by static and dynamic obstacles. Several solutions are being investigated, and the most promising one exploits relays. However, traditional relay schemes react to link failure and leverage instanta-neous information, which impedes efficient relay selection in highly mobile and complex networks, such as vehicular scenarios. In this context, we propose a novel proactive relaying strategy that exploits the cooperation between CAVs and environment information to predict the dynamic LoS-map, which describes the links' evolu-tion in time. The proactive relaying schemes exploit the dynamic LoS-map to maximize the network connectivity. A novel framework integrating realistic mobility patterns and geometric channel prop-agation models is proposed to analyze the performance in different scenarios. Numerical simulations suggest that a novel proactive relaying strategy that exploits the cooperation between CAVs and environment information to predict the dynamic LoS-map, which describes the links' evolution in time.

AB Most previous progress in object tracking is realized in daytime scenes with favorable illumination. State-of-the-arts can hardly carry on their superiority at night so far, thereby considerably blocking the broadening of visual tracking-related unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. To realize reliable UAV tracking at night, a spatial-channel Transformer-based low-light enhancer (namely SCT), which is trained in a novel task-inspired manner, is proposed and plugged prior to tracking approaches. To achieve semantic-level low-light enhancement targeting the high-level task, the novel spatial-channel attention module is proposed to model global information while preserving local context. In the enhancement process, SCT denoises and illuminates nighttime images simultaneously through a robust non-linear curve projection. Moreover, to provide a comprehensive evaluation, we construct a challenging nighttime tracking benchmark, namely DarkTrack2021, which contains 110 challenging sequences with over 100 K frames in total. Evaluations on both the public UAVDark135 benchmark and the newly constructed DarkTrack2021 benchmark show that the task-inspired design enables SCT with significant performance gains for nighttime UAV tracking compared with other top-ranked low-light enhancers. Real-world tests on a typical UAV platform further verify the practicability of the proposed approach. The DarkTrack2021 benchmark and the code of the proposed approach are publicly available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/SCT.

AB We developed an automatic measurement system for flow velocity and direction in natural rivers using an autonomously controlled unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Oncoming mainstream velocity was measured by the propulsion force required for the USV in order to preserve the position at a measurement point. To conduct such a field mission, the system runs by changing four characteristic control stages: 1) calculation of the tentative propulsion force, 2) navigation to the target point, 3) velocity measurement by staying at the target, and 4) detection of flow direction by flowing downstream. More than 20 indoor tests were conducted under several hydraulic conditions by varying streamwise velocity, and the calibration formula was obtained by interrelating the oncoming velocity magnitude with the propulsion force required to remain at the target. The attitude control was provided with side thrusters to improve the yaw stability of the USV in the oncoming current. The adjunctive work of the side thrusters was very effective. Field tests were conducted to examine the reliability and accuracy of the present automatic flow measurements in a river. Both local velocity and direction in the river flow were measured well by the USV. Error analysis was conducted by comparing with the existing velocimetry results, and the USV was found to possess a sufficient ability to meet practical performance for the flow measurement in a calm river with about 1 m/s velocity.

AB The development of autonomous vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles has led to a current research focus on improving the environmental perception of automation equipment. The unmanned platform detects its surroundings and then makes a decision based on environmental information. The major challenge of environmental perception is to detect and classify objects precisely; thus, it is necessary to perform fusion of different heterogeneous data to achieve complementary advantages. In this paper, a robust object detection and classification algorithm based on millimeter-wave (MMW) radar and camera fusion is proposed. The corresponding regions of interest (ROIs) are accurately calculated from the approximate position of the target detected by radar and cameras. A joint classification network is used to extract micro-Doppler features from the time-frequency spectrum and texture features from images in the ROIs. A fusion dataset between radar and camera is established using a fusion data acquisition platform and includes intersections, highways, roads, and playgrounds in schools during the day and at night. The traditional radar signal algorithm, the Faster R-CNN model and our proposed fusion network model, called RCF-Faster R-CNN, are evaluated in this dataset. The experimental results indicate that the mAP(mean Average Precision) of our network is up to 89.42% more accurate than the traditional radar signal algorithm and up to 32.76% higher than Faster R-CNN, especially in the environment of low light and strong electromagnetic clutter.

AB Digital technologies are transforming the automotive industry and disrupting traditional business models. New business opportunities related to Industry 4.0 are emerging, so companies must adapt to the new environment.
   The study presents an application of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze the future impact of digital transformation on business performance models and the different actors' satisfaction. A wide range of aspects and actors derived from the digital transformation process in the automotive industry are considered.
   The study covers connected and autonomous driving, mobility as a service, digital information sources in car purchasing, big data, etc. The disruptive effect of the gradual introduction of electric vehicles into the market is also considered, which is boosted by environmental policies on climate change and directives for the potential use of renewable energy sources to power electric vehicles.
   On the other hand, the study analyses the impacts of digital transformation on the automotive industry from the point of view of different actors, ranging from automobile manufacturers, service providers, public transportation providers, and consumers to governments.
   The methodology has been successfully applied to a complex case study-based empirical analysis. It presents a novel application of fsQCA to digital transformation in the automotive industry in Spain.
   The conclusions show that it is necessary to invest in adequate measures for adaptation to digital transformation, and manufacturers will end up having greater profits, productivity, and competitiveness. From the point of view of consumers, there will be access to more and better services and greater satisfaction with the required services.

AB GNSS positioning accuracy can be degraded in areas where the surrounding object geometry and morphology interacts with the GNSS signals. Specifically, urban environments pose challenges to precise GNSS positioning because of signal interference or interruptions. Also, non-GNSS surveying methods, including total stations and laser scanners, involve time consuming practices in the field and costly equipment. The present study proposes the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for autonomous rapid mapping that resolves the problem of localization for the drone itself by acquiring location information of characteristic points on the ground in a local coordinate system using simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and vision algorithms. A common UAV equipped with a camera and at least a single known point, are enough to produce a local map of the scene and to estimate the relative coordinates of pre-defined ground points along with an additional arbitrary point cloud. The resulting point cloud is readily measurable for extracting and interpreting geometric information from the area of interest. Under two novel optimization procedures performing line and plane alignment of the UAV-camera-measured point geometries, a set of experiments determines that the localization of a visual point in distances reaching 15 m from the origin, delivered a level of accuracy under 50 cm. Thus, a simple UAV with an optical sensor and a visual marker, prove quite promising and cost-effective for rapid mapping and point localization in an unknown environment.

AB The foraging behaviour of bacteria in colonies exhibits motility patterns that are simple and reasoned by stimuli. Notwithstanding its simplicity, bacteria behaviour demonstrates a level of intelligence that can feasibly inspire the creation of solutions to address numerous optimisation problems. One such challenge is the optimal allocation of tasks across multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) to perform cooperative tasks for future autonomous systems. In light of this, this paper proposes a bacteria-inspired heuristic for the efficient distribution of tasks amongst deployed UAVs. The usage of multi-UAVs is a promising concept to combat the spread of the red palm weevil (RPW) in palm plantations. For that purpose, the proposed bacteria-inspired heuristic was utilised to resolve the multi-UAV task allocation problem when combating RPW infestation. The performance of the proposed algorithm was benchmarked in simulated detect-and-treat missions against three long-standing multi-UAV task allocation strategies, namely opportunistic task allocation, auction-based scheme, and the max-sum algorithm, and a recently introduced locust-inspired algorithm for the allocation of multi-UAVs. The experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed algorithm, as it substantially improved the net throughput and maintained a steady runtime performance under different scales of fleet sizes and number of infestations, thereby expressing the high flexibility, scalability, and sustainability of the proposed bacteria-inspired approach.

AB Real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals is widely used, e.g., for surveying, agriculture, and potentially for autonomous vehicles and unmanned air vehicles in the future. In this paper, an extended RTK positioning for significant height differences between two low-cost GNSS receivers with patch antennas is presented. In this case, the classical model for double difference measurements needs to be extended, i.e., a differential tropospheric zenith delay and pseudorange multipath errors need to be estimated besides the baseline and carrier phase integer ambiguities. The increased number of unknowns results in an ill-conditioned system of observation equations and a substantial correlation between the state estimates. We introduce prior information on the differential tropospheric zenith delay based on the differential air pressure and exploit the temporal correlation of pseudorange multipath errors. Moreover, a criterion for the integer ambiguity candidate vector selection is provided, which is robust over phase multipath and unavoidable errors in the float ambiguity covariance matrix. The proposed method is validated with two low-cost GNSS modules that were placed at the Zugspitzplatt (2601 m a.s.l.) and Eibsee (1018 m a.s.l.). The obtained estimates for the baseline and differential tropospheric zenith delay show a high repeatability over several independent ambiguity fixings. The residuals of the fixed carrier phase measurements are within 2 cm for almost all satellites, which confirms both the measurement model and the ambiguity fixing.

ID MODEL
AB Predicting future trajectories of pairwise traffic agents in highly interactive scenarios, such as cut-in, yielding, and merging, is challenging for autonomous driving. The existing works either treat such a problem as a marginal prediction task or perform single-axis factorized joint prediction, where the former strategy produces individual predictions without considering future interaction, while the latter strategy conducts conditional trajectory-oriented prediction via agentwise interaction or achieves conditional rollout-oriented prediction via timewise interaction. In this article, we propose a novel double-axis factorized joint prediction pipeline, namely, conditional goal-oriented trajectory prediction (CGTP) framework, which models future interaction both along the agent and time axes to achieve goal and trajectory interactive prediction. First, a goals-of-interest network (GoINet) is designed to extract fine-grained features of goal candidates via hierarchical vectorized representation. Furthermore, we propose a conditional goal prediction network (CGPNet) to produce multimodal goal pairs in an agentwise conditional manner, along with a newly designed goal interactive loss to better learn the joint distribution of the intermediate interpretable modes. Explicitly guided by the goal-pair predictions, we propose a goal-oriented trajectory rollout network (GTRNet) to predict scene-compliant trajectory pairs via timewise interactive rollouts. Extensive experimental results confirm that the proposed CGTP outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction models on the Waymo open motion dataset (WOMD), Argoverse motion forecasting dataset, and In-house cut-in dataset.

TI Multi-Branch Dilation Convolution CenterNet for Object Detection of

AB Object detection occupies a very important position in the fishing operation and autonomous navigation of underwater vehicles. At present, most deep-learning object detection approaches, such as R-CNN, SPPNet, R-FCN, etc., have two stages and are based on anchors. However, the previous methods generally have the problems of weak generalization ability and not high enough computational efficiency due to the generation of anchors. As a well-known one-stage anchor-free method, CenterNet can accelerate the inference speed by omitting the step of generating anchors, whereas it is difficult to extract sufficient global information because of the residual structure at the bottom layer, which leads to low detection precision for the overlapping targets. Dilation convolution makes the kernel obtain a larger reception field and access more information. Multi-branch structure can not only preserve the whole area information, but also efficiently separate foreground and background. By combining the dilation convolution and multi-branch structure, multi-branch dilation convolution is proposed and applied to the Hourglass backbone network in CenterNet, then an improved CenterNet named multi-branch dilation convolution CenterNet (MDC-CenterNet) is built, which has a stronger ability of object detection. The proposed method is successfully utilized for detection of underwater organisms including holothurian, scallop, echinus and starfish, and the comparison result shows that it outperforms the original CenterNet and the classical object detection network. Moreover, with the MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, a number of comparative experiments are performed for showing the advancement of our method compared to other best methods.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications and networks are promising technologies in the forthcoming 5G/6G wireless communications. However, they have challenges for realizing secure communications. In this paper, we consider to construct a virtual antenna array consists UAV elements and use collaborative beamforming (CB) to achieve the UAV secure communications with different base stations (BSs), subject to the known and unknown eavesdroppers on the ground. To achieve a better secure performance, the UAV elements can fly to optimal positions with optimal excitation current weights for performing CB transmissions. However, this leads to extra motion energy consumption. We formulate a physical layer secure communication multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) of UAV networks to simultaneously improve the total secrecy rates, total maximum sidelobe level (SLL) and total motion energy consumption of UAVs by jointly optimizing the positions and excitation current weights of UAVs, and the order of communicating with different BSs. Due to the complexity and NP-hardness of the formulated MOP, we propose an improved multi-objective dragonfly algorithm with chaotic solution initialization and hybrid solution update operators (IMODACH) and a parallel-IMODACH (P-IMODACH) to solve the problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed approaches can effectively solve the formulated MOP and it has better performance than some other benchmark algorithms and approaches. Moreover, some unexpected circumstances are considered and discussed.

AB In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are widely used in both military and civilian scenarios. However, due to the distributed nature, they are also vulnerable to threats from adversaries. Time delay attack is a type of internal attack which maliciously delays the transmission of data packets and further causes great damage to UAV networks. Furthermore, it is easy to implement and difficult to detect due to the avoidance of packet modification and the unique characteristics of UAV networks. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on time delay attack detection in UAV networks. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Time Delay Attack Detection Framework (ETD). First, we collect and select delay-related features from four different dimensions, namely delay, node, message and connection. Meanwhile, we utilize the pre-planned trajectory information to accurately calculate the real forwarding delay of nodes. Then, one-class classification is used to train the detection model, and the forwarding behaviors of all nodes can be evaluated, based on which their trust values can be obtained. Finally, the K-Means clustering method is used to distinguish malicious nodes from benign ones according to their trust values. Through extensive simulation, we demonstrate that ETD can achieve higher than 80% detection accuracy with less than 2.5% extra overhead in various settings of UAV networks and different routing protocols.

AB This work investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted IoT system, where a UAV flies to each foothold to collect data from IoT devices, and then return to its start point. For such a system, we aim to minimize the energy consumption by jointly optimizing the deployment and flight trajectory of UAV. It is a mixed-integer non-convex and NP-hard problem. In order to address it, a bilevel optimization approach is proposed, where an upper-level method aims to optimize the deployment of UAV and a lower-level one aims to plan UAV flight trajectory. Specifically, the former optimizes the number and locations of footholds of UAV. This work proposes an improved dandelion algorithm with a novel encoding strategy, in which each dandelion represents a foothold of UAV and the entire dandelion population is seen as an entire deployment. Then, two mutation strategies are designed to adjust the number and locations of footholds. Based on the footholds of the UAV provided by the former, the latter transforms flight trajectory planning into a traveling salesman problem (TSP). This work proposes an iterated greedy algorithm to solve it efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed bilevel optimization approach is verified on ten instances, and the experimental results show that it significantly outperforms other benchmark approaches.

AB The automatic parking system can replace people to complete the parking task and reduce the burden of driving. The size of the parking space affects the number of parking operations and the time for parking planning to be completed. Parking planning in narrow space is a challenging problem, especially in crowded urban environments. This paper presents a parking path planning method in a narrow vertical parking space. First, the parking path planning method can be used in narrow corridor spaces and narrow spots. According to the size of the corridor space and the parking space obtained by the environment perception, this method can determine the number of parking maneuvers and the start parking position. Second, to allow the vehicle to generate a parking path at any position to reach the parking starting point, the system generates a target line set that considers control error factors. It will also select the optimal target line based on the current position. Third, the vehicle cannot complete the parking while traveling along the original parking path when the factual error is greater than the reserved error. Therefore, a re-planning method based on geometric planning is proposed to improve the robustness of the system. Finally, through the establishment of longitudinal and lateral driver models, the effectiveness of the path planning method is verified, and compared with other path planning methods, it proves that the method proposed in this paper performs well in the number of maneuvers and planning time in a small space.

AB With the continuous development of the power grid industry, the difficulty of substation operation and maintenance is also increasing. Because of its high mobility and low destructiveness, a rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can achieve effective detection and avoid the difficulty and poor accuracy of high-altitude inspection of substations. Owing to the ability of a UAV to integrate various sensors, such as visible light imaging sensors, thermal imaging sensors, and self-positioning sensors, it can ensure its own safety and that of the equipment to be tested during the inspection. Thus, in this paper, we study the application of rotary-wing multi- sensor UAVs in the high-altitude inspection of substations. Firstly, we establish a UAV inspection and autonomous detection model involving electromagnetic and other environmental influences. This model considers substation environmental restrictions, UAV physical constraints, and the limitations of sensor detection, and it is combined with a mobile edge computing platform. Secondly, we design an improved path planning algorithm combining the floating algorithm and the rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm and introduce improved strategies such as the Cauchy mutation strategy and Levy flight strategy to reduce the blindness of the algorithm search. Finally, by conducting simulation experiments and comparing the designed algorithm with traditional algorithms such as the ant colony algorithm, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing algorithm, we verify the feasibility of the model and algorithm. The results of this study provide practical assistance to promote the automation and intelligence of substation inspection.

AB This paper tackles strategic path planning for a multi-UAV routing problem in low altitude urban environment, where GNSS coverage challenges typically affect navigation performance and thus autonomous flight capabilities. These issues are addressed with a multi-step strategy that includes automated definition of GNSS-challenging volumes based on a georeferenced three-dimensional environment model, derivation of candidate obstacle-free paths between waypoints, waypoint assignment and definition of time-tagged trajectories for all UAVs. In all the steps, attention is paid to limiting the computational burden, thus ensuring applicability in real mission scenarios. Going beyond binary logics which consider GNSS-challenging volumes as obstacles, a discrete number of dilution of precision levels is considered, leading to different three-dimensional maps of the environment defined as "DOP layers". Then, the basic idea to ensure that the designed trajectories are "flyable" with given positioning accuracy requirements is to take navigation performance into account at waypoint assignment level, using propagated covariance as a metric. The approach thus combines "navigation aware" planning with multi-vehicle task assignment, generating a solution that depends on the sensors embarked onboard the UAVs, and can be naturally extended to account for multi-sensor-based navigation architectures and ground-infrastructure support. The algorithm is tested in simulations based on a real world scenario, considering a wide combination of input parameters in terms of positioning error threshold, maximum UAV velocity, number of UAVs, navigation sensors performance, and mission epoch.

AB Objective This study investigated the impact of driving styles of drivers and automated vehicles (AVs) on drivers' perception of automated driving maneuvers and quantified the relationships among drivers' perception of AV maneuvers, driver trust, and acceptance of AVs. Background Previous studies on automated driving styles focused on the impact of AV's global driving style on driver's attitude and driving performance. However, research on drivers' perception of automated driving maneuvers at the specific driving style level is still lacking. Method Sixteen aggressive drivers and sixteen defensive drivers were recruited to experience twelve driving scenarios in either an aggressive AV or a defensive AV on the driving simulator. Their perception of AV maneuvers, trust, and acceptance was measured via questionnaires, and driving performance was collected via the driving simulator. Results Results revealed that drivers' trust and acceptance of AVs would decrease significantly if they perceived AVs to have a higher speed, larger deceleration, smaller deceleration, or shorter stopping distance than expected. Moreover, defensive drivers perceived significantly greater inappropriateness of these maneuvers from aggressive AVs than defensive AVs, whereas aggressive drivers didn't differ significantly in their perceived inappropriateness of these maneuvers with different driving styles. Conclusion The driving styles of automated vehicles and drivers influenced drivers' perception of automated driving maneuvers, which influence their trust and acceptance of AVs. Application This study suggested that the design of AVs should consider drivers' perceptions of automated driving maneuvers to avoid undermining drivers' trust and acceptance of AVs.

AB In this work, a relay-based UAV-assisted cooperative communication for emergency applications is proposed for rural and semi-urban scenarios. 3-D deployment of multiple UAVs is resolved by jointly optimizing the height and transmit power of cluster UAVs and the optimal trajectory of relay UAVs is perfected by using the graph theory approach. While the majority of works in literature use UAVs as aerial base stations or as relays, this paper proposes to use UAVs as both relays and aerial base stations. Furthermore, this is one of the few works where UAVs are used as both static base stations (cluster UAVs) and mobile base stations (relay UAVs). The proposed 3-D deployment and trajectory planning algorithm is implemented at the ground base station (GBS) and the resultant parameters will be distributed to cluster UAVs either directly or through relay UAVs. A four-step approach is proposed to solve the 2-D location coordinates of cluster UAVs, to find the location of the GBS, the power-height optimization of cluster UAVs, and to optimize the trajectory of relay UAVs. The number of users served, channel capacity achieved, power saved due to optimal deployment, latency reduced, and power saving by optimal trajectory are some of the performance metrics used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The simulation results are validated to show that the proposed solutions outperform existing similar approaches.

ID TRAJECTORY GENERATION; TRACKING
AB Autonomous micro aerial vehicles are deployed for a variety of tasks including surveillance and monitoring. Perching and staring allow the vehicle to monitor targets without flying, saving battery power and increasing the overall mission time without the need to frequently replace batteries. This article addresses the active visual perching (AVP) control problem to autonomously perch on inclined surfaces up to 90 degrees C. Our approach generates dynamically feasible trajectories to navigate and perch on a desired target location while taking into account actuator and field-of-view constraints. By replanning in midflight, we take advantage of more accurate target localization increasing the perching maneuver's robustness to target localization or control errors. We leverage the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to identify the compatibility between planning objectives and the visual sensing constraint during the planned maneuver. Furthermore, we experimentally identify the corresponding boundary conditions that maximize the spatio-temporal target visibility during the perching maneuver. The proposed approach works on-board in real time with significant computational constraints relying exclusively on cameras and an inertial measurement unit. Experimental results validate the proposed approach and show a higher success rate as well as increased target interception precision and accuracy compared to a one-shot planning approach, while still retaining aggressive capabilities with flight envelopes that include large displacements from the hover position on inclined surfaces up to 90(degrees)C, angular speeds up to 750(degrees)/s, and accelerations up to 10 m/s(2).

AB Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are increasingly used in industry to automate material flow tasks. To efficiently operate systems of AGVs, researchers have proposed many different planning and control methods, e.g., for scheduling, dispatching, and routing. The performance of these methods depends on the characteristics of the system, such as transport distances and station operation frequencies. Even though these characteristics strongly influence the algorithms, no classified collection of layout data was found based on a scientific literature review. In this paper, a data set of 72 material flow and layout compositions from the scientific literature (42) and German industry (30) is presented. Each composition in the data set consists of a transport matrix and a distance matrix. To classify the compositions, a holistic taxonomy was established based on distinguishing criteria for material flow and layout compositions known from the scientific literature. The compositions were classified according to the taxonomy. An analysis of the station operation frequency and transport distance distribution data reveals typical characteristics of the compositions as well as variations between the classified compositions. The aim of this data set is to allow benchmarking of planning and control methods, thus increasing the transparency and traceability of scientific work. Furthermore, the analysis of the layouts and their taxonomy allows to compare the methods of different disciplines. By providing standardized, machine readable formats, automatic testing and optimization will be possible.

AB Weight reduction and low power consumption are key requirements in the next generation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. Employing modulating retro-reflector (MRR)-based free space optical (FSO) technology is an innovative technique for UAV-to-ground communication in order to reduce the payload weight and power consumption of UAVs which leads to increased maneuverability and flight time of UAV. In this paper, we consider an MRR-based FSO system for UAV-to-ground communication. We will show that the performance of the considered system is very sensitive to tracking errors. Therefore, to assess the benefits of MRR-based UAV deployment for FSO communications, the MRR-based UAV FSO channel is characterized by taking into account tracking system errors along with UAV's orientation fluctuations, link length, UAV's height, optical beam divergence angle, effective area of MRR, atmospheric turbulence and optical channel loss in the double-pass channels. To enable effective performance analysis, tractable and closed-form expressions are derived for probability density function of end-to-end signal to noise ratio, outage probability and bit error rate of the considered system under both weak-to-moderate and moderate-to-strong atmospheric turbulence conditions. The accuracy of the analytical expressions is verified by extensive simulations. Analytical results are then used to study the relationship between the optimal system design and tracking system errors.

AB The application of a flapping wing mechanism offers a vast range of development possibilities for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The influence of wake transitions on flapping wing mechanism's capabilities is not fully understood particularly at low Reynolds numbers. The numerical investigation of a symmetric airfoil performing sinusoidal heaving oscillations is performed to explore the wake transitions. The influence of heaving parameters on wake transitions when exposed to a constant velocity flow is investigated. The existence of reverse von Karman vortex street, deflected wake and chaotic wake is observed. The wake deflection is found to switch its direction before transforming into a chaotic wake. The coherent structures and its evolution with the flow are presented using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The underlying structures and their interactions for different wake situations are identified. Correlations for the nondimensional maximum velocity in the wake in terms of frequency and amplitude is proposed. The wake dynamics is found to depend significantly on the leading edge vortices. The time-varying velocity fluctuations in the flow field are presented and discussed in detail. The velocity fluctuation contours are used to identify the regions of momentum transfer. The transient nature of the flow field is studied using the phase plot. A transition route from the periodic to chaotic regime though a quasi-periodic regime is established using time series analysis. The wake transitions are observed to be more sensitive towards heaving frequency than the heaving amplitude.

AB In recent years, we have witnessed fast-growing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) based applications. To better facilitate these applications, many efforts have been made to enhance the capability of UAS from various aspects, including communications, control and networking, and so on. Nevertheless, most of these studies neglect the computation aspect. Recently, the UAS-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) has attracted increasing research attention, which utilises UAS with onboard computing capability to provide on-demand computing services for mobile users. However, existing research on UAS-enabled MEC remains at the theory stage and how to design a UAS platform with advanced onboard computing capability has not been addressed. In this study, the authors aim to fill this research gap and design an open UAS-based airborne computing platform with advanced onboard computing capability. This platform was designed from three aspects: hardware, software, and applications. In particular, feasible computing hardware to perform UAS onboard computing is first considered and a prototype is then designed. To enhance the flexibility and programmability of the platform, two key virtualisation techniques are then investigated. Finally, they test the performance of their prototype by executing real UAS onboard computing tasks, the results of which verify the feasibility and potentials of the proposed airborne computing platform.

AB Unmanned merchant ships are ships that carry goods and engage in commercial activities without manual operations on board. In contrast to traditional merchant ships, unmanned merchant ships have great advantages in economy, society, and safety. However, we observe that commercial applications of unmanned ships are still at an exploratory stage. We believe that unmanned merchant ships will be widely adopted and popular in the near future. There is a need to have a good survey of current technologies, foundation, and obstacles of implementation of future unmanned merchant ships. Such a survey is beneficial to ship builders, researchers, owners, and students. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of ship structure and technology, navigation, automation, algorithms, communication, Internet of Things (IOT), etc. We introduce traditional ships and analyze the role of crew and navigation operations on board. We summarize classifications, benefits, and core technologies of unmanned merchant ships. We review architecture, communication standards, security, essential technologies of IOT for unmanned merchant ships. Moreover, we introduce intelligent awareness, data fusion, applications, and E-navigation for unmanned merchant ships. We also present several future research directions at the end.

AB Purpose -This paper aims to propose and formulate a complicated routing/scheduling problem for multiple automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in a manufacturing system.
   Design/methodology/approach -Considering the due date of AGVs requiring for material handling among shops in a jobshop layout, their earliness and tardiness are significant in satisfying the expected cycle time and from an economic view point. Therefore, the authors propose a mathematical program to minimize the penalized earliness and tardiness for a conflict-free and just-in-time production.
   Findings -The model considers a new concept of turning point for deadlock resolution. As the mathematical program is difficult to solve with a conventional method, an optimization method in two stages, namely, searching the solution space and finding optimal solutions are proposed. The performance of the proposed mathematical model is tested in a numerical example.
   Practical implications -A case study in real industrial environment is conducted. The findings lead the decision-makers to develop a user interface decision support as a simulator to plan the AGVs' movement through the manufacturing network and help AGVs to prevent deadlock trap or conflicts. The proposed decision support can easily be commercialized.
   Originality/value -The benefits of such commercialization are increase in the quality of material handling, improve the delivery time and prevent delays, decrease the cost of traditional handling, capability of computerized planning and control, intelligent tracking and validation experiments in simulation environment.

AB An important concept proposed in the early stage of robot path planning field is the shrinking of a robot to a point and meanwhile the expanding of obstacles in the workspace as a set of new obstacles. The resulting grown obstacles are called the Configuration Space (Cspace) obstacles. The find-path problem is then transformed into that of finding a collision-free path for a point robot among the Cspace obstacles. However, the research experiences have shown that the Cspace transformation is very hard when the following situations occur: 1) both the robot and obstacles are not polygons, and 2) the robot is allowed to rotate. This situation gets even worse when the robot and obstacles are three dimensional (3D) objects with various shapes. For this reason, direct path planning approaches without the Cspace transformation is quite useful and expected. Motivated by the practical requirements of robot path planning, a generalized constrained optimization problem (GCOP) with not only logic AND but also logic OR relationships was proposed and a mathematical solution developed previously. This paper inherits the fundamental ideas of inequality and optimization techniques from the previous work, converts the obstacle avoidance problem into a semi-infinite constrained optimization problem with the help of the mathematical transformation, and proposes a direct path planning approach without Cspace calculation, which is quite different from traditional methods. To show its merits, simulation results in 3D space have been presented.

AB Multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are able to accelerate the large area data collection procedure by using a parallel manner. Due to the UAV flying ability differentiation and the communication equipment (CE) distribution, the optimal trajectory that minimizes the data collection completion time is difficult to achieve. This paper aims at minimizing the multi-UAV parallel data collection completion time in a wide area without precise CE location information. Different with the existing works, we propose a coarse multi-UAV trajectory design solution without repeated edges, in which each UAV follows a closed-loop trajectory to reduce the data collection time. To facilitate the UAV control and guarantee the data collection of edge CEs, four flight rules are set up. Then a division unit structure with four stay points is proposed to partition the wide area. We prove that a closed-loop trajectory exists for any area that consists of division units with the proposed structure. In the high signal to noise ratio case, the optimal area partition that minimizes the data collection time is obtained. The closed-loop trajectory for each UAV is constructed to minimize the data collection completion time. Simulation results show that the proposed coarse closed-loop trajectory design method is approaching the lower bound of the data collection completion time with a loss less than 10%.

AB This paper addresses the control of a fleet of unmanned aerial systems (UAVs), termed as drones, for flight formation problems. Getting drones to fly in formation is a relevant problem to be solved when cooperative cargo transportation is desired. A general approach for this problem considers the coordination of a fleet of UAVs, by fusing all information coming from several individual sensors posed on each UAVs. However, this approach induces a high cost as every UAV should have its advanced perception system. As an alternative, this paper proposes the use of a single perception system by a fleet composed of several elementary drones (workers) with primitive low-cost sensors and a leader drone carrying a 3D perception source. We propose a Quadral-Fuzzy approach to ensure that all drones fly in formation and will not collide with each other or with environment obstacles. We also develop a new way to compute potential fields based on possibility fuzzy (fuzziness) measure with the focus of avoiding collisions between the drones. The proposed approach encompasses four high-coupled intelligent controllers that respectively control the leader and worker drones & x2019; motion and implement obstacle and collision avoidance procedures. Simulation results using a fleet of four aerial drones are presented, showing the potential for solving usual problems to flights in formation, such as dodging obstacles, avoiding collisions between the drones, among others.

AB Multi-rotor UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) have been increasingly used for hazardous inspection tasks in complex open-air warehouse storage environments due to their high maneuverability and aerial perspective. To facilitate rapid response to patrol missions and improve the efficiency of UAV trajectory planning. This paper established a rotary-wing UAV trajectory plan model considering UAV patrol efficiency, trajectory cost, and power consumption cost. Secondly, an improved SSA (salp swarm algorithm) is incorporated for the shortcomings of low algorithmic search efficiency and unsmooth paths when planning paths in the traditional RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees). The predation mechanism of the salps group is incorporated into the random sampling of the RRT algorithm, which reduces the invalid sampling of random points and introduces the adaptive leader structure, and reverses the search strategy to improve the algorithm's global search for superiority at the later stage of the search. Finally, the designed LASSA-RRT algorithm is subjected to simulation experiments and compared with RRT, RRT*, IRRT, and PF-RRT* in a cross-sectional manner. The results show that the LASSA-RRT algorithm has an average reduction of 55.83% in sampling times, 51.91% in run time, 13.17% in track length, and 0.1491% in flight cost. In summary, this paper's UAV trajectory planning method can be effectively applied to complex open storage environments. It can provide a helpful reference direction for UAV trajectory planning.

TI Requirements and system design for a robot performing selective cleaning

AB Cleaning is a silvicultural tending operation, primarily aimed at improving the growing conditions of the remaining trees in young stands (ca. 3 m of height). The cost of cleaning has increased in comparison to other forest operations, and the annually cleaned area has decreased in Sweden. Therefore, cleaning with robots might be the key to improve profitability. This paper aims at assessing some design requirements, and suggesting an architecture for a robot cleaning in young forest stands, based on reviewed literature and our own research. The results of cleaning performed by robots have to reach acceptable results and be done at a competitive cost. The robot has to find, select, and handle trees in the whole assigned area according to given instructions. Furthermore, it must be safe for humans, capable of moving safely within the forest environment, and be able to handle snow and other prevalent boreal weather conditions. The vehicle's size and mass are of importance, and bear on its ability to manoeuvre among remaining stems. Generally, the robot must be capable of operating independently and unattended for several hours in a dynamic and non-deterministic environment. Obstacle avoidance and target identification are identified as the most difficult problems. Machine vision, radar, and laser scanners are promising techniques for both obstacle avoidance, tree identification, and tool control. The proposed architecture is based on a hybrid between the reactive and the hierarchical robot paradigms. (c) 2005 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Network connectivity is a necessary prerequisite to realizing distributed formation control. However, it is challenging to maintain the global network connectivity of a formation with local information because the communications between topological agents may be disconnected as formation maneuvers due to the range-limited sensing capabilities of agents. In this article, we propose a novel connectivity-preserving formation strategy to address the challenge. The core idea is to decompose global connectivity constraint into the induced-subgraph-preserving problems of each agent. Different from the state-of-the-art methods, our strategy can acquire the local algebraic connectivity directly at the level of maximal cliques, instead of estimating the global algebraic connectivity by hundreds of iterations. Consequently, it yields more flexibility in formation maneuvers and requires lower computing costs. Moreover, we treat the entire formation as a single rigid body and employ a variant of the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance algorithm to optimize the overall movement of the formation so that agents can maintain the desired shape while avoiding obstacles. Here, the position and orientation of the desired formation are negotiated by the agents using only local peer-to-peer information. Simulation results verify that the proposed strategy can drive a group of agents to implement connectivity-preserving formations in obstacle-rich spaces.

DT Article
ID MODEL
AB With the rapid progress of urbanization and continuous increasing of automobiles, expressway on- and off-ramp area becomes the bottleneck, and recurrent congestion occurs frequently. In order to solve the problem of traffic jam caused around off-ramps, various methods have been employed. Among all, mainline variable speed limit (VSL) control accounts for some proportion. In this study, mainline VSL adjustment of off-ramp upstream is investigated with the reinforcement learning algorithm under the connected vehicles environment to alleviate the traffic congestion. First, the assumptions are made to be suitable for the traffic conditions of mainline VSL control on off-ramp upstream, and then VSL algorithm based on reinforcement learning is presented, and Q-learning is chosen as the main algorithm. Next, the state space, action space, and reward function required by Q-learning are constructed orderly, and the related parameters are labelled. After that, according to the platform based on Python and VISSIM, three schemes, free control (Scheme 0), mainline VSL adjustment of off-ramp upstream based on rule (Scheme 1), and mainline VSL adjustment of off-ramp upstream based on Q-learning algorithm (Scheme 2), are designed, and the three schemes are simulated and compared quantitatively to reflect the off-ramp travel efficiency. The results indicate that mainline dynamic VSL adjustment of off-ramp upstream based on Q-learning algorithm performs the best in terms of general and specific indexes. The results provide potential insights for relieving the traffic congestion and traffic flow control under CAVs environment.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image stitching techniques based on position and attitude information have shown clear speed superiority over feature-based counterparts. However, how to improve stitching accuracy and robustness remains a great challenge since position and attitude parameters are sensitive to noise introduced by sensors and external environment. To mitigate this issue, this work presents a simple yet effective stitching algorithm for UAV images based on a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, we first conduct coarse registration using the position and attitude information obtained from GPS, IMU, and altimeter. Then, we introduce a novel offline calibration phase that is designed to regress the obtained global transformation matrix to the optimal one computed from feature-based algorithms, by using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for fast correction. Consequently, the proposed method well integrates the complementary strengths of both parameter and feature-based methods, achieving an ideal speed-accuracy tradeoff. Moreover, to facilitate research on this topic, we establish a new dataset, named UAV-AIRPAI, that comprises over 100 UAV image pairs with position and attitude annotations to the community, opening up a promising direction for UAV image stitching. Extensive experiments on the UAV-AIRPAI dataset show that our method achieves superior accuracy compared to priors while running at a real-time speed of 0.0124 s per image pair. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/dededust/UAV-AIRPAI.

AB Smart and precision agriculture concepts require that the farmer measures all relevant variables in a continuous way and processes this information in order to build better prescription maps and to predict crop yield. These maps feed machinery with variable rate technology to apply the correct amount of products in the right time and place, to improve farm profitability. One of the most relevant information to estimate the farm yield is the Leaf Area Index. Traditionally, this index can be obtained from manual measurements or from aerial imagery: the former is time consuming and the latter requires the use of drones or aerial services. This work presents an optical sensing-based hardware module that can be attached to existing autonomous or guided terrestrial vehicles. During the normal operation, the module collects periodic geo-referenced monocular images and laser data. With that data a suggested processing pipeline, based on open-source software and composed by Structure from Motion, Multi-View Stereo and point cloud registration stages, can extract Leaf Area Index and other crop-related features. Additionally, in this work, a benchmark of software tools is made. The hardware module and pipeline were validated considering real data acquired in two vineyards-Portugal and Italy. A dataset with sensory data collected by the module was made publicly available. Results demonstrated that: the system provides reliable and precise data on the surrounding environment and the pipeline is capable of computing volume and occupancy area from the acquired data.

AB With the rapid development of renewable energy, the scale of China's power grid with renewable energy has become much bigger than ever; as a result, we are facing severe challenges in the inspection and maintenance work of power grids that use renewable energy. Focusing on the shortcomings of the traditional manual inspection methods, this paper studies and proposes an optimization algorithm of automatic inspection of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to improve the efficiency and cost of the inspection and maintenance work of renewable energy power grids. Firstly, the communication network of the swarm intelligence system has been established to transmit the local information sensed by each UAV in real time. Secondly, according to the sensing ability of UAVs, the segmentation model of UAVs overlapping sensing areas is established, which effectively reduces the probability of overlapping UAVs sensing areas. Thirdly, according to the difference between the coverage value and the effective coverage index of each point in the sensing area, the optimization function of the coverage index is given, which makes the UAV give priority to the inspection area with the lower coverage value. Finally, when a UAV completes a local coverage task, the traction speed is introduced to prevent the UAV from stopping, which ensures that the inspection task of the whole area can be completed in a limited time. The numerical simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively control the UAVs to complete the inspection task in the specified area, and compared with the single UAV inspection method, this algorithm can greatly improve the inspection efficiency and reduce the inspection cost.

AB Search and rescue (SAR) operations can take significant advantage from supporting autonomous or teleoperated robots and multi-robot systems. These can aid in mapping and situational assessment, monitoring and surveillance, establishing communication networks, or searching for victims. This paper provides a review of multi-robot systems supporting SAR operations, with system-level considerations and focusing on the algorithmic perspectives for multi-robot coordination and perception. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first survey paper to cover (i) heterogeneous SAR robots in different environments, (ii) active perception in multi-robot systems, while (iii) giving two complementary points of view from the multi-agent perception and control perspectives. We also discuss the most significant open research questions: shared autonomy, sim-to-real transferability of existing methods, awareness of victims' conditions, coordination and interoperability in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, and active perception. The different topics in the survey are put in the context of the different challenges and constraints that various types of robots (ground, aerial, surface, or underwater) encounter in different SAR environments (maritime, urban, wilderness, or other post-disaster scenarios). The objective of this survey is to serve as an entry point to the various aspects of multi-robot SAR systems to researchers in both the machine learning and control fields by giving a global overview of the main approaches being taken in the SAR robotics area.

AB This paper describes the use of support vector machine (SVM) classifier for real-time terrain estimation to improve autonomous navigation of tracked mobile robots. Real-time terrain identification and terrain property estimation has been explored previously for application on a wide range of systems from planetary exploration rovers to commercial vehicles like cars and trucks. A majority of the existing methods rely on the use of dedicated sensors including vibration sensors, accelerometers, cameras, LIDAR, etc., which makes them susceptible to the failure modes of each of these sensors. This work proposes a method for real-time classification of different terrain types based on the state evolution of a ground robot, specifically the measured change in the pose of the robot for a known control input. By using a trained SVM to perform terrain estimation based on the collected state evolution data, the proposed method does not require dedicated sensing modalities solely for the terrain estimation. In addition, this method is generally applicable in all conditions where the robot can traverse. The training data was obtained from four different terrain conditions including vinyl flooring, asphalt, artificial turf, and grassgravel, to train the SVM to perform terrain estimation. The proposed technique is validated using a skid-steer tracked robot over multiple simulated and real terrain transitions cases, where the response to control inputs is significantly affected by terrain characteristics. The results show that the proposed method provides greater than 80% accuracy in all cases, with fast detection of terrain transitions. The paper concludes with a detailed description on the application of real-time terrain estimation in improving autonomous navigation.

AB This study presents computer vision modules of a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, which scored gold, silver, and bronze medals at the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge 2017. This autonomous system, which was running completely on board and in real time, had to address two complex tasks in challenging outdoor conditions. In the first task, an autonomous UAV had to find, track, and land on a human-driven car moving at 15 km/hr on a figure-eight-shaped track. During the second task, a group of three UAVs had to find small colored objects in a wide area, pick them up, and deliver them into a specified drop-off zone. The computer vision modules presented here achieved computationally efficient detection, accurate localization, robust velocity estimation, and reliable future position prediction of both the colored objects and the car. These properties had to be achieved in adverse outdoor environments with changing light conditions. Lighting varied from intense direct sunlight with sharp shadows cast over the objects by the UAV itself, to reduced visibility caused by overcast to dust and sand in the air. The results presented in this paper demonstrate good performance of the modules both during testing, which took place in the harsh desert environment of the central area of United Arab Emirates, as well as during the contest, which took place at a racing complex in the urban, near-sea location of Abu Dhabi. The stability and reliability of these modules contributed to the overall result of the contest, where our multi-UAV system outperformed teams from world's leading robotic laboratories in two challenging scenarios.

AB As revolutionary technologies that can actively change the communication link signal, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have emerged as reliable, economical and convenient wireless communication solutions for a variety of practical scenarios. Therefore, this paper focuses on an IRS empowered UAV downlink communication network, where the dynamic UAV establishes a cascade link via IRS to provide signal enhancement services for multiple users. Considering constraints of transmit power, flight speed and area at the UAV and the reflecting constraints at the IRS, the block coordinate descent (BCD) method based on resource allocation, reflecting design and trajectory optimization is adopted to maximize the sum-rate of all users. The proposed problem is converted by using quadratic transformation and Lagrangian dual transformation. Then applying for the approximate linear method and Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM) to optimize the transmit power of UAV and phase shift of IRS respectively. Since additional reflection propagation paths by IRS, the complexity of the channel model makes the trajectory design difficult. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a UAV trajectory optimization method based on enhanced reinforcement learning with the fixed initial location and destination. In the end, the convergence of the proposed scheme is effectively verified by simulations. Moreover, abundant simulation comparisons between the proposed scheme and other benchmark schemes demonstrate the validity and high performance gains of the proposed algorithm.

AB Aiming at the situation that the underwater integrated navigation system is easy to be disturbed and the output is unavailable during the task of underwater vehicle, a RVBAKF/ LSTM hybrid method is proposed in this paper. Considering the actual underwater working environment of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), the measured value of Doppler velocity log (DVL) is prone to outliers or even interruption, so it is very important to improve the fault tolerance of integrated navigation system. For the processing of outliers, a robust adaptive filter based on VB theory is proposed. Its advantage is to realize the adaptation of time-varying noise and reduce the interference of outliers to the integrated navigation system. Firstly, selecting the SINS output related to AUV velocity, such as velocity, attitude, angular velocity and specific force as the training input when the DVL output is normal. When DVL output is interrupted, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is used to provide pseudo measurement values for integrated navigation system. The effectiveness of the method is verified by the on-board experimental data. When the DVL output is interrupted, the method can effectively improve the accuracy of the integrated navigation system. The method in this paper is compared with four different hybrid methods, and the results are obviously better than the four methods.

AB This paper introduces an approach to produce accurate 3D detection boxes for objects on the ground using single monocular images. We do so by merging 2D visual cues, 3D object dimensions, and ground plane constraints to produce boxes that are robust against small errors and incorrect predictions. First, we train a single-shot convolutional neural network (CNN) that produces multiple visual and geometric cues of interest: 2D bounding boxes, 2D keypoints of interest, coarse object orientations and object dimensions. Subsets of these cues are then used to poll probable ground planes from a pre-computed database of ground planes, to identify the "best fit" plane with highest consensus. Once identified, the "best fit" plane provides enough constraints to successfully construct the desired 3D detection box, without directly predicting the 6DoF pose of the object. The entire ground plane polling (GPP) procedure is constructed as a non-parametrized layer of the CNN that outputs the desired "best fit" plane and the corresponding 3D keypoints, which together define the final 3D bounding box. Doing so allows us to poll thousands of different ground plane configurations without adding considerable overhead, while also creating a single CNN that directly produces the desired output without the need for post processing. We evaluate our method on the 2D detection and orientation estimation benchmark from the challenging KITTI dataset, and provide additional comparisons for 3D metrics of importance. This single-stage, single-pass CNN results in superior localization and orientation estimation compared tomore complex and computationally expensive monocular approaches.

AB The Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is an autonomous system mobile vehicle connected over a wireless link to transmit data packets in the network. It is noteworthy that vehicles are highly mobile with a limited communication range so that they change their network topology frequently. Therefore, efficient and robust data delivery in VANET is a challenging task due to dynamic network topology, unstable links, and high mobility. In this paper, an opportunistic routing protocol named Opportunistic Directional-Location Added Routing (OD-LAR) protocol proposed that uses full broadcast characteristics. The proposed protocol OD-LAR is a combination of geographical location, link quality, and angular deviation. Using all of these three metrics proposed protocol prioritizes the candidate next-hop forwarder (CNHF) nodes at the border area (BA) of the forward area (FA) towards destination node D. The proposed protocol OD-LAR assign the highest priority to CNHF node has the minimum distance from destination, good link quality, and minimum angular deviation and selects it as an optimal next hop forwarder (ONHF) node. The basic aim of the proposed OD-LAR protocol is to improve packet overhead, packet drop rates, delay, and throughput. To evaluate the performance of OD-LAR, it has simulated through network simulator-2 (NS-2) and compared with the directional-location aided routing (D-LAR) and location aided routing (LAR) protocols. Through simulated results, it has shown packet drop rate and delay is minimum in OD-LAR as compared to the D-LAR and LAR protocols.

AB Micro aerial vehicles, particularly quadrotors, have been used in a wide range of applications. However, the literature on aerial manipulation and grasping is limited and the work is based on quasi-static models. In this paper, we draw inspiration from agile, fast-moving birds such as raptors, that are able to capture moving prey on the ground or in water, and develop similar capabilities for quadrotors. We address dynamic grasping, an approach to prehensile grasping in which the dynamics of the robot and its gripper are significant and must be explicitly modeled and controlled for successful execution. Dynamic grasping is relevant for fast pick-and-place operations, transportation and delivery of objects, and placing or retrieving sensors. We show how this capability can be realized (a) using a motion capture system and (b) without external sensors relying only on onboard sensors. In both cases we describe the dynamic model, and trajectory planning and control algorithms. In particular, we present a methodology for flying and grasping a cylindrical object using feedback from a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit onboard the aerial robot. This is accomplished by mapping the dynamics of the quadrotor to a level virtual image plane, which in turn enables dynamically-feasible trajectory planning for image features in the image space, and a vision-based controller with guaranteed convergence properties. We also present experimental results obtained with a quadrotor equipped with an articulated gripper to illustrate both approaches.

AB The Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System (MEMS) micromirror has shown great advantages in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for autonomous vehicles. The equipment on vehicles is usually exposed to environmental vibration that may degrade or even destroy the flexure of the micromirror for its delicate structure. In this work, a mechanical low-pass filter (LPF) acting as a vibration isolator for a micromirror is proposed. The research starts with the evaluation of vibration influences on the micromirror by theoretical calculation and simulation. The results illustrate that mechanical load concentrates at the slow flexure of the micromirror as it is excited to resonate in second-order mode (named piston mode) in Z-direction vibration. A specific LPF for the micromirror is designed to attenuate the response to high-frequency vibration, especially around piston mode. The material of the LPF is a beryllium-copper alloy, chosen for its outstanding properties of elasticity, ductility, and fatigue resistance. To measure the mechanical load on the micromirror in practical, the on-chip piezoresistive sensor is utilized and a relevant test setup is built to validate the effect of the LPF. Micromirrors with or without the LPF are both tested under 10 g vibration in the Z-direction. The sensor output of the device with the LPF is 35.9 mV in piston mode, while the device without the LPF is 70.42 mV. The attenuation ratio is 0.51. This result demonstrates that the LPF structure can effectively reduce the stress caused by piston mode vibration.

AB This paper proposes an iterative learning control framework for lane changing to improve traffic operation and safety at a diverging area nearby a highway off-ramp in an environment with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). This framework controls CAVs in the off-ramp bottlenecks by imitating the trajectories optimized by machine learning algorithms. Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset is utilized as the raw data and filtered by cost function. The traffic models, including lane-changing decision (LCD) models and lane-changing execution (LCE) models, are completed by Random Forest (RF) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) algorithms. Based on simulation results, simulation data satisfying the predetermined criterion will be added to dataset in the next iteration. Various metrics are considered to evaluate the proposed framework systematically from both lateral and longitudinal aspects, including time exposed time-to collision (TET), time integrated time-to-collision (TIT), rear-end collision risk indexes (RCRI) and lane-changing risk index (LCRI). The results present that the iterative framework can decrease the longitudinal risk of the system by a factor of two times, and can reduce the lateral risk by 28.7%. When the CAVs market penetration rate (MPR) reaches 100%, the longitudinal and lateral risk values of the off-ramp system can be reduced by 90% and 35%, respectively. However, it is worth noting that only when the CAVs MPR reaches 50% does the system's value at risk change significantly.

ID FRICTION; BEHAVIOR
AB The measurement of the road adhesion coefficient is of great significance for the vehicle active safety control system and is one of the key technologies for future autonomous driving. With a focus on the problems of interference uncertainty and system nonlinearity in the estimation of the road adhesion coefficient, this work adopts a vehicle model with 7 degrees of freedom (7-DOF) and the Dugoff tire model and uses these models to estimate the road adhesion coefficient in real time based on the particle filter (PF) algorithm. The estimations using the PF algorithm are verified by selecting typical working conditions, and they are compared with estimations using the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm. Simulation results show that the road adhesion coefficient estimator error based on the UKF algorithm is less than 7 %, whereas the road adhesion coefficient estimator error based on the PF algorithm is less than 0.1 %. Thus, compared with the UKF algorithm, the PF algorithm has a higher accuracy and control effect with respect to estimating the road adhesion coefficient under different road conditions. In order to verify the robustness of the road adhesion coefficient estimator, an automobile test platform based on a four-wheel-hub-motor car is built. According to the experimental results, the estimator based on the PF algorithm can realize the road surface identification with an error of less than 1 %, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm with respect to estimating the road adhesion coefficient and shows good robustness.

AB Abnormal behavior poses a great threat to social security and stability. The resulting violence or crime leads to terrible consequences. How to utilize reasonable means to predict the dangerous intentions of massive crowds and prevent the potential hazard to the public is significant for social security. A crowd monitoring and management system is an effective way to detect abnormal behavior. In this article, we release unmanned aerial vehicles as well as fixed ground devices to achieve multi-level and multi-modal behavioral sensing on a massive crowd, deploy a hybrid model in edge cloud to extract global features from behavioral data of a massive crowd, and then utilize these global features to construct decent classification algorithms for action recognition and behavioral semantic cognition. With the cooperation of behavioral data and cognitive algorithms, we can understand the instantaneous emotions of the crowd. On the basis of behavioral data and the emotional state of the crowd, the correlation between daily behavior and any dangerous intention of a massive crowd has been revealed by utilizing behavioral big data analysis, which is a key foundation for predicting people's dangerous intentions. Finally, we conduct a case study of abnormal behavior detection based on pix2pix and continuous video frames. The experimental results show that the performance of our method is better than other algorithms in both public datasets and the customized Hajj dataset. The proposed novel pattern for the effective learning of a massive crowd is validated to effectively eliminate some of the possible dangers caused by abnormal behavior.

AB Self-driving cars not only solve the problem of navigating safely from location A to location B; they also have to deal with an abundance of (sometimes unpredictable) factors, such as traffic rules, weather conditions, and interactions with humans. Over the last decades, different approaches have been proposed to design intelligent driving systems for self-driving cars that can deal with an uncontrolled environment. Some of them are derived from computationalist paradigms, formulating mathematical models that define the driving agent, while other approaches take inspiration from biological cognition. However, despite the extensive work in the field of selfdriving cars, many open questions remain. Here, we discuss the different approaches for implementing driving systems for self-driving cars, as well as the computational paradigms from which they originate. In doing so, we highlight two key messages: First, further progress in the field might depend on adapting new paradigms as opposed to pushing technical innovations in those currently used. Specifically, we discuss how paradigms from cognitive systems research can be a source of inspiration for further development in modelling driving systems, highlighting emergent approaches as a possible starting point. Second, self-driving cars can themselves be considered cognitive systems in a meaningful sense, and are therefore a relevant, yet underutilized resource in the study of cognitive mechanisms. Overall, we argue for a stronger synergy between the fields of cognitive systems and self-driving vehicles.

AB Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are becoming promising for on-demand air transportation in urban air mobility (UAM). However, successfully bringing such vehicles and airspace operations to fruition will require introducing orders of magnitude more aircraft to a given airspace volume. Although there are existing solutions for communication technology, onboard computing capability, and sensor technology, the computation guidance algorithm to enable safe, efficient, and scalable flight operations for dense self-organizing air traffic still remains an open question. In this paper, a message-based decentralized computational guidance algorithm is proposed and analyzed for multiple cooperative aircraft by formulating this problem using multi-agent Markov decision process and solving it by Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. A novel coordination strategy is introduced by using the logit level-kmodel in behavioral game theory. To achieve higher scalability, the airspace sector concept is introduced into the UAM environment by dividing the airspace into sectors, so that each aircraft only needs to coordinate with aircraft in the same sector. At each decision step, all of the aircraft will run the proposed computational guidance algorithm onboard, which can guide all the aircraft to their respective destinations while avoiding potential conflicts among them. For validation and demonstration, a free-flight airspace simulator that incorporates environment uncertainty is built in an OpenAI Gym environment. Numerical experiment results over several case studies, including the roundabout test problem, show that the proposed computational guidance algorithm has promising performance even with the high-density air traffic case.

AB By development of ocean exploration, autonomous vehicles are employed to perform on-water and underwater tasks. Using an extended Kalman filter, Inertial Navigation System/Doppler Velocity Log (INS/DVL) integrated systems are trying to navigate in oceans and underwater environments when Global Positioning System (GPS) signals are not accessible. The dependency of DVL signals on acoustic environments may cause any DVL malfunction due to sea creatures or strong wave-absorbing material. In this paper, an improved version of evolutionary TS-fuzzy (eTS) is proposed in order to predict DVL sensor outputs at DVL malfunction moment, by utilizing an artificial intelligent (AI) aided integrated system. According to lack of input selection and shrinking, while the classic eTS suffers from soaring prediction errors and may result in instability, by adding these properties to eTS, the performance increases in long-term DVL outage. The proposed eTS-aided system makes ocean navigation purposes possible during long-term and simultaneous outage of GPS and DVL. These evolutionary fuzzy systems change their structure depending on the path which makes the trained fuzzy system more flexible with non-stationary and varying environments. The real sensor data is collected online with a test setup on a lake and then the algorithms are applied. The powerful capacity of the proposed data fusion method is demonstrated in analysis results.

AB The Mars sample return mission is intended to perform autonomous rendezvous and docking, aimed at gathering Mars samples, stored in an orbiting capsule. This study focuses on guidance and control techniques for the three phases of a typical Mars sample return mission: (i) orbit acquisition, (ii) phasing and correction maneuvers, and (iii) rendezvous and docking with the orbiting sample (OS) capsule, which is assumed to be a noncooperative spacecraft. The chaser vehicle is assumed to be equipped with both chemical and electrical propulsion. The latter is used in phase (i), in conjunction with nonlinear orbit control. This can be regarded as an autonomous guidance technique also in the presence of nonnominal flight conditions. In phase (ii), a phasing strategy and proper correction maneuvers are designed, to reach suitable parking conditions, identified through the orbital commensurability criterion. Then, a guidance, control, and actuation architecture is proposed for phase (iii), split in arc 1 (proximity maneuvers) and arc 2 (final approach and docking). Feedback linearization is employed for trajectory control, aimed at tracking a reference path, which is iteratively defined from the estimation of the rotational state of the capsule. Two distinct, nonlinear feedback control laws, enjoying quasi-global stability properties, are used for attitude control. Actuation is demanded to a pyramidal array of single-gimbal control momentum gyros, the main thruster, and an arrangement of side thrusters. A large set of perturbations (including navigation and actuation errors) are modeled. Monte Carlo simulations prove that the guidance, control, and actuation architecture at hand is effective to complete safe docking with a noncooperative OS capsule.

AB With the advancement of technology and the rise of the unmanned aerial vehicle industry, the use of drones has grown tremendously. For drones performing near-ground delivery missions, the problem of 3D space-based path planning is particularly important in the autonomous navigation of drones in complex spaces. Therefore, an improved butterfly optimization (BOA-TSAR) algorithm is proposed in this paper to achieve the autonomous pathfinding of drones in 3D space. First, this paper improves the randomness strategy of the initial population generation in the butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) via the Tent chaotic mapping method, by means of the removal of the short-period property, which balances the equilibrium of the initial solutions generated by the BOA algorithm in the solution space. Secondly, this paper improves the shortcomings of the BOA algorithm in terms of slower convergence, lower accuracy, and the existence of local optimal stagnation when dealing with high-dimensional complex functions via adaptive nonlinear inertia weights, a simulated annealing strategy, and stochasticity mutation with global adaptive features. Finally, this paper proposes an initial population generation strategy, based on the 3D line of sight (LOS) detection method, to further reduce the generation of path interruption points while ensuring the diversity of feasible solutions generated by the BOA algorithm for paths. In this paper, we verify the superior performance of BOA-TSAR by means of simulation experiments. The simulation results show that BOA-TSAR is very competitive among swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms of the same type. At the same time, the BOA-TSAR algorithm achieves the optimal path length measure and smoothness measure in the path-planning experiment.

ID TERRAIN AUTONOMOUS MOBILITY
AB This article is my personal account on the work at Stanford on Stanley, the winning robot in the DARPA Grand Challenge. Between July 2004 and October 2005, my then-postdoc Michael Montemerlo and I led a team of students, engineers, and professionals with the single vision of claiming one of the most prestigious trophies in the field of robotics: the DARPA Grand Challenge (DARPA 2004).(1) The Grand Challenge, organized by the U.S. government, was unprecedented in the nation's history. It was the first time that the U.S. Congress had appropriated a cash price for advancing technological innovation. My team won this prize, competing with some 194 other teams. Stanley was the fastest of five robotic vehicles that, on October 8, 2005, successfully navigated a 131.6-mile-long course through California's Mojave Desert.
   This essay is not about the technology behind our success; for that I refer the interested reader to recent articles on the technical aspects of Stanley (Dahlkamp et al. 2006; Montemerlo et al. 2006; Stavens and Thrun 2006; Thrun, Montemerlo, and Aron 2006; Thrun et al. 2006). Instead, this is my personal story of leading the Stanford Racing Team. It is the story of a team of people who built an autonomous robot in record time. It is also a success story for the field of artificial intelligence, as Stanley used some state of the art Al methods in areas such as probabilistic inference, machine learning, and computer vision. Of course, it is also the story of a step towards a technology that, one day, might fundamentally change our lives.

AB Autonomous continuous analysis of oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration with depth is of great significance with regard to ocean acidification and climate change. However, miniaturisation of in situ analysis systems is hampered by the size, cost and power requirements of traditional optical instrumentation. Here, we report a low-cost microfluidic alternative based on CO2 separation and conductance measurements that could lead to integrated lab-on-chip systems for ocean float deployment, or for moored or autonomous surface vehicle applications. Conductimetric determination of concentration, in the seawater range of 1000-3000 mu mol kg(-1), has been achieved using a microfluidic thin-film electrode conductivity cell and a membrane-based gas exchange cell. Sample acidification released CO2 through the membrane, reacting in a NaOH carrier, later drawn through a sub-mu L conductivity cell, for impedance versus time measurements. Precision values (relative standard deviations) were 0.2% for peak height measurements at 2000 mu mol kg(-1). Comparable precision values of 0.25% were obtained using a C4D electrophoresis headstage with similar measurement volume. The required total sample and reagent volumes were 500 mu L for the low volume planar membrane gas exchange cell. In contrast, previous conductivity-based DIC analysis systems required total volumes between 5000 and 10,000 mu L. Long membrane tubes and macroscopic wire electrodes were avoided by incorporating a planar membrane (PDMS) in the gas exchange cell, and by sputter deposition of Ti/Au electrodes directly onto a thermoplastic (PMMA) manifold. Future performance improvements will address membrane chemical and mechanical stability, further volume reduction, and component integration into a single manifold.

AB Accurate velocity estimation plays a significant role in improving path tracking performance. Meanwhile, for in-wheel motor drive electric buses (IWMEBs), how to tradeoffthe energy optimization and torque distribution in path tracking is also a challenging task. To address the above issues, a hierarchical control framework is proposed in this paper for IWMEBs based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), under which a modular nonlinear observer is designed to achieve accurate velocity estimate. The framework can be divided into two layers. In the upper layer, a modular nonlinear observer is designed to estimate the longitudinal and lateral velocities, considering the dependence of path tracking control on vehicle states. By replacing the tire model with the estimated longitudinal and lateral forces, the errors caused by the inaccurate parameters and modeling can be reduced. In the lower layer, a coordinated control method is proposed to realize the accurate path tracking while minimizing the energy consumption based on NMPC. By integrating tracking error, energy consumption and dynamic demand of IWMEB into an objective function, the coordinated control of path tracking and energy optimization is accomplished. The comparison simulation is implemented via Trucksim-Simulink joint simulation, whose results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical control framework is effective and its performance is satisfactory.

AB Visual odometry estimates the ego-motion of an agent (e.g., vehicle and robot) using image information and is a key component for autonomous vehicles and robotics. This paper proposes a robust and precise method for estimating the 6-DoF ego-motion, using a stereo rig with optical flow analysis. An objective function fitted with a set of feature points is created by establishing the mathematical relationship between optical flow, depth and camera ego-motion parameters through the camera's 3-dimensional motion and planar imaging model. Accordingly, the six motion parameters are computed by minimizing the objective function, using the iterative Levenberg-Marquard method. One of key points for visual odometry is that the feature points selected for the computation should contain inliers as much as possible. In this work, the feature points and their optical flows are initially detected by using the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) algorithm. A circle matching is followed to remove the outliers caused by the mismatching of the KLT algorithm. A space position constraint is imposed to filter out the moving points from the point set detected by the KLT algorithm. The Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is employed to further refine the feature point set, i.e., to eliminate the effects of outliers. The remaining points are tracked to estimate the ego-motion parameters in the subsequent frames. The approach presented here is tested on real traffic videos and the results prove the robustness and precision of the method.

AB The purpose of this paper is to present orientation estimation for small unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV). An extended Kalman filter with adaptive PR (P denotes the estimation error covariance matrix, and R denotes the measurement noise covariance matrix) is designed to estimate orientation by sensors of gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer integrated in Micro Electronic Mechanic System-based heading reference systems. Since ferromagnetic materials or other magnetic fields near the magnetometer disturb the measurement of local earth magnetic field and the external forces which produce maneuvering acceleration effect the measurement of gravity by the accelerometer, the orientation estimation is disturbed. Accordingly, the error equations of sensors are established using a current statistical model, and then the extended Kalman filter with adaptive PR with 12 state variables is designed. In the filter, the orientation error, gyroscope offset error, magnetic disturbance error, and maneuvering acceleration error are estimated. The swing experiment in hand with the magnetic disturbance and small maneuvering acceleration, and flight experiment for SUAV with the magnetic disturbance and large maneuvering acceleration, are developed. The compensation results show that the orientation is accurately calculated with disturbances. A new methodology for the orientation estimation is proposed, which could also be considered for other special application such as the robot on the ground and the autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper provides a novel realization method for accurate orientation estimation for SUAV. The method can be applied in many applications with a simple hardware.

Remembering the true objective to guarantee amass applications and disallow uncertified clients from getting to the correspondence data that cannot be anchored by a remote MANET, including IP multicast, the singular gathered data content must remain encoded by a typical shared gathering key. Key administration is required to anchor the assurance of gathering the key and to safeguard those gathering data. GKM framework is associated with the remote system condition partners with three issues: execution, security, and system versatility. This article focuses on the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mobile backbone node (MBN) remote system performance. The UAV-MBN Network condition is a military system that includes a proposal to group an important administrative structure. A half-and-half gathering key administration technique, which works on each target of UAV-MBN, is included in an arrangement to start two basic remote gathering key administration difficulties: (1) operational performance and (2) multiple-enrollment development. By working with minimal small-scale key administration, this strategy can diminish the execution cost associated with the key administration along with the increment operational execution of remote GKM. Scaled-down key organization is carried out in the context of these movement units. The key administration approach also restricted the operational procedure and decreased the operation's cost in terms of key generation, figuring, and associated correspondence. Overall, the HGKM strategy that has been introduced enhances the operational process and functions effectively in reasonable remote areas.

AB Over time, the field of robotics has provided solutions to automate routine tasks in different scenarios. In particular, libraries are awakening great interest in automated tasks since they are semi-structured environments where machines coexist with humans and several repetitive operations could be automatically performed. In addition, multirotor aerial vehicles have become very popular in many applications over the past decade, however autonomous flight in confined spaces still presents a number of challenges and the use of small drones has not been reported as an automated inventory device within libraries. This paper presents the UJI aerial librarian robot that leverages computer vision techniques to autonomously self-localize and navigate in a library for automated inventory and book localization. A control strategy to navigate along the library bookcases is presented by using visual markers for self-localization during a visual inspection of bookshelves. An image-based book recognition technique is described that combines computer vision techniques to detect the tags on the book spines, followed by an optical character recognizer (OCR) to convert the book code on the tags into text. These data can be used for library inventory. Misplaced books can be automatically detected, and a particular book can be located within the library. Our quadrotor robot was tested in a real library with promising results. The problems encountered and limitation of the system are discussed, along with its relation to similar applications, such as automated inventory in warehouses.

AB We demonstrate that assimilation of water temperature measurements by sea turtles into an operational ocean nowcast/forecast system improves representation of mesoscale eddies and front variations in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Confluence region. For a period from August to December in 2009, vertical ranges of the measurements by six turtles covered from surface to maximum 150m depth, and the number of the measurements in the region was comparable to that of usual sampling by research vehicles and profiling floats. Comparison of the turtle measurements and products of an operational ocean nowcast/forecast system JCOPE2M elucidated low-temperature bias in JCOPE2M due to assimilation of high-resolution satellite sea surface temperature data. Additional assimilation of the turtle data into a modified JCOPE2M system with correction of the low-temperature bias led to reasonable modification of horizontal temperature/salinity gradient associated with northward moving warm core rings separating from the Kuroshio Extension and southward moving the Oyashio water intrusion branches. Effects of the turtle data assimilation propagated to far east of the Kuroshio-Oyashio confluence region along the subarctic boundary and front through advection. Another experiment assimilating the in situ profile data excluding the traditional temperature/salinity profiles data but including only the turtle data showed that the turtle measurements captured the warm core rings better than the Oyashio intrusion branches, suggesting possible optimum design of future ocean observing systems composed of different kinds of animals and/or autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB An effective management of precision viticulture processes relies on robust crop monitoring procedures and, in the near future, to autonomous machine for automatic site-specific crop managing. In this context, the exact detection of vineyards from 3D point-cloud maps, generated from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) multispectral imagery, will play a crucial role, e.g. both for achieve enhanced remotely sensed data and to manage path and operation of unmanned vehicles.
   In this paper, an innovative unsupervised algorithm for vineyard detection and vine-rows features evaluation, based on 3D point-cloud maps processing, is presented. The main results are the automatic detection of the vineyards and the local evaluation of vine rows orientation and of inter-rows spacing.
   The overall point-cloud processing algorithm can be divided into three mains steps: (1) precise local terrain surface and height evaluation of each point of the cloud, (2) point-cloud scouting and scoring procedure on the basis of a new vineyard likelihood measure, and, finally, (3) detection of vineyard areas and local features evaluation.
   The algorithm was found to be efficient and robust: reliable results were obtained even in the presence of dense inter-row grassing, many missing plants and steep terrain slopes. Performances of the algorithm were evaluated on vineyard maps at different phenological phase and growth stages. The effectiveness of the developed algorithm does not rely on the presence of rectilinear vine rows, being also able to detect vineyards with curvilinear vine row layouts.

AB An ensemble-based approach is developed to conduct optimal path planning in unsteady ocean currents under uncertainty. We focus our attention on two-dimensional steady and unsteady uncertain flows, and adopt a sampling methodology that is well suited to operational forecasts, where an ensemble of deterministic predictions is used to model and quantify uncertainty. In an operational setting, much about dynamics, topography, and forcing of the ocean environment is uncertain. To address this uncertainty, the flow field is parametrized using a finite number of independent canonical random variables with known densities, and the ensemble is generated by sampling these variables. For each of the resulting realizations of the uncertain current field, we predict the path that minimizes the travel time by solving a boundary value problem (BVP), based on the Pontryagin maximum principle. A family of backward-in-time trajectories starting at the end position is used to generate suitable initial values for the BVP solver. This allows us to examine and analyze the performance of the sampling strategy and to develop insight into extensions dealing with general circulation ocean models. In particular, the ensemble method enables us to perform a statistical analysis of travel times and consequently develop a path planning approach that accounts for these statistics. The proposed methodology is tested for a number of scenarios. We first validate our algorithms by reproducing simple canonical solutions, and then demonstrate our approach in more complex flow fields, including idealized, steady and unsteady double-gyre flows.

AB Seafloor blister-like mounds, methane migration and gas hydrate formation were investigated through detailed seafloor surveys in Santa Monica Basin, offshore of Los Angeles, California. Two distinct deep-water (>= 800 m water depth) topographic mounds were surveyed using an autonomous underwater vehicle (carrying a multibeam sonar and a chirp sub-bottom profiler) and one of these was explored with the remotely operated vehicle Tiburon. The mounds are > 10 m high and > 100 m wide dome-shaped bathymetric features. These mounds protrude from crests of broad anticlines (similar to 20 in high and 1 to 3 km long) formed within latest Quatemary-aged seafloor sediment associated with compression between lateral offsets in regional faults. No allochthonous sediments were observed on the mounds, except slumped material off the steep slopes of the mounds. Continuous streams of methane gas bubbles emanate from the crest of the northeastern mound, and extensive methane-derived authigenic carbonate pavements and chemosynthetic communities mantle the mound surface. The large local vertical displacements needed to produce these mounds suggests a corresponding net mass accumulation has occurred within the immediate subsurface. Formation and accumulation of pure gas hydrate lenses in the subsurface is proposed as a mechanism to blister the seafloor and form these mounds. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the last decade, the popularity of UAVs has increased tremendously. Nowadays, many researchers are interested in UAV swarms. Coordinating a swarm of UAVs is a complicated task and many problems should be addressed before wide-spread adoption. In this work, we focus on the take-off for large-scale UAV swarms, with an extra focus on the assignment phase. The assignment phase is the first take-off stage whereby we decide which UAV on the ground goes to which place in the air. A good assignment algorithm, is quick, and at the same time reduce the total distance travelled as much as possible. We assess the performance of three different assignment algorithms: a heuristic, the original Kuhn-Munkres algorithm (KMA), and the KMA adapted for GPU use. Each algorithm was tested while varying the number of UAVs, as well as the type of flight formation. During the experiments, we measured the calculation time, total distance travelled, and number of flight paths crossing. In terms of total distance travelled, the KMA always outperforms the heuristic. However, the KMA takes longer (orders of magnitude) to calculate the assignment. Realistically, the KMA algorithm can only be used as long as the swarm does not contain more than 500 UAVs. From that point the GPU version of the KMA is faster. We can conclude that, in most cases, it is recommendable to use the KMA for the assignment as it will reduce the distance travelled to a minimum and, consequently, also reduce the number of flight paths crossing.

AB Diel variations in oxygen concentration have been extensively used to estimate rates of photosynthesis and respiration in productive freshwater and marine ecosystems. Recent improvements in optical oxygen sensors now enable us to use the same approach to estimate metabolic rates in the oligotrophic waters that cover most of the global ocean and for measurements collected by autonomous underwater vehicles. By building on previous methods, we propose a procedure to estimate photosynthesis and respiration from vertically resolved diel measurements of oxygen concentration. This procedure involves isolating the oxygen variation due to biological processes from the variation due to physical processes, and calculating metabolic rates from biogenic oxygen changes using linear least squares analysis. We tested our method on underwater glider observations from the surface layer of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre where we estimated rates of gross oxygen production and community respiration both averaging 1.0 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1), consistent with previous estimates from the same environment. Method uncertainty was computed as the standard deviation of the fitted parameters and averaged 0.6 and 0.5 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1) for oxygen production and respiration, respectively. The variability of metabolic rates was larger than this uncertainty and we were able to discern covariation in the biological production and consumption of oxygen. The proposed method resolved variability on time scales of approximately 1 week. This resolution can be improved in several ways including by measuring turbulent mixing, increasing the number of measurements in the surface ocean, and adopting a Lagrangian approach during data collection.

AB Navigation on unmarked and possible poorly delineated roads where the boundaries between the road and the non-road surfaces are not clearly indicated is a particularly challenging task for autonomous vehicles. The results of this study show that fairly robust navigation strategies can be generated by a robot equipped with a dynamic active-vision based control system represented by an artificial neural network synthesized using evolutionary computation techniques. In the experiments described in this paper, a simulated Pioneer robot is required to visually navigate multiple poorly delineated roads that differ in terms of variations in luminance and/or chrominance between the road and the adjacent non-road areas. Low resolution camera images are processed by a mechanism that continuously adjusts the contribution of each component of a three dimensional colour model (e.g., R, G and B) to the generation of the robot perceptual experience. We show that the best controller can successfully drive a simulated Pioneer robot in environments with colour characteristics never encountered during the design phase, and operate with colour models never used during training. We show that the dynamic differential weighting of the colour components is underpinned by a complex pattern of neural activity that allows the robot to successfully adapt its perceptual system to the colour characteristics of different visual scenes. We also show that the controller can be easily ported onto real hardware, by showing the results of a series of tests with a physical Pioneer robot required to navigate various poorly delineated pedestrian roads.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Simultaneously and accurately predicting trajectories of multiple heterogeneous agents is crucial for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications, e.g., connected and autonomous vehicles. Existing model-based and data-driven methods can achieve good prediction accuracy, but most of them neglect the domain shift issue and prevalent imperfect data problems, i.e., few-shot learning and zero-shot learning issues. To address these issues, we propose a multi-source transfer learning (TL) framework, transferable hierarchical Siamese Transformer network (T-HSTN), for trajectory prediction of multiple heterogeneous agents, e.g., vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, at urban unsignalized intersections under small data conditions. Specifically, by extending the self-attention mechanism and exploring feature representations of traffic scenes, a Transformer-based network that hierarchically extracts temporal/spatial features and map features is introduced as the basic prediction model. Moreover, a TL framework with adaptive learning and feature alignment modules is built to explore the feature representations of unfixed traffic scenes and align both statistical and deep features to learn domain-invariant knowledge. More challenging trajectory prediction experiments are designed, corresponding to newly-built or badly-instrumented intersections under real-world scenarios. Experimental results verify the proposed method's high accuracy, transferability, and generability. Our work fills the gap in solutions and benchmarks for TL tasks in trajectory prediction for heterogeneous agents. The conducted TL experiments provide a more practical setting of considering imperfect data problems in trajectory prediction.

AB A large amount of high-quality data are collected through autonomous vehicles, CCTVs, guidance service robots, and web map services (Google Street View). However, the data collected through them include personal information such as peoples' faces and vehicle license plates. Currently, personal information contained in data is de-identified using methods such as face blur, pixelation, and masking. Consequently, it loses value as data for artificial intelligence (AI) learning. Therefore, in this study, we propose a model to generate a fake face that maintains the basic structure of the human face. There are several methods for generating faces. One is to generate them using a generative adversarial network (GAN) model. The GAN is an AI algorithm used for unsupervised learning and is implemented by a system in which two neural networks compete. However, because GAN operates as an input of a random noise vector, it is difficult to obtain results for the desired face angle and shape. Therefore, pre- and post-processing is required to generate a fake face that maintains the basic structure and angles; however, the calculation is complicated, and it is difficult to generate a natural image. To solve this problem, we propose a method for generating a fake face that maintains the basic structure and angle of the real face by applying a facial landmark. Using the proposed method, it was possible to generate a fake face with a different impression while maintaining the basic structure and angle of the face.

AB While underwater acoustic (UWA) communication offers a practical way to establish a wireless link with underwater vehicles, designing a UWA communication system onboard a small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) still poses significant challenges. As the adoption of the low-complexity, robust noncoherent communication technology is limited by low bandwidth efficiency and a low data rate, coherent UWA communication requires Doppler mitigation and channel equalization measures to achieve a relatively high data rate in a moving state. Due to the strict constraints of a small-scale AUV in terms of resources and energy consumption, it is not appropriate to use high-complexity Doppler/multipath compensation technology from the prospect of system implementation. In this paper, an efficient and low-complexity UWA differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) system onboard a small AUV is proposed by simplifying the Doppler and multipath compensation. Specifically, for Doppler, the delay of the adjacent DBPSK symbols is calculated according to the Doppler estimate to facilitate delay-tuning Doppler correction. For multipath, low-complexity LMS channel equalization is incorporated with error correction coding to enable multipath mitigation. With a simple structure and low computational complexity, the proposed scheme facilitates the practical hardware implementation and system integration in the small AUV platform. The numerical simulations are conducted to assess the validity of the proposed scheme under different channel conditions and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is further verified by two UWA communication field tests, which are performed at a practical shallow water sea and lake, respectively.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) is a viable solution to remotely charge several energy receivers (ERs) in areas with intermittent access to a source of energy. However, given the limited available energy in the on-board battery of the UAV, which is mainly required to suffice propulsion energy consumption, the UAV struggles to roam seamlessly for long intervals. A key challenge is thus to efficiently use the limited battery energy, and accordingly prolong the UAV's endurance, via controlling the underlying associated parameters such as cruising velocity. To further extend the battery lifetime, the UAV can also harness other sources of sustainable energy, such as sunlight, via solar energy harvesting. This paper studies a UAV-enabled WPT system, where a rotary-wing UAV transfers radio frequency (RF) wireless energy to several ERs at known locations. To offer uninterrupted seamless service, the UAV also harvests solar energy using solar panels. Considering the propulsion energy consumption of the UAV, we maximize the minimum average power received among all ERs over a finite cycle duration by jointly optimizing the UAV's time allocation between harvesting and charging, flight trajectory as well as velocity, and transmit power allocation. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we utilize the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Numerical results show that the proposed solution outperforms benchmark schemes.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a sensor that uses a laser to represent the surrounding environment in three-dimensional information. Thanks to the development of LiDAR, LiDAR-based applications are being actively used in autonomous vehicles. In order to effectively use the information coming from LiDAR, extrinsic calibration which finds the translation and the rotation relationship between LiDAR coordinate and vehicle coordinate is essential. Therefore, many studies on LiDAR extrinsic calibration are steadily in progress. The performance index (PI) of the calibration parameter is a value that quantitatively indicates whether the obtained calibration parameter is similar to the true value or not. In order to effectively use the obtained calibration parameter, it is important to validate the parameter through PI. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an algorithm to obtain the performance index for the calibration parameter between LiDAR and the motion sensor. This performance index is experimentally verified in various environments by Monte Carlo simulation and validated using CarMaker simulation data and real data. As a result of verification, the PI of the calibration parameter obtained through the proposed algorithm has the smallest value when the calibration parameter has a true value, and increases as an error is added to the true value. In other words, it has been proven that PI is convex to the calibration parameter. In addition, it is able to confirm that the PI obtained using the proposed algorithm provides information on the effect of the calibration parameters on mapping and localization.

AB In recent years Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have progressively been utilized for wildfire management, and are especially in prevalent in forest fire monitoring missions. To ensure the fast detection and accurate area estimation of forest fires, a two-step search and survey algorithm for multi-UAV system is proposed to address these fire scenarios. Initially, a grid-based partition method is applied to divide the area-of-interest into several search areas. Then, an archetype search pattern is used to provide timely UAV exploration within those sub-areas. Once the fire zones are detected, a novel survey strategy is employed for UAVs to discover the boundary points of the fire zones, so that the area of the fire zones can be estimated using the sampled boundary points. In addition, the effect of wind is accounted for improving fire zone boundary estimates. The proposed search-and-survey procedure is validated on multiple simulated scenarios using the U.S. Air Force's mission-realistic Aerospace Multi-Agent Simulation Environment (AMASE) software. Simulation results showcase that the proposed search pattern can effectively discover the seeded fire zones within 40 min of the mission. This is relatively faster than the other two well-known search patterns. Moreover, the proposed survey technique provides a coverage estimate with at least 85% accuracy for the area of interest within 90 min of the mission. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fusion of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and camera data is a promising approach to improve the environmental perception and recognition for intelligent vehicles because of the combination of depth and color information. One of the difficulties in achieving the fusion is the accurate alignment of the 3-D points with the image pixels. Current methods of data alignment involve the steps of estimating the camera intrinsic parameters and developing a transformation matrix between the camera and LiDAR frame. The drawback of these methods is the accumulation of errors during the calculation of the camera intrinsic parameters and the transformation matrix. In order to improve the data alignment accuracy, we propose a novel algorithm that directly calculates the alignment between the 3-D points and the pixels without the need for camera parameters and calibration of the coordinate transformation matrix. We call the proposed method the pixel and 3-D point alignment (PPA) method. The alignment procedure is achieved by using the extracted corresponding points. First, we calculate a linear alignment matrix without considering the image distortion; and second, we optimize the parameters using the maximum likelihood estimation to consider the camera distortion. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the PPA method is able to align the 3-D points in LiDAR frame with the pixels in image frame with higher accuracy and increased robustness against noise in calibration process than comparable state-of-the-art methods.

AB As an advanced combat weapon, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in military wars. In this paper, we formulated the Autonomous Navigation Control (ANC) problem of UAVs as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and proposed a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to allow UAVs to perform dynamic target tracking tasks in large-scale unknown environments. To solve the problem of limited training experience, the proposed Imaginary Filtered Hindsight Experience Replay (IFHER) generates successful episodes by reasonably imagining the target trajectory in the failed episode to augment the experiences. The well-designed goal, episode, and quality filtering strategies ensure that only high-quality augmented experiences can be stored, while the sampling filtering strategy of IFHER ensures that these stored augmented experiences can be fully learned according to their high priorities. By training in a complex environment constructed based on the parameters of a real UAV, the proposed IFHER algorithm improves the convergence speed by 28.99% and the convergence result by 11.57% compared to the state-of-the-art Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. The testing experiments carried out in environments with different complexities demonstrate the strong robustness and generalization ability of the IFHER agent. Moreover, the flight trajectory of the IFHER agent shows the superiority of the learned policy and the practical application value of the algorithm.

AB Perception and interpretation of the terrain is essential for robot navigation, particularly in off-road areas, where terrain characteristics can be highly variable. When planning a path, features such as the terrain gradient and roughness should be considered, and they can jointly represent the traversability cost of the terrain. Despite this range of contributing factors, most cost maps are currently binary in nature, solely indicating traversible versus non-traversible areas. This work presents a joint local and global planning methodology for building continuous cost maps using LIDAR, based on a novel traversability representation of the environment. We investigate two approaches. The first, a statistical approach, computes terrain cost directly from the point cloud. The second, a learning-based approach, predicts an IMU response solely from geometric point cloud data using a 2D-Convolutional-LSTM neural network. This allows us to estimate the cost of a patch without directly driving over it, based on a data set that maps IMU signals to point cloud patches. Based on the terrain analysis, two continuous cost maps are generated to jointly select the optimal path considering distance and traversability cost for local navigation. We present a real-time terrain analysis strategy applicable for local planning, and furthermore demonstrate the straightforward application of the same approach in batch mode for global planning. Off-road autonomous driving experiments in a large and hybrid site illustrate the applicability of the method. We have made the code available online for users to test the method.

AB Recently, growth in e-commerce has resulted in substantially increased investment in robotic technologies in warehouses, especially for storage and retrieval devices. A shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) is one of the robotic automated storage and retrieval technologies mostly used for a miniload material handling system in e-commerce warehouses. This new technology has been developed as an alternative to the traditional miniload crane-based automated storage and retrieval system. Because it has an autonomous order picker robot in each tier of the racking system, the process rate for this new technology is very high. To evaluate several design options for an SBS/RS warehouse quickly, we have developed analytical models for estimating important performance outputs of these systems. Specifically, this study presents an open queuing network-based software tool that can quickly estimate some important performance metrics for a predefined SBS/RS warehouse design. Once the user enters the required input data values in the tool (e.g., the arrival rate of transactions in the system, warehouse metrics, number of tiers, aisles, and bays, and velocity profiles of devices), the performance metric estimates can be obtained in terms of the mean cycle time of a transaction, the mean energy consumption and energy regeneration per transaction, the mean waiting time of a transaction, the mean number of transactions waiting in a server (lift/shuttle) queue, and the mean utilization of servers.

AB This paper aims to apply real-time light-weight high-precision 3D detection for autonomous driving. We propose LIDAR-based 3D object detection based on foreground segmentation using a fully sparse convolutional network (FS(2)3D). We design a sparse convolutional backbone network and a sparse convolutional detection head to efficiently use the computing and memory resources and accelerate the inference. Instead of using the anchor-based method, we convert the detection problem into a foreground segmentation problem on a bird's-eye view. The sparse convolutional detection head predicts the objectness and bounding box on each active point on the sparse feature map. We design a new oriented bounding box coding method and corresponding loss functions. We predict the endpoints of two mutually perpendicular lines that pass through the foreground active points and indirectly predict the objects' oriented bounding box from these four endpoints. We use the indirectly calculated object center, size, and orientation as inputs of loss functions in the training step. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that the sparse backbone network we designed is 2.2 times faster and 18.4 times fewer FLOPs than the dense backbone network. The average improvement of the loss functions based on the bounding box code is 1.1% and 0.8% on the BEV and 3D detection, respectively, compared to no addition of these losses. Moreover, FS(2)3D outperforms the state-of-the-art LIDAR-based method in speed and precision for both cars and cyclists.

AB Operating Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in subterranean environments is becoming more and more relevant in the field of aerial robotics. Despite the large spectrum of technological advances in the field, flying in such challenging environments is still an ongoing quest that requires the combination of multiple sensor modalities like visual/thermal cameras as well as 3D and 2D lidars. Nevertheless, there exist cases in subterranean environments where the aim is to deploy fast and lightweight aerial robots for area reckoning purposes after an event (e.g. blasting in production areas). This work proposes a novel baseline approach for the navigation of resource constrained robots, introducing the aerial underground scout, with the main goal to rapidly explore unknown areas and provide a feedback to the operator. The main proposed framework focuses on the navigation, control and vision capabilities of the aerial platforms with low-cost sensor suites, contributing significantly towards real-life applications. The merit of the proposed control architecture is that it considers the flying platform as a floating object, composing a velocity controller on the x, y axes and altitude control to navigate along the tunnel. Two novel approaches make up the cornerstone of the proposed contributions for the task of navigation: (1) a vector geometry method based on 2D lidar, and (2) a Deep Learning (DL) method through a classification process based on an on-board image stream, where both methods correct the heading towards the center of the mine tunnel. Finally, the framework has been evaluated in multiple field trials in an underground mine in Sweden. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Stereo vision during adverse weather - Using priors to increase
   robustness in real-time stereo vision
SO IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING

AB Stereo vision can deliver a dense 3D reconstruction of the environment in real-time for driver assistance as well as autonomous driving. Semi-Global Matching (SGM) is a popular method of choice for solving this task which is already in use for production vehicles. Despite the enormous progress in the field and the high level of performance of modern stereo methods, one key challenge remains: robust stereo vision in automotive scenarios during rain, snow and darkness. Under these circumstances, current methods generate strong temporal noise, many disparity outliers and false positives on object level. These problems are addressed in this work by regularizing stereo vision via prior information. We formulate a temporal prior and a scene prior, which we apply to SGM in order to overcome the deficiencies. The temporal prior integrates knowledge from the previous disparity map to exploit the high temporal correlation, the scene prior exploits knowledge of a representative traffic scene. Using these priors, the object detection rate improves significantly on a driver assistance dataset of 3000 frames including bad weather while reducing the rate of erroneous object detections. We also outperform the ECCV Robust Vision Challenge 2012 winner, iSGM, on this dataset. In addition, results are presented for the KITTI dataset, even showing improvements under good weather conditions when exploiting the temporal prior.
   We also show that the temporal and scene priors are easy and efficient to implement on a hybrid CPU/reconfigurable hardware platform. The use of these priors can be extended to other application areas such as mobile robotics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Featured Application This research has a direct application to autonomous cars, as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The condition of the roads where cars circulate is of the utmost importance to ensure that each autonomous or manual car can complete its journey satisfactorily. The existence of potholes, speed bumps, and other irregularities in the pavement can cause car wear and fatal traffic accidents. Therefore, detecting and characterizing these anomalies helps reduce the risk of accidents and damage to the vehicle. However, street images are naturally multivariate, with redundant and substantial information, as well as significantly contaminated measurement noise, making the detection of street anomalies more challenging. In this work, an automatic color image analysis using a deep neural network for the detection of potholes on the road using images taken by a ZED camera is proposed. A lightweight architecture was designed to speed up training and usage. This consists of seven properly connected and synchronized layers. All the pixels of the original image are used without resizing. The classic stride and pooling operations were used to obtain as much information as possible. A database was built using a ZED camera seated on the front of a car. The routes where the photographs were taken are located in the city of Celaya in Guanajuato, Mexico. Seven hundred and fourteen images were manually tagged, several of which contain bumps and potholes. The system was trained with 70% of the database and validated with the remaining 30%. In addition, we propose a database that discriminates between potholes and speed bumps. A precision of 98.13% using 37 convolution filters in a 3 x 3 window was obtained, which improves upon recent state-of-the-art work.

AB To improve the positioning accuracy and reliability of autonomous navigation agricultural machinery and reduce the cost of high-precision positioning, an integrated navigation system based on Real-Time Dynamic Kinematic BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (RTK-BDS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) is designed in this study. On the one hand, an autonomous navigation control board is designed and made in the system, which integrates BDS high-precision analysis module, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) module, and radio module, and realizes the integrated navigation algorithm on the control board. On the other hand, low-cost RTK technology is realized by building differential reference stations and vehicle-mounted mobile stations. Experiments are carried out on actual farm machinery under different road conditions including open road, signal-shielded road, and urban congested road. According to the angular velocity and acceleration information from INS and the position and velocity information from the BDS high-precision analysis module, the system uses Kalman filter algorithm for data fusion to calculate the precise position, velocity, and attitude information of agricultural machinery in real time. The experimental results show that the position error of the integrated navigation system on the open road is within 3 cm, the azimuth error is within 0.6 degrees, and the inclination error is within 1 degrees, all of which converge rapidly when encountering bad road conditions. It can be known from the experimental results that the RTK-BDS/INS integrated navigation system has high positioning accuracy, strong adaptive anti-interference ability, and low implementation cost of RTK technology, which provides a reliable way for automatic navigation control of agricultural machinery.

AB Background: Theranostics, a fusion of two key parts of modern medicine - diagnostics and therapy of the organism's disorders, promises to bring the efficacy of medical treatment to a fundamentally new level and to become the basis of personalized medicine. Extrapolating today's progress in the field of smart materials to the long-run prospect, we can imagine future intelligent agents capable of performing complex analysis of different physiological factors inside the living organism and implementing a built-in program thereby triggering a series of therapeutic actions. These agents, by analogy with their macroscopic counterparts, can be called nanorobots. It is quite obscure what these devices are going to look like but they will be more or less based on today's achievements in nanobiotechnology.
   Scope of Review: The present Review is an attempt to systematize highly diverse nanomaterials, which may potentially serve as modules for theranostic nanorobotics, e.g., nanomotors, sensing units, and payload carriers. Major Conclusions: Biocomputing-based sensing, externally actuated or chemically "fueled" autonomous movement, swarm inter-agent communication behavior are just a few inspiring examples that nanobiotechnology can offer today for construction of truly intelligent drug delivery systems.
   General Significance: The progress of smart nanomaterials toward fully autonomous drug delivery nanorobots is. an exciting prospect for disease treatment. Synergistic combination of the available approaches and their further development may produce intelligent drugs of unmatched functionality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most freshwater aquatic studies rely on Eulerian monitoring, i.e., water quality and quantity are monitored using grab samples or semi-continuous sensors deployed at fixed cross-sections. While Eulerian monitoring is practical, it provides a limited understanding of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We designed and built The Navigator, a Lagrangian (i.e., along a flow path) monitoring system that offers cost-effective solutions for in-situ, real-time data collection in surface freshwater ecosystems. The Navigator features a suite of technologies, including an autonomous surface vehicle with GPS and LTE connectivity, water quality sensors, a depth sonar, a camera, and a webpage dashboard to visualize real-time data. With these technologies, The Navigator provides insight into where, how, and why water quality and quantity change over time and space as it moves with the current or follows user-specified pathways. We tested The Navigator monitoring water quality parameters at high spatial -temporal resolution in multiple surface water bodies in New Mexico (USA) to: (1) identify water quality changes associated with land use changes along a 7th-order reach in the Rio Grande, (2) identify the fate of wildfire disturbances similar to 175 km downstream of a burned watershed affected by the largest wildfire ever recorded in the state, (3) monitor the water quality of a recreational fishing pond in the City of Albuquerque. Our three successful tests confirm that The Navigator is an affordable (USD 5,101 in 2023) monitoring system that can be used to address questions involving mass and energy balances in surface waters.

AB The separate control method of flippers and the movement of the mass center makes the active articulated tracked robot unable to realize higher-level motion and difficult to adapt to rough and complex obstacle terrain. In this paper, a new design method of distributed autonomous obstacle traversal controller for the novel six-track robot is proposed. The controller establishes a unified control framework that includes all degrees of freedom of the robot so that the center of mass tracking error and flipper motion tracking error can converge simultaneously to achieve obstacle traversal independently of specific terrain or tasks. First, the forward kinematics model and differential kinematics model of tracked robot are established to generate 3D motion, including flipper angular velocity and body traction velocity. Then, the differential drive robot model is extended into the differential kinematic model to eliminate the slip effect during obstacle traversal. Finally, the feedback control law of the control system and the optimal solution for the singular position of the robot structure are established. In addition, several simulation experiments and physical prototype experiments in different obstacle terrains are executed. In the virtual simulation experiment, the average trajectory error of the flipper is about 0.029 m. In the physical prototype experiment, compared to the manual remote controller and the prior art controller, the average error norm of the center of mass is reduced by 40.7% and 13.5%, respectively; the maximum slip norm is reduced by 34.6% and 19.9%, respectively; and the obstacle crossing time is reduced by 21.3% and 9.3%, respectively, and they validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the designed controller.

AB Simultaneously predicting the future trajectories of heterogeneous multiple agents in a neighborhood is crucial for ensuring the safe and efficient operations of autonomous vehicles in intelligent transportation systems. The unsignalized roundabout is a typical traffic scenario wherein the multivariate and complex information interactions make the prediction task challenging. To address the aforementioned challenges, a macro-micro-hierarchical spatio-temporal attention (MMH-STA) architecture, which can effectively extract the temporal and spatial features of multiple agents based on the interaction mechanism, is presented in this article. This work makes three contributions: 1) A novel hierarchical framework, which considers the heterogeneity of different types of agents, is proposed for trajectory prediction in the roundabout environment. Similarly, the macro-state for interaction with the roundabout structure and the micro-state for interaction with other agents are introduced for an agent. 2) A heterogeneous graph is devised to represent the spatial interactions of a multi-agent, which is reflected in connections between different types of agents and the properties of nodes and edges in the graph. 3) A novel heterogeneous graph attention network with a multi-order neighborhood is designed to describe the spatial feature interactions in the neighborhood. Finally, a characterized decoder forecasts the future trajectories of multiple agents concomitantly. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model can effectively implement multi-agent trajectory prediction in roundabout scenarios with high accuracy and state-of-the-art performance compared to the baseline.

AB The recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has revolutionized traditional agriculture with intelligence and automation. In a typical intelligent agriculture (IA) ecosystem, massive and real-time data are generated, analyzed, and sent to the cloud server (CS) for the purpose of addressing complex agricultural issues, such as yield prediction, water feed calculation, and so on. This helps farmer and associated stakeholders to take correct decision that improves the yield and quality of agricultural product. However, the distributed nature of IA entities and the usage of insecure wireless communication open various challenges related to data sharing, monitoring, storage, and further makes the entire IA ecosystem vulnerable to various potential attacks. In this article, we exploit deep learning and smart contract to propose a new IoT-enabled IA framework for enabling secure data sharing among its various entities. Specifically, first we develop new authentication and key management scheme to ensure secure data transmission in IoT-enabled IA. The encrypted transactions are then used by the CS to analyze and further detect intrusions by a novel deep learning architecture. In CS, the smart contract (SC)-based consensus mechanism is executed on legitimate transactions that verifies and adds the formed blocks into blockchain by a peer-to-peer CSs network. In comparison to existing competing security solutions, a rigorous comparative research demonstrates that the proposed approach provides greater security and more utility characteristics.

AB In this paper, a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) space-time-frequency (S-T-F) non-stationary channel model with time-space consistency for sixth generation (6G) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless communication systems is proposed. In the proposed model, the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission and non-LoS (NLoS) transmission through ground reflection, single-clusters, and twin-clusters are modeled. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional (3D) continuously arbitrary trajectory and the self-rotation of UAV are imitated. To capture the time-space consistency and S-T-F non-stationarity simultaneously, a new UAV-related non-stationary modeling algorithm that integrates the visibility region (VR), frequency-dependent path gain, and survival probability is developed for the first time. In this algorithm, the UAV-related parameters are considered, including UAV's height, 3D moving velocity, and self-rotation angles. In the proposed model, the calculation of channel impulse response (CIR) is developed, which considers the cluster density index influenced by communication scenarios, frequency, UAV's height, and the distance between transceivers. Some important channel statistical properties, such as S-T-F correlation function (STF-CF), Doppler power spectral density (DPSD), and stationary interval, are derived. Finally, simulation results match well with ray-tracing-based results, which verifies the utility of the proposed model.

AB The definition of pedestrian behavior when crossing the street and facing potential collision situations is crucial for the design of new Autonomous Emergency Braking systems (AEB) in commercial vehicles. To this end, this article proposes the generation of classification models through the deployment of machine learning techniques that can predict whether there will be a collision depending on the type of reaction, the lane where it occurs, the visual acuity the level of attention, and consider the most relevant factors that determine the cognitive and movement characteristics of pedestrians. Thereby, the inclusion of this type of model in the decision-making algorithm of the AEB system allows for modulating its response. For this purpose, relevant information on pedestrian behavior is obtained through experiments made in an ad-hoc, Virtual Reality (VR) environment, using a portable backpack system in three urban scenarios with different characteristics. Database generation, feature selection, and k-fold cross-validation generate the inputs to the supervised learning models. A subsequent analysis of the accuracy, optimization, error measurement, variable importance, and classification capability is conducted. The tree-based models provide more balanced results for the performance metrics (with higher accuracy for the single decision tree case) and are more easily interpretable and adaptable to the algorithm. From them it is deduced the high importance of the reaction type and the relative position where it occurs, coinciding with the high significance of these factors in the analyzed collisions.

AB Vision based solutions for the localization of vehicles have become popular recently. In this study, we employ an image retrieval based visual localization approach, in which database images are kept with GPS coordinates and the location of the retrieved database image serves as the position estimate of the query image in a city scale driving scenario. Regarding this approach, most existing studies only use descriptors extracted from RGB images and do not exploit semantic content. We show that localization can be improved via descriptors extracted from semantically segmented images, especially when the environment is subjected to severe illumination, seasonal or other long-term changes. We worked on two separate visual localization datasets, one of which (Malaga Streetview Challenge) has been generated by us and made publicly available. Following the extraction of semantic labels in images, we trained a CNN model for localization in a weakly-supervised fashion with triplet ranking loss. The optimized semantic descriptor can be used on its own for localization or preferably it can be used together with a state-ofthe-art RGB image based descriptor in hybrid fashion to improve accuracy. Our experiments reveal that the proposed hybrid method is able to increase the localization performance of the standard (RGB image based) approach up to 7.7% regarding Top-1 Recall values.

AB In outdoor sports such as alpine skiing, athletes hope to obtain information such as movement trajectory and speed to achieve scientific training. The portable sensor has a sense of restraint and affects the athlete's performance. Cameras have difficulty capturing the whole race in an outdoor environment. For alpine skiing needs, we designed an alpine skiing information acquisition system, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and ground cameras to obtain information on the whole path of the race. The environment of the alpine skiing field, the high-speed curvilinear movement of athletes and the flight characteristics of UAVs cause challenges in the detection and tracking of athletes by UAVs. To realize the detection and tracking of alpine skiing by UAVs, we propose a detection algorithm by combining neural networks and correlation filters. A tracking confidence score based on the motion distance of the interval frame is defined. When the tracking confidence of the neural network detector is less than the threshold, the correlation filter is used to expand the recognition range and realize redetection. In addition, we created and annotated a fresh alpine skiing dataset. We compare our algorithm with four advanced algorithms on the UAV123 dataset. Three methods are used to evaluate the performance of our method on the alpine skiing sequence dataset. From the simulation results, our algorithm outperforms the comparison methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Therefore, our algorithm has application value in the scientific training of alpine skiers.

ID STRATEGY
AB This paper proposes a demand response method to reduce the long-term charging cost of single plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) while overcoming obstacles such as the stochastic nature of the user's driving behaviour, traffic condition, energy usage, and energy price. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with an unknown transition probability matrix and solved using deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The proposed method does not require any initial data on the PEV driver's behaviour and shows improvement on learning speed when compared to a pure model-free reinforcement learning method. A combination of model-based and model-free learning methods called Dyna-Q reinforcement learning is utilized in our strategy. Every time a real experience is obtained, the model is updated, and the RL agent will learn from both the real experience and "imagined" experiences from the model. Due to the vast amount of state space, a table-lookup method is impractical, and a value approximation method using deep neural networks is employed for estimating the long-term expected reward of all state-action pairs. An average of historical price and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network are used to predict future price. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and its ability to reach an optimal policy quicker while avoiding state of charge (SOC) depletion during trips when compared to existing PEV charging schemes.

AB Sags and tunnels are major bottlenecks, where the road capacity is reduced, and the "capacity drop" phenomenon occurs; however, there is no simple model or theory that can explain the formation and other characteristics of capacity drop. This paper presents a car-following model, which is equivalent to a continuum model in the Lagrangian coordinates. The model is built on two main assumptions: (i) inhomogeneous fundamental diagrams with location-dependent time gaps, and (ii) bounded acceleration. We first demonstrate that the stationary speed profiles, the low acceleration rates, the dropped capacity, and the approximate time duration of the capacity drop formation in the model are consistent with empirical observations. Then the impacts on the stationary states and dropped capacity of the numerical viscosity caused by the discretization method are investigated, and it is shown that the dropped capacity converges to the theoretical value. Further, a one-dimensional iterated function system is proposed to model the formation mechanism of the capacity drop, which is derived by investigating the spatial pattern of equilibrium and bounded acceleration traffic states that arises in a lead-vehicle problem. Utilizing this model, we uncover a set of properties of the capacity drop such as existence, uniqueness, global convergence, and convergence speed. Finally, the model is applied to analyze the impacts of heterogeneous drivers. The model and insights in this study will help to develop control and management schemes to alleviate capacity drop effects with connected and autonomous vehicles in the future.

AB Recent advancements in computer vision led to the development of a real-time surveillance system which ensures the safety and security of the people in public places. An aerial surveillance system will be advantageous in this scenario using a platform like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) will be very reliable and can be considered as a cost-effective option for this task. To make the system fully autonomous, we require real-time abnormal event detection. But, this is computationally complex and time-consuming due to the heavy load on the UAV, which affords limited processing and payload capacity. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective approach for aerial surveillance in which we move the large computation tasks to the cloud while keeping limited computation on-board UAV device using edge computing technique. Further, our proposed system will maintain the minimum communication between UAV and cloud. Thus it not only reduces the network traffic but also reduces the end-to-end delay. The proposed method is based on the state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) technique for real-time object detection deployed on edge computing device using Intel neural compute stick Movidius VPU (Vision Processing Unit), and we applied abnormal event detection using motion influence map on the cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system reduces the end-to-end delay. Further, Tiny YOLO is six times faster while processing the frames per second (fps) when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

AB This paper presents a novel path planning method for mobile robots in complex and dynamic environments using Voronoi diagram (VD) and computation geometry technique (CGT) termed, VD-CGT. An algorithm to categorize moving obstacles based on their positions, velocities, distances, and directions to ascertain their collision threat level and possible replanning decision is introduced. The initial path computation is done using morphological dilation, VD, A-star, and cubic spline algorithms. Instead of considering the entire map of the environment, CGT is used to compute a small rectangular region estimated to enclose a detected collision-threat obstacle and the current position of the robot. The roadmap is computed in the geometrical shape using VD and nodes are added to the initial roadmap nodes to compute a new path for replanning. To avoid increasing time and space requirements, these nodes are discarded before subsequent replanning is done. The results indicate better path replanning performance in complex and dynamic environments in terms of success path computation rate, path cost, time, and the number of replanning computations compared with other five popular related path planning approaches. The proposed method is efficient, and it computes safe and shortest replan path to goal with low computation time requirement. Unnecessary replanning computations are avoided which aid in reducing time and distance to get to the goal. With the performance results, the proposed method is a promising method for achieving safe, less path cost, and time in path replanning computations in complex and dynamic environments.

AB In this paper, an autonomous UCAV air combat maneuvering decision method based on LSHADE-TSO optimization in a model predictive control framework is proposed, along with enemy trajectory prediction. First, a sliding window recursive prediction method for multi-step enemy trajectory prediction using a Bi-LSTM network is proposed. Second, Model Predictive Control (MPC) theory is introduced, and when combined with enemy trajectory prediction, a UCAV maneuver decision model based on the MPC framework is proposed. The LSHADE-TSO algorithm is proposed by combining the LSHADE and TSO algorithms, which overcomes the problem of traditional sequential quadratic programming falling into local optimum when solving complex nonlinear models. The LSHADE-TSO-MPC air combat maneuver decision method is then proposed, which combines the LSHADE-TSO algorithm with the MPC framework and employs the LSHADE-TSO algorithm as the optimal control sequence solver. To validate the effectiveness of the maneuvering decision method proposed in this paper, it is tested against the test maneuver and the LSHADE-TSO decision algorithm, respectively, and the experimental results show that the maneuvering decision method proposed in this paper can beat the opponent and win the air combat using the same weapons and flight platform. Finally, to demonstrate that LSHADE-TSO can better exploit the decision-making ability of the MPC model, LSHADE-TSO is compared to various optimization algorithms based on the MPC model, and the results show that LSHADE-TSO-MPC can not only help obtain air combat victory faster but also demonstrates better decision-making ability.

AB As transportation network companies and automobile manufacturers continue to invest in the development of self-driving vehicles, it can be expected that autonomous taxi (a-taxi) fleets will become a major component of on-demand transport services in the foreseeable future. The ma-jority of existing automated fleet management systems focus on central dispatch strategies that rely on real-time information and communication. This paper proposes a novel decentralised cooperative cruising method for offline operation of a-taxi fleets, which serves as a contingency plan during a full communication shutdown. The proposed method acts as an emergency plan for the system to continue serving passengers with the objective of maximising the total number of served passengers by the fleet. The method uses historical trip data to estimate PageRank cen-tralities of roads as a proxy of long-term likelihood of finding waiting passengers over a series of trips. The proposed method uses this metric to (i) compute weighted shortest paths for vacant a-taxi cruising route planning, and (ii) partition the network into homogeneous regions for effective cruising destination choice (mission planning). The movements of vacant a-taxis between regions are modelled as a Markov chain such that a transition probability matrix is computed to achieve the optimal spatial distribution of vacant a-taxis to maximise the total expected pick-ups by the fleet, estimated based on bilateral meeting functions. Compared to benchmark strategies which select destinations randomly and cruise along the shortest travel time path, the proposed method shows significant improvements in service performances for different fleet sizes.

AB The safety-critical applications of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) require high reliability and low transmission latency. IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 802.11bd are two standards proposed for such vehicular communication systems. In this paper, we propose an effective SINR-based model to conduct the QoS analysis of IEEE 802.11p/bd driven VANETs for safety applications. First, a semi-Markov process (SMP) model with a D/G/1/1 queue is tailored and modified for characterizing channel access behavior of IEEE 802.11 broadcast networks with deterministic message generation rate. Then, a novel approach is developed to derive the distribution of signal-to-interference-to-noise ratio (SINR) on each receiver in the VANET, given general channel fading/shadowing models as well as general node geometry distributions. Consequently, various QoS metrics in Physical/MAC/Application layer of VANETs are defined and evaluated. Compared with the existed analytic SINR-based models for broadcast VANETs, the proposed models are more general, more accurate, and are faster to solve. Finally, a new mechanism is shown to map the performance in physical layer into the QoS quantification in higher layer so that the QoS prediction of IEEE 80211bd driven VANETs is enabled. Furthermore, comparison between 802.11p and 802.11bd is conducted regarding how the stringent QoS requirements of selected safety applications in both human driving VANETs and autonomous driving VANETs are met by the two communication systems. Constructive conclusions are given on the suitability of IEEE 802.11bd for VANET critical safety services and the directions of future development.

AB An essential component for the autonomous flight or air-to-ground surveillance of a UAV is an object detection device. It must possess a high detection accuracy and requires real-time data processing to be employed for various tasks such as search and rescue, object tracking and disaster analysis. With the recent advancements in multimodal data-based object detection architectures, autonomous driving technology has significantly improved, and the latest algorithm has achieved an average precision of up to 96%. However, these remarkable advances may be unsuitable for the image processing of UAV aerial data directly onboard for object detection because of the following major problems: (1) Objects in aerial views generally have a smaller size than in an image and they are uneven and sparsely distributed throughout an image; (2) Objects are exposed to various environmental changes, such as occlusion and background interference; and (3) The payload weight of a UAV is limited. Thus, we propose employing a new real-time onboard object detection architecture, an RGB aerial image and a point cloud data (PCD) depth map image network (RGDiNet). A faster region-based convolutional neural network was used as the baseline detection network and an RGD, an integration of the RGB aerial image and the depth map reconstructed by the light detection and ranging PCD, was utilized as an input for computational efficiency. Performance tests and evaluation of the proposed RGDiNet were conducted under various operating conditions using hand-labeled aerial datasets. Consequently, it was shown that the proposed method has a superior performance for the detection of vehicles and pedestrians than conventional vision-based methods.

AB Coastal marine ecosystems are profoundly influenced by processes that originate from their boundaries. These include fluid boundaries with the atmosphere, oceanic boundary currents and terrestrial aquatic systems, as well as solid boundaries with the seafloor and coast. Phytoplankton populations transfer complexly interacting boundary influences into the biosphere. In this contribution, we apply data from an ocean observing and modeling system to examine boundary influences driving phytoplankton ecology in Monterey Bay, CA, USA. The study was focused on species that may cause harmful algal blooms (HABs). During September-October 2010, autonomous molecular analytical devices were moored at two locations characterized by different degrees of stratification and exposure to upwelling dynamics. The time-series revealed multiple transitions in local HAB phytoplankton communities, involving diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.), dinoflagellates (Alexandrium catenella), and raphidophytes (Heterosigma akashiwo). Observational and model results showed that the biological transitions were closely related to environmental changes that resulted from a variety of boundary processes responses of oceanic circulation to wind forcing, influxes of different water types that originated outside the bay, and emergence of strongly stratified nearshore water into the greater bay. Boundary processes were further implicated at patch scales. High-resolution mapping and sampling of a phytoplankton-enriched patch were conducted in a Lagrangian framework using autonomous underwater vehicles. These highly resolved measurements showed that small-scale spatial patterns in the toxicity of Pseudo-nitzschia populations were related to the coupling of resuspended sediments from the bottom boundary layer to the surface mixed layer.

AB The early detection of damaged (partially broken) outdoor insulators in primary distribution systems is of paramount importance for continuous electricity supply and public safety. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present a safer, autonomous, and efficient way to examine the power system components without closing the power distribution system. In this work, a novel dataset is designed by capturing real images using UAVs and manually generated images collected to overcome the data insufficiency problem. A deep Laplacian pyramid-based super-resolution network is implemented to reconstruct high-resolution training images. To improve the visibility of low-light images, a low-light image enhancement technique is used for the robust exposure correction of the training images. A different fine-tuning strategy is implemented for fine-tuning the object detection model to increase detection accuracy for the specific faulty insulators. Several flight path strategies are proposed to overcome the shuttering effect of insulators, along with providing a less complex and time- and energy-efficient approach for capturing a video stream of the power system components. The performance of different object detection models is presented for selecting the most suitable one for fine-tuning on the specific faulty insulator dataset. For the detection of damaged insulators, our proposed method achieved an F1-score of 0.81 and 0.77 on two different datasets and presents a simple and more efficient flight strategy. Our approach is based on real aerial inspection of in-service porcelain insulators by extensive evaluation of several video sequences showing robust fault recognition and diagnostic capabilities. Our approach is demonstrated on data acquired by a drone in Swat, Pakistan.

AB We present a survey on maritime object detection and tracking approaches, which are essential for the development of a navigational system for autonomous ships. The electrooptical (EO) sensor considered here is a video camera that operates in the visible or the infrared spectra, which conventionally complements radar and sonar for situational awareness at sea and has demonstrated its effectiveness over the last few years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction, and foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The key processes involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background, and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation. The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime systems that use EO sensors. The survey also highlights methods from computer vision research, which hold promise to perform well in maritime EO data processing. Performance of several maritime and computer vision techniques is evaluated on Singapore Maritime Dataset.

ID SYSTEMS
AB We present a methodology for automatic synthesis of embedded control software that incorporates a class of linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications sufficient to describe a wide range of properties including safety, stability, progress, obligation, response and guarantee. To alleviate the associated computational complexity of LTL synthesis, we propose a receding horizon framework that effectively reduces the synthesis problem into a set of smaller problems. The proposed control structure consists of a goal generator, a trajectory planner, and a continuous controller. The goal generator reduces the trajectory generation problem into a sequence of smaller problems of short horizon while preserving the desired system-level temporal properties. Subsequently, in each iteration, the trajectory planner solves the corresponding short-horizon problem with the currently observed state as the initial state and generates a feasible trajectory to be implemented by the continuous controller. Based on the simulation property, we show that the composition of the goal generator, trajectory planner and continuous controller and the corresponding receding horizon framework guarantee the correctness of the system with respect to its specification regardless of the environment in which the system operates. In addition, we present a response mechanism to handle failures that may occur due to a mismatch between the actual system and its model. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through an example of an autonomous vehicle navigating an urban environment. This example also illustrates that the system is not only robust with respect to exogenous disturbances but is also capable of properly handling violation of the environment assumption that is explicitly stated as part of the system specification.

AB Gene transfer to the central nervous system provides powerful methodology for the study of gene function and gene-environment interactions in vivo, in addition to a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic transgenes for gene therapy. The aim of the present study was to determine patterns of tropism exhibited by pseudotyped lentiviral vectors in the rat substantia nigra, in order to evaluate their utility for gene transfer in experimental models of Parkinson's disease. Isogenic lentiviral vector particles encoding a GFP reporter were pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins derived from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Mokola virus (MV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), or Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV). Adult male Lewis rats received unilateral stereotactic infusions of vector into the substantia nigra; three weeks later, patterns of viral transduction were determined by immunohistological detection of GFP. Different pseudotypes gave rise to transgene expression in restricted and distinct cellular populations. VSV and MV pseudotypes transduced midbrain neurons, including a subset of nigral dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, LCMV- and MuLV-pseudotyped lentivirus produced transgene expression exclusively in astrocytes; the restricted transduction of astroglial cells was not explained by the cellular distribution of receptors previously shown to mediate entry of LCMV or MuLV. These data suggest that pseudotyped lentiviral vectors will be useful for experimental gene transfer to the rat substantia nigra. In particular, the availability of neuronal and astrocytic-targeting vectors will allow dissociation of cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous functions of key gene products in vivo.

AB Road segmentation has been one of the leading research areas in the realm of autonomous driving cars due to the possible benefits autonomous vehicles can offer. Significant reduction of crashes, greater independence for the people with disabilities, and reduced traffic congestion on the roads are some of the vivid examples of them. Considering the importance of self-driving cars, it is vital to develop models that can accurately segment drivable regions of roads. The recent advances in the area of deep learning have presented effective methods and techniques to tackle road segmentation tasks effectively. However, the results of most of them are not satisfactory for implementing them into practice. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel model, dubbed as TA-Unet, that is able to produce quality drivable road region segmentation maps. The proposed model incorporates a triplet attention module into the encoding stage of the U-Net network to compute attention weights through the triplet branch structure. Additionally, to overcome the class-imbalance problem, we experiment on different loss functions, and confirm that using a mixed loss function leads to a boost in performance. To validate the performance and efficiency of the proposed method, we adopt the publicly available UAS dataset, and compare its results to the framework of the dataset and also to four state-of-the-art segmentation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed TA-Unet outperforms baseline methods both in terms of pixel accuracy and mIoU, with 98.74% and 97.41%, respectively. Finally, the proposed method yields clearer segmentation maps on different sample sets compared to other baseline methods.

AB Diesel-powered, human-driven buses currently dominate public transit options in most U.S. cities, yet they produce health, environmental, and cost concerns. Emerging technologies may improve fleet operations by cost-effectively reducing emissions. This study analyzes both battery-electric buses and self-driving (autonomous) buses from both cost and qualitative perspectives, using the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority's bus fleet in Austin, Texas. The study predicts battery-electric buses, including the required charging infrastructure, will become lifecycle cost-competitive in or before the year 2030 at existing U.S. fuel prices ($2.00/gallon), with the specific year depending on the actual rate of cost decline and the diesel bus purchase prices. Rising diesel prices would result in immediate cost savings before reaching $3.30 per gallon. Self-driving buses will reduce or eliminate the need for human drivers, one of the highest current operating costs of transit agencies. Finally, this study develops adoption schedules for these technologies. Recognizing bus lifespans and driver contracts, and assuming battery-electric bus adoption beginning in year-2020, cumulative break-even (neglecting extrinsic benefits, such as respiratory health) occurs somewhere between 2030 and 2037 depending on the rate of battery cost decline and diesel-bus purchase prices. This range changes to 2028 if self-driving technology is available for simultaneous adoption on new electric bus purchases beginning in 2020. The results inform fleet operators and manufacturers of the budgetary implications of converting a bus fleet to electric power, and what cost parameters allow electric buses to provide budgetary benefits over their diesel counterparts.

AB Road detection is one of the crucial tasks for scene understanding in autonomous driving. Recently, methods based on deep learning had rapidly grown and addressed this task excellently, because they can extract more abundant features. In this study, the authors consider the visual road detection problem as a classification for each pixel of the given image, which is road or non-road. There is complex illumination encounter in traffic applications, so that the detection model has poor adaptability. They address this problem by proposing a deep network architecture, which combines the network U-Net-prior and domain adaptation model (DAM). U-Net-prior is a modified segmentation network which integrates location prior and shape prior into U-Net. DAM is a model for reducing the gap between training images and test images, which is optimised in adversarial learning to make the features extracted from different datasets close to each other. They validate the effectiveness of each component of the algorithm, and compare the overall architecture with other state-of-the-art methods, and the results show that the architecture achieves top accuracies with the shortest run time in monocular-vision-based methods, simultaneously, compared with the methods based on other sensors, the architecture also achieves a competitive result.

AB Interleukin-1 (IL-1), a key cytokine that drives neuroinflammation in the Central Nervous System (CNS), is enhanced in many neurological diseases/disorders. Although IL-1 contributes to and/or sustains pathophysiological processes in the CNS, we recently demonstrated that IL-1 can protect cortical astrocytes from oxidant injury in a glutathione (GSH)-dependent manner. To test whether IL-1 could similarly protect neurons against oxidant stress, near pure neuronal cultures or mixed cortical cell cultures containing neurons and astrocytes were exposed to the organic peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), following treatment with IL-1 or its vehicle. Neurons and astrocytes in mixed cultures, but not pure neurons, were significantly protected from the toxicity of t-BOOH following treatment with IL-1 in association with enhanced GSH production/release. IL-1 failed to increase the GSH levels or to provide protection against t-BOOH toxicity in chimeric mixed cultures consisting of IL-1R1(+/+) neurons plated on top of IL-1R1(-/-) astrocytes. The attenuation of GSH release via block of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) transport also abrogated the protective effect of IL-1. These protective effects were not strictly an in vitro phenomenon as we found an increased striatal vulnerability to 3-nitropropionic acid-mediated oxidative stress in IL-1R1 null mice. Overall, our data indicate that IL-1 protects neurons against oxidant injury and that this likely occurs in a non-cell-autonomous manner that relies on an increase in astrocyte GSH production and release.

AB Decision making is a fundamental ability for intelligent agents (e.g., humanoid robots and unmanned aerial vehicles). During decision making process, agents can improve the strategy for interacting with the dynamic environment through reinforcement learning. Many state-of-the-art reinforcement learning models deal with relatively smaller number of state-action pairs, and the states are preferably discrete, such as Q-learning and Actor-Critic algorithms. While in practice, in many scenario, the states are continuous and hard to be properly discretized. Better autonomous decision making methods need to be proposed to handle these problems. Inspired by the mechanism of decision making in human brain, we propose a general computational model, named as prefrontal cortex-basal ganglia (PFC-BG) algorithm. The proposed model is inspired by the biological reinforcement learning pathway and mechanisms from the following perspectives: (1) Dopamine signals continuously update reward-relevant information for both basal ganglia and working memory in prefrontal cortex. (2) We maintain the contextual reward information in working memory. This has a top-down biasing effect on reinforcement learning in basal ganglia. The proposed model separates the continuous states into smaller distinguishable states, and introduces continuous reward function for each state to obtain reward information at different time. To verify the performance of our model, we apply it to many UAV decision making experiments, such as avoiding obstacles and flying through window and door, and the experiments support the effectiveness of the model. Compared with traditional Q-learning and Actor-Critic algorithms, the proposed model is more biologically inspired, and more accurate and faster to make decision.

AB Storm-driven sediment resuspension is an episodic process that is an important constraint on sediment transport on continental shelves; unfortunately, the spatial variability of the resuspension and transport processes are poorly quantified using traditional sampling techniques. Using two autonomous underwater gliders, long-range high frequency radar and buoy data, we quantified spatial variability of sediment resuspension and transport in a large fall storm in November of 2009. Wave, wind and current data in conjunction with glider profiles showed that waves and winds mixed the water column, waves initially mobilized the sediment and shear induced turbulence advected sediment throughout the water column. The separation of over 50 km between the two gliders (RU05 and RU21) is used to highlight the spatial variability of sediment resuspension. Both gliders were operating along the 40 m isobath with RU21 located 50 km north of RU05. Sediment resuspension on the New Jersey (NJ) shelf responded to synoptically forced turbulent motions. Currents transported this sediment toward the southwest in the along-shelf axis and onshore on the cross-shelf axis during the peak resuspension on November 13th through November 14th, with resuspension and transport on the southern NJ shelf measured by RU05 approximately twice that of RU21 on the northern MAB. Variability in resuspension profiles between the two gliders was largely a product of smaller mean grain sizes on the southern portion of the NJ shelf. These smaller grain sediment particles had a reduced fall velocity and were more easily retained throughout the water column by turbulent motions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PERCEPTION; NAVIGATION; ROBOT; ROC
AB Autonomous driving is a challenging problem in mobile robotics, particularly when the domain is unstructured, as in an outdoor setting. In addition, field scenarios are often characterized by low visibility as well, due to changes in lighting conditions, weather phenomena including fog, rain, snow and hail, or the presence of dust clouds and smoke. Thus, advanced perception systems are primarily required for an off-road robot to sense and understand its environment recognizing artificial and natural structures, topology, vegetation and paths, while ensuring, at the same time, robustness under compromised visibility. In this paper the use of millimeter-wave radar is proposed as a possible solution for all-weather off-road perception. A self-learning approach is developed to train a classifier for radar image interpretation and autonomous navigation. The proposed classifier features two main stages: an adaptive training stage and a classification stage. During the training stage, the system automatically learns to associate the appearance of radar data with class labels. Then, it makes predictions based on past observations. The training set is continuously updated online using the latest radar readings, thus making it feasible to use the system for long range and long duration navigation, over changing environments. Experimental results, obtained with an unmanned ground vehicle operating in a rural environment, are presented to validate this approach. A quantitative comparison with laser data is also included showing good range accuracy and mapping ability as well. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the utility of millimeter-wave radar as a robotic sensor for persistent and accurate perception in natural scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Land use, transport, and energy-environment integration (LUTEI) is receiving considerable attention as an elaborate approach to improving urban resilience. Research evidence on this multidisciplinary topic tends to be fragmented, hindering constructive analysis of its role in shaping sustainable cities. This paper addresses this by undertaking a holistic systematic review to consolidate diverse perspectives. The analysis of 195 reviewed papers identified four main clusters of knowledge that include methodological approaches, policy instruments, urban design elements, and impacts of interventions. The analysis revealed that a growing body of literature is increasingly focused on improving accessibility planning, transit-oriented development, and policy integration to achieve sustainable and healthy transport as a vital element of resilience in cities. The review found, however, that the integration of environment and energy into land use and transport models is still at a nascent stage of development and has largely been overlooked in traditional LUTI models. This can lead to unreliable assessments of the impacts of low-carbon mobility solutions, emerging green transport technologies, and long-term changes in energy consumption affecting sustainable mobility futures. This paper concludes by connecting LUTEI dimensions to the UN's sustainable development goals (SDG), outlining future directions to ignite meaningful research on the topic and providing a transparent path for decision-makers to adopt LUTEI-informed planning.

AB The research presented in this article focuses on expanding and deepening the prior research of a low-cost terminal guidance system in a previous paper entitled "Design, implementation and verification of a low-cost terminal guidance system for small fixed-wing UAVs." An automatic terminal guidance workflow is specially designed for an individual in a small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV) swarm. The extended work around the proposed workflow primarily involves upgrading onboard hardware modules to improve sensor accuracy and environmental adaptability, the imaging performance of the seeker, as well as the computational capability of the image processor, applying object detection to replace the human-in-the-loop function and adopting the integral proportional guidance law in the vertical direction to reduce the required overload and obtain a larger impact angle. Furthermore, we conducted several field tests on two types of SUAV against a stationary target on the ground in a field scenario. The experiments have generated valuable onboard image data and SUAV status information, all of which are aligned in the time domain. The only remaining data sets that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author. Our study into automatic terminal guidance has yielded a solution of the automatic strap-down monocular terminal guidance problem of individual SUAVs. The field trials of a single SUAV demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed automatic terminal guidance methodology and lays a foundation for the future SUAVs' cooperative attack test.

AB Purpose
   This work aims to combine the cloud robotics technologies with deep reinforcement learning to build a distributed training architecture and accelerate the learning procedure of autonomous systems. Especially, a distributed training architecture for navigating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complicated dynamic environments is proposed.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study proposes a distributed training architecture named experience-sharing learner-worker (ESLW) for deep reinforcement learning to navigate UAVs in dynamic environments, which is inspired by cloud-based techniques. With the ESLW architecture, multiple worker nodes operating in different environments can generate training data in parallel, and then the learner node trains a policy through the training data collected by the worker nodes. Besides, this study proposes an extended experience replay (EER) strategy to ensure the method can be applied to experience sequences to improve training efficiency. To learn more about dynamic environments, convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) modules are adopted to extract spatiotemporal information from training sequences.
   Findings
   Experimental results demonstrate that the ESLW architecture and the EER strategy accelerate the convergence speed and the ConvLSTM modules specialize in extract sequential information when navigating UAVs in dynamic environments.
   Originality/value
   Inspired by the cloud robotics technologies, this study proposes a distributed ESLW architecture for navigating UAVs in dynamic environments. Besides, the EER strategy is proposed to speed up training processes of experience sequences, and the ConvLSTM modules are added to networks to make full use of the sequential experiences.

AB Objective
   We experimentally test the effect of cognitive load on auditory susceptibility during automated driving.
   Background
   In automated vehicles, auditory alerts are frequently used to request human intervention. To ensure safe operation, human drivers need to be susceptible to auditory information. Previous work found reduced susceptibility during manual driving and in a lesser amount during automated driving. However, in practice, drivers also perform nondriving tasks during automated driving, of which the associated cognitive load may further reduce susceptibility to auditory information. We therefore study the effect of cognitive load during automated driving on auditory susceptibility.
   Method
   Twenty-four participants were driven in a simulated automated car. Concurrently, they performed a task with two levels of cognitive load: repeat a noun or generate a verb that expresses the use of this noun. Every noun was followed by a probe stimulus to elicit a neurophysiological response: the frontal P3 (fP3), which is a known indicator for the level of auditory susceptibility.
   Results
   The fP3 was significantly lower during automated driving with cognitive load compared with without. The difficulty level of the cognitive task (repeat or generate) showed no effect.
   Conclusion
   Engaging in other tasks during automated driving decreases auditory susceptibility as indicated by a reduced fP3.
   Application
   Nondriving task can create additional cognitive load. Our study shows that performing such tasks during automated driving reduces the susceptibility for auditory alerts. This can inform designers of semi-automated vehicles (SAE levels 3 and 4), where human intervention might be needed.

AB Paths planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in a dynamic environment is considered a challenging task in autonomous flight control design. In this work, an efficient method based on a Multi-Objective Multi Verse Optimization (MOMVO) algorithm is proposed and successfully applied to solve the path planning problem of quadrotors with moving obstacles. Such a path planning task is formulated as a multicriteria optimization problem under operational constraints. The proposed MOMVO-based planning approach aims to lead the drone to traverse the shortest path from the starting point and the target without collision with moving obstacles. The vehicle moves to the next position from its current one such that the line joining minimizes the total path length and allows aligning its direction towards the goal. To choose the best compromise solution among all the non-dominated Pareto ones obtained for compromise objectives, the modified Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is investigated. A set of homologous metaheuristics such as Multiobjective Salp Swarm Algorithm (MSSA), Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer (MOGWO), Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), and Non-Dominated Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) is used as a basis for the performance comparison. Demonstrative results and statistical analyses show the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed MOMVO-based planning method. The obtained results are satisfactory and encouraging for future practical implementation of the path planning strategy.

AB Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is the communication technology designed to support road safety for drivers and autonomous driving. The light-weight security solution is crucial to meet the real-time needs of on-board V2X applications. However, most of the recently proposed V2X security protocols-based on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)-are not efficient enough to support fast processing and reduce the communication overhead between vehicles. ECDSA provides a high-security level at the cost of excessive communication and computation overhead, which motivates us to propose a light-weight message authentication and privacy preservation protocol for V2X communications. The proposed protocol achieves highly secure message authentication at a substantially lower cost by introducing a hash chain of secret keys for a Message Authentication Code (MAC). We implemented the proposed protocol using commercial V2X devices to prove its performance advantages over the standard and non-standard protocols. We constructed real V2X networks using commercial V2X devices that run our implemented protocol. Our extensive experiments with real networks demonstrate that the proposed protocol reduces the communication overhead by 6 times and computation overhead by more than 100 times compared with the IEEE1609.2 standard. Moreover, the proposed protocol reduces the communication overhead by 4 times and the computation overhead by up to 100 times compared with a non-standard security protocol, TESLA. The proposed protocol substantially reduces the average end-to-end delay to 2.5 ms, which is a 24- and 28-fold reduction, respectively, compared with the IEEE1609 and TESLA protocols.

AB Accurate and timely perception of collision in highly variable environments is still a challenging problem for artificial visual systems. As a source of inspiration, the lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) in locust's visual pathways have been studied intensively, and modelled as quick collision detectors against challenges from various scenarios including vehicles and robots. However, the state-of-the-art LGMD models have not achieved acceptable robustness to deal with more challenging scenarios like the various vehicle driving scenes, due to the lack of adaptive signal processing mechanisms. To address this problem, we propose an improved neuronal system model, called LGMDC, that is featured by novel modelling of spatiotemporal inhibition dynamics with biological plausibilities including 1) lateral inhibitions with global biases defined by a variant of Gaussian distribution, spatially, and 2) an adaptive feedforward inhibition mediation pathway, temporally. Accordingly, the LGMDC performs more effectively to detect merely approaching objects threatening head-on collision risks by appropriately suppressing motion distractors caused by vibrations, near-miss or approaching stimuli with deviations from the centre view. Through evolutionary learning with a systematic dataset of various crash and non-collision driving scenarios, the LGMDC shows improved robustness outperforming the previous related methods. After evolution, its computational simplicity, fiexibility and robustness have also been well demonstrated by real-time experiments of autonomous micro-mobile robots.

AB Improving the effectiveness of spatial shape features classification from 3D lidar data is very relevant because it is largely used as a fundamental step towards higher level scene understanding challenges of autonomous vehicles and terrestrial robots. In this sense, computing neighborhood for points in dense scans becomes a costly process for both training and classification. This paper proposes a new general framework for implementing and comparing different supervised learning classifiers with a simple voxel-based neighborhood computation where points in each non-overlapping voxel in a regular grid are assigned to the same class by considering features within a support region defined by the voxel itself. The contribution provides offline training and online classification procedures as well as five alternative feature vector definitions based on principal component analysis for scatter, tubular and planar shapes. Moreover, the feasibility of this approach is evaluated by implementing a neural network (NN) method previously proposed by the authors as well as three other supervised learning classifiers found in scene processing methods: support vector machines (SVM), Gaussian processes (GP), and Gaussian mixture models (GMM). A comparative performance analysis is presented using real point clouds from both natural and urban environments and two different 3D rangefinders (a tilting Hokuyo UTM-30LX and a Riegl). Classification performance metrics and processing time measurements confirm the benefits of the NN classifier and the feasibility of voxel-based neighborhood.

AB Urban localization with the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) remains an unsolved problem with frequent misdetection of which street or which side of the street the user is located. 3D mapping-aided GNSS uses grid-based GNSS shadow matching and ranging alongside data-driven line-of-sight (LOS) classifiers to improve localization accuracy. However, previous work on shadow matching has not considered the needs of risk-aware autonomous systems. Our prior work introduced a fully set-based version of shadow matching that proposed set-valued maps and localization with computationally efficient set representations. In this work, we extend our prior work to propose Mosaic Zonotope Shadow Matching (MZSM), which provides a mathematical framework to begin addressing risk awareness in 3D mapping-aided GNSS. We employ a classifier-agnostic polytope mosaic architecture to provide risk-aware set-based bounds on urban positioning. We formulate a recursively expanding binary tree that, through set operations, refines an initial set-based location estimate into a mosaic of smaller polytopes. We assess our framework with a 3D building map of San Francisco and emulated classifiers to validate our algorithm's risk-aware improvements. We demonstrate that MZSM provides set-based localization bounds across varied data-driven LOS classifiers and yields a more precise understanding of the uncertainty and risks in 3DMA-GNSS over existing methods. We validate that our tree-based construction is efficient and tractable, computing a mosaic from 14 satellites in 0.63 seconds and growing quadratically in the satellite number.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Food desert communities in the US have a widely recognized gap between the demand for healthy foods and the minimum order size that makes it worthwhile for food purveyors to deliver to such neighborhoods, thereby creating delivery deficiencies. A diverse set of mobility constraints and activity-travel patterns exist for disadvantaged segments in these communities, especially the elderly, unemployed, and socially excluded. Appreciating this complexity, an effective solution would be to improve the food access of such communities by providing faster, inexpensive, and flexible online deliveries of healthy foods. However, little is currently known about the shopping travel pattern in food desert communities and the associated mobility inequalities. This paper fulfills this critical research gap and quantifies the differences in shopping travel behavior observed among consumers residing in food deserts and food oases using data collected from Portland and Nashville Metropolitan areas. The paper subsequently captures the perceived acceptance of autonomous delivery robots (ADRs) among these consumers to overcome their mobility inequalities. The results indicate that food desert residents aged between 18 and 25 years, African Americans and those earning more than $75,000 are more likely to engage in internet shopping than food oasis residents. Despite the perceived potential of ADRs to reduce the mobility inequalities in food deserts, acceptance levels for this emerging technology are found to be significantly less among food desert residents, especially among older generational cohorts and less qualified. This study will provide key takeaways to e-commerce companies to expand their delivery service through ADRs in underserved areas.

AB While remotely operated unmanned vehicles are increasingly a part of everyday life, truly autonomous robots capable of independent operation in dynamic environments have yet to be realized - particularly in the case of ground robots required to interact with humans and their environment. We present a unified multiresolution vision model for this application designed to provide the wide field of view required to maintain situational awareness and sufficient visual acuity to recognize elements of the environment while permitting feasible implementations in real-time vision applications. The model features a kind of color-constant processing through single-opponent color channels and contrast invariant oriented edge detection using a novel implementation of the Combination of Receptive Fields model. The model provides color and edge-based salience assessment, as well as a compressed color image representation suitable for subsequent object identification. We show that bottom-up visual saliency computed using this model is competitive with the current state-of-the-art while allowing computation in a compressed domain and mimicking the human visual system with nearly half (45%) of computational effort focused within the fovea. This method reduces storage requirement of the image pyramid to less than 5% of the full image, and computation in this domain reduces model complexity in terms of both computational costs and memory requirements accordingly. We also quantitatively evaluate the model for its application domain by using it with a camera/lens system with a 185 field of view capturing 3.5M pixel color images by using a tuned salience model to predict human fixations.

AB Sensor data fusion is essential for environmental perception within smart traffic applications. By using multiple sensors cooperatively, the accuracy and probability of the perception are increased, which is crucial for critical traffic scenarios or under bad weather conditions. In this paper, a modular real-time capable multi-sensor fusion framework is presented and tested to fuse data on the object list level from distributed automotive sensors (cameras, radar, and LiDAR). The modular multi-sensor fusion architecture receives an object list (untracked objects) from each sensor. The fusion framework combines classical data fusion algorithms, as it contains a coordinate transformation module, an object association module (Hungarian algorithm), an object tracking module (unscented Kalman filter), and a movement compensation module. Due to the modular design, the fusion framework is adaptable and does not rely on the number of sensors or their types. Moreover, the method continues to operate because of this adaptable design in case of an individual sensor failure. This is an essential feature for safety-critical applications. The architecture targets environmental perception in challenging time-critical applications. The developed fusion framework is tested using simulation and public domain experimental data. Using the developed framework, sensor fusion is obtained well below 10 milliseconds of computing time using an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H mobile processor and the Python programming language. Furthermore, the object-level multi-sensor approach enables the detection of changes in the extrinsic calibration of the sensors and potential sensor failures. A concept was developed to use the multi-sensor framework to identify sensor malfunctions. This feature will become extremely important in ensuring the functional safety of the sensors for autonomous driving.

AB Given the increased interest in smart assistive technologies and autonomous robot vehicles, path planning has emerged as one of the most researched and challenging topics in navigation. Moving to partially known or unknown environment, an assistive navigation system should be able to extract spatiotemporal information and dynamically identify objects and adjust the route. Current approaches typically rely on external services to perform high demanding computations and employ a plethora of overlapping sensors to accurately scan the surrounding environment. This increases their energy demands, size and weight, while incommodes their use in real time applications making their application to wearable assistive systems, such as smart glasses, a challenge. Aiming to provide a comfortable and computationally efficient wearable solution that can be used by human or robotic assistive systems, in this study we propose a novel two-level hierarchical architecture combining global and local path planning. The macroscale navigation involves the construction of the initial global path while the microscale navigation includes the local path planning with obstacle detection and avoidance. The methodology consists of: (i) a novel chaotic ant colony optimization algorithm with fuzzy logic (CACOF) for path construction; (ii) powerful and light weight deep convolutional neural networks for obstacle detection; and (iii) a Bug-like algorithm enhanced with fuzzy rules for obstacle avoidance in case of static objects. A vast experimental evaluation was conducted to test the proposed methodologies in a simulation environment based on the topology of real area. The results proved the computational efficiency and ability of the proposed path planning algorithms to address effectively multi-objective global and path planning problems which make them suitable for real time applications.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly popular in many applications. Nevertheless, AI technologies are still developing, and many issues need to be addressed. Among those, the reliability of AI systems needs to be demonstrated so that AI systems can be used with confidence by the general public. In this paper, we provide statistical perspectives on the reliability of AI systems, focusing on the time dimension. That is, the system can perform its designed functionality for the intended period of time. We introduce a so-called "SMART" statistical framework for AI reliability research, which includes five components: Structure of the system, Metrics of reliability, Analysis of failure causes, Reliability assessment, and Test planning. We review traditional methods in reliability data analysis and software reliability, and discuss how those existing methods can be transformed for reliability modeling and assessment of AI systems. Different from traditional reliability studies, the focus of AI reliability is on the software system to include the training data. Thus, we describe recent developments in modeling and analysis of AI reliability for software systems. The paper outlines statistical research challenges in this area, including out-of-distribution detection, the effect of the training set, adversarial attacks, model accuracy, and uncertainty quantification. We discuss how those topics can be related to AI reliability, with illustrative examples. The final element of SMART (test planning), is critical for the demonstration of AI reliability. Therefore we discuss data collection and testing planning, highlighting methods for improving system design in order to achieve higher AI reliability. The paper closes with some concluding remarks.

AB Underwater navigation system is an indispensable part for autonomous underwater vehicles. Due to the indiscernibility of satellite signal, however, the underwater navigation problem is quite challenging, and a satellite-free navigation scheme should be looked for. Polarization navigation, inspired by insects' capability of autonomous homing and foraging, is an alternative solution to satellite navigation with great application potential. Underwater polarization provides an indirect sun compass to animals for orientation determination. However, it is difficult to apply terrestrial solar-tracking methodologies in underwater situations due to the refraction of polarized skylight at the air-water interface. To resolve this issue, an underwater solar-tracking algorithm is developed based on the underwater refraction-polarization pattern inside the Snell's window. By employing Snell's law and Fresnel refraction formula to decouple the refractive ray bending and polarization deflection, the celestial polarization pattern is obtained based on underwater measurement. To further improve the accuracy, the degree of polarization is employed as a weight factor for E-vector. A long-lasting underwater experiment was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the results showed the root-mean-square errors of solar zenith and azimuth employing this algorithm were 0.3 degrees and 1.3 degrees, respectively. Our experimental results show that the refraction-polarization pattern inside the Snell's window exhibits immense potential to improve the solar-tracking accuracy for underwater navigation.(c) 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

AB Analyzing videos and images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles or aerial drones is an emerging application attracting significant attention from researchers in various areas of computer vision. Currently, the major challenge is the development of autonomous operations to complete missions and replace human operators. In this paper, based on the type of analyzing videos and images captured by drones in computer vision, we have reviewed these applications by categorizing them into three groups. The first group is related to remote sensing with challenges such as camera calibration, image matching, and aerial triangulation. The second group is related to drone-autonomous navigation, in which computer vision methods are designed to explore challenges such as flight control, visual localization and mapping, and target tracking and obstacle detection. The third group is dedicated to using images and videos captured by drones in various applications, such as surveillance, agriculture and forestry, animal detection, disaster detection, and face recognition. Since most of the computer vision methods related to the three categories have been designed for real-world conditions, providing real conditions based on drones is impossible. We aim to explore papers that provide a database for these purposes. In the first two groups, some survey papers presented are current. However, the surveys have not been aimed at exploring any databases. This paper presents a complete review of databases in the first two groups and works that used the databases to apply their methods. Vision-based intelligent applications and their databases are explored in the third group, and we discuss open problems and avenues for future research.

AB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is the process by which a mobile robot carrying specific sensors builds a map of the environment and at the same time uses this map to estimate its pose. Currently, SLAM has been proven its value and is a hot topic. However, challenges still exist: when the mobile robot stops in the process of motion and a large number of feature points in the environment move slightly, the feature matching process cannot eliminate the non-stationary feature point pairs. The introduction of a large number of outliers (non-stationary feature point pairs) seriously affects the observation process of SLAM. It directly leads to the estimation errors of mobile robot pose and the 3D features position, and further leads to keyframe trajectory drift. If there is a mechanism that allows the robot to accurately detect itself in a stop state, then the pose and map points could be locked, and the state variables could be optimized to make the system enter the positive succession. Therefore, detecting the stop status of the mobile robot is a significant work for SLAM. In this manuscript, an improved phase correlation method is proposed to solve the problem of stop detection for the autonomous driving vehicle in the dynamic street environment. After experiments, it is revealed that the stop detection is significant for the performance improvement to the state-of-the-art visual SLAM system, and the improved phase correlation method has higher stop detection accuracy than the conventional phase correlation in various scenarios.

AB The impressive capabilities of the mammalian brain-ranging from perception, pattern recognition and memory formation to decision making and motor activity control-have inspired their re-creation in a wide range of artificial intelligence systems for applications such as face recognition, anomaly detection, medical diagnosis and robotic vehicle control(1). Yet before neuron-based brains evolved, complex biomolecular circuits provided individual cells with the 'intelligent' behaviour required for survival(2). However, the study of how molecules can 'think' has not produced an equal variety of computational models and applications of artificial chemical systems. Although biomolecular systems have been hypothesized to carry out neural-network-like computations in vivo(3,2,4) and the synthesis of artificial chemical analogues has been proposed theoretically(5-9), experimental work(10-13) has so far fallen short of fully implementing even a single neuron. Here, building on the richness of DNA computing(14) and strand displacement circuitry(15), we show how molecular systems can exhibit autonomous brain-like behaviours. Using a simple DNA gate architecture(16) that allows experimental scale-up of multilayer digital circuits(17), we systematically transform arbitrary linear threshold circuits(18) (an artificial neural network model) into DNA strand displacement cascades that function as small neural networks. Our approach even allows us to implement a Hopfield associative memory(19) with four fully connected artificial neurons that, after training in silico, remembers four single-stranded DNA patterns and recalls the most similar one when presented with an incomplete pattern. Our results suggest that DNA strand displacement cascades could be used to endow autonomous chemical systems with the capability of recognizing patterns of molecular events, making decisions and responding to the environment.

AB Featured Application A real-time approach based on an improved label template matching algorithm with an RGB-D sensor was proposed to recognize and locate pallets in a warehouse environment in this paper. The application of this technology can reduce labor and cost savings, as well as provide a level of warehouse automation. (1) Background: Forklifts are used widely in factories, but it shows the problem of large uncertainties when using an RGB-D sensor to recognize and locate pallets in warehouse environments. To enhance the flexibility of current autonomous forklifts in unstructured environments, the improved labeled template matching algorithm was proposed to recognize pallets. (2) Methods: The algorithm comprises four steps: (i) classifying each pixel of a color image with the color feature and obtaining the category matrix; (ii) building a labeled template containing the goods, pallet, and ground category information; (iii) compressing and matching the category matrix and template to determine the region of the pallet; and (iv) extracting the pallet pose from information in respect of the pallet feet. (3) Results: The results show that the proposed algorithm is robust against environmental influences and obstacles and that it can precisely recognize and segment multiple pallets in a warehouse with a 92.6% detection rate. The time consumptions were 72.44, 85.45, 117.63, and 182.84 ms for detection distances of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 mm, respectively. (4) Conclusions: Both static and dynamic experiments were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the detection accuracy is directly related to the detection angle and distance.

AB Low-cost, high-performance vision sensors in conjunction with aerial sensing platforms are providing new possibilities for achieving autonomous visual inspection in civil engineering structures. A large volume of images of a given structure can readily be collected for use in visual inspection, overcoming spatial and temporal limitations associated with human-based inspection. Although researchers have explored several algorithms and techniques for visionbased inspection in recent decades, a major challenge in past implementations lies in dealing with a high volume of images while only a small fraction of them are important for actual inspection. Because processing irrelevant images can generate a significant number of falsepositives, automated visual inspection techniques should be used in coordination with methods to localize relevant regions on the images. When combined, automated visual inspection will be able to meet the objectives and quality of human visual inspection. To enable this technology, we develop and validate a novel automated image localization technique to extract regions of interest (ROIs) on each of the images before utilizing vision-based damage detection techniques. ROIs are the portions of an image that contain the physical region of the structure that is targeted for visual interrogation, denoted as the targeted region of interest (TRI). ROIs are computed based on the geometric relationship between the collected images and the TRIs. Analysis of such highly relevant and localized images would enable efficient and reliable visual inspection. We successfully demonstrate the capability of the technique to extract the ROIs using a full-scale highway sign structure in the case where weld connections serve as the TRIs.

AB Underwater acoustic networks (UANs) are an emerging technology for a number of oceanic applications, ranging from oceanographic data collection to surveillance applications. However, their reliable usage in the field is still an open research problem, due to the challenges posed by the oceanic environment. The UAN project, a European-Union-funded initiative, moved along these lines, and it was one of the first cases of successful deployment of a mobile underwater sensor network integrated within a wide-area network, which included above water and underwater sensors. This contribution, together with a description of the underwater network, aims at evaluating the communication performance, and correlating the variation of the acoustic channel to the behavior of the entire network stack. Results are given based on the data collected during the UAN11 (May 2011, Trondheim Fjord area, Norway) sea trial. During the experimental activities, the network was in operation for five continuous days and was composed of up to four Fixed NOdes (FNOs), two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and one mobile node mounted on the supporting research vessel. Results from the experimentation at sea are reported in terms of channel impulse response (CIR) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as measured by the acoustic modems during the sea tests. The performance of the upper network levels is measured in terms of round trip time (RTT) and probability of packet loss (PL). The analysis shows how the communication performance was dominated by variations in signal-to-noise ratio, and how this impacted the behavior of the whole network. Qualitative explanation of communication performance variations can be accounted, at least in the UAN11 experiment, by standard computation of the CIR and transmission loss estimate.

AB The main idea of this research is to devise the smart module to pick the best supplier bid(s) automatically. The hybrid model is composed of three useful tools: fuzzy logic, AHP, and QFD. The approach has been carefully implemented and verified via a real-world case study in a medium-to-large industry manufacturing vehicle tires and other rubber products. A collection of 12 assessment criteria classified into two categories have been considered. Eight factors are derived from customer suggestions and the other four are design specifications required to manufacture the product. The main outcomes are: a hybrid autonomous model to evaluate supplier bids without direct human intervention; devising a hybrid three-module method and overcoming complexity of computations in resulting algorithm by means of agents; outlining the best criteria to assess suppliers; evaluating the suppliers based on voice of customer during all stages of the process; and discussing analysis, design, and implementation issues of the evaluation agent. The paper includes implications for development of an integrated total system for supply chain coordination. The most important advantages of this work over earlier researches on supplier selection are: implementation of an autonomous assessment mechanism using intelligent agents for the first time, making the best out of three widely applied methodologies all at once, evaluation process mainly based on features of customer order, coordination of supply job based on a bidding system, and portal-mediated operation and control.

AB Extracting information related to weather and visual conditions at a given time and space is indispensable for scene awareness, which strongly impacts our behaviours, from simply walking in a city to riding a bike, driving a car, or autonomous drive-assistance. Despite the significance of this subject, it has still not been fully addressed by the machine intelligence relying on deep learning and computer vision to detect the multi-labels of weather and visual conditions with a unified method that can be easily used in practice. What has been achieved to-date are rather sectorial models that address a limited number of labels that do not cover the wide spectrum of weather and visual conditions. Nonetheless, weather and visual conditions are often addressed individually. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to automatically extract this information from street-level images relying on deep learning and computer vision using a unified method without any pre-defined constraints in the processed images. A pipeline of four deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, so-called WeatherNet, is trained, relying on residual learning using ResNet50 architecture, to extract various weather and visual conditions such as dawn/dusk, day and night for time detection, glare for lighting conditions, and clear, rainy, snowy, and foggy for weather conditions. WeatherNet shows strong performance in extracting this information from user-defined images or video streams that can be used but are not limited to autonomous vehicles and drive-assistance systems, tracking behaviours, safety-related research, or even for better understanding cities through images for policy-makers.

AB The use of computer controlled swarms of UAVs for crop spraying enables non-uniform coverage of high precision and time efficiency. For this purpose an algorithmic control method for autonomous UAV swarm spraying, based on multi-agent area coverage method Heat Equation Driven Area Coverage (HEDAC), is proposed. Motion control relies on suitable spraying model which enables of multi-agent spraying simulations for arbitrary agent's trajectories. The HEDAC control method was tested in comparison with conventional (Lawnmower) and state-of-the-art (SMC) path planning methods on three numerical tests: two based on simple geometries and algebraically defined spraying goal densities, and one based on a real-world crop disease map. Additionally, the effects of spraying tool design (number of nozzles and their spraying density) on spraying accuracy were analyzed, with results consistently illustrating the direct causation between tool precision and overall spraying error. The results of the testing have shown HEDAC control to be significantly faster than Lawnmower (approximately 35%-65% less time needed) and SMC (approximately 15%-50% less time needed) in achieving convergence, while producing spraying density of comparable accuracy. Moreover, HEDAC spraying typically mitigates over-spraying by approximately 3%-8% when compared with conventional path planning. In additional tests, it is shown that an implementation of collision avoidance technique for HEDAC motion control provides collision-free UAV swarm spraying. The effect of HEDAC collision avoidance control on the spraying convergence rate and accuracy is practically insignificant. It may be concluded that in real-world application HEDAC controlled UAV spraying swarms are expected to significantly outperform UAVs operating with existing path planning methods.

AB One of the major open challenges in self-driving cars is the ability to detect cars and pedestrians to safely navigate in the world. Deep learning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using camera imagery to detect and classify objects. But for a safety critical application, such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current state of the art are still too high to enable safe operation. Moreover, the characterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing on prerecorded datasets. Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without additional human labels. In this letter, we propose an automated method to identify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels. We show that inconsistencies in the object detector output between a pair of similar images can be used as hypotheses for false negatives (e.g., missed detections) and using a novel set of features for each hypothesis, an off-the-shelf binary classifier can he used to find valid errors. In particular, we study two distinct cues-temporal and stereo inconsistencies-using data that are readily available on most autonomous vehicles. Our method can be used with any camera-based object detector and we illustrate the technique on several sets of real world data. We show that a state-of-the-art detector, tracker, and our classifier trained only on synthetic data can identify valid errors on KITTI tracking dataset with an average precision of 0.94. We also release a new tracking dataset with 104 sequences totaling 80,655 labeled pairs of stereo images along with ground truth disparity from a game engine to facilitate further research.

AB In the wake of today's highly dynamic and competitive energy markets, optimal dispatching of energy sources requires effective demand responsiveness. Suppliers have adopted a dynamic pricing strategy in efforts to control the downstream demand. This method however requires consumer awareness, flexibility, and timely responsiveness. While residential activities are more flexible and schedulable, larger commercial consumers remain an obstacle due to the impacts on industrial performance. This paper combines methods from quadratic, stochastic, and evolutionary programming with multi-objective optimization and continuous simulation, to propose a two stage discrete-continuous multi-objective load optimization (DiCoMoLoOp) autonomous approach for industrial consumer demand response (DR). Stage 1 defines discrete-event load shifting targets. Accordingly, controllable loads are continuously optimized in stage 2 while considering the consumer's utility. Utility functions, which measure the loads' time value to the consumer, are derived and weights are assigned through an analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The method is demonstrated for an industrial building model using real data. The proposed method integrates with building energy management system and solves in real-time with autonomous and instantaneous load shifting in the hour-ahead energy price (HAP) market. The simulation shows the occasional existence of multiple load management options on the Pareto frontier. Finally, the computed savings, based on the simulation analysis with real consumption, climate, and price data, ranged from modest to considerable amounts depending on the consumer's solution preference.

AB Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) play a crucial role in numerous military and civil applications since it shortens mission duration and enhances coverage significantly compared with a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Whereas, designing an energy-efficient FANETs routing protocol with a high packet delivery rate (PDR) and low delay is challenging owing to the dynamic topology changes. In this article, we propose a topology-aware resilient routing strategy based on adaptive Q-learning (TARRAQ) to accurately capture topology changes with low overhead and make routing decisions in a distributed and autonomous way. First, we analyze the dynamic behavior of UAVs nodes via the queuing theory, and then the closed-form solutions of neighbors' change rate (NCR) and neighbors' change interarrival time (NCIT) distribution are derived. Based on the real-time NCR and NCIT, a resilient sensing interval (SI) is determined by defining the expected sensing delay of network events. Besides, we also present an adaptive Q-learning approach that enables UAVs to make distributed, autonomous, and adaptive routing decisions, where the above SI ensures that the action space can be updated in time with low cost. The simulation results verify the accuracy of the topology dynamic analysis model, and also prove that our TARRAQ outperforms the Q-learning-based topology-aware routing (QTAR), mobility prediction-based virtual routing (MPVR), and greedy perimeter stateless routing based on energy-efficient hello (EE-Hello) in terms of 25.23%, 20.24%, and 13.73% lower overhead, 9.41%, 14.77%, and 16.70% higher PDR, and 5.12%, 15.65%, and 11.31% lower energy consumption, respectively.

AB Autonomous driving systems are set to become a reality in transport systems and, so, maximum acceptance is being sought among users. Currently, the most advanced architectures require driver intervention when functional system failures or critical sensor operations take place, presenting problems related to driver state, distractions, fatigue, and other factors that prevent safe control. Therefore, this work presents a redundant, accurate, robust, and scalable LiDAR odometry system with fail-aware system features that can allow other systems to perform a safe stop manoeuvre without driver mediation. All odometry systems have drift error, making it difficult to use them for localisation tasks over extended periods. For this reason, the paper presents an accurate LiDAR odometry system with a fail-aware indicator. This indicator estimates a time window in which the system manages the localisation tasks appropriately. The odometry error is minimised by applying a dynamic 6-DoF model and fusing measures based on the Iterative Closest Points (ICP), environment feature extraction, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) methods. The obtained results are promising for two reasons: First, in the KITTI odometry data set, the ranking achieved by the proposed method is twelfth, considering only LiDAR-based methods, where its translation and rotation errors are1.00%and 0.0041 deg/m, respectively. Second, the encouraging results of the fail-aware indicator demonstrate the safety of the proposed LiDAR odometry system. The results depict that, in order to achieve an accurate odometry system, complex models and measurement fusion techniques must be used to improve its behaviour. Furthermore, if an odometry system is to be used for redundant localisation features, it must integrate a fail-aware indicator for use in a safe manner.

TI Ontology-based conditional random fields for object recognition

DE Object recognition; Conditional random fields; Ontologies; Probabilistic
   graphical models
ID SEARCH
AB Object recognition is a cornerstone task in autonomous and/or assistance systems like robots, autonomous vehicles, or those assisting to visually impaired, aiming to achieve a certain level of understanding of their surroundings. Probabilistic models, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), have been successfully applied to this end given their ability to exploit contextual and situation information, e.g. a bowl is typically found in a cabinet and not in a night-stand. In this work we propose to evolve CRFs into Ontology based Conditional Random Fields (obCRFs), which define a multi-level structure where each level assigns a category with different granularity to the same set of objects. For example, a level could assign to an object the category appliance or furniture, while the next one could categorize it into the tv, microwave, cabinet, or table types. In this way, general categorizations can guide the classification into more specialized ones (and vice versa), improving recognition success, and mitigating the CRFs limitations when modeling a high number of object categories (shared, in general, by Machine Learning techniques). To set the categories in each level we propose to mimic the hierarchical structure of ontologies, where categories are naturally codified following a subsumption ordering. This leads us to the second advantage of obCRFs : the multi labeling of objects provides a richer understanding of the scene, which can be leveraged for accomplishing high-level tasks (e.g. object search or scheduling). Our approach has been tested with scenes from two state-of-the-art datasets: Robot@Home and Cornell-RGBD, outperforming the results provided by standard CRFs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Knowledge of passenger flow underpins any optimal public transport application, such as new facilities design and operations. The interactions between passengers and sensors may provide the foundation to measure this flow and dismiss users and staff from the measures' validation loop. Removing humans and their errors may impact significantly and improve measures' cost and quality. The literature considered smartphones the leading enabler due to market penetration and embodied sensors. Smartphones allow users' localization, identification, authentication, and billing. Via Bluetooth, smartphones detect short-range implicit interactions, device-to-device. We model passenger states on buses, either be-in or be-out (BIBO). The BIBO use case identifies a fundamental building block of continuously-valued passenger flow, which this paper describes through a Human-Computer interaction experimental setting involving two autonomous buses and a proprietary smartphone-Bluetooth sensing platform. The resulting dataset of 14,000 observations/sensors contains two ground-truth levels: the first is the passengers' validation; the second is validation by video cameras surveilling buses and tracks. This study verifies separately classification based on Bluetooth and GPS signals, as well as an inertial navigation system, evaluating signals and related machine learning (ML) classifiers against measurement and ground-truth noise. The paper contributes a Monte Carlo simulation of labels-flip to emulate human errors in the labeling process, as in smartphone surveys, and a novel unsupervised variational auto-encoder classifier. Experimental results indicate error-free human validation is unlikely. The impact of mistakes on model performance bias can be significant. This use case supports the potential substitution of human validation with independent Bluetooth validation.

AB Real-time detection of illegal activities in maritime areas, such as drug trafficking or illegal fishing, is a very challenging task. It generally requires important and expensive means (patrol planes, coastguard, or navy ships) to provide an efficient monitoring of large areas. As ships emit noise due to their propulsion (propeller and engines), passive acoustic monitoring can be an effective alternative to accomplish this task, at a reasonable cost. To be efficient, the detection process should be autonomous, run in real-time, and should transmit information within a short period. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of using gliders equipped with a tri-dimensional acoustic vector sensor (AVS) to run a survey mission in total autonomy. Based on the ability of the AVS to measure the direction of arrival of the incoming wave, we develop an embedded and real-time processing chain to detect ships and to cluster detections in a multiple-sources scenario. We also propose a receiver that runs in real time to measure the time difference of arrival (TDOA) if multipath propagation occurs. The sonar contacts are transmitted every 30 s to a command and control (C2) station using an acoustic modem, without interrupting the detection process. The C2 can process the sonar contacts with a tracker for target localization; the article also shows that it is possible to get a good estimate of the source distance by processing the TDOA from multipath propagation. The proposed methods are validated on data recorded during an at-sea experiment in shallow waters.

AB The implementation of autonomous driving is inseparable from developing intelligent driving decision-making models, which are facing high scene complexity, poor decision-making coupling, and the inability to guarantee decision-making safety. This paper starts with the priority and logic of lane change and car-following decision-making, considering driving efficiency, safety, and comfort, then constructs a double-layer decision-making model. This paper uses two deep reinforcement learning algorithms for the upper and lower layers to process large-scale mixed state space and ensure the composite action output of lane-changing decisions and car-following decisions. In the upper layer model, we use the D3QN algorithm to distinguish the potential value of the environment and the value of selecting lane-changing actions when making lane-changing decisions. Different from the traditional mechanisms that only use negative rewards, the lane changing benefit function and dangerous action shielding mechanism are used to eliminate collisions. DDPG algorithm is adopted in the lower layer model to process car-following decisions and output continuous vehicle speed control. Besides, coupled training is taken for the two algorithms to improve the coordination of the double-layer model. This paper selected mixed standard driving cycle conditions to build a highly complex training environment and used NGSIM data to reconstruct scenes to test our model. Simulations in SUMO are presented that the double-layer model can increase the driving speed of the original data by 23.99%, which has higher effectiveness than other models.

   monitoring; formal methods
AB Traffic systems, where human and autonomous drivers interact, are a very relevant instance of complex systems and produce behaviors that can be regarded as trajectories over time. Their monitoring can be achieved by means of carefully stated properties describing the expected behavior. Such properties can be expressed using Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a specification language for expressing temporal properties in a formal and human-readable way. However, manually authoring these properties is a hard task, since it requires mastering the language and knowing the system to be monitored. Moreover, in practical cases, the expected behavior is not known, but it has instead to be inferred from a set of trajectories obtained by observing the system. Often, those trajectories come devoid of human-assigned labels that can be used as an indication of compliance with expected behavior. As an alternative to manual authoring, automatic mining of STL specifications from unlabeled trajectories would enable the monitoring of autonomous agents without sacrificing human-readability. In this work, we propose a grammar-based evolutionary computation approach for mining the structure and the parameters of an STL specification from a set of unlabeled trajectories. We experimentally assess our approach on a real-world road traffic dataset consisting of thousands of vehicle trajectories. We show that our approach is effective at mining STL specifications that model the system at hand and are interpretable for humans. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study on a set of unlabeled real-world road traffic data. Being able to mine interpretable specifications from this kind of data may improve traffic safety, because mined specifications may be helpful for monitoring traffic and planning safety promotion strategies.

AB Accurate and fast 3D object detection from point clouds is a key task in autonomous driving. Existing one-stage 3D object detection methods can achieve real-time performance, however, they are dominated by anchor-based detectors which are inefficient and require additional post-processing. In this paper, we eliminate anchors and model an object as a single point--the center point of its bounding box. Based on the center point, we propose an anchor-free CenterNet3D network that performs 3D object detection without anchors. Our CenterNet3D uses keypoint estimation to find center points and directly regresses 3D bounding boxes. However, because inherent sparsity of point clouds, 3D object center points are likely to be in empty space which makes it difficult to estimate accurate boundaries. To solve this issue, we propose an extra corner attention module to enforce the CNN backbone to pay more attention to object boundaries. Besides, considering that one-stage detectors suffer from the discordance between the predicted bounding boxes and corresponding classification confidences, we develop an efficient keypoint-sensitive warping operation to align the confidences to the predicted bounding boxes. Our proposed CenterNet3D is non-maximum suppression free which makes it more efficient and simpler. We evaluate CenterNet3D on the widely used KITTI dataset and more challenging nuScenes dataset. Our method outperforms all state-of-the-art anchor-based one-stage methods and has comparable performance to two-stage methods as well. It has an inference speed of 20 FPS and achieves the best speed and accuracy trade-off. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/wangguojun2018/CenterNet3d.

AB Passive diffusion-based drug delivery systems have indeed shown impressive performance to overcome a cascade of biological barriers, but the delivery efficiency is still modest. Although artificial micro/nanomotors are capable of autonomous movement, oriented navigation and seeking target actively represent an alternative and attractive strategy to revolutionize drug delivery patterns potentially, the separated and single propulsion mode of motors still hampers their further biomedical application that needs to overcome successive biological barriers. Herein, we demonstrated a cascaded NIR-light/gas-driven Janus calcium carbonate particle micromotors (JCPMs) to overcome multi-staged biological barriers and achieved active drug delivery. These JCPMs exhibited NIR light-driven thermophoretic motion with precisely steered start/stop switch, speed, and motion trajectory in biological media and displayed CO2-bubbles-powered autonomous propulsion in an acidic environment. With the collaborative use of cascaded light/gas double-mode driving, JCPMs displayed a multistage self-adapted strategy to overcome sequential biological barriers during tumor-targeted drug delivery in a cascaded manner, involving of light-driven active tumor cells seeking, facilitated tumor penetration and cellular membranes traversal by virtue of photo-thermomechanical force and self-thermophoretic propulsion, gas-driven lysosomes escape and intracellular drug release successively. Such a strategy guaranteed trajectory-controllable active drug delivery to exert the selective tumor therapeutic effect as well as avoided side effects. We envisioned that the proposed cascaded driving mode of micromotors for traversing biological barriers would boost the delivery efficiency for tumor treatment, which may pave a convenient and versatile way to develop next generation active vehicles in the biomedical field.

AB With the popularity of ground and airborne three-dimensional laser scanning hardware and the development of advanced technologies for computer vision in geometrical measurement, intelligent processing of point clouds has become a hot issue in artificial intelligence. The intervisibility analysis in 3D space can use viewpoint, view distance, and elevation values and consider terrain occlusion to derive the intervisibility between two points. In this study, we first use the 3D point cloud of reflected signals from the intelligent autonomous driving vehicle's 3D scanner to estimate the field-of-view of multi-dimensional data alignment. Then, the forced metrics of mechanical Riemann geometry are used to construct the Manifold Auxiliary Surface (MAS). With the help of the spectral analysis of the finite element topology structure constructed by the MAS, an innovative dynamic intervisibility calculation is finally realized under the geometric calculation conditions of the Mix-Planes Calculation Structure (MPCS). Different from advanced methods of global and interpolation pathway-based point clouds computing, we have removed the 99.54% high-noise background and reduced the computational complexity by 98.65%. Our computation time can reach an average processing time of 0.1044 s for one frame with a 25 fps acquisition rate of the original vision sensor. The remarkable experimental results and significant evaluations from multiple runs demonstrate that the proposed dynamic intervisibility analysis has high accuracy, strong robustness, and high efficiency. This technology can assist in terrain analysis, military guidance, and dynamic driving path planning, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), communication base station siting, etc., is of great significance in both theoretical technology and market applications.

AB The progress brought by the deep learning technology over the last decade has inspired many research domains, such as radar signal processing, speech and audio recognition, etc., to apply it to their respective problems. Most of the prominent deep learning models exploit data representations acquired with either Lidar or camera sensors, leaving automotive radars rarely used. This is despite the vital potential of radars in adverse weather conditions, as well as their ability to simultaneously measure an object's range and radial velocity seamlessly. As radar signals have not been exploited very much so far, there is a lack of available benchmark data. However, recently, there has been a lot of interest in applying radar data as input to various deep learning algorithms, as more datasets are being provided. To this end, this paper presents a survey of various deep learning approaches processing radar signals to accomplish some significant tasks in an autonomous driving application, such as detection and classification. We have itemized the review based on different radar signal representations, as it is one of the critical aspects while using radar data with deep learning models. Furthermore, we give an extensive review of the recent deep learning-based multi-sensor fusion models exploiting radar signals and camera images for object detection tasks. We then provide a summary of the available datasets containing radar data. Finally, we discuss the gaps and important innovations in the reviewed papers and highlight some possible future research prospects.

AB This paper presents a high performance (low computationally demanding) monocular vision-based system for a hovering Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in the context of autonomous docking process-MViDO system: Monocular Vision-based Docking Operation aid. The MViDO consists of three sub-modules: a pose estimator, a tracker and a guidance sub-module. The system is based on a single camera and a three spherical color markers target that signal the docking station. The MViDO system allows the pose estimation of the three color markers even in situations of temporary occlusions, being also a system that rejects outliers and false detections. This paper also describes the design and implementation of the MViDO guidance module for the docking manoeuvres. We address the problem of driving the AUV to a docking station with the help of the visual markers detected by the on-board camera, and show that by adequately choosing the references for the linear degrees of freedom of the AUV, the AUV is conducted to the dock while keeping those markers in the field of view of the on-board camera. The main concepts behind the MViDO are provided and a complete characterization of the developed system is presented from the formal and experimental point of view. To test and evaluate the MViDO detector and pose an estimator module, we created a ground truth setup. To test and evaluate the tracker module we used the MARES AUV and the designed target in a four-meter tank. The performance of the proposed guidance law was tested on simulink/Matlab.

AB Arrow signs found on roadway pavement are an important component of modern transportation systems. Given the rise in autonomous vehicles, public agencies are increasingly interested in accurately identifying and analysing detailed road pavement information to generate comprehensive road maps and decision support systems that can optimise traffic flow, enhance road safety, and provide complete official road cartographic support (that can be used in autonomous driving tasks). As arrow signs are a fundamental component of traffic guidance, this paper aims to present a novel deep learning-based approach to identify the orientation and direction of arrow signs on marked roadway pavements using high-resolution aerial orthoimages. The approach is based on convolutional neural network architectures (VGGNet, ResNet, Xception, and DenseNet) that are modified and adapted for regression tasks with a proposed learning structure, together with an ad hoc model, specially introduced for this task. Although the best-performing artificial neural network was based on VGGNet (VGG-19 variant), it only slightly surpassed the proposed ad hoc model in the average values of the R2 score, mean squared error, and angular error by 0.005, 0.001, and 0.036, respectively, using the training set (the ad hoc model delivered an average R2 score, mean squared error, and angular error of 0.9874, 0.001, and 2.516, respectively). Furthermore, the ad hoc model's predictions using the test set were the most consistent (a standard deviation of the R2 score of 0.033 compared with the score of 0.042 achieved using VGG19), while being almost eight times more computationally efficient when compared with the VGG19 model (2,673,729 parameters vs VGG19 ' s 20,321,985 parameters).

AB The state estimation strategy using the smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is based on the variable structure and sliding mode concepts. As presented in its standard form with a fixed boundary layer limit, the value of the boundary layer width is not precisely known at each step and may be selected based on a priori knowledge. The boundary layer width reflects the level of uncertainty in the model parameters and disturbance characteristics, where large values of the boundary layer width lead to robustness without optimality and small values of the boundary layer width provide optimality with poor robustness. As a solution and to overcome these limitations, an adaptive smoothing boundary layer is required to achieve greater robustness and suitable accuracy. This adapted value of the boundary layer width is obtained by minimizing the trace of the a posteriori covariance matrix. In this paper, the proposed new approach will be considered as another alternative to the extended Kalman filters (EKF), nonlinear H-infinity and standard SVSF-based data fusion techniques for the autonomous airborne navigation and self-localization problem. This alternative is based on strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and GPS data using the nonlinear SVSF with a covariance derivation and adaptive boundary layer width. Furthermore, the full mathematical model of the SINS/GPS navigation system considering the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) position, velocity and Euler angle as well as gyro and accelerometer biases will be used in this paper to estimate the airborne position and velocity with better accuracy.

AB Integrity monitoring for precise point positioning is critical for safety-related applications. With the increasing demands of high-accuracy autonomous navigation for unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, the integrity monitoring method of high-precision positioning has become an essential requirement. While high precision Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) positioning is widely used in such applications, there are still many difficulties in the integrity monitoring method for the multi-frequency multi-GNSS undifferenced and uncombined Precise Point Positioning (PPP). The main difficulties are caused by using the measurements of multiple epochs in PPP. Based on the baseline Multiple Hypothesis Solution Separation (MHSS) Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM) algorithm, this paper discusses the feasibility of the pseudorange-based baseline ARAIM method on the single-epoch PPP based on Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) networks (PPP-RTK) framework to overcome these difficulties. In addition, a new scheme is proposed to transfer the conventional PPP process into the single-epoch PPP-RTK framework. The simulation results using the proposed model are analyzed in this study. The Protection Levels (PLs) estimated by PPP Wide-lane Ambiguity Resolution (PPP-WAR) model with regional corrections can reach the meter level and the PLs estimated by PPP Ambiguity Resolution (PPP-AR) and PPP-RTK models are usually the sub-meter level. Given a horizontal Alert Limit (AL) of 1.5 m, the global coverage of availability above 99.9% for PPP-WAR, PPP-AR, and PPP-RTK can reach 92.6%, 99.4%, and 99.7% respectively. The results using real kinematic data also show that tight PLs can be achieved when the observation conditions are good.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL
AB An open problem in autonomous vehicle safety validation is building reliable models of human driving behavior in simulation. This work presents an approach to learn neural driving policies from real world driving demonstration data. We model human driving as a sequential decision making problem that is characterized by non-linearity and stochasticity, and unknown underlying cost functions. Imitation learning is an approach for generating intelligent behavior when the cost function is unknown or difficult to specify. Building upon work in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) aims to provide effective imitation even for problems with large or continuous state and action spaces, such as modeling human driving. This article describes the use of GAIL for learning-based driver modeling. Because driver modeling is inherently a multi-agent problem, where the interaction between agents needs to be modeled, this paper describes a parameter-sharing extension of GAIL called PS-GAIL to tackle multi-agent driver modeling. In addition, GAIL is domain agnostic, making it difficult to encode specific knowledge relevant to driving in the learning process. This paper describes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which modifies the reward signal to provide domain-specific knowledge to the agent. Finally, human demonstrations are dependent upon latent factors that may not be captured by GAIL. This paper describes Burn-InfoGAIL, which allows for disentanglement of latent variability in demonstrations. Imitation learning experiments are performed using NGSIM, a real-world highway driving dataset. Experiments show that these modifications to GAIL can successfully model highway driving behavior, accurately replicating human demonstrations and generating realistic, emergent behavior in the traffic flow arising from the interaction between driving agents.

AB In this paper, we break with the traditional approach to classification, which is regarded as a form of supervised learning. We offer a method and algorithm, which make possible fully autonomous (unsupervised) detection of new classes, and learning following a very parsimonious training priming (few labeled data samples only). Moreover, new unknown classes may appear at a later stage and the proposed xClass method and algorithm are able to successfully discover this and learn from the data autonomously. Furthermore, the features (inputs to the classifier) are automatically sub-selected by the algorithm based on the accumulated data density per feature per class. In addition, the automatically generated model is easy to interpret and is locally generative and based on prototypes which define the modes of the data distribution. As a result, a highly efficient, lean, human-understandable, autonomously self-learning model (which only needs an extremely parsimonious priming) emerges from the data. To validate our proposal, we approbated it on four challenging problems, including imbalanced Faces-1999 data base, Caltech-101 dataset, vehicles dataset, and iRoads dataset, which is a dataset of images of autonomous driving scenarios. Not only we achieved higher precision (in one of the problems outperforming by 25% all other methods), but, more significantly, we only used a single class beforehand, while other methods used all the available classes and we generated interpretable models with smaller number of features used, through extremely weak and weak supervision. We demonstrated the ability to detect and learn new classes for both images and numerical examples.

AB Continuing with the description of the Canadian teleoperated mine detection systems, in this paper we will focus on systems developed primarily for antipersonnel (AP) landmine detection. The Articulated Robotic Scanner (ARS) is a system approach that uses a generic robotic device capable of automatically moving a landmine detection sensor over natural ground surfaces in a manner similar to an operator. Exploiting the cost efficiency of proven high sensitivity commercial-off-the-shelf sensors, such as the metal detectors widely employed by military and humanitarian deminers, the high-precision automation of the ARS can be utilized to provide a low cost and low weight scanning imaging sensor that can be carried on a small autonomous platform. Concurrent with the ARS project, Defence R&D Canada - Suffield has maintained an active programme in the development of portable AP landmine detection systems, a number of which will be described. Together, these projects inspired a more ambitious vision, the Canadian Sensor Integration Concept (CANSIC), which applies the successful multi-sensor landmine detection approach to a small autonomous vehicle, using complementary sensors designed for antipersonnel landmine detection. Using a high-mobility robotic platform, the envisioned system incorporates five separate technologies: two hyper-spectral cameras, thermal and visual/near infrared, along with a scanning sensor imaging system mounted on a purpose build articulated robotic scanner, working in conjunction with a nuclear imaging confirmation sensor. Designed to provide clearance options for areas off established roadways, the goal is not only to operate in all environments and conditions that a deminer is able to, but also to extend the demining capabilities of military commanders and humanitarian demining project managers to situations where there is a high probability of casualities.

TI Research on 3D Point Cloud Object Detection Algorithm for Autonomous

SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB In autonomous driving, lidar has become the main vehicle sensor due to its advantages such as long-range measurement and high accuracy. However, the collected point cloud data is sparse and unevenly distributed, and it lacks characterization capabilities when facing objects with missing or similar shapes, so that the detection accuracy is low while detecting long-distance small targets with similar shapes and a small number of point clouds. In order to improve the detection accuracy of small targets represented by point clouds, this paper adopts a method that fuses point cloud and RGB image to construct a 3D object detection network architecture based on two-stage complementary fusion. In the first stage of the fusion, we use the FPS method to select some points from the raw point cloud data as key points. Then, we voxelize the raw point cloud and use the 3D sparse convolutional neural network to extract multi-scale points cloud features, which would fuse features of different scales with key points. In the second stage of fusion, a 2D object detector is used to obtain the 2D bounding box and category information of the target in the image and take the camera as the origin to extend along the direction of the 2D bounding box to form a frustum; then the point cloud and target category information within the frustum are fused into the key points. This paper uses key points as a bridge to effectively combine the semantic information of the image such as texture and color with the point cloud features. The experimental results show that the network proposed in this paper has excellent performance on small objects.

AB Very low latency and high reliability are two of the main requirements for new applications exploiting 5G networks. This is the case for the remote operation of robots or vehicles, the autonomous interaction of equipment in a factory, autonomous driving and tactile internet applications. Although the TCP/IP stack has been sufficient as the end-to-end solution for most of the history of the Internet, a number of surveys have appeared recently presenting many different methods for managing the end-to-end communication to meet the requirements of various technologies such as that of 5G networks. In this paper, we present a novel classification of the literature focused on new end-to-end solutions and the creation of services towards the support of low latency (1 ms) and high reliability (10(-9) error rate) in current and future 5G networks. We specifically highlight how the proposals can be classified according to enabling technologies and the specific method used to achieve success in terms of the latency and reliability. The literature related to end-to-end solutions for reliable low-latency communications are organized according to three main topics: (i) end-to-end protocols that improve communication in terms of latency and reliability, (ii) functionality or technologies implemented on the network to support the current demands, and (iii) application programming interfaces that enhance the correct utilization of those protocols and additional technologies.

AB Integrating global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) with inertial navigation systems (INSs) has been widely recognized as an ideal solution for autonomous vehicle navigation. However, GNSSs suffer from disturbances and signal blocking inevitably, making the performance of GNSS/INSs degraded in the occurrence of measurement outliers. It has been proven that the sigma points-based Kalman filter (KF) performs better than an extended KF in cases where large prior uncertainty is present in the state estimation of a GNSS/INS. By modifying the sigma points directly, the resampling-free sigma point update framework (SUF) propagates more information excepting Gaussian moments of prescribed accuracy, based on which the resampling-free cubature Kalman filter (RCKF) was developed in our previous work. In order to enhance the adaptivity and robustness of the RCKF, the resampling-free SUF depending on dynamic prediction residue should be improved by suppressing the time-varying measurement outlier. In this paper, a robust observability-constrained RCKF (ROCRCKF) is proposed based on adaptive measurement noise covariance estimation and outlier detection, where the occurrence of measurement outliers is modelled by the Bernoulli variable and estimated with the state simultaneously. Experiments based on car-mounted GNSS/INSs are performed to verify the effectiveness of the ROCRCKF, and result indicates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the RCKF in the presence of measurement outliers, where the heading error and average root mean square error of the position are reduced from 1.96 & DEG; and 6.38 m to 0.27 & DEG; and 5.95 m, respectively. The ROCRCKF is robust against the measurement outliers and time-varying model uncertainty, making it suitable for the real-time implementation of GNSS/INSs in GNSS-challenged environments.

AB A robust multisensor navigation filter design for the entry phase of next-generation Mars entry, descent, and landing (EDL) is presented. The entry phase is the longest and most uncertain portion of a Mars landing sequence. Navigation performance at this stage determines landing precision at the end of the powered descent phase of EDL. In the present work, measurements from a ground-based radio beacon array, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), as well as an array of atmospheric and aerothermal sensors on the body of a Mars entry vehicle are fused using an M-estimation-based iterated extended Kalman filtering (MIEKF) framework. The multisensor approach enables an increased positioning accuracy as well as the estimation of parameters that are otherwise unobservable. Furthermore, owing to the proposed statistically robust filter formulation, states and parameters can be accurately estimated in the presence of non-Gaussian measurement noise. Deviations from normally distributed observation noise correspond to outlier events such as sensor faults or other sources of spurious sensor data such as interference. The proposed framework provides a significant reduction in estimation error at the parachute phase of EDL, thereby increasing the likelihood of a pinpoint landing at a chosen landing site. Six states and three parameters are estimated. The suggested method is compared to the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Detailed simulation results show that the presented fusion architecture is able to meet future pinpoint planetary landing requirements in realistic sensor measurement scenarios.

AB This article presents a method for cave surveying in total darkness using an autonomous aerial vehicle equipped with a depth camera for mapping, downward-facing camera for state estimation, and forward and downward lights. Traditional methods of cave surveying are labor-intensive and dangerous due to the risk of injury when operating in darkness, and the potential structural instability of the subterranean environment. Although these dangers can be mitigated by deploying robots to map dangerous passages and voids, real-time feedback is often needed to operate robots safely and efficiently. Few state-of-the-art, high-resolution perceptual modeling techniques attempt to reduce their high bandwidth requirements to work well with low bandwidth communication channels. To bridge this gap in the state-of- the-art, this work compactly represents sensor observations as Gaussian mixture models and maintains a local occupancy grid map for a motion planner that greedily maximizes an information-theoretic objective function. The approach accommodates both limited field of view (FoV) depth cameras and larger FoV LiDAR sensors and is extensively evaluated in long duration simulations on an embedded PC. An aerial system is leveraged to demonstrate the repeatability of the approach in a flight arena as well as the effects of communication dropouts. Finally, the system is deployed in Laurel Caverns, a commercially owned and operated cave in southwestern Pennsylvania, USA, and a wild cave in West Virginia, USA. Videos of the simulation and hardware results are available at https://youtu.be/iwi3p7IENjE and https://youtu.be/H8MdtJ5VhyU.

AB A typical formation shape control problem involves point agents sensing relative positions, that is, orientations and distances, of their neighbors and then moving so that these relative positions achieve some prespecified values. Such a procedure, requiring as it does sensing of orientations, implicitly presupposes that all agents have a shared understanding of the common orientations. On the other hand, there may be biases in sensors, variations in the earth's magnetic field interfering with compass-based sensing, or drift in inertial sensors, with the result that orientations are inconsistently measured or measured with error. In this paper, we investigate the formation control problem with mismatched coordinates in the 3-D space, considering the consequences of this error. First, the situation of a two-agent formation is considered. We show that the agents converge to a fixed but distorted formation exponentially fast. In contrast to the matched case, the formation is not asymptotically stationary, but rather instead translates with a certain constant velocity depending on the mismatches. The formation distortion between the actual one and the desired one is obtained, as well as the steady-state velocity of the formation for small mismatch orientations. The case of agents with double integrator dynamics is then considered and similar phenomena are observed. Based on the results, an estimation algorithm is given to obtain the mismatch rotation matrix, which allows a compensation algorithm to be proposed such that the desired formation is achieved with zero steady-state velocity for the formation as a whole. The case of n-agent formations is finally considered, first with a star graph and then with a general graph. Simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results.

AB We present a multiplatform control architecture to enable stable hovering flight and trajectory tracking for insect-scale flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). In the proposed approach, flight controllers are synthesized by using modern design techniques and applying the quaternion representation to describe the attitude dynamics of the controlled FWMAVs. During controller synthesis, the nominal stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed and ensured employing nonlinear Lyapunov methods. Given stringent fabrication, payload, size, and actuation limits at the insect scale, all subgram FWMAVs developed to date have been underactuated and, therefore, operate under multiple constraints. This observation has motivated us to develop an approach in which attitude is directly controlled by generating roll, pitch, and yaw torques through asymmetrical flapping; however, positional control forces are generated by manipulating the attitude of the robot to align its body-fixed aerodynamic-thrust vector along a desired direction. By leveraging this concept, we endow the proposed control architecture with the desired multiplatform characteristic and flexibility required to achieve multiple different objectives. The functionality, performance, and suitability of the proposed control approach are demonstrated experimentally using two different FWMAVs: a new version of the RoboBee, a 75-mg two-wing robot originally developed at Harvard University; and the Bee(++), a 95-mg four-wing robot that we developed in the Autonomous Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL) at the University of Southern California (USC). The use of a single control architecture to fly both robots allows an objective comparison of their flight capabilities.

ID PARTICLE FILTER SLAM; LOCALIZATION; ALIGNMENT
AB Positioning is a key function for autonomous vehicles that requires globally referenced localization information. Lidarbased mapping, which refers to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), provides continuous positioning in diverse scenarios. However, SLAM error can accumulate through time. Besides, only relative positioning is provided by SLAM. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver is one of the significant sensors for providing globally referenced localization, and it is usually integrated with lidar in autonomous driving. However, the performance of the GNSS is severely challenged due to the reflection and blockage caused by buildings in superurbanized cities, including Hong Kong, China; Tokyo; and New York, resulting in the notorious non-line-of-sight (NLOS) receptions. Moreover, the uncertainty of the GNSS positioning is ambiguous, leading to the incorrect tuning of its weight during GNSS?lidar integration. This article innovatively employs lidar to identify the NLOS measurement of the GNSS receiver using point-cloud-based object detection. Measurements from satellites suffering from NLOS reception will be excluded based on the proposed fault detection and exclusion (FDE) algorithm. Then, GNSS-weight least-square positioning is conducted based on the surviving measurements from FDE. The noise covariance of the GNSS positioning is calculated by considering the potential location errors caused by the NLOS and the remaining LOS measurements. The improved GNSS result and its corresponding noise covariance are integrated with lidar through a graph-based SLAM-integration framework. Experimental results indicate that the proposed GNSS?lidar integration can obtain improved positioning accuracy in a highly urbanized area in Hong Kong.

TI An AIS-Based Site Planning Method to Help Minimize Collision Risk during
   Marine Autonomous Surface Craft Deployments
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Marine autonomous surface crafts (MASCs), or unmanned surface vehicles as their precursors have traditionally been known, could cost effectively advance spatiotemporal coverage and resolution capabilities for oceanographic sampling in coastal and estuarine settings, if deployed for long durations (from days to weeks). Site planning for such deployments balances scientific goals against operational risk of collision avoidance (CA) maneuvers required by the MASC during encounters with other vessels. A method is developed and demonstrated in this paper, using archived Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data, to quantify such potential encounters of a MASC on a repeat-transect survey. The demonstration site is Rhode Island Sound, where average vessel track frequencies are shown to range from about 8 to 0.01 or less per day, from inshore shipping lanes to areas farther offshore, respectively. Encounters per month ranged from 24 to 1 for increasingly offshore locations, based on a MASC repeatedly traversing an 18-km transect at an average speed of 2.5 m s(-1) (similar to 5 kt) over a one-month summer period and stopping at each of 10 equispaced stations in one direction to sample for 10 min. Crude estimates of non-AIS vessel traffic suggest total encounters (with vessels equipped by AIS or not) up to 3-4 times higher. The method can be applied anywhere AIS data are available and is generalizable to any survey configuration. It facilitates investigating sensitivity to choices of transect location and sampling configuration parameters, providing crucial information to guide deployment planning for a given level of confidence in CA capabilities of the MASC.

TI Traveling waves in an optimal velocity model of freeway traffic
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOW; CONGESTION
AB Car-following models provide both a tool to describe traffic Row and algorithms for autonomous cruise control systems. Recently developed optimal velocity models contain a relaxation term that assigns a desirable speed to each headway and a response time over which drivers adjust to optimal velocity conditions. These models predict traffic breakdown phenomena analogous to real traffic instabilities. In order to deepen our understanding of these models, in this paper, we examine the transition from a linear stable stream of cars of one headway into a linear stable stream of a second headway. Numerical results of the governing equations identify a range of transition phenomena, including monotonic and oscillating travelling waves and a time-dependent dispersive adjustment wave. However, for certain conditions, we find that the adjustment takes the form of a nonlinear traveling wave From the upstream headway to a third, intermediate headway, followed by either another traveling wave or a dispersive wave further downstream matching the downstream headway. This intermediate value of the headway is selected such that the nonlinear traveling wave is the fastest stable traveling wave which is observed to develop in the numerical calculations. The development of these nonlinear waves, connecting linear stable flows of two different headways, is somewhat reminiscent of stop-start waves in congested flow on freeways. The different types of adjustments are classified in a phase diagram depending on the upstream and downstream headway and the response time of the model. The results have profound consequences fur autonomous cruise control systems. For an autocade of both identical and different vehicles, the control system itself may trigger formations of nonlinear, steep wave transitions. Further information is available [Y. Sugiyama, Traffic and Granular Flow (World Scientific, Singapore, 1995), p. 137].

AB Smart interaction between autonomous centimeter-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., nano-UAVs) and Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes is an upcoming high-impact scenario. This work tackles precise 3-D localization of indoor edge nodes with an autonomous nano-UAV without prior knowledge of their position. We employ ultrawideband (UWB) and wake-up radio (WUR) technologies: we perform UWB-based ranging and data exchange between the nano-UAV and the nodes, while the WUR minimizes the sensors' power consumption. UWB-based precise localization requires addressing multiple sources of error, such as UWB-ranging noise and UWB antennas' uneven radiation pat-tern. The limited computational resources aboard a nano-UAV further complicate this scenario, requiring real-time execution of the localization algorithm within a microcontroller unit (MCU). We propose a novel UWB-based localization system for nano-UAVs, composed by: 1) a lightweight localization algorithm; 2) an optimal flight strategy; and 3) a ranging-error-correction model. Our 3-D flight policy requires only five UWB measurements to feed the localization algorithm, which bounds the localization error within 28 cm and runs in 1.2 ms on a Cortex-M4 MCU. Localization accuracy is improved by an additional 25% thanks to a novel error-correction model. Leveraging the WUR, the entire localization/data-exchange cycle costs only 24 mJ at the sensor node, which is 50 times more energy efficient than the state of the art with comparable localization accuracy.

AB Spraying pesticides using row alignment in the maize seedling stage can effectively improve pesticide utilization and protect the ecological environment. Therefore, this study extracts a guidance line for maize crops using machine vision and develops an automatic row-oriented control system based on a high-clearance sprayer. First, the feature points of crop rows are extracted using a vertical projection method. Second, the candidate crop rows are obtained using a Hough transform, and two auxiliary line extraction methods for crop rows based on the slope feature outlier algorithm are proposed. Then, the guidance line of the crop rows is fitted using a tangent formula. To greatly improve the robustness of the vision algorithm, a Kalman filter is used to estimate and optimize the guidance line to obtain the guidance parameters. Finally, a visual row-oriented spraying platform based on autonomous navigation is built, and the row alignment accuracy and spraying performance are tested. The experimental results showed that, when autonomous navigation is turned on, the average algorithm time consumption of guidance line detection is 42 ms, the optimal recognition accuracy is 93.3%, the average deviation error of simulated crop rows is 3.2 cm and that of field crop rows is 4.36 cm. The test results meet the requirements of an automatic row-oriented control system, and it was found that the accuracy of row alignment decreased with increasing vehicle speed. The innovative spray performance test found that compared with the traditional spray, the inter-row pesticide savings were 20.4% and 11.4% overall, and the application performance was significantly improved.

AB The Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) in collaboration with the Great Lakes Observing System and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (NOAA GLERL) deployed an autonomous underwater glider in southern Lake Michigan several times per year between 2012 and 2019 to collect offshore (>30 m depth) limnological measurements, including temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (beginning during 2015), and chlorophyll-a fluorescence. From these data, we calculated mixed layer depth, several measures of light penetration (diffuse attenuation coefficient, first optical depth, euphotic zone depth), and depth of the subsurface chlorophyll-a maxima. During summer, mean offshore mixed layer depth was typically 10-15 m, Kd for PAR was 0.1-0.17 m(-1), first optical depth was 6-9 m, euphotic zone depth was 35-40 m, and depth of subsurface chlorophyll-a maxima was 30-35 m. We also observed substantial spatial and temporal variation in these values across the basin and within and among seasons. Glider-based observations provide a wider horizontal and vertical perspective than other methods (e.g., ship- and satellite-based observations, buoys, and fixed moorings), and are therefore a valuable, complementary tool for Great Lakes limnology. The set of observations reported here provide seasonal and basin-scale information that may help to identify anomalies useful for future glider-assisted investigation into the role of biophysical processes in Great Lakes limnology and ecology.

Such a problem can be transformed into a dynamic optimization problem which, however, is NP-complete and thus infeasible to be solved. A usual attempt is to relax this problem by employing greedy (optimal one-step-ahead) solutions which may end-up quite problematic. In this paper, we first show that optimal one-step-ahead exploration schemes that are based on a transformed optimization criterion can lead to highly efficient solutions to the multi-AXV exploration. Such a transformed optimization criterion is constructed using both theoretical analysis and experimental investigations and attempts to minimize the "disturbing" effect of deadlocks and nonlinearities to the overall exploration scheme. As, however, optimal one-step-ahead solutions to the transformed optimization criterion cannot be practically obtained using conventional optimization schemes, the second step in our approach is to combine the use of the transformed optimization criterion with the cognitive adaptive optimization (CAO): CAO is a practicably feasible computational methodology which adaptively provides an accurate approximation of the optimal one-step-ahead solutions. The combination of the transformed optimization criterion with CAO results in a multi-AXV exploration scheme which is both practically implementable and provides with quite efficient solutions as it is shown both by theoretical analysis and, most importantly, by extensive simulation experiments and real-life underwater sea-floor mapping experiments in the Leixes port, Portugal.

AB As delivery companies continue to explore the use of drones, the need for efficient and safe operation in urban environments becomes increasingly critical. Market-wide versions of drone delivery services will necessarily spread many drones, especially in big cities. In this scenario, avoiding collisions with other drones or typical obstacles in urban spaces is fundamental. This paper proposes and evaluates, via simulation and analytical modeling, an aerial delivery service scenario and three autonomous geometric approaches for collision avoidance. We compare our approaches with three simple methods - DoNothing (not detouring), Random, and aviation-like Rightward - and two state-of-the-art geometric approaches. Simulation experiments consider different fleet sizes with constant and Poisson drone arrival rates and drones randomly choosing one of different altitudes for the cruise flight. Contrary to our expectations, the Random and Rightward approaches increase the collisions compared with DoNothing, making the latter our baseline. Our approaches significantly reduce collisions in all experiments and deal with more drones within the detection radius, showing that collisions are more complex to avoid. Comparing the collision rate, successful trips, and the number of flying drones reveals that the efficiency in avoiding collisions reduces the number of successful trips by increasing the number of active drones. Regardless of the expected reduction in collisions, more altitudes do not eliminate them. These results indicate the need for more sophisticated approaches to reduce or eliminate collisions. The analytical modeling using Markov Chains corroborates the simulation results by shedding some light on and helping explain the simulation results.

ID ROBUST; VISION
AB Localization of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies heavily on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which are susceptible to interference. Especially in security applications, robust localization algorithms independent of GNSS are needed to provide dependable operations of autonomous UAVs also in interfered conditions. Typical non-GNSS visual localization approaches rely on known starting pose, work only on a small-sized map, or require known flight paths before a mission starts. We consider the problem of localization with no information on initial pose or planned flight path. We propose a solution for global visual localization on large maps, based on matching orthoprojected UAV images to satellite imagery using learned season-invariant descriptors, and test with environment sizes up to 100 km2. We show that the method is able to determine heading, latitude and longitude of the UAV at 12.6-18.7 m lateral translation error in as few as 23.2-44.4 updates from an uninformed initialization, also in situations of significant seasonal appearance difference (winter- summer) between the UAV image and the map. We evaluate the characteristics of multiple neural network architectures for generating the descriptors, and likelihood estimation methods that are able to provide fast convergence and low localization error. We also evaluate the operation of the algorithm using real UAV data and evaluate running time on a real-time embedded platform. We believe this is the first work that is able to recover the pose of an UAV at this scale and rate of convergence, while allowing significant seasonal difference between camera observations and map.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Using single transponder ranging (STR) information to aid positioning satisfies the needs of frogman autonomous positioning in waters emergency rescue, where miniaturized and low-cost devices are preferred. On this basis, a frogman self-navigation method based on virtual transponder array (VTA) and dead reckoning (DR) is proposed in this article, to solve the problem that calculation results of DR still accumulate with time when STR information is taken as the external measurement. In the proposed method, firstly, by constructing the VTA with depth information constraint, frogman autonomous positioning under the condition of single transponder configuration is realized. Then, to combine the characteristics that DR positioning data is smooth and short-term stable, and that VTA positioning error is not cumulative, the DR navigation system is used to describe frogman's motion law, the frogman positioning coordinates that calculated by VTA are taken as external measurement and the Kalman filter is designed, which solves the problem of DR accumulated errors. Compared to traditional STR-DR method, the proposed VTA-DR method further improves the accuracy and stability of frogman navigation and positioning. Finally, based on the high-precision three-dimensional motion capture system, the semi-physical simulation experimental environment is built to verify the proposed method. The experimental results under different tracks indicate that the average total location error of VTA-DR method is 0.149m, which is reduced by 53.5% compared with STR-DR method. The proposed VTA-DR method can better suppress the accumulation of positioning errors and has better positioning accuracy and robustness.

AB In this paper, the design of an electronic circuit for harvesting energy trickling from benthic sources and the long-term performance in powering sensors and devices in a littoral tidal basin are considered. The process has to contend with the randomness, diurnal variations, and low levels and voltages in available energy compared to what is required by oceanographic sensors. The system has two components: a circuit for conditioning the power and a large area electrode array in a littoral basin. The circuit has two stages and is able to overcome the leaks in capacitors used to store the power; the energy is stored first in a small capacitor and then in a large one so that voltages compatible with sensors are produced. The footprint of the anode is 10 m(2) and is inserted into the sediment and the cathode resides in the salt water above the sediment. Several different sensors and actuators have been autonomously powered by the stored energy (4.2 kJ at 12 V). A beacon and an underwater acoustic sensor (5 h of activation of combined hydrophone and three-axis accelerometer sensors, every 40 h; duty cycle has been doubled with recent improvements) have been powered over one to two months. Also, in-water propulsion (for 165 s at a time) of a 25-W biorobotic flapping fin propulsor has been achieved. The system is suitable primarily for powering sensors. It has been operated for more than three years at useful duty cycles, indicating sustainability for autonomous usage.

AB Due to the flight characteristics such as small size, low noise, and high efficiency, studies on flapping wing robots are being actively conducted. In particular, the flapping wing robot is in the spotlight in the field of search and reconnaissance. Most of the research focuses on the development of flapping wing robots rather than autonomous flight. However, because of the unique characteristics of flapping wings, it is essential to consider the development of flapping wing robots and autonomous flight simultaneously. In this article, we describe the development of the flapping wing robot and computationally efficient vision-based obstacle avoidance algorithm suitable for the lightweight robot. We developed a 27 cm and 45 g flapping wing robot named CNUX Mini that features an X-type wing and tailed configuration to attenuate oscillation caused by flapping motion. The flight experiment showed that the robot is capable of stable flight for 1.5 min and changing its direction with a small turn radius in a slow forward flight condition. For the obstacle detection algorithm, the appearance variation cue is used with the optical flow-based algorithm to cope robustly with the motion-blurred and feature-less images obtained during flight. If the obstacle is detected during straight flight, the avoidance maneuver is conducted for a certain period, depending on the state machine logic. The proposed obstacle avoidance algorithm was validated in ground tests using a testbed. The experiment shows that the CNUX Mini performs a suitable evasive maneuver with 90.2% success rate in 50 incoming obstacle situations.

AB Distributed robust formation tracking of multiple autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) with uncertain dynamics and individual objectives is investigated in this paper by developing a noncooperative game-based approach. Compared with the multiple ASVs model commonly studied in existing literature, two distinct features of the present multiple ASVs model are: (i) the ASVs are allowed to have individual objectives, and (ii) the evolution of each ASV is subjected to unmodeled dynamics and time-varying external disturbances. Specifically, the ASVs are required to cooperatively achieve the group objective of tracking a time-varying reference trajectory in a specific formation pattern, while each ASV also needs to complete its own individual objective of maintaining desired displacement with respect to the reference trajectory during the formation tracking process according to its own benefit. A noncooperative game-based approach is developed for the ASVs to achieve the goal of formation tracking in the presence of individual objectives where the formation tracking problem is cast into the Nash equilibrium seeking problem of a noncooperative game among ASVs subject to unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. To make each ASV seek the Nash equilibrium efficiently, adaptive neural network (NN) is adopted to approximate the unmodeled dynamics and nonsmooth feedback is utilized to deal with the effect of bounded external disturbances. It is theoretically shown that the states of ASVs including the position and heading angle states could asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium if the underlying communication graph is strongly connected and the control parameters of the Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms are suitably selected. Finally, an experimental study is performed to verify the validity of the theoretical results.

AB The development of unmanned aerial vehicles has been identified as a potential source of a weapon for causing operational disruptions against critical infrastructures. To mitigate and neutralise the threat posed by the misuse of drones against malicious and terrorist activity, this paper presents a holistic design of a long-range autonomous drone detection platform. The novelty of the proposed system lies in the confluence between the design of hardware and software components to effective and efficient localisation of the intruder objects. The research presented in the paper proposes the design and validation of a situation awareness component which is interfaced with the hardware component for controlling the focal length of the camera. The continuous stream of media data obtained from the region of vulnerability is processed using the object detection that is built on region based fully connected neural network. The novelty of the proposed system relies on the processing of multi-threaded dual-media input streams that are evaluated to mitigate the latency of the system. Upon the successful detection of malicious drones, the system logs the occurrence of intruders that consists of both event description and the associated media evidence for the deployment of the mitigation strategy. The analytics platform that controls the signalling of the low-cost sensing equipment contains the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 for detecting drones. The experimental testbeds developed for the validation of the proposed system has been constructed to include environments and situations that are commonly faced by critical infrastructure operators such as the area of protection, drone flight path, tradeoff between the angle of coverage against the distance of coverage. The validation of the proposed system has resulted in yielding a range of intruder drone detection by 250m with an accuracy of 95.5%.

AB Path planning of autonomous mobile robots in a real-world environment presents several challenges which are usually not raised in other areas. The real world is inherently complex, uncertain and dynamic. Therefore, accurate models of path planning are difficult to obtain and quickly become outdated. Anytime planners are ideal for this type of problem as they can find an initial solution very quickly and then improve it as time allows. This paper proposes a new anytime incremental search algorithm named improved Anytime Dynamic A*(iADA*). The algorithm is based on the currently popular anytime heuristic search algorithm, which is Anytime Dynamic A*(ADA*). The iADA* algorithm improves the calculation of the path lengths and decreases the calculating frequency of the path throughout the search, making it significantly faster. The algorithm is designed to provide an efficient solution to a complex, dynamic search environment when the locally changes affected. Our study shows that the two-dimensional path-planning iADA* experiments were between 2.0 to 3.7 times faster than ADA*, both in partially known and fully unknown dynamic environments. Additionally, in this paper shows the experiment results of the comparison with other four existing algorithms based on computing time and path lengths. iADA* was an average 2.57 times reduced on the computational time for the environment which locally changes effected. For the path length is little increase, but it is not the worst case. According to the experiments, the more the environmental problems and complexity increases, the more iADA* provides a rapid in-search time and total time to obtain the final solution.

AB Timely assessment of damages induced to buildings due to an earthquake is critical for ensuring life safety, mitigating financial losses, and expediting the rehabilitation process as well as enhancing the structural resilience where resilience is measured by an infrastructure's capacity to restore full functionality post extreme events. Since manual inspection is expensive, time consuming and risky, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles or robots can be leveraged as a viable alternative for quick reconnaissance. Visual data captured by the sensors mounted on the robots can be analyzed, and the damages can be detected and classified autonomously. The present study proposes the use of deep learning-based approaches to this end. Region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN) is exploited to detect four different damage types, namely, surface crack, spalling (which includes facade spalling and concrete spalling), and severe damage with exposed rebars and severely buckled rebars. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on manually annotated image data collected from reinforced concrete buildings damaged under several past earthquakes such as Nepal (2015), Taiwan (2016), Ecuador (2016), Erzincan (1992), Duzce (1999), Bingol (2003), Peru (2007), Wenchuan (2008), and Haiti (2010). Several experiments are presented in the paper to illustrate the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of the proposed approach for earthquake reconnaissance. It was observed that Inception-ResNet-v2 significantly outperforms the other networks considered in this study. The research outcome is a stepping stone forward to facilitate the autonomous assessment of buildings where this can be potentially useful for insurance companies, government agencies, and property owners.

AB The transportation industry has played a crucial role in advancing human society, but it has also raised concerns about carbon emissions and environmental pollution. As a result, significant research is being conducted in various areas, such as electric vehicles, powertrain energy efficiency, shared mobility, and autonomous driving. However, vehicles remain essential, and reducing their energy consumption is vital. One effective way to achieve this is by light-weighting vehicle materials. In the past, steel was the primary material used, but the transition to materials like aluminum has shown better weight-to-strength ratios. To drive change, we must explore the use of diverse materials since no single material is perfect. By combining specific materials, we can complement their weaknesses and enhance their strengths, opening up new possibilities for the future of mobility. One critical factor in advancing future mobility is the joining of dissimilar materials. This paper delves into various methods of joining dissimilar materials, their characteristics, and techniques to improve their joining performance. The joint strength for each joining method is also summarized in this study. The joining methods are primarily divided into mechanical joining, chemical joining using adhesives, and thermal fusion welding. Methods to enhance the joint include combining each joining method and improving surface interactions through surface treatments. The joint exhibiting the highest strength was the laser-welded joint of strength 312 MPa between Ti3Al-Nb alloy and Ni-based superalloy, while the lightest and strong joint was the friction stir-welded joint of strength 63.4 MPa in Polyamide 6 GFRP. Welded joints of polymer materials appear promising for the future mobility industry, particularly in terms of being lightweight. Additionally, there is a need to develop new methods to measure strength as the units used to represent the physical characteristics of the joints are not standardized. Some joints suffer from issues due to unclear joint area, highlighting the necessity to develop new strength measurement methods for future advancements.

AB Increased safety is one of the main motivations for traffic research and planning. The arduous task has two components: (i) improving the existing traffic policies based on a good understanding of risk factors related to trends in traffic accidents, and (ii) underpinning the emerging technologies that will advance the safety of vehicles. For the latter route, the introduction of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a promising option as CAVs can potentially reduce the number of accidents. However, to reap their benefits, they need to be introduced in a safe manner and tested for their ability to safely deal with risky scenarios. Unfortunately, the identification of such test scenarios remains a key challenge for the industry. This study contributes to increased safety by (i) analyzing UK's STATS19 accident data to identify patterns in past traffic accidents, and (ii) utilizing this information to systematically generate scenarios for CAV testing. For task (i), the patterns in the accidents were identified in terms of static and time-dependent internal and external factors. For this purpose, the study employed a clustering algorithm, COOLCAT, which is particularly suitable for dealing with high-dimensional categorical data. Six different clusters emerged naturally as a result of the algorithm. To interpret the clusters, we applied a frequency analysis to each cluster. The frequency tests showed that in each cluster, certain distinct real-world situations were represented more significantly compared to the non-clustered reference case, which are the markers of each cluster. The second task (ii) complemented the first task by synthesizing the relationships between attributes. This was done by association rule mining using the market basket analysis approach. The method enabled us to develop, drawing from the characteristics of the clusters, non-trivial test scenarios that can be used in the testing of CAVs, especially in virtual testing.

AB While researchers have stressed the potential of automated vehicle (AV) technology in improving mobility and accessibility for a range of people, only a few attempts have been made to examine the impact of this new technology on different segments of the population in a realistic setting using high-fidelity simulation. To fill this gap, we analyze the equity implications of Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) in three full-scale prototype cities using SimMobility, a state-of-theart activity- and agent-based framework. The prototype cities were developed based on two autodependent typologies, representing cities largely in the US/Canada, and a dense transit-oriented typology. We perform equity analyses at the individual and income-group level, in order to reveal the winners and losers from the introduction of AVs under two scenarios: (1) AMoD Intro, in which a low-cost AMoD service competes with mass transit, and (2) AMoD Transit Integration, where AMoD complements mass transit, via access/egress connectivity service to rapid transit stations. We evaluate the following outcomes: induced demand by age and income groups, mode share by income levels, individual kilometers traveled by different modes and income levels, and the spatial distribution of change in fare and accessibility. Outcomes are considered as equityoriented if they reduce accessibility gaps, particularly among disadvantaged populations. Our results indicate that in large population-dense and transit-oriented cities, the most equity-oriented outcomes can be achieved, due to extensive mass transit usage, which depresses car usage and restricts induced demand for AMoD. Such cities provide greater opportunities for low-income groups. Specifically, the AMoD Transit Integration scenario results in the best outcomes and implies a new market share, as disadvantaged groups, such as children and low-income individuals, were able to travel more using the integrated AMoD-transit service. Nevertheless, in cardependent cities, where accessibility gaps are much larger, AMoD Intro scenario performs better compared to AMoD Transit Integration, as it serves the less accessible population and significantly improves their opportunities.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to design a spherical sensor which can detect the surge from various directions to lay the foundation of the research of surge.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper designed a spherical sensor to detect the impact force generated by the surge. To realize the depth and stability control of the shallow underwater vehicles, it is necessary to do research and analysis on the surge in shallow waters. The spherical sensor with novel structure was skillfully composed of 24 cantilever beam pressure-type strain sensors. It is powerful to detect the surge from various directions simultaneously.
   Findings - It is proved that the spherical sensor can accurately collect the surge data from multiple directions through experiments, which laid the foundation of the anti-surge study.
   Research limitations/implications - Surge is not a new topic. But there is no effective tool to detect surge. The research of this paper is an attempt to provide an available tool to analyze surge. The research limitation is that the pool where the spherical sensor is installed is a little small. In the future, a bigger pool can be used.
   Practical implications - A deep and comprehensive analysis of surge can be conducted according to the surge data detected by the spherical sensor to achieve the essential features of surge. This lays the foundation for the accurate control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), especially fixed depth and stability control.
   Social implications - As the control accuracy of AUVs increases, the AUVs can perform much more difficult tasks such as port monitoring, underwater salvaging, underwater pipeline maintenance and so on. These can be applied in commercial applications or in the national defense of many countries.
   Originality/value - A novel spherical sensor using 24 cantilever beam pressure-type strain sensors to detect the surge was designed. The spherical sensor was installed in the physical surge simulator to collect surge data and conduct an analysis of the collected data.

TI EdgeDrones: Co-scheduling of drones for multi-location aerial computing

AB Low altitude platform (LAP) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also called drones, are currently being exploited by Edge computing (EC) systems to execute complex resource-hungry use cases, such as virtual reality, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, etc., by attaching portable edge devices on them. However, a typical drone has limited flight time, coupled with the resource-constrained attached edge device, which can jeopardize aerial computing missions if they are not holistically taking into consideration. Moreover, the fundamental challenge is how to co-schedule multi-drone among multi-location where EC services are needed, such that drones are scheduled to maximize the utility from the activities while meeting computing resource and flight time constraints. Therefore, for a given fleet of drones and tasks across disjointed target locations in a city, we derive a machine learning (ML) linear regression model that estimates these tasks resource requirement and execution time. Leveraging this estimation values, we jointly consider each drone's flight time availability and its attached edge device resource capacity, and formulate a novel Multi-Location Capacitated Mission Scheduling Problem (MLCMSP) that selects suitable drones and co-schedules their flight routes with the least total distance to visit and execute tasks at the target locations. Then, we show that faster scheduling and execution of complex tasks at each location, while considering the inter-task dependencies is important to achieve effective solution for our MLCMSP. Hence, we further propose EdgeDrones, a variant bin-packing optimization approach through gang-scheduling of inter-dependent tasks that co-schedules and co-locates tasks tightly so as to achieve faster execution time, as well as to fully utilize available resources. Extensive experiments on Alibaba cluster trace with information on task dependencies (about 12,207,703 dependencies) show that EdgeDrones achieves up to 73% higher resource utilization, up to 17.6 times faster executions, and up to 2.87 times faster flight travel time compared to the baseline approaches.

AB The decision of whether to cross a road or wait for a car to pass, humans make frequently and effortlessly. Recently, the application of drift-diffusion models (DDMs) on pedestrians' decision-making has proven useful in modelling crossing behaviour in pedestrian-vehicle interactions. These models consider binary decision-making as an incremental accumulation of noisy evidence over time until one of two choice thresholds (to cross or not) is reached. One open question is whether the assumption of a kinematics-dependent drift-diffusion process, which was made in previous pedestrian crossing DDMs, is justified, with DDM-parameters varying over time according to the developing traffic situation. It is currently unknown whether kinematics-dependent DDMs provide a better model fit than conventional DDMs, which are fitted per condition. Furthermore, previous DDMs have not considered reaction times for the not-crossing option. We address these issues by a novel experimental design combined with modelling. Experimentally, we use a 2-alternative-forced-choice paradigm, where participants view videos of approaching cars from a pedestrian's perspective and respond whether they want to cross before the car or to wait until the car has passed. Using these data, we perform thorough model comparison between kinematics-dependent and condition-wise fitted DDMs. Our results demonstrate that condition-wise fitted DDMs can show better model fits than kinematics-dependent DDMs as reflected in the mean-squared-errors. The condition-wise fitted models need considerably more parameters, but in some cases still outperform kinematics-dependent DDMs in measures that penalize the parameter number (e.g., Akaike information criterion). Introducing a starting point bias provides support for the novel hypothesis of rapid early evidence build-up from the initial view of the vehicle distance. The drift rates obtained for the condition-wise fitted models align with the assumptions in the kinematics-dependent models, confirming that pedestrians' decision processes are kinematics-dependent. However, the partial preference for condition-wise fitted models in the model selection suggests that the correct form of kinematics-dependence has not yet been identified for all DDM-parameters, indicating room for improvement of current pedestrian crossing DDMs. Developing more accurate models of human cognitive processes will likely facilitate autonomous vehicles to understand pedestrians' intentions as well as to show unambiguous human-like behaviour in future traffic interactions with humans.

AB The integration of electronic reconnaissance platforms and payloads in the electromagnetic and spatial domains of cognition is necessary for the successful execution of cognitive electronic reconnaissance missions. However, in partially observable environments, platforms and payloads interact in separate operational domains, making it a challenge for the model. The authors create a theoretical model of cognitive electronic reconnaissance, present an analysis method of model elements and derives adequate requirements for optimal radiation source sorting or recognition. Then, a 3D cognitive reconnaissance simulator 'Scouter' to simulate the dynamic interaction process of space electronic reconnaissance missions is developed and a deep reinforcement learning framework to optimise the electronic reconnaissance strategies of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is designed. For the first time, a method for judging reconnaissance area coverage using a behavioural angle is proposed. This method enables a deep reinforcement learning-based UAV with better reconnaissance behaviours and to realise the stable targeting of the target by the receiving antenna beam during reconnaissance. Moreover, the fast convergence of UAV agent training is ensured through the normalisation of partially observable status and reward shaping. Verified by adequate numerical simulations, a trained UAV can complete a 100 reconnaissance cycles mission with a completion rate of 91.9%. Even after the reconnaissance cycles are prolonged to 600, the mission completion rate can still be maintained at 78.5%. The most satisfying aspect is that the UAV comprehends the idea of reconnaissance and behaves in a way that is typical of it, such as by reciprocating or circling the edge of the radar's detecting power.

For the first time, a method for judging reconnaissance area coverage using a behavioural angle is proposed. Comparing the simulation results, it can be seen that after training the UAV has gained insights into the concept of reconnaissance and learnt the radar detection power and flying or reciprocating around outside the radar detection power is the more favoured reconnaissance by the UAV strategy.image

TI ATC Human Factors Involved in RPAS Contingency Management in

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL

DE RPAS operations; non-segregated airspace; contingency management
AB Objectives: The overall approach towards Remotely Piloted Aerial System integration into a non-segregated airspace is that the unmanned vehicles should be able to fit into the current air traffic management system, thus meeting all the technical and regulatory requirements to be treated similar to any other airspace user. Such a requirement implies that unmanned aircraft operations should behave as close as possible to manned aviation or at least generate the most negligible possible negative impact on the system. From the air traffic management point of view, this implies that air traffic controllers should be capable of effectively handling different types of RPAS operating in a nominal state but also when suffering a potential contingency. This paper aims to analyse how air traffic controllers involved in managing unmanned aircraft integration into non-segregated airspace are impacted when an unmanned vehicle suffers a contingency. Participants: Six air traffic controllers were the test subjects, complemented by one RPAS pilot and several pseudo-pilots controlling the simulated manned traffic. The project collected real-time simulation data to develop specific indicators to determine how the controllers' workload increases while managing complex traffic scenarios, including a single RPAS. Study Method: We conducted exhaustive traffic flight simulations, recreating complex airspace scenarios, including various RPAS types and mission-oriented trajectories. The involved RPAS were subjected to two of the most relevant contingencies: loss of the command-and-control link and engine failure. The experiments were evaluated in different operational scenarios, including using autonomous communication technologies to help air traffic controllers track the RPAS operation. Findings: The results indicate that the air traffic controller's perception and workload are not affected beyond reason by the introduction of an unmanned aircraft as a new element into the non-segregated airspace, even when that aircraft suffers a contingency. The flight-intent technology increases situational awareness, leading to more efficient and safe airspace management. Additional simulations may need to be performed to evaluate the impact on airspace capacity, safety, and workload when various unmanned vehicles are simultaneously inserted.

AB Assessing the impacts of new and disruptive technologies on the transportation system is crucial for planners and policymakers. This study offers an innovative method for estimating the impact of transportation network company (TNC, e.g., Uber and Lyft) operations on travel demand. Among various measures of travel demand, vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) is tested due to its broad applications in evaluating changes in transportation policy. The evaluation is based on counterfactual theory, which compares VMT estimates after the TNCs introduction to a region to what the VMT would have been without the TNCs. The latter of the two is a counterfactual, and this study develops and demonstrates the empirical Bayes (EB) approach for obtaining counterfactual VMT estimates. The EB approach is widely used to estimate crash frequency after a particular traffic safety treatment is applied to a roadway location. We reinterpret the traffic safety treatment as being akin to the introduction of TNCs in the Atlanta region and the estimation of crash frequency as analogous to the resulting change in VMT. Since the crash experience of a roadway site may be affected by several factors, like the VMT of a region, a robust counterfactual estimate is necessary for conducting a before-after study. A counterfactual VMT estimate is obtained by combining two VMT estimates from 1) the cross-sectional analysis for Atlanta and its regional peers and 2) the time-series analysis based on the longitudinal trend from the Atlanta region. We measure the difference between the counterfactual VMT estimate and the reported VMT estimate as an indicator of TNC impact. We find that the VMT estimates in a counterfactual scenario without TNCs are lower than the actual VMT estimates between 2012 and 2018. We estimate that the TNCs may be accounting for extra 0.6 percent average annual growth in VMT. The findings may support future TNC-related planning and policymaking. We expect the approach to be useful in estimating the effects of other disruptions, such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) introduction and lasting impact of the pandemic, on VMT.

ID OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
AB Path planning of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or its variant supported with weapon systems, also called unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), is one of the most crucial steps for the autonomous flight and requires compelling decisions being made by considering the existence of the enemy defence, obstacles, and battery or fuel capacity of the vehicle optimally before starting the flight. Immune plasma algorithm (IP algorithm or IPA), inspired by the convalescent plasma treatment which is a medical method being popularized again with the rise of new coronavirus or COVID-19, has been introduced recently as a new optimization technique and the promising performance of the mentioned algorithm validated through a set of numerical and engineering problems. In this study, the IP algorithm was specialized as a three-dimensional UCAV path planner for the first time. Its performance was investigated particularly by using three different battlefield environments and assigning various constants to the population size. Moreover, the effect of two IPA-specific control parameters that are responsible for determining the number of donors and number of receivers on the qualities of the calculated paths were analyzed in detail. The results obtained by the IPA were compared with the results of other three-dimensional path planners guiding optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA), gray wolf optimizer (GWO) and symbiotic organism search (SOS). Experimental studies showed that the main idea lying behind the usage of qualified solutions as donors and transferring information directly from them to the receivers representing the poor solutions of the problem gives a positive contribution to the exploitation-dominant operations of IPA and fully complies with the challenging requirements of the path planning problem. Especially in the battlefields for which an optimal or near optimal path contains complex maneuvers, the advantages from the subtly balanced operational steps of the IPA become more apparent by setting the number of donors and receivers appropriately and IPA is found to be more stable and successful compared to the other tested algorithms.

AB The control and management of Unmanned Combat Vehicles (UCVs) operating in an adversarial urban environment is a challenging task due, in part, to the imperfect and incomplete information available, the conflicting objectives of opposing teams, the uncertain stochastic dynamics, and the limitation in computational capability. In this paper, a decision policy built upon Markov decision processes is proposed to provide optimal routing and munitions management despite the conflicting objectives of the adversaries and the stochastic dynamics. The main novelty of the proposed decision policy lies in its handling of multiple UCV formations of varying dimensions. This multiformations capability is explicitly accounted for in the proposed formulation of the optimization problem. The UCVs, which constitute the blue team, have for objective to reach prescribed tactical target locations from a common starting point by following possibly different paths across an adversarial urban environment, within prescribed time windows and with maximum lethality. On their way, the UCVs will face an adversarial red team, which is composed of ground units that can engage any nearby UCV. The rendezvous objective of the blue team can be interpreted as a constraint in an optimization problem, aimed at minimizing damage while maximizing the total number of remaining munitions at the time the multiformations reach the targets. The blue and red teams play the roles of cost-function minimizer and maximizer, respectively. The worst-case minimization objective of the blue team is formulated as a finite-time optimization, which is solved by means of a dynamic programming equation with value function evolving according to a graph of feasible UCV paths. The resulting decision policy takes the form of a lookup table, which is ideal for online implementations. The practical case of imperfect information on the classification and the location of the adversarial ground units is addressed by means of a one-step lookahead rollout policy using estimates provided by a recursive Bayesian filter. Simulation results show that the concept of multiformations provides, on average, an improvement in performance when compared with single-formation routing.

AB Recent research in automated highway systems has ranged from low-level vision-based controllers to high-level route-guidance software. However, there is currently no system for tactical-level reasoning. Such a system should address tasks such as passing cars, making exits on time, and merging into a traffic stream. Many previous approaches have attempted to hand construct large rule-based systems which capture the interactions between multiple input sensors, dynamic and potentially conflicting subgoals, and changing roadway conditions. However, these systems are extremely difficult to design due to the large number of rules, the manual tuning of parameters within the rules, and the complex interactions between the rules. Our approach to this intermediate-level planning is a system which consists of a collection of autonomous agents, each of which specializes in a particular aspect of tactical driving. Each agent examines a subset of the intelligent vehicle's sensors and independently recommends driving decisions based on their local assessment of the tactical situation. This distributed framework allows different reasoning agents to be implemented using different algorithms.
   When using a collection of agents to solve a single task, it is vital to carefully consider the interactions between the agents. Since each reasoning object contains several internal parameters, manually finding values for these parameters while accounting for the agents' possible interactions is a tedious and error-prone task. In our system, these parameters, and the system's overall dependence on each agent, is automatically tuned using a novel evolutionary optimization strategy, termed Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL).
   Our system, which employs multiple automatically trained agents, can competently drive a vehicle, both in terms of the user-defined evaluation metric, and as measured by their behavior on several driving situations culled from real-life experience. In this article, we describe a method for multiple agent integration which is applied to the automated highway system domain. However, it also generalizes to many complex robotics tasks where multiple interacting modules must simultaneously be configured without individual module feedback.

TI Enhancement of deep-sea floor images obtained by an underwater vehicle

AB The underwater robot is one of the most important research tools in deep-sea exploration where the high pressure, extreme darkness, and radio attenuation prevent direct access. In particular, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are the focus of much attention since they do not have tethered cables and can navigate freely. However, ideally, AUVs should be able to make independent decisions even with limited information using mounted sensors. That is, AUVs need powerful programming and low-power consumption computer systems which enable them to recognize their surroundings and cruise for long distances. Thus, modern computer development makes it possible for AUVs to be one of the most practical solutions for deep-sea exploration and investigations. As a next-generation AUV, we have been developing a Sampling-AUV that can dive into deep-sea regions and bring back samples of marine creatures in order to more fully understand the marine ecosystem. Our mission scenario calls for the Sampling-AUV to transmit deep-sea floor images to scientists on the research ship using acoustic communication. The scientists select the marine creatures to sample, and the AUV is tasked with retrieving them. The AUV then returns to the area where the interesting marine creatures have been observed, and collects and brings back samples. In order to realize this mission scenario, the sea-floor images need to be enhanced to assist the judgment of the scientists as the color red attenuates rapidly and the images become bluish while small differences in AUV altitude to the sea-floor also affect the brightness of the images due to light attenuation. Moreover, although underwater acoustic communication is slow and inaccurate, the AUV is required to select interesting images that include marine life. In this paper, we propose a deep-sea floor image enhancement method based on the Retinex theory and its performance was evaluated using deep-sea floor images taken by an AUV. The performance of the image enhancement was evaluated through crab recognition.

AB Introduction: Vehicle technologies have the potential to help address the disproportionate crash risk that teen drivers face. While crash avoidance features benefit the general population, several address crash scenarios for which teen drivers are particularly at risk, such as rear-end and lane-drift crashes. Other emerging technologies have been designed for teen drivers by addressing certain crash or injury risk factors associated with risky driving behavior, such as speeding or not wearing a seat belt. Methods: Using nationwide U.S. crash data from 2016 to 2019, this study examined the maximum potential safety benefits of three currently available crash avoidance features (front crash prevention, lane departure prevention, and blind spot monitoring) and three teen-driver-specific technologies (speeding prevention, extended seatbelt reminders and interlocks, and nighttime curfew violation alerts). Results: Teen driver-specific features have the largest potential for reducing teen driver injuries and fatalities, followed by lane departure prevention, front crash prevention, and blind spot monitoring; however, altogether these technologies have the potential to prevent 78% of teen driver fatalities, 47% of injured teen drivers, and 41% of crashes involving teen drivers. Conclusions: Crash avoidance features and teen-driver-specific vehicle technologies appear to address different risk factors and crash scenarios, which emphasizes the importance of utilizing both types of safety features to reduce the crash risk of teen drivers. Practical applications: Wider acceptance, accessibility, and use of these technologies are needed for their safety potential to be realized. More manufacturers should offer and advertise teen-driver-specific technology suites that integrate crash avoidance systems and safety features that address risky driving behavior. While this study shows the maximum potential safety benefits of these technologies, further research is needed to understand the behavioral implications as teens learn to drive with these features.(c) 2022 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

AB The propulsion system is one of the important and vulnerable sub-systems in a strap-on launch vehicle. Among different failure modes, the thrust drop fault is the most common and remediable one. It degrades vehicle attitude tracking ability directly. To this end, this paper focuses on the design and application of attitude reconstruction problems with a thrust loss fault during the ascending flight phase. We firstly analyze the special failure modes and impacts on the propulsion system through a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Then, six degrees of freedom dynamic and kinematic models are formulated, which are integrated into the Matlab/Simulink environment afterward. The above models' validation is realized through numerical simulations with different fault severity. Simulation results show that the max attitude deviation is only 0.67 degrees approximately in the pitch angle channel under normal conditions, and the flight attitude angle deviation is directly proportional to the thrust loss percentage when the thrust drop fault occurs. Based on the validated models, a practical reconfigurable ideal through adjusting the control allocation matrix is analyzed. Then, an automation redistribution mechanism based on the moment equivalent principle before and after the thrust drop is proposed to realize proportional allocation of virtual control command among the actuators. The effectiveness of the designed attitude reconstruction method is demonstrated through numerical simulations and comparison analysis under various fault scenarios. The results show that the rocket attitude can be quickly adjusted to the predetermined program angle within about 2.5 s after the shutdown failure of a single engine, and the flight speed and altitude can also reach the required value with another 17 s engine operation. Therefore, the designed control reconfiguration strategy can deal with the thrust loss fault with high practicability and can be applied to real-time FTC systems. Last but not least, conclusions and prospects are presented to inspire researchers with further exploration in this field.

AB In the past two decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in many scientific research fields for various applications. In particular, the use of UAVs for magnetic surveys has become a hot spot and is expected to be actively applied in the future. A considerable amount of literature has been published on the use of UAVs for magnetic surveys, however, how to choose the platform and reduce the interference of UAV to the collected data have not been discussed systematically. There are two primary aims of this study: (1) To ascertain the basis of UAV platform selection and (2) to investigate the characteristics and suppression methods of UAV magnetic interference. Systematic reviews were performed to summarize the results of 70 academic studies (from 2005 to 2021) and outline the research tendencies for applying UAVs in magnetic surveys. This study found that multi-rotor UAVs have become the most widely used type of UAVs in recent years because of their advantages such as easiness to operate, low cost, and the ability of flying at a very low altitude, despite their late appearance. With the improvement of the payload capacity of UAVs, to use multiple magnetometers becomes popular since it can provide more abundant information. In addition, this study also found that the most commonly used method to reduce the effects of the UAV's magnetic interference is to increase the distance between the sensors and the UAV, although this method will bring about other problems, e.g., the directional and positional errors of sensors caused by erratic movements, the increased risk of impact to the magnetometers. The pros and cons of different types of UAV, magnetic interference characteristics and suppression methods based on traditional aeromagnetic compensation and other methods are discussed in detail. This study contributes to the classification of current UAV applications as well as the data processing methods in magnetic surveys.

AB In recent years, the automotive field has been changed by the accelerated rise of new technologies. Specifically, autonomous driving has revolutionized the car manufacturer's approach to design the advanced systems compliant to vehicle environments. As a result, there is a growing demand for the development of intelligent technology in order to make modern vehicles safer and smarter. The impact of such technologies has led to the development of the so-called Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), suitable to maintain control of the vehicle in order to avoid potentially dangerous situations while driving. Several studies confirmed that an inadequate driver's physiological condition could compromise the ability to drive safely. For this reason, assessing the car driver's physiological status has become one of the primary targets of the automotive research and development. Although a large number of efforts has been made by researchers to design safety-assessment applications based on the detection of physiological signals, embedding them into a car environment represents a challenging task. These mentioned implications triggered the development of this study in which we proposed an innovative pipeline, that through a combined less invasive Neuro-Visual approach, is able to reconstruct the car driver's physiological status. Specifically, the proposed contribution refers to the sampling and processing of the driver PhotoPlethysmoGraphic (PPG) signal. A parallel enhanced low frame-rate motion magnification algorithm is used to reconstruct such features of the driver's PhotoPlethysmoGraphic (PPG) data when that signal is no longer available from the native embedded sensor platform. A parallel monitoring of the driver's blood pressure levels from the PPG signal as well as the driver's eyes dynamics completes the reconstruction of the driver's physiological status. The proposed pipeline has been tested in one of the major investigated automotive scenarios i.e., the detection and monitoring of pedestrians while driving (pedestrian tracking). The collected performance results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The accurate large-scale measurement of peach crowns is vital in horticultural science and the optimization of orchard management. Nowadays, numerous crown parameters (e.g., crown area, height, and volume) can be obtained via the analysis of point clouds or photographs. Current laser-based sensors provide the required reliable and accurate information; however, they are costly and time-consuming. Therefore, a simpler approach for crown measurement is required. For this purpose, this study presents a pipeline for the monitoring and clustering of 259 peach tree crowns based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images of a peach orchard in Southeast China. Considering the limitation that the original aerial image dataset contains little information, a data augmentation process is adopted, and an efficient deep learning architecture based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) was designed to extract the crown area. Then, the shape of the crown area was clustered using an edge detection process and a k-means algorithm. Finally, an ellipsoid volume method (EVM) was applied to estimate the crown volume. Five indicators-namely, Qseg, Sr, Precision, Recall, and F-measure-were employed to evaluate the crown extraction effects, and the average results for testing samples were 0.832, 0.847, 0.851, 0.828, and 0.846, respectively. Compared with other approaches-namely, fully convolutional network (FCN), U-Net, SegNet21, the excess green index (ExG), and the color index of vegetation extraction (CIVE)-the proposed cGAN model performs better, achieving an accuracy improvement of 5%-25%. For the estimation of crown volume, using measurements from a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) scanner as a reference, the correlation coefficient and relativeroot-mean-square error (R-RMSE) were found to be 0.836% and 14.93%, respectively. Overall, the results demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible for measuring peach tree crowns. The wide application of such technology would facilitate applied research in plant phenotyping and precision horticulture.

TI Consumer preferences for on-demand transport in Australia

AB On-demand transport (ODT) refers to adaptive transport services that use a fleet of vehicles to provide shared flexible transport to consumers, when and where they need it. This study surveyed 3,985 geographically and demographically representative Australians nationwide, to understand consumer demand and willingness to pay for ODT in Australia. Our analysis finds that the current market for ODT services in Australia is small. For example, for an ODT service that costs roughly the same as UberX's ridesharing service, and offers comparable level-of-service, our analysis predicts that only 17 per cent of the Australian population can be expected to use the service a few times a week or more. However, shared electric autonomous vehicles could significantly change the business case for ODT services, by enabling on-demand door-to-door transport services at a fractional cost of similar existing services. Our analysis finds that while consumers are willing to pay, on average, 0.28$/km more to avoid sharing a vehicle with other passengers, 0.17$/km more for door-to-door service, and 0.10$/km to be able to book the service in real time, cost is the most important determinant of ODT use (of the service attributes included in our analysis). For an ODT service that provides the same level-of-service as UberX, but at a fractional cost of $0.30 per km, 31 per cent of the Australian population can be expected to use the service a few times a week or more. And this figure is likely to be larger once we account for more long-term changes in lifestyles that might accompany the introduction of these services. We find that frequency of ODT use is strongly correlated with age and lifecycle stage: young individuals who are employed full-time are likely to use ODT most frequently; older adults who have retired from the workforce and whose children have left home are likely to be infrequent users. Overall, our analysis indicates that ODT services have the ability to both increase public transport use among existing public transport customers, and to draw new customers to public transport services.

AB Vehicle sharing, electrification, and automation, as the triple revolutions in urban transportation, have been under debate towards a new transport paradigm. In this regard, carsharing services, as a potential solution for sustainable urban transport, have gained momentum within the context of sustainable cities in recent years. This research, as the first attempt in the literature, aims to render a comprehensive map of the body of knowledge in the carsharing field of research through conducting a systematic bibliometric analysis. To achieve that, a total of 729 peer-reviewed journal articles from the Web of Science database were scrutinized using keyword, text mining, and bibliographic coupling analyses. The analyses revealed four main research themes building the carsharing literature, including (1) collaborative consumption and carsharing business models development in the context of sustainable urban transport, (2) carsharing adoption with a special focus on user behavior, intention, and preferences, (3) carsharing operational challenges, considering infrastructure and fleet management, and (4) technological advancement towards deployment of shared autonomous vehicles and mobility as a service. The results showed that the carsharing literature lacks (i) a well-established and comprehensive longterm sustainability assessment framework, (ii) inclusive and integrative marketing and training plans, as well as effective incentives, (iii) a holistic analysis of the role of carsharing in the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, (iv) reliable circular economy indicators designed to measure the circularity of carsharing to help transitioning towards a circular economy, and (v) a timely broad analysis on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the future of carsharing post pandemic era, which call for more investigations in the future. The provided insights support both researchers and policy-makers by shedding light on carsharing services research by providing a state-of-the-art of carsharing studies and developments up to date, uncovering the emergent research themes and trends, and identifying research gaps for future studies towards better positioning carsharing services in sustainable cities development.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), when illuminated by high-power microwave (HPM), is vulnerable to losing control and even falling to the ground with damage. To explore the mechanism of the UAV's falling and its damage caused by HPM, the HPM radiation experiments on a certain kind of UAV are carried out. It is concluded that the UAV's cable is the main energy coupling path from HPM according to the analysis of the cable connection relationships among the flight control system (FCS), the electronic speed control (ESC) board, and the motors based on the experiment. Furthermore, the coupled voltages of the cable's termination load are obtained when the UAV is radiated by HPM with different carrier frequencies or incident directions using numerical calculation and typical test verification. To facilitate the analysis of circuit level, the equivalence of radiation and injection test is analyzed, so the waveform of the control signal related to the UAV's flight is recorded by the injection test. According to the experimental results and the principle of the UAV's flight dynamics, the effect mechanisms of the UAV's falling and its damage are clarified. The experimental results show that the carrier frequency of the HPM leading to the falling and damage of the UAV mainly depends on the length of the internal cable inside the UAV. The pulsewidth and the repetition frequency of HPM resulting in the UAV's falling are related to the pulsewidth and the period of the control signal of FCS. In addition, the coupled voltages induced on the twisted three-wire cables due to the illumination of HPM are verified to enter into the control signal port through parasitic capacitance and, finally, to damage the vulnerable components, including the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor inside the ESC and the motor of the UAV. The damage mechanism is determined to be the high-voltage breakdown and large current burning.

   transmission model; Moving bottleneck; Transition node model
ID KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC FLOW; NODE MODELS; FORMULATION
AB Traffic management on (smart) motorways is becoming increasingly important to extract the most out of the limited capacity that is available, especially during peak periods. Accurate modelling of traffic management measures in traffic flow simulation is therefore paramount to make accurate short, and/or long-term predictions, to aid offline and online applications. In this work we propose a novel macroscopic network loading model that supports variable speed limits (VSL). Most existing aggregate network loading models that support VSL impose speed limits instantaneously across the entire road section, ignoring the fact that only vehicles passing the speed limit sign are aware of the new limit (either by a driver seeing the signal, or in case of autonomous/connected vehicles via infrastructure-to vehicle-technology), this leads to a discrepancy between model and reality that one ideally would want to avoid. Another challenge that arises is that current state-of-the-art macroscopic network loading models, such as the link transmission model (LTM), do not track the internal state of the link while constructing their solution. This is especially useful in large-scale (macroscopic) simulations where its increased efficiency is valued highly. Unfortunately, this desirable property makes modelling traffic management measures such as VSL much more challenging. Virtually all existing methods to date rely on tracking the link's internal state to support VSL. Therefore, very few methods exist that offer proper support for VSL in LTM. At the same time, the methods that do exist have various limitations. In this work we propose a continuous-time LTM model that address these limitations, yields exact solutions, and supports VSL. The proposed solution method is an extension of the event-based LTM of Bliemer and Raadsen (2019) and Raadsen and Bliemer (2019) which can be considered a special case with a single speed limit. Three case studies are provided to demonstrate feasibility and general applicability of the proposed method and solution algorithm.

AB The article presents an overview of the theoretical and experimental work related to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) motion parameters estimation based on the integration of video measurements obtained by the on-board optoelectronic camera and data from the UAV's own inertial navigation system (INS). The use of various approaches described in the literature which show good characteristics in computer simulations or in fairly simple conditions close to laboratory ones demonstrates the sufficient complexity of the problems associated with adaption of camera parameters to the changing conditions of a real flight. In our experiments, we used computer simulation methods applying them to the real images and processing methods of videos obtained during real flights. For example, it was noted that the use of images that are very different in scale and in the aspect angle from the observed images in flight makes it very difficult to use the methodology of singular points. At the same time, the matching of the observed and reference images using rectilinear segments, such as images of road sections and the walls of the buildings look quite promising. In addition, in our experiments we used the projective transformation matrix computation from frame to frame, which together with the filtering estimates for the coordinate and angular velocities provides additional possibilities for estimating the UAV position. Data on the UAV position determining based on the methods of video navigation obtained during real flights are presented. New approaches to video navigation obtained using the methods of conjugation rectilinear segments, characteristic curvilinear elements and segmentation of textured and colored regions are demonstrated. Also the application of the method of calculating projective transformations from frame-to-frame is shown which gives estimates of the displacements and rotations of the apparatus and thereby serves to the UAV position estimation by filtering. Thus, the aim of the work was to analyze various approaches to UAV navigation using video data as an additional source of information about the position and velocity of the vehicle.

AB Presently, swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems confront an array of obstacles and constraints that detrimentally affect their efficiency and mission performance. These include restrictions on communication range, which impede operations across extensive terrains or remote locations; inadequate processing capabilities for intricate tasks such as real-time object detection or advanced data analytics; network congestion due to a large number of UAVs, resulting in delayed data exchange and potential communication failures; and power management inefficiencies reducing flight duration and overall mission endurance. Addressing these issues is paramount for the successful implementation and operation of swarm UAV systems across various real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel system designed to surmount these challenges through salient features such as fortified communication, collaborative hardware integration, task distribution, optimized network topology, and efficient routing protocols. Cost-effectiveness was prioritized in selecting the most accessible equipment satisfying minimum requirements, identified through comprehensive literature and market review. By focusing on energy efficiency and high performance, successful cooperation was facilitated through harmonized equipment and effective task division. The proposed system utilizes Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano for task division, endowing the UAVs with superior intelligence for navigating intricate environments, real-time object detection, and the execution of coordinated actions. The incorporation of the Ad Hoc UAV Network's decentralized approach enables system adaptability and expansion in response to evolving environments and mission demands. An efficient routing protocol was selected for the system, minimizing unnecessary broadcasting and reducing network congestion, thereby ensuring extended flight durations and enhanced mission capabilities for UAVs with limited battery capacity. Through the careful selection and testing of hardware and software components, the proposed swarm UAV system improves communication range, processing power, autonomy, scalability, and energy efficiency. This makes it highly adaptable and effective for a broad spectrum of real-world applications. The proposed system sets a new standard in the field, demonstrating how the integration of intelligent hardware, optimized task division, and efficient networking can overcome the limitations of current swarm UAV systems.

AB Gap distributions in forests reflect the spatial impact of man-made tree harvesting or naturally-induced patterns of tree death being caused by windthrow, inter-tree competition, disease or senescence. Gap sizes can vary from large (>100 m(2)) to small (<10 m(2)), and they may have contrasting spatial patterns, such as being aggregated or regularly distributed. However, very small gaps cannot easily be recorded with conventional aerial or satellite images, which calls for new and cost-effective methodologies of forest monitoring. Here, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and very high-resolution images to record the gaps in 10 temperate managed and unmanaged forests in two regions of Germany. All gaps were extracted for 1-ha study plots and subsequently analyzed with spatially-explicit statistics, such as the conventional pair correlation function (PCF), the polygon-based PCF and the mark correlation function. Gap-size frequency was dominated by small gaps of an area <5 m(2), which were particularly frequent in unmanaged forests. We found that gap distances showed a variety of patterns. However, the polygon-based PCF was a better descriptor of patterns than the conventional PCF, because it showed randomness or aggregation for cases when the conventional PCF showed small-scale regularity; albeit, the latter was only a mathematical artifact. The mark correlation function revealed that gap areas were in half of the cases negatively correlated and in the other half independent. Negative size correlations may likely be the result of single-tree harvesting or of repeated gap formation, which both lead to nearby small gaps. Here, we emphasize the usefulness of UAV to record forest gaps of a very small size. These small gaps may originate from repeated gap-creating disturbances, and their spatial patterns should be monitored with spatially-explicit statistics at recurring intervals in order to further insights into forest dynamics.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown promising results for autonomous sensing. UAVs have been deployed for multiple applications that include surveillance, mapping, tracking, and search operations. Finding an efficient path between a source and a goal is a critical issue that has been the focus of recent exploration. Many path-planning algorithms are utilized to find an efficient path for a UAV to navigate from a source to a goal with obstacle avoidance. Despite the extensive literature and numerous research proposals for path planning, dynamic obstacle avoidance has not been addressed with machine learning. When the obstacles are dynamic, i.e., they can change their position over time, and the constraints of the path planning algorithm become more challenging. This in turn adds a layer of complexity to the path planning algorithm. To address this challenge, a Q-learning algorithm is proposed in this work to facilitate efficient path planning for UAVs with both static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. We introduced the Shortest Distance Prioritization policy in the learning process which marginally reduces the distance that the UAV has to travel to reach the goal. Further, the proposed Q-learning algorithm adopts a grid-graph-based method to solve the path-planning problem. It learns to maximize the reward based on the agent's behavior in the environment. Through results, the performance comparison between the proposed approach and stateof-the-art path planning approaches such as A-star, Dijkstra, and Sarsa algorithms are evaluated in terms of learning time and path length. We show through results that the proposed approach results in improved performance when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further, the effect of an increased number of obstacles are evaluated on the performance of the proposed approach.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to be extensively employed for assisting wireless communications in the Internet of Things (IoT). On the other hand, terahertz (THz)-enabled intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is expected to be one of the core enabling technologies for forthcoming beyond-5G (B5G) wireless communications that promise a broad range of data-demand applications. In this article, we propose a UAV-mounted IRS (UIRS) communication system over THz bands for confidential data dissemination from an access point (AP) toward multiple ground user equipments (UEs) in IoT networks. Specifically, the AP intends to send data to the scheduled UE, while unscheduled UEs may behave as potential adversaries. To protect information messages from the privacy preservation perspective, we aim to devise an energy-efficient multi-UAV covert communication scheme, where the UIRS is for reliable data transmissions, and an extra UAV is utilized as an aerial cooperative jammer, opportunistically generating artificial noise (AN) to degrade unscheduled UEs detection, leading to communication covertness improvement. This poses a novel max-min optimization problem in terms of minimum average energy efficiency (mAEE), aiming to improve covert throughput and reduce UAVs' propulsion energy consumption, subject to satisfying some practical constraints such as the covertness requirements for which we obtain analytical expressions. Since the optimization problem is nonconvex, we tackle it via the block successive convex approximation (BSCA) approach to iteratively solve a sequence of approximated convex subproblems, designing the binary user scheduling, AP's power allocation, maximum AN jamming power, IRS beamforming, and both UAVs' trajectory and velocity planning. Finally, we present a low-complex overall algorithm for system performance enhancement with complexity and convergence analysis. Numerical results are provided to verify the analysis and demonstrate significant outperformance of our design over other existing benchmark schemes concerning the mAEE performance.

AB Preventing and mitigating high severity collisions is one of the main opportunities for Automated Driving Systems (ADS) to improve road safety. This study evaluated the Waymo Driver's performance within real-world fatal collision scenarios that occurred in a specific operational design domain (ODD). To address the rare nature of high-severity collisions, this paper describes the addition of novel techniques to established safety impact assessment methodologies. A census of fatal, human-involved collisions was examined for years 2008 through 2017 for Chandler, AZ, which overlaps the current geographic ODD of the Waymo One fully automated ridehailing service. Crash reconstructions were performed on all available fatal collisions that involved a passenger vehicle as one of the first collision partners and an available map in this ODD to determine the pre-impact kinematics of the vehicles involved in the original crashes. The final dataset consisted of a total of 72 crashes and 91 vehicle actors (52 initiators and 39 responders) for simulations. Next, a novel counterfactual "what-if" simulation method was developed to synthetically replace human-driven crash participants one at a time with the Waymo Driver. This study focused on the Waymo Driver's performance when replacing one of the first two collision partners. The results of these simulations showed that the Waymo Driver was successful in avoiding all collisions when replacing the crash initiator, that is, the road user who made the initial, unexpected maneuver leading to a collision. Replacing the driver reacting (the responder) to the actions of the crash initiator with the Waymo Driver resulted in an estimated 82% of simulations where a collision was prevented and an additional 10% of simulations where the collision severity was mitigated (reduction in crash-level serious injury risk). The remaining 8% of simulations with the Waymo Driver in the responder role had a similar outcome to the original collision. All of these "unchanged" collisions involved both the original vehicle and the Waymo Driver being struck in the rear in a front-to-rear configuration. These results demonstrate the potential of fully automated driving systems to improve traffic safety compared to the performance of the humans originally involved in the collisions. The findings also highlight the major importance of driving behaviors that prevent entering a conflict situation (e.g. maintaining safe time gaps and not surprising other road users). However, methodological challenges in performing single instance counterfactual simulations based solely on police report data and uncertainty in ADS performance may result in variable performance, requiring additional analysis and supplemental methodologies. This study's methods provide insights on rare, severe events that would otherwise only be experienced after operating in extreme real-world driving distances (many billions of driving miles).

AB Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as an important transmission technology for numerous applications in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the application of RIS in energy harvesting (EH) based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication network with finite block length (BL) codes, where a rotary wing type flying UAV communicates with the multiple single antenna IoT users with the aid of multiple RISs mounted on several skyscraper buildings. To transmit the signal to a particular IoT user, the UAV selects an RIS on the basis of either UAV-RIS (i.e., partial) or UAV-RIS-IoT (i.e., full) channel state information (CSI) and then transmits the signal through the selected RIS along with the direct link transmission. In particular, we derive (i) the expression for probability of RIS selection, (ii) the statistical distribution of instantaneously received information signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the IoT user. Based on the derived statistics, we analyze the performance of the considered system under finite BL codes in terms of the average outage probability, average block error rate (ABLER) and goodput averaged over entire flying duration. Moreover, the BLER performance with finite BL codes is also compared with the infinite BL codes scenario. Additionally, we also investigate the impact of various channel and system parameters like imperfect CSI, number of RISs and the number of reflecting elements at each RIS, location of IoT users, variable altitude of the UAV, and the severity of channel fading of UAV-RIS link on the system performance. Furthermore, we have obtained the optimum UAV location in each time slot which minimizes the ABLER per time slot over all the users in the network. The analytical results are corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations.

AB Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) constitute a revolutionary technique of beneficially reconfiguring the smart radio environment. However, despite the fact that wireless propagation is of time-varying nature, most of the existing RIS contributions focus on time-invariant scenarios for the following reasons. Firstly, it becomes impractical to instantaneously feed back the control signal based on the doubly selective non-line-of-sight (NLoS) fading scenario. Secondly, channel estimation conceived for the high-mobility and high-dimensional RIS-assisted links has to take into account the spatial-domain (SD), time-domain (TD), and frequency-domain (FD) correlations imposed by the angle-of-arrival/departure (AoA/AoD), the Doppler and the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) operations, respectively, where none of the existing solutions can be directly applied. Thirdly, it is far from trivial to maximize the NLoS channel powers on all subcarriers by a common set of RIS reflecting coefficients. Fourthly, in the face of double selectivity, it becomes inevitable to encounter either inter-symbol interference (ISI) or inter-channel interference (ICI) during the signal detection in the TD or in the FD, respectively. Against this background, firstly, we focus our attention on line-of-sight (LoS) dominated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scenarios. Secondly, we conceive new minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimation methods for doubly selective fading, which perodically transmit pilot symbols embedded into the TD and FD over the SD in order to beneficially exploit the correlations in the three domains. Thirdly, the RIS coefficients are optimized by a low-complexity algorithm based on the LoS representation of the end-to-end system model. Fourthly, tailor-made interference cancallation techniques are devised for improving the signal detection both in the FD and in the TD. Our simulation results are examined in six frequency bands licensed in 5 G, which confirms that the employment of RIS is capable of achieving substantial performance improvements.

AB Objective The effect of reclined seatbacks during frontal crashes in children seated on a belt-positioning booster (BPB) is not understood. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine submarining in reclined child occupants with and without a BPB and with and without a simulated pre-pretensioner (PPT). We used the Large Omnidirectional Child (LODC) Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) seated on a production vehicle seat with and without a moderately reclined seatback angle during sled-simulated frontal vehicle crashes. Methods Ten sled-simulated frontal impact tests were performed (24 g peak, 80 ms duration, 56 km/h delta-V). An adjustable D-ring anchor simulated a seat integrated belt. A fixed load-limited 3-point seatbelt webbing system was used to secure the LODC to a vehicle seat and booster seat. We compared the following conditions: a) BPB vs no-BPB and b) 25 degrees versus 45 degrees seatback angles, c) PPT, vs no-PPT in 45 degrees seatback condition, each test was repeated. Abdominal forces (left and right), seatbelt loads, Anterior-Superior-Illiac-Spine forces (ASIS, upper and lower, left and right), and pelvis rotation were analyzed. Results Average peak abdominal pressures were smaller in both nominal and moderate recline positions in the BPB (25 degrees: 73.7 kPa, 45 degrees: 82.5 kPa) compared to the no-BPB conditions (25 degrees: 168.4 kPa, 45 degrees: 339.1 kPa). In the 45 degrees recline no-BPB conditions, both the peaks of the lap belt force and ASIS forces occurred early and a rapid reduction in those forces followed. This change in the lap belt and ASIS forces accompanied a rearward rotation of the pelvis. During the reduction of ASIS and lap belt forces, there was an increase in abdominal pressure suggesting that the lap belt moved upward, off the ASIS, and into the abdominal pressure sensor. There was a slight reduction in head and knee excursion with the PPT. These results suggest the presence of submarining in the 45 degrees recline no-BPB conditions but not in the 45 degrees recline with the BPB. Conclusions The BPB could be beneficial when the seatback is moderately reclined. The differences during the moderate recline between the BPB and no-BPB conditions also indicate that the BPB could prevent submarining in moderately reclined seats.

AB Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained attention due to increased use-cases in healthcare, monitoring, surveillance, and logistics operations. UAVs mainly communicate with mobile base stations, ground stations (GS), or networked peer UAVs, known as UAV swarms. UAVs communicate with GS, or UAV swarms, over wireless channels to support mission-critical operations. Communication latency, bandwidth, and precision are of prime importance in such operations. With the rise of data-driven applications, fifth-generation (5G) networks would face bottlenecks to communicate at near-real-time, at low latency and improved coverage. Thus, researchers have shifted towards network designs that incorporate beyond 5G (B5G) networks for UAV designs. However, UAVs are resource-constrained, with limited power and battery, and thus centralized cloud-centric models are not suitable. Moreover, as exchanged data is through open channels, privacy and security issues exist. Federated learning (FL) allows data to be trained on local nodes, preserving privacy and improving network communication. However, sharing of local updates is required through a trusted consensus mechanism. Thus, blockchain (BC)-based FL schemes for UAVs allow trusted exchange of FL updates among UAV swarms and GS. To date, limited research has been carried out on the integration of BC and FL in UAV management. The proposed survey addresses the gap and presents a solution taxonomy of BC-based FL in UAVs for B5G networks due to the open problem. This paper presents a reference architecture and compares its potential benefits over traditional BC-based UAV networks. Open issues and challenges are discussed, with possible future directions. Finally, a logistics case study of BC-based FL-oriented UAVs in 6G networks is presented. The survey aims to aid researchers in developing potential UAV solutions with the key integrating principles over a diverse set of application verticals.

AB Natural gas is an abundant resource across the United States, of which methane (CH4) is the main component. About 2% of extracted CH4 is lost through leaks. The Remote Methane Leak Detector (RMLD)-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system was developed to investigate natural gas fugitive leaks in this study. The system is composed of three major technologies: miniaturized RMLD (mini-RMLD) based on Backscatter Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS), an autonomous quadrotor UAV and simplified quantification and localization algorithms. With a miniaturized, downward-facing RMLD on a small UAV, the system measures the column-integrated CH4 mixing ratio and can semi-autonomously monitor CH4 leakage from sites associated with natural gas production, providing an advanced capability in detecting leaks at hard-to-access sites compared to traditional manual methods. Automated leak characterization algorithms combined with a wireless data link implement real-time leak quantification and reporting. This study placed particular emphasis on the RMLD-UAV system description and the quantification algorithm development based on a mass balance approach. Early data were gathered to test the prototype system and to evaluate the algorithm performance. The quantification algorithm derived in this study tended to underestimate the gas leak rates and yielded unreliable estimations in detecting leaks under 7 m(3)/s (1 Standard Cubic Feet per Hour (SCFH)). Zero-leak cases can be ascertained via a skewness indicator, which is unique and promising. The influence of the systematic error was investigated by introducing simulated noises, of which Global Positioning System (GPS) noise presented the greatest impact on leak rate errors. The correlation between estimated leak rates and wind conditions were investigated, and steady winds with higher wind speeds were preferred to get better leak rate estimations, which was accurate to approximately 50% during several field trials. High precision coordinate information from the GPS, accurate wind measurements and preferred wind conditions, appropriate flight strategy and the relative steady survey height of the system are the crucial factors to optimize the leak rate estimations.

AB We are in the interim of the massive expansion of the new and fundamental technology, which is represented by the advanced algorithms of AI. No one knows the real potential of machine learning and AI. Letting the algorithms drive autonomous vehicles (driverless cars) is like running the Boston Marathon. Creating an ethically completely autonomous AI system is like a piloted flight to Alpha Centauri. Nevertheless, we still live in the world of algorithms. Today there are algorithms in every corner of civilization, as quantum fluctuations they are integrally interwoven into the structure of everyday life. They are not just in your mobile phone or laptop. Algorithms plan flights and then fly with planes. Algorithms run factories, the bank is a vast array of algorithms, evaluating our credit score, algorithms collect revenue and keep records, read medical images, diagnose cancer, drive cars, write scientific texts, compose music, conduct symphony orchestras, navigate drones, speak to us and for us, write film scenarios, invent chemical formulations for a new cosmetic cream, order, advise, paint pictures. Climate models decide what is a safe carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere, NSA algorithms decide whether you are a potential terrorist. If every algorithm suddenly stopped working, it would be the end of the world as we know it. How did this new alliance, this interim world come into existence, does it suit us, and how and where will it develop? What AI algorithms have shown and offered to us so far is just a prelude, and even today it turns out that politics, ethics and law do not know what to do with the consequences of these changes. However, when we experience computer control by a mere idea, complex genetic modifications, and DNA enhancement using CRISPR, or perhaps flying cars, we can expect real challenges related to the power of algorithms. Then AI algorithms will really transform everything. The study analyzes the social contradictions, promises and limitations associated with how the desire to move higher on technological prominence in the realm of artificial intelligence faces the ethical, legal and political barriers of the existing order of things.

AB With millions of devices connected together, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become an emerging technology for future wireless networks. The ever-increasing number of smart devices and data hungry applications demand a high Quality-of-Service (QoS) for IoT. In conventional networks, data being sent to cloud for computational purpose leads to poor QoS. In order to address QoS challenges, mobile edge networks have emerged as a promising solution. In edge networks, bringing the networks resources closer to the end devices results in improved QoS. The maneuverability and the ease of versatile deployment coupled with cost efficiency makes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) a promising candidate for future edge networks. The UAVs can act as edge servers to provide computational capabilities and improved services to the edge devices. Due to the flying ability, UAVs can establish better line-of-sight link with the ground devices. In this paper, we consider that the edge devices in the area of interest have to be facilitated with a certain desired QoS, which is based on the notion of outage probability of the wireless link between the UAV and the edge devices. In this context, we first propose a novel method that computes the optimum height at which UAV should hover, resulting in maximum coverage radius with sufficiently small outage probability. Then the geographical area is divided in optimal number of clusters using a novel algorithm based on K-means clustering. The method computes the optimum number of UAVs required for covering the area of interest. Each of the UAVs utilizes 3D beamforming in order to cover its own coverage area. For this purpose, we are taking coordinate transformation of the original area and forming a wide beam to cover the desired area. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared to existing methods, which validate the utilization of the proposed method over large scale network applications.

DE PPP-RTK; INS; Vision; Rapid ambiguity resolution; Tightly coupled

AB Emerging applications like autonomous cars and unmanned aerial vehicles demand accurate, continuous and reliable positioning. The PPP-RTK technique, which could provide a rapid centimeter-accurate positioning service using a single GNSS receiver, has been recognized as a promising tool for mass-market and automotive applications. Nevertheless, the positioning performance of PPP-RTK degrades in urban environments because of the frequent signal deteriorating and blocking. Inertial navigation system (INS) is commonly integrated with GNSS to improve the continuity, accuracy and reliability of precise positioning as it has several advantages of all-environment operability and high temporal resolution, but it is limited by rapid error accumulation in long-term operation, especially when a microelectromechanical system inertial measurement unit (MEMS-IMU) is employed. Fortunately, the camera, another low-cost sensor, which provides rich information about the surrounding environment, is expected to improve the navigation performance further. This contribution develops a tightly integrated PPP-RTK/MEMS/vision model to achieve continuous and accurate positioning in urban environments. The raw data of MEMS-IMU and a stereo camera, as well as the high-precision GNSS phase measurements, are fused based on a multistate constraint Kalman filter to fully exploit the complementary properties from heterogeneous sensors. On this basis, a fast ambiguity resolution is achievable with the augmentation of the high-precision INS/vision information and the precise atmospheric corrections. The proposed integrated system is validated by several vehicle experiments conducted in urban areas. Results indicate that a centimeter-level accuracy of 4.1, 2.2 and 7.3 cm in the east, north and up components, respectively, and a high fixing percentage of 96.8% can be achieved for PPP-RTK/MEMS/vision in an urban environment, which exhibits comparable performance with respect to the tight integration of PPP-RTK and a tactical IMU. Besides, ambiguity refixing can be implemented instantaneously for the integrated system when going under three consecutive overpasses in 25 s.

AB In this manuscript we show that in shallow water an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can be used to quantify the horizontal and vertical structure of turbulence. We present data obtained during the Layered Organization in the Coastal Ocean (LOCO) experiment, which took place in a very shallow region of Monterey Bay at nighttime in the summer of 2006. The AUV employed was the T-REMUS vehicle, which contains a variety of the microscale and finescale sensors as well as supporting "hotel" sensors which monitor its position and performance. The vehicle was run in a 5-degree yoyo mode and, using the Rockland Microstructure Measurement System (RMMS), was able to obtain direct estimates of the turbulent dissipation rate on a vertical scale of 0.5 m. The yoyo sampling scheme allowed the finestructure and microstructure data to be obtained with an average horizontal sampling distance of 150 m. We examine the spatial structure of turbulence over a horizontal range of 2.5 km and throughout most of the water column, from 1 m from the surface to 4 m above the bottom. Eight hours of such data were collected.
   The experiment took place during a time period of very light wind forcing, little air sea exchange, and weak tidal flow. Nonetheless, strong turbulence, characterized by a turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate of epsilon>10(-7)W/kg and buoyancy Reynolds number of Re(b) > 10(3), was observed throughout the experimental region. The turbulence, for the most part, was patchy and typically confined to the surface and bottom boundary layer regions. However, towards the end of the experiment a spatially continuous region of turbulence of at least 2.5 km extent was observed in the upper part of the thermocline. This occurred during the time period when an internal wave train appeared in the experimental area. Evidence is presented which suggests that the internal wave induced vertical strain gradient was responsible for producing this turbulent field. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, while mm-wave communication has high power efficiency, it has strong straightness, so it is difficult to secure stable communication in an environment with blocking. Especially when considering use cases such as autonomous driving, continuous communication is required when transmitting streaming data such as moving images taken by vehicles, it is necessary to compensate the blocking problem. For this reason, the authors examined an optimum radio access technology (RAT) selection scheme which selects mm-wave communication when mm-wave can be used and select wide-area macro communication when mm-wave may be blocked. In addition, the authors implemented the scheme on a prototype device and conducted field tests and confirmed that mm-wave communication and macro communication were switched at an appropriate timing.

AB ObjectiveThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of agent-based models, focusing specifically on their application in urban transportation research. It identifies research gaps and challenges while outlining the key potential directions for future research.MethodologyTo conduct this study, a bibliometric analysis has been performed on 309 documents obtained from the Scopus database. The resulting clustering analysis has been further supplemented with content analysis.FindingsThe analysis reveals the existence of nine distinct clusters representing a wide range of research methods and problem interpretations in the field. In-depth examination of selected publications within each cluster has helped to identify key challenges faced by agent-based modelling approaches. These challenges include enhancing computing efficiency, developing unified calibration and validation methods, ensuring reproducibility of work, and incorporating various modules or frameworks into models to accurately replicate the complexities of the transport system and travel behaviour within specific application contexts.

AB In this paper, we consider a underwater wireless sensor network, which is composed of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and the underwater data collection stations. Constrained by limited resources, at each decision epoch the AUV selects one underwater data collection station to update the data and then uploads it to the surface base station. Different from other underwater communication models, we consider the influence of underwater environment on the AUV and develop an AUV model with random lifetime, meanwhile, we further propose that the information arrives randomly with different importance levels. The system model is formulated into a discounted Markov decision process with infinite horizon. Taking the age of information and the importance of information as the performance metrics, the optimal scheduling strategy of the AUV is developed, and the threshold structure characteristics of the optimal strategy are proved. Finally, the numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results, and the impacts of system parameters on the optimal strategy and the value function are also investigated.

AB We consider a scenario where mobile agents are required to collect measurements from a geographically dispersed set of sensors and return them to a base. An agent faces a risk of destruction while traversing the environment to reach the sensors, and gets a reward for gathering a sensor measurement only if it successfully returns to base. We first consider the single agent scenario and characterize several properties of the optimal policy for the agent based on a quantity that we term the "reward-to-risk" ratio of the tasks. We provide the optimal policy when the risk of destruction is sufficiently high, and then extend our analysis to multiple (heterogeneous) agents, with potentially different costs and survival probabilities. In particular, when the risk of destruction is sufficiently high, we show that the multi-agent task allocation problem has a submodular structure, and accordingly provide a greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to return an allocation that is within a 1/2 factor of optimal.

AB Data collection in underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is a more robust solution than traditional approaches, instead of transmitting data from each node to a destination node. However, the design of delay-aware and energy-efficient path planning for AUVs is one of the most crucial problems in collecting data for UWSNs. To reduce network delay and increase network lifetime, we proposed a novel reliable AUV-based data-collection routing protocol for UWSNs. The proposed protocol employs a route planning mechanism to collect data using AUVs. The sink node directs AUVs for data collection from sensor nodes to reduce energy consumption. First, sensor nodes are organized into clusters for better scalability, and then, these clusters are arranged into groups to assign an AUV to each group. Second, the traveling path for each AUV is crafted based on the Markov decision process (MDP) for the reliable collection of data. The simulation results affirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technique in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, delay, and reliability.

AB Many safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles and service robots, must achieve high-level task specifications with performance guarantees. Much recent progress toward this goal has been made through an automatic controller synthesis from temporal logic specifications. Existing approaches, however, have been limited to relatively short and simple specifications. Furthermore, existing methods either consider some prior discretization of the state space, deal only with a convex fragment of temporal logic, or are not provably complete. We propose a scalable, provably complete algorithm that synthesizes continuous trajectories to satisfy nonconvex temporal logic over reals (RTL) specifications. We separate discrete task planning and continuous motion planning on-the-fly and harness highly efficient Boolean satisfiability and linear programming solvers to find dynamically feasible trajectories that satisfy nonconvex RTL specifications for high-dimensional systems. The proposed design algorithms are proven sound and complete, and simulation results demonstrate our approach's scalability.

AB This article addresses the problem of path following for underactuated unmanned surface vessels (USVs) formation via a modified deep reinforcement learning with random braking (DRLRB). A formation control model based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is constructed to urge USVs to form a preset formation. Specifically, an efficient reward function is designed from the perspective of velocity and error distance of each USV related to the given formation, and then a novel random braking mechanism is formulated to prevent the training of the decision-making network from falling into the local optimum and failing to achieve the training objectives. Following that, a virtual leader-based path-following guidance system is developed for the USV formation problem. Wherein, with the aid of DRLRB, our proposed system can adjust formation automatically and flexibly even when some USVs deviate from the formation. Simulation verifies the effectiveness and superiority of our formation and path-following control strategy.

AB In robotics and mapping, prior knowledge of an environment can be included as virtual assets to a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solution. Borrowing the concept of affordances from robotic manipulation (i.e. virtual/interactive object models/primitives), this work addresses the fundamental duality in discrepancies between virtual and physical structures for localization and mapping. We propose a multimodal/non-Gaussian solution as a fundamental mechanism to leverage navigation-affordance assets during the localization and mapping process while simultaneously identifying any mismatches from the physical object. This allows the localization and mapping state-estimate more robust access to non-conventional and imperfect prior information about the environment, while computationally identifying assumed model discrepancies from imperfect sensor data. We use non-Gaussian factor graphs as modeling language to incorporate navigation-affordances with multi-sensor data similar to SLAM methods. We illustrate the approach with synthesized and real-world data from the construction industry where digital assets (such as drawings or models) are good proxies for how navigation-affordances can be generated and used in general.

AB The formation control for the effective operation of multiple vessels is discussed. First, a virtual matrix approach is proposed to improve the formation robustness and transform performance during swarm operations, which is created based on the virtual leader vessel location, and agents composing the formation follow cells in the matrix to maintain formation. This approach is affected by the virtual leader vessel location. The virtual leader vessel location is defined by two cases: matrix center and geometric center; furthermore, robustness and efficiency comparison simulations are performed. The simulation results show that in most formations, the geometric center is better in terms of efficiency and robustness. Second, the isosceles triangle guidance algorithm is proposed to improve the "go-back behavior" of certain agents during excessive maneuvering. Through a waypoint-following simulation, the algorithm is confirmed to be superior to the line-of-sight guidance algorithm. The swarm simulation on the virtual map verifies the performance of the proposed formation control and guidance algorithm.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous vehicle technologies, how to perform high-precision localization in unknown complex outdoor environment has become an important issue. Visual odometry is one of the low-cost and the most widely utilized localization methods. Traditional methods predict relative pose based on the principle of multi-view geometry, which is sensitive to camera parameters and environmental changes. This paper studies deep learning-based methods which can be more robust. A novel end-to-end unsupervised visual odometry framework based on confidence evaluation is proposed. Its process can be divided into two stages. The first is predicting the initial relative pose transformation with the help of confidence mask which is generated by measuring the relative similarity of geometric corresponding regions in associated images. The second is evaluating the confidence of the output pose estimate based on the trajectory geometric consistency and then refining it. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the proposed approach on KITTI dataset are presented to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving pose estimation accuracy and robustness.

ID RANDOM-WALKS; CONSENSUS; LEADERSHIP; NETWORKS; TOPOLOGY; MODEL
AB Agents are normally designed to be self-interested and tend to maximize their own interests in many realistic systems, such as robotics, smart grids and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a model of repeated bimatrix game to study the ubiquitous group behavior, coalescence, in multi-agent systems, where different agents form a union and keep consensus in states. We find that whether the system can reach coalescence will significantly depend on the payoffs, the functions of the distance between agents' states. As a result, if the maximum initial distance of agents' states is sufficiently large, all agents in the population will fail to reach coalescence. If the maximum initial distance remains sufficiently small, on the contrary, all agents will form a union. Moreover, the distribution and the expected value of coalescence time are explicitly obtained when the utility of agents is described by a power function. Finally, simulation examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB E-commerce and retail companies are seeking ways to cut delivery times and costs by exploring opportunities to use drones for making last mile delivery deliveries. This paper addresses the delivery concept of a truck-drone combination along with the idea of allowing autonomous drones to fly from delivery trucks, make deliveries, and fly to any available delivery truck nearby. We present a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation that captures this scenario with the objective of minimizing the arrival time of both trucks and drones at the depot after completing the deliveries. A new algorithm based on insertion heuristics is also developed to solve large sized problems containing up to a hundred locations. Experiments are conducted to compare the MIP solutions with those obtained from different models with single truck, multiple truck and a single truck and drone system, as well as test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The numerical results demonstrate the potential operational gain when implementing the proposed drone delivery system compared to the conventional truck alone or single truck/drone delivery system.

AB This work proposes an ADRC (Active Disturbance Rejection Control) strategy by disturbance extended observers to stabilize a moving riderless bicycle with a variant forward speed. Although the bicycle has an unstable and non-linear dynamics when in its upright position, which can be modeled as a LPV (Linear-Parameter-Varying) system that depends on the forward speed, a simplified time-invariant and lumped-parameter model, with an nominal constant forward speed is used in the controller design. ADRC scheme groups discrepancies between the simplified model and the plant, with external disturbances into an equivalent additive unified disturbance signal at input, which is estimated via the observer and rejected through a linear control law. The effectiveness of this strategy is validated by a co-simulation between ADAMS and MATLAB, which exhibits a high performance and robustness in a virtual dynamic model of the bicycle, submitted to severe external disturbances and parameter variations.

AB The traffic sign detection and recognition system is an essential module of the driver warning and assistance system. During the last few years much research effort has been devoted to autonomous vehicle navigation using different algorithm. Proposed work includes a neural network based drivers assistance system for traffic sign detection. In this paper authors have implemented a high-speed color camera to enhance its performance in real time scanning. The proposed algorithm increases the efficiency of the system by 7 to 10% as compared to conventional algorithms. The system includes two main modules: detection module and recognition module. In the detection module, the thresholding is used to segment the image. The features of traffic signs are investigated and used to detect potential objects. In recognition module, we use complimenting and then ANDing techniques. The joint use of classification and validation networks can reduce the false positive rate. There liability demonstrated by the proposed method suggests that this system could be a part of an integrated driver warning and assistance system based on computer vision technology.

AB Suspended particle size and concentration are critical parameters that are necessary to understand water quality, sediment dynamics, carbon flux, and ecosystem dynamics, among other ocean processes. In this study we detail the integration of a Sequoia Scientific, Inc., Laser In Situ Scattering and Transmissometry (LISST) sensor into a Teledyne Webb Research Slocum autonomous underwater glider. These sensors are capable of measuring particle size, concentration, and beam attenuation by particles in size ranges from 1.00 to 500 mu m at a resolution of 1 Hz. The combination of these two technologies provides the unique opportunity to measure particle characteristics persistently at specific locations or to survey regional domains from a single profiling sensor. In this study we present the sensor integration framework, detail quality assurance and control procedures, and provide a case study of storm-driven sediment resuspension and transport. Specifically, Rutgers glider RU28 was deployed with an integrated LISST-Glider for 18 days in September of 2017. During this period, it sampled the nearshore environment off coastal New Jersey, capturing full water column sediment resuspension during a coastal storm event. A novel method for in situ background corrections is demonstrated and used to mitigate long-term biofouling of the sensor windows. In addition, we present a method for removing schlieren-contaminated time periods utilizing coincident conductivity temperature and depth, fluorometer, and optical backscatter data. The combination of LISST sensors and autonomous platforms has the potential to revolutionize our ability to capture suspended particle characteristics throughout the world's oceans.
   SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study details the integration and deployment of an optical particle size and concentration system on an autonomous underwater vehicle. The unique combination of this sensor and platform will enable broad sampling of suspended particle characteristics across the coastal and global oceans, within extreme storm events, in coastal river plumes, and throughout the deep oceans' "twilight zones." This will greatly enhance our ability to monitor water quality, sediment mobilization, ecosystem dynamics, pollutant fate and effects, and carbon export flux, among other important ocean-observing applications.

AB Roadside light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is commonly used to record the traffic data of the whole intersection scene or road segment in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). However, general deep-learning object detection methods do not adequately consider the static background captured by roadside LiDAR. Moreover, critical issues remain to be overcome in object detection using roadside LiDAR: false alarms caused by complex background interference and multiscale objects with limited characteristics. To this end, a feature enhancement and cascade network (FecNet) is proposed to alleviate the problems. From the perspective of feature enhancement, FecNet improves foreground feature discrimination by extracting foreground information and fusing it with feature maps of multiple stages. Also, from the perspective of feature cascade, a feature cascade backbone is proposed to enhance the localization and contextual information of multiscale objects with limited characteristics. Comprehensive experiments are conducted using a roadside LiDAR dataset. The experimental results suggest that FecNet is superior to the benchmark detectors and achieves better computational efficiency and detection accuracy.

AB This article proposes a planetary autonomous soft pinpoint adaptive fixed-time feedback landing guidance scheme based on the sliding mode control that is subject to thruster magnitude constraint, unknown control acceleration deviation, and disturbance without a priori knowledge. More specifically, a sliding surface is designed, and its gain is adjusted by the system state, increasing the convergence rate. Then, the adaptive law is proposed to compensate for the thruster magnitude constraint, unknown control acceleration deviation, and disturbance without a priori knowledge. On these bases, a thruster-magnitude-constrained feedback landing guidance is developed to ensure the fixed-time stability of the vehicle even in the presence of unknown control acceleration deviation and disturbance without priori knowledge. Furthermore, numerical simulations are performed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Moreover, its near-fuel-optimal performance is illustrated by comparing it with offline fuel-optimal guidance.

AB The great performance of machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks in several perception and control tasks is pushing the industry to adopt such technologies in safety-critical applications, as autonomous robots and self-driving vehicles. At present, however, several issues need to be solved to make deep learning methods more trustworthy, predictable, safe, and secure against adversarial attacks. Although several methods have been proposed to improve the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, most of them are tailored for specific classes of adversarial examples, hence failing to detect other corner cases or unsafe inputs that heavily deviate from the training samples. This paper presents a lightweight monitoring architecture based on coverage paradigms to enhance the model robustness against different unsafe inputs. In particular, four coverage analysis methods are proposed and tested in the architecture for evaluating multiple detection logic. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in detecting both powerful adversarial examples and out-of-distribution inputs, introducing limited extra-execution time and memory requirements.

AB In this paper, the multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) task allocation (TA) problem in ocean current environment based on a novel reinforcement learning approach is studied. First, the ocean current environment including direction and intensity is established and a reward function is designed, in which the AUVs are required to consider the ocean current, the task emergency and the energy constraints to find the optimal TA strategy. Then, an automatic policy amendment algorithm (APAA) is proposed to solve the drawback of slow convergence in reinforcement learning (RL). In APAA, the task sequences with higher team cumulative reward (TCR) are recorded to construct task sequence matrix (TSM). After that, the TCR, the subtask reward (SR) and the entropy are used to evaluate TSM to generate amendment probability, which adjusts the action distribution to increase the chances of choosing those more valuable actions. Finally, the simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The convergence performance of APAA is also better than DDQN, PER and PPO-Clip.

DE Lane detection; Direction-aware feedback network; Directional attention
   module; Wide-range contextual dependencies
AB Lane detection is a fundamental technique for autonomous driving systems. Various methods with deep neural networks have been actively introduced for this task, however, challenging issues, e.g., occlusion by vehicles, ambiguity by deterioration, etc., often give difficulties to accurately detect lanes in diverse road environments. To alleviate those problems, we propose the direction-aware feedback network. The key idea of the proposed method is to abundantly consider the global context of lanes by exploiting the directional attention module (DAM) in a multi-scale manner, which efficiently explores the high directionality with consideration of wide-range contextual dependencies both in horizontal and vertical directions. Moreover, such direction-aware features extracted from our DAMs are progressively refined by utilizing the feedback mechanism across different scale spaces, leading to the high-precision lane detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method under various road environments. The code and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/JinheeKIM94/ Direction-aware lane detection

AB In this paper, a circular objects detection method for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking is proposed, based on the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) and the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework. In contrast to the related work, the proposed method not only avoids motion blur caused by frame-based recognition during docking procedure but also reduces data redundancy with limited on-chip resources. First, four coplanar and rectangular constrained circular light sources are constructed as the docking landmark. By combining asynchronous Hough circle transform with the SNN model, the coordinates of landmarks in the image are detected. Second, a Perspective-4-Point (P4P) algorithm is utilized to calculate the relative pose between AUV and the landmark. In addition, a spatiotemporal filter is also used to eliminate noises generated by the background. Finally, experimental results are demonstrated from both software simulation and experimental pool, respectively, to verify the proposed method. It is concluded that the proposed method achieves better performance in accuracy and efficiency in underwater docking scenarios.

AB Performing autonomous maneuvering flight planning and optimization remains a challenge for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially for fixed-wing UAVs due to its high maneuverability and model complexity. A novel hybrid-driven fixed-wing UAV maneuver optimization framework, inspired by apprenticeship learning and nonlinear programing approaches, is proposed in this paper. The work consists of two main aspects: (1) Identifying the model parameters for a certain fixed-wing UAV based on the demonstrated flight data performed by human pilot. Then, the features of the maneuvers can be described by the positional/attitude/compound key-frames. Eventually, each of the maneuvers can be decomposed into several motion primitives. (2) Formulating the maneuver planning issue into a minimum-time optimization problem, a novel nonlinear programming algorithm was developed, which was unnecessary to determine the exact time for the UAV to pass by the key-frames. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in several scenarios, as both the preservation of geometric features and the minimization of maneuver times were ensured.</p>

AB Path planning can be perceived as a combination of searching and executing the optimal path between the start and destination locations. Deliberative planning capabilities are essential for the motion of autonomous unmanned vehicles in real-world scenarios. There is a challenge in handling the uncertainty concerning the obstacles in a dynamic scenario, thus requiring an intelligent, robust algorithm, with the minimum computational overhead. In this work, a fuzzy gain-based dynamic ant colony optimization (FGDACO) for dynamic path planning is proposed to effectively plan collision-free and smooth paths, with feasible path length and the minimum time. The ant colony system's pheromone update mechanism was enhanced with a sigmoid gain function for effective exploitation during path planning. Collision avoidance was achieved through the proposed fuzzy logic control. The results were validated using occupancy grids of variable size, and the results were compared against existing methods concerning performance metrics, namely, time and length. The consistency of the algorithm was also analyzed, and the results were statistically verified.

One of the major challenges in real-time image and video processing is the execution of complex functions and high computational tasks. In this paper, the hardware acceleration of different filter algorithms for both image and video processing is implemented on Xilinx Zynq (R)-7000 System on-Chip (SoC) device. It consists of Dual-core CortexTM-A9 processors which provide computing ability to perform I/O and processing functions and software libraries using Vivado (R) High-Level Synthesis (HLS). In the proposed work, Sobel-Feldman filter, posterize and threshold filter algorithms are implemented for 1920 x 1080 image resolutions. The implementation results exhibit effective resource utilization such as 45.6% of logic cells, 51% of Look-up tables (LUTs), 29.47% of Flip-flops, 15% of Block RAMs and 23.63% of DSP slices under 100 MHz frequency on comparing with previous works.

ID CALCIUM-CARBONATE NANOPARTICLES
AB Self-propelled nanomotors demonstrating autonomous motion in biologically relevant fuel are currently being studied to overcome the use of external physical or chemical stimuli as precise delivery agents. In this context, the tumor microenvironment (TME) with slightly acidic pH is used for developing cargo-releasing artificial systems triggered by such conditions. However, there is still a need for fabrication of smart nanomotors that can sense the acidic pH prevalent in the TME rather than using an external fuel source for selective activation and thereafter migrating towards tumors for active drug delivery. Herein, supramolecular assembly-based nanomotors are fabricated by in-situ grown CaCO3 nanoparticles and studied for their motility behaviour in endogenously generated acidic pH by HeLa cells and further exploited as an active delivery vehicle for DOX molecules to the cells for their anticancer efficacy. The nanomotors are activated in slightly acidic pH showcasing "pH taxis" towards tumor cells without the need for any sophisticated/complicated technologies or an external fuel source for active and targeted delivery of drugs.

AB Runtime monitoring is a vital part of safety-critical systems. However, early stage assurance of monitoring quality is currently limited: it relies either on complex models that might be inaccurate in unknown ways or on data that would only be available once the system has been built. To address this issue, we propose a compositional framework for modeling and analysis of noisy monitoring systems. Our novel 3-value detector model uses probability spaces to represent atomic (noncomposite) detectors, and it composes them into a temporal logic-based monitor. The error rates of these monitors are estimated by our analysis engine, which combines symbolic probability algebra, independence inference, and estimation from labeled detection data. Our evaluation on an autonomous underwater vehicle found that our framework produces accurate estimates of error rates while using only detector traces, without any monitor traces. Furthermore, when data are scarce, our approach shows higher accuracy than noncompositional data-driven estimates from monitor traces. Thus, this article enables accurate evaluation of logical monitors in early design stages before deploying them.

AB Underwater LED based Optical Communication has immense applications in the marine, autonomous underwater vehicle drivers and military fields. Compared with traditional underwater acoustic communication LED based optical communication offers secure, very high data rates (in similar to Gbps), and short wavelength which makes the antenna size of transmitter and receiver relatively small. In this paper an experimental setup of underwater LED (using Red, Green and Blue color) based optical communication in a 39x8x12 inches tank is designed to achieve data rates of 2Mbps at a distance of 1m. Furthermore, the performance comparison of free space and underwater optical link using ASK, FSK and PSK is made along with NRZ line encoding scheme. The results are presented and discussed in terms of eye diagrams and bit error rates. The experimental results reveal that the blue color LED has best received signal strength in comparison to the green and red LEDs in underwater medium. All three LEDs achieve a bit error rate of around 10(-5) with blue LED achieving highest SNR of 22.5dB.

AB Today, conventional power systems are evolving to modern smart grids, where interconnected microgrids may dominate the distribution system with high penetration of renewable energy and energy storage systems. The hybrid ac/dc systems with dc and ac sources/loads are considered to be the most possible future distribution or even transmission structures. For such hybrid ac/dcmicrogrids, power management strategies are one of the most critical operation aspects. This paper presents an overview of power management strategies for a hybrid ac/dc microgrid system, which includes different system structures (ac-coupled, dc-coupled, and ac-dc-coupled hybrid microgrids), different operation modes, a thorough study of various power management and control schemes in both steady state and transient conditions, and examples of power management and control strategies. Finally, discussion and recommendations of power management strategies for the further research are presented.

ID COLLABORATIVE OPTIMIZATION
AB Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MOO) is proposed for the design of the lines of an underwater robot. Hydrodynamic performances of the underwater robot are concerned about in the design, including the resistance and the manoeuvrability. A method of MDO, Collaborative Optimization (CO), is adopted. To improve the efficiency of optimization, approximate models are established in subdisciplines. Also, an artificial intelligent technique, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is incorporated into the CO framework. The optimization design of the lines of the underwater robot is carried out on an Isight platform, an automatic integration optimization platform. Through the platform, the optimization design of the lines and the analysis of the hydrodynamic performances can be achieved automatically with high efficiency. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), SUBOFF, is taken as a verification model. For different lines, CFD calculation is performed to analyze the resistance and manoeuvrability. By comparison, the optimal lines of the hull and the fairwater are determined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A wide variety of underwater applications, such as warning systems and deep water positioning systems used to track autonomous underwater vehicles etc, warrant underwater wireless communication in both shallow and deep water. These systems do, in the main, use underwater wireless acoustic communication modems and hence they play a vital role in underwater networking systems. However; the acoustic signals, particularly in shallow water suffer severe disturbances due to ambient noise from the sea. The ambient noise underwater is very unique, location specific and deterministic. This paper aims at developing a de-noising algorithm to improve the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) using the Gabor Wavelet and compares this with another important Shannon wavelet by way of study. The simulation was carried out using the MATLAB Simulink tool. The ambient noise used for the validation is sea truth data collected in the Bay of Bengal using broad band hydrophones. The results obtained were very encouraging as, in the range of input SNR -15 dB to 0 dB, the improved output SNR was in the order of 8 dB. This shows the efficiency of the algorithm simulated.

AB The development of a novel type of hybrid underwater glider that combines the advantages of buoyancy-driven gliders and propeller-driven autonomous underwater vehicles has recently received considerable interest. However, few studies have considered a hybrid glider with docking capability, which would expand the glider's applications. This study presents a hybrid glider with a rotatable thruster for realizing underwater docking. A tailored dynamic model of the hybrid glider is derived, and the motion performance is evaluated by simulations and experimental tests. A comparison between the experiments and simulations shows that results are in agreement, thus indicating the feasibility of the dynamic model and the accuracy of the hydrodynamic coefficients. In addition, the hybrid glider open-loop docking tests validate the feasibility of the mechanical docking system. More over the experimental tests also validate the glider's different functions and indicate that the hybrid glider with rotatable thruster has high maneuverability even at low speeds. Thus, this type hybrid glider can be used for underwater docking.

AB Detecting the free road surface ahead of a moving vehicle is an important research topic in different areas of computer vision, such as autonomous driving or car collision warning. Current vision-based road detection methods are usually based solely on low-level features. Furthermore, they generally assume structured roads, road homogeneity, and uniform lighting conditions, constraining their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, road priors and contextual information are introduced for road detection. First, we propose an algorithm to estimate road priors online using geographical information, providing relevant initial information about the road location. Then, contextual cues, including horizon lines, vanishing points, lane markings, 3-D scene layout, and road geometry, are used in addition to low-level cues derived from the appearance of roads. Finally, a generative model is used to combine these cues and priors, leading to a road detection method that is, to a large degree, robust to varying imaging conditions, road types, and scenarios.

AB This paper studies a class of hierarchical formations for an ordered set of n + 1 unicycle robots: the first robot plays the role of the leader and the formation is induced through a constraint function, so that the position and orientation of the ith robot depends only on the pose of the preceding ones. We study the dynamics of the formation with respect to the leader's reference frame by introducing the concept of reduced internal dynamics, we characterize its equilibria and provide sufficient conditions for their existence. The discovered theoretical results are applied to the case in which the constraint induces a formation where the ith robot follows a convex combination of the positions of the previous i - 1 vehicles. In this case, we prove that if the curvature of the leader's trajectory is sufficiently small, the positions and orientations of the robots, relative to the leader's reference frame, are confined in a precise polyhedral region.

AB Objective: Though autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems for car-to-cyclist collisions have been under development, an estimate of the benefit of AEB systems based on an analysis of accident data is needed for further enhancing their development. Compared to the data available from in-depth accident data files, data provided by drive recorders can be used to reconstruct car-to-cyclist collisions with greater accuracy because the position of cyclists can be observed from the videos. In this study, using data from drive recorders, the performance and limitations of AEB systems were investigated. Method: Data of drive recorders involving taxi-to-cyclist collisions were collected. Using the images collected from the drive recorders of those taxis, 40 cases of 90 degrees car-to-cyclist intersection collisions were reconstructed using PC-Crash. Then, the collisions were reconstructed again utilizing car models with AEB systems installed while changing the sensor's field of view (FOV) and the delay time of initiating vehicle deceleration. Results: The angle of FOV has a significant influence on avoiding car-to-cyclist collisions. Using a 50 degrees FOV with a braking delay time of 0.5 s resulted in avoiding 6 collisions, and using a 90 degrees FOV resulted in avoiding an additional 14 collisions. Even when installing an ideal AEB system providing 360 degrees FOV and no delay time for braking, 8 collisions were not avoided, though the impact velocities were reduced for all of these remaining collisions. These collisions were caused by the cyclists' sudden appearance in front of cars, and the time-to-collision (TTC) when the cyclists appeared was less than 0.9 s. Conclusion: The AEB systems were effective for mitigating collisions that occurred due to driver perception delay. Because cyclists have a traveling velocity, a wide-angle FOV is effective for reduction of car-to-cyclist intersection collisions. The reduction of delay time in braking can reduce the number of collisions that are close to the braking performance limit. The collisions that remained even with an ideal AEB system in the PC-Crash simulation indicate that such collisions could still occur for autonomous cars if the traffic environment does not change.

ID PEDESTRIAN DETECTION
AB Fallen person detection (FPD) is a new problem that aims to detect a person who lies or falls down on driving roads. The biggest difficulty in FPD is capturing a sufficient number of training images of people lying on driving roads because of the dangers involved. In this paper, we propose a novel fallen person detection image synthesis framework to address this difficulty. Our framework first embeds a fallen person instance into an image of a driving road, thereby generating a hard-to-acquire image (image of a person who has fallen on a road) from two easy-to-acquire images (driving road image and fallen person image). We then reduce the domain gap between the two images using domain adaptation. Finally, we remove some pixel artifacts from the border between the fallen person and background area in the synthesized image. Our proposed framework addresses the lack of training data, which is a serious problem inherent to FPD. Furthermore, we develop a new dataset named FPD (Fallen Person detection with Driving scenes)-set to train a detection network. FPD-set consists of four subsets: (1) RealFP218, (2) RealD1.8K, (3) RealFPDK1.4K and (4) RealFPDY1.1K. RealFP218 consists of 218 images of real fallen persons and their pixel-level mask annotations; and RealD1.8K consists of 1820 real driving road images. The two sets will be used to synthesize the driving road images including fallen persons. RealFPDK1.4K and RealFPDY1.1K are test sets which are captured at two different places (K-City and Yonsei University). The two test sets consist of 1400 and 1161 images of real fallen persons on the road with bounding box annotations, respectively. Our dataset covers a variety of conditions, including occlusion, lack of lighting, and shadows, thereby facilitating qualitative and quantitative evaluations in the real world. We released this dataset for the benefit of the autonomous driving society. We verify the effectiveness of our training image synthesis method by applying the detector to the RealFPDK1.4K and RealFPDY1.1K datasets. Our approach achieves AP scores of 0.815 and 0.753, and the scores are higher than those of the baseline by +0.287 and +0.210 on RealFPDK1.4K and RealFPDY1.1K, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework contributes significantly to training an FPD network.

AB Following the tracking-by-attention paradigm, this letter introduces an object-centric, transformer-based framework for tracking in 3D. Traditional model-based tracking approaches incorporate the geometric effect of object- and ego motion between frames with a geometric motion model. Inspired by this, we propose STAR-TRACK, which uses a novel latent motion model (LMM) to additionally adjust object queries to account for changes in viewing direction and lighting conditions directly in the latent space, while still modeling the geometric motion explicitly. Combined with a novel learnable track embedding that aids in modeling the existence probability of tracks, this results in a generic tracking framework that can be integrated with any query-based detector. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the benefits of our approach, showing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for DETR3D-based trackers while drastically reducing the number of identity switches of tracks at the same time.

AB Place recognition is an important component for autonomous vehicles to achieve loop closing or global localization. In this article, we tackle the problem of place recognition based on sequential 3-D LiDAR scans obtained by an onboard LiDAR sensor. We propose a transformer-based network named SeqOT to exploit the temporal and spatial information provided by sequential range images generated from the LiDAR data. It uses multiscale transformers to generate a global descriptor for each sequence of LiDAR range images in an end-to-end fashion. During online operation, our SeqOT finds similar places by matching such descriptors between the current query sequence and those stored in the map. We evaluate our approach on four datasets collected with different types of LiDAR sensors in different environments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR-based place recognition methods and generalizes well across different environments. Furthermore, our method operates online faster than the frame rate of the sensor.

AB The composite learning control with the heterogeneous estimator is proposed to deal with the multiple uncertainties of strict-feedback nonlinear systems. The article applies the recorded data-based neural learning and the disturbance observer (DOB) to learn the multiple uncertainties, including the nonlinear dynamics, the unknown control gain function (CGF), and the time-varying disturbance. The lumped prediction error is constructed and included into the update law by neural approximation and disturbance observation. Furthermore, the asymmetric saturation nonlinearity (ASN) of the control input is represented by the smooth form model to ensure the input limitation, and a projection algorithm is adopted to avoid the singularity problem. The closed-loop system stability is rigorously analyzed and the boundedness of the system tracking error is guaranteed. Through the tests of the third-order nonlinear system and the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), it is observed that the proposed approach can improve the system tracking accuracy with the expected learning performance.

AB Attention toward automated driving has recently increased. This has also increased the need to monitor drivers' actions, such as finger touch/pressure sensing on the steering wheel. This study demonstrates an active signal-generating spacer-fabric-type continuous touch/pressure sensor comprising five yarn layers: surface-insulating cotton, upper conductive, monofilament spacer, lower conductive and bottom-insulating cotton yarn. The sensor actively generates signals, and the magnitude of the voltage output through a diode bridge and capacitor circuit determines if the fingers are 'not touching', 'touching', 'pushing' or 'pushing hard'. This demonstrates that the proposed sensor can be operated as an active signal-generating touch/pressure sensor and can also detect 'pushing hard' actions. Furthermore, the active signal-generating operation originates from the electromagnetic waves emitted by electrical appliances and cables powered by a commercial power supply frequency in the environment. The proposed sensor will contribute to developing high-cushioning touch/pressure sensors with low power consumption and excellent air permeability that can be used in electric and autonomous vehicles.

AB Many studies have been conducted on single lane detection, but multi-lane detection is rarely addressed. The latter is more advantageous for applications such as autonomous navigation, unmanned vehicles, departure warning, and cruise control. In this paper, we propose a novel and robust multiple lane detection algorithm based on the road structure information, which contains five complementary constraints: length constraint, parallel constraint, distribution constraint, pair constraint and uniform width constraint. All the five constraints are incorporated into a Hough transform (HT) based unified framework to select lane candidates. Nearly 99% of the false alarm candidates in HT space can be removed. Moreover, a dynamic programming strategy is proposed to find the most rational solutions among the remaining candidates. This strategy can effectively deal with combination complexity and interferences introduced by multi-lane detection. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset and other collected data demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

AB This article presents a GPU-accelerated software design of the recently proposed model of Slanted Stixels, which represents the geometric and semantic information of a scene in a compact and accurate way. We reformulate the measurement depth model to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, relying on the confidence of the depth estimation and the identification of invalid values to handle outliers. The proposed massively parallel scheme and data layout for the irregular computation pattern that corresponds to a Dynamic Programming paradigm is described and carefully analyzed in performance terms. Performance is shown to scale gracefully on current generation embedded GPUs. We assess the proposed methods in terms of semantic and geometric accuracy as well as run-time performance on three publicly available benchmark datasets. Our approach achieves real-time performance with high accuracy for 2048 x 1024 image sizes and 4 x 4 Stixel resolution on the low-power embedded GPU of an NVIDIA Tegra Xavier.

AB In this paper, an integral reinforcement learning-based adaptive neural network (NN) tracking control is developed for the continuous-time (CT) nonlinear system with unknown control directions. The long-term performance index in the CT domain is prescribed. Critic and action NNs are designed to approximate the unavailable long-term performance index and the unknown dynamics, respectively. The reinforcement signal is explicitly embedded in the updated law of the action NN and then the estimated long-term performance index can be minimized. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided to show that the closed-loop system is stabilized and all closed-loop signals are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, to demonstrate the control performance, simulation results are provided to verify the tacking control performance of an autonomous underwater vehicle model.

AB The accuracy of experimental procedure used to calculate the drag coefficient of an Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in a towing tank is investigated using computational fluid dynamics. Effects of struts, used to connect the AUV model to towing carriage, on the hydrodynamics coefficient of the AUV at various relative submergence depths, at AUV speeds of 1.5 and 2.5 m/s are numerically simulated. Various numerical modeling are performed to investigate the effects of free surface with and without presence of struts on the drag coefficient of the AUV. Volume of fluid (VOF) model is used to solve the two phase flow RANS equations. The drag coefficients obtained from two phase flow simulations are compared with those obtained from single phase flow at corresponding velocities. The results obtained from experiments conducted in the towing tank of the Subsea Science and Technology centre, on a full-scale model of the AUV developed in this Centre, agreed well with those obtained by numerical simulations.

AB Detection and classification of road markings are a prerequisite for operating autonomous vehicles. Although most studies have focused on the detection of road lane markings, the detection and classification of other road markings, such as arrows and bike markings, have not received much attention. Therefore, we propose a detection and classification method for various types of arrow markings and bike markings on the road in various complex environments using a one-stage deep convolutional neural network (CNN), called RetinaNet. We tested the proposed method in complex road scenarios with three open datasets captured by visible light camera sensors, namely the Malaga urban dataset, the Cambridge dataset, and the Daimler dataset on both a desktop computer and an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded system. Experimental results obtained using the three open databases showed that the proposed RetinaNet-based method outperformed other methods for detection and classification of road markings in terms of both accuracy and processing time.

AB Aerodynamic forces are not negligible for a reusable rocket returning back to Earth. How the aerodynamic controls and propulsion should be coordinated to realize fuel-optimal precise landing is addressed in this paper. To this end, a model-based optimal control problem is formulated with the rocket's angle of attack and thrust as control inputs, and constraints on the controls are included to reflect the capabilities of the vehicle. Precise landing requires the (highly nonlinear and nonconvex) problem to be solved onboard in real time. This ability of online computation is becoming increasingly desired in aerospace guidance and control for autonomous missions. Hence, this paper presents how to solve the rocket landing problem via convex optimization that has guaranteed polynomial-time complexity. Specifically, a novel methodology of handling the rocket nonlinear dynamics is introduced, and a relaxation technique used to convexify nonconvex constraints is theoretically proved to be valid. High efficiency of the proposed method, with potential for online computation, is demonstrated by numerical examples and comparisons with other methods.

AB This work provides an overview of the use of small unmanned aircraft systems for freshwater fisheries survey and fish identification. As an example, a series of river reaches in Mongolia was surveyed for identification and sizing of the endangered Taimen Hucho taimen, the world's largest salmonid. Using polarized video imagery, Taimen were positively identified in depths of over 2 m. River reaches were chosen for survey to include likely Taimen holding grounds as well as areas that were unlikely Taimen habitat. Large areas of river reaches were quickly surveyed with video imagery stored for analysis. Using land-based targets for sizing and flying autonomous search patterns, we found that Taimen were easily identifiable based on their swimming patterns and could be remotely sized; furthermore, the fish did not appear to be disturbed by the presence of overhead aircraft. Lessons learned from the experiments and recommendations for future advances are provided. The use of small unmanned aircraft systems for fisheries is shown to be a novel and inexpensive alternative to traditional fisheries survey methods.

AB This paper addresses the problem of autonomous trajectory tracking control for a quadrotor in a global positioning system (GPS)-denied environment using only onboard sensing. To achieve that goal, it requires accurate estimation of quadrotor states followed by proper control actions. For the position estimation in a GPS-denied environment, an open source high speed optical flow sensor PX4FLOW is adopted. As for the quadrotor control, there are several challenges due to its highly nonlinear system dynamics, such as underactuation, coupling, model uncertainties, and external disturbances. To deal with those challenges, the cascaded inner-outer uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based robust control scheme has been developed and applied to the attitude and position control of a quadrotor. Extensive real flight experiments, including attitude stabilization, hover, disturbance rejection, trajectory tracking, and comparison with the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed UDE-based controllers.

AB Surmounting terrain elevations, such as terraces, is useful to increase the reach of mobile robots operating in disaster areas, construction sites, and natural environments. This paper proposes an autonomous climbing maneuver for tracked mobile manipulators with the help of the onboard arm. The solution includes a fast 3-D scan processing method to estimate a simple set of geometric features for the ascent: three lines that correspond to the low and high edges, and the maximum inclination axis. Furthermore, terraces are classified depending on whether they are reachable through a slope or an abrupt step. In the proposed maneuver, the arm is employed both for shifting the center of gravity of the robot and as an extra limb that can be pushed against the ground. Feedback during climbing can be obtained through an inertial measurement unit, joint absolute encoders, and pressure sensors. Experimental results are presented for terraces of both kinds on rough terrain with the hydraulic mobile manipulator Alacrane.

AB The emerging area of intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research has shown rapid development in recent years and offers a great number of research challenges for artificial intelligence. For both military and civil applications, there is a desire to develop more sophisticated UAV platforms where the emphasis is placed on development of intelligent capabilities. Imagine a mission scenario where a UAV is supplied with a 3D model of a region containing buildings and road structures and is instructed to fly to an arbitrary number of building structures and collect video streams of each of the building's respective facades. In this article, we describe a fully operational UAV platform which can achieve such missions autonomously. We focus on the path planner integrated with the platform which can generate collision free paths autonomously during such missions. Both probabilistic roadmap-based (PRM) and rapidly exploring random trees-based (RRT) algorithms have been used with the platform. The PRM-based path planner has been tested together with the UAV platform in an urban environment used for UAV experimentation.

To improve the reliability of velocity, hybrid velocity based on solution separation (SS) is proposed to monitor time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP), Doppler, and code-based velocity solutions. A public low-cost GNSS dataset of kinematic vehicle tests in Tokyo's urban canyons is applied to verify the proposed method. Results show that the SS test of the proposed method can effectively improve velocity accuracy by removing faulty velocity estimations. Besides, it is able to provide a 99.66% availability of velocity estimation. The hybrid IM-based velocity method achieves an improved perfor-mance both considering availability and accuracy, which could provide precise velocity with high availability and reliability for support of GNSS-based and multi-sensor-based positioning for autonomous navigation in signal-denying environments.

AB Empathy can help designers discover and fulfill users' latent needs in design, which can lead to better design solutions. To achieve deep user understanding, designers utilize their ability to empathize with users. However, empathy is always incomplete and inconstant in user understanding. This study applies a quantitative behavioral empathy measure to a case of designers attempting to understand the needs of users of a future semi-autonomous vehicle technology. In total, 16 designers and 48 users are involved. We study how interpersonal differences between designers and users and different users' mental content impact the level of empathic understanding. Specifically, these factors are national cultural differences, visiting experience, binary gender differences, the relationship between users and designers, and user mental content types. The results show that cultural differences and visiting experiences significantly affect designers' empathic accuracy and emotional tone accuracy in both physical and online interviews. These influences vary depending on contextual factors that are related to the participant's own experience and the experiment itself.

AB A successful deployment of drones provides an ideal solution for surveillance systems. Using drones for surveillance can provide access to areas that may be difficult or impossible to reach by humans or in-land vehicles gathering images or video recordings of a specific target in their coverage. Therefore, we introduces a data delivery drone to transfer collected surveillance data in harsh communication conditions. This paper proposes a Myerson auction-based asynchronous data delivery in an aerial distributed data platform in surveillance systems taking battery limitation and long flight constraints into account. In this paper, multiple delivery drones compete to offer data transfer to a single fixed-location surveillance drone. Our proposed Myerson auction based algorithm, which uses the truthful second-price auction (SPA) as a baseline, is to maximize the seller's revenue while meeting several desirable properties, i.e., individual rationality and incentive compatibility while pursuing truthful operations. On top of this SPA-based operations, a deep learning based framework is additionally designed for delivery performance improvements.

AB High-accuracy position awareness is essential to many applications, such as indoor navigation and autonomous vehicles. Wireless localization is a promising positioning service provider with the merits of extensive coverage and low cost but degrades in complex multipath propagation environments. This paper proposes a tensor-based algorithmic framework for localization in multipath environments by exploiting sparse spatio-temporal features of the received waveforms. Specifically, we construct low-rank tensors to characterize sparse spatio-temporal features, which can separate coherent multipath signals hinging on the uniqueness of tensor decomposition. Compared with related tensor-based works, our method does not rely on array configurations or signal structures, revealing its potential for broad use in multipath estimation. Position-related parameters are further extracted from tensor decomposition results, where a method based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is developed to retrieve distance information from the carrier part. Simulation results show that our method yields high-accuracy localization performance in complex multipath environments.

AB A recent trend is to combine multiple sensors (i.e., cameras, LiDARs and millimeter-wave Radars) to achieve robust multi-modal perception for autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles. Although quite a few sensor fusion algorithms have been proposed, some of which are top-ranked on various leaderboards, a systematic study on how to integrate these three types of sensors to develop effective multi-modal 3D object detection and tracking is still missing. Towards this end, we first study the strengths and weaknesses of each data modality carefully, and then compare several different fusion strategies to maximize their utility. Finally, based upon the lessons learnt, we propose a simple yet effective multi-modal 3D object detection and tracking framework (namely EZFusion). As demonstrated by extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, without fancy network modules, our proposed EZFusion makes remarkable improvements over the LiDAR-only baseline, and achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art fusion-based methods.

AB This article addresses the vision-based landing problem of a low-cost quadrotor on an unknown moving platform. A robust landing controller is developed, which consists of the design of the low-complexity outer-loop controller and the geometric inner-loop attitude controller. First, an error transformation based on prescribed performance is designed to guarantee the landing behaviors and deal with the intermediate control signal of backstepping approaches, resulting in a low-complexity position-based visual servoing (PBVS) design. In addition, the proposed PBVS controller exhibits strong robustness against an uncertain relative dynamic system due to no incorporation of any prior knowledge of the moving platform. Next, a modified geometric attitude controller is presented by characterizing the geometric properties of rotation matrices intrinsically. Finally, the stability analysis is presented using Lyapunov stability theory, and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experiments.

AB This paper focuses on the three-dimensional (3-D) formation tracking of multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) system in complex ocean environments. An observer-controller scheme based on decentralized estimation and control is designed. Develop an observer for each AUV to estimate the overall state of the system, then integrate it with collective task variables to produce the control inputs. It enables the multi-AUV system to perform formation trajectory tracking tasks that depend on global information. In the design stage, utilizing hyperbolic tangent function reduces the risk of actuator saturation, and the measurement noise and nonlinearities of the system are addressed. Next, under the connected undirected topology, as well as for the cases of unsaturated and saturated control inputs, the stability analysis based on the Lyapunov method proves the convergence of estimation errors and task errors. Simultaneously, sufficient conditions for the formation tracking convergence are given. Finally, the simulation results in different cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ID PERCEPTION
AB Autonomous flight of flapping-wing robots is a major challenge for robot perception. Most of the previous sense-and-avoid works have studied the problem of obstacle avoidance for flapping-wing robots considering only static obstacles. This letter presents a fully onboard dynamic sense-and-avoid scheme for large-scale ornithopters using event cameras. These sensors trigger pixel information due to changes of illumination in the scene such as those produced by dynamic objects. The method performs event-by-event processing in low-cost hardware such as those onboard small aerial vehicles. The proposed scheme detects obstacles and evaluates possible collisions with the robot body. The onboard controller actuates over the horizontal and vertical tail deflections to execute the avoidance maneuver. The scheme is validated in both indoor and outdoor scenarios using obstacles of different shapes and sizes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first event-based method for dynamic obstacle avoidance in a flapping-wing robot.

ID AUV NAVIGATION; LOCALIZATION; PRECISION
AB Underwater navigation using a single beacon has been widely discussed and used because of the lower hardware complexity and installation accuracy compared with the long baseline (LBL) and the ultra-short baseline (USBL) methods, respectively. The existing navigation methods are mainly dependent on the time delays of the direct signals (DS) from the beacon to the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Considering that the underwater acoustic channel is a multipath channel, this paper proposes a novel single beacon navigation method based on the time delays of the direct signals and the surface-reflected signals (SRS). The precision analysis proves that the proposed DS-SRS-based method can achieve a higher navigation precision than the DS-based method. Moreover, a tracking method based on the DS and the SRS is also presented to smooth the navigation results, and the corresponding observability analysis is given. Several simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) plays an important role in ocean research and exploration. The underwater environment has a great influence on AUV control and human-robot interaction, since underwater environment is highly dynamic with unpredictable fluctuation of water flow, high pressure and light attenuation. The traditional control model contains a large number of parameters, which is not effective and produces errors frequently. The proposal of fuzzy control addressed this issue to a certain extent. It applies fuzzy variables to the controller, which replace the values in an interval. In addition to the controller, underwater human-robot interaction is also difficult. Divers cannot speak or show any facial expressions underwater. The buttons on the AUV also need to overcome the huge water pressure. In this paper, we proposed a method to recognize the gesture instructions and apply it to the fuzzy control of AUV. Our contribution is the gesture recognition framework for the human-robot interaction, including the gesture detection network and the algorithm for the control of AUV. The experiment result shows the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB This work analyzes the adverse effects of cyber-physical attacks on discrete-time distributed multi-agent systems, and proposes a mitigation approach for attacks on sensors and actuators. First, we show how an attack on a single node snowballs into a network-wide attack and even destabilizes the entire system. Next, to overcome the adversarial effects of attacks on sensors and actuators, a distributed adaptive attack compensator is designed by estimating the normal expected behavior of agents. The adaptive attack compensator is augmented with the controller and it is shown that the proposed controller achieves secure consensus in the presence of the attacks on sensors and actuators. No restrictive assumption on the number of agents under adversarial input is assumed. Moreover, it recovers compromised agents under actuator attacks and avoids propagation of attacks on sensors without discarding information from the compromised agents. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the presented theoretical contributions on a network of Sentry autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB During autonomous driving, fast and accurate object recognition supports environment perception for local path planning of unmanned ground vehicles. Feature extraction and object recognition from large-scale 3D point clouds incur massive computational and time costs. To implement fast environment perception, this paper proposes a 3D recognition system with multiple feature extraction from light detection and ranging point clouds modified by parallel computing. Effective object feature extraction is a necessary step prior to executing an object recognition procedure. In the proposed system, multiple geometry features of a point cloud that resides in corresponding voxels are computed concurrently. In addition, a scale filter is employed to convert feature vectors from uncertain count voxels to a normalized object feature matrix, which is convenient for object-recognizing classifiers. After generating the object feature matrices of all voxels, an initialized multilayer neural network (NN) model is trained offline through a large number of iterations. Using the trained NN model, real-time object recognition is realized using parallel computing technology to accelerate computation.

AB The assumption of scene rigidity is typical in SLAM algorithms. Such a strong assumption limits the use of most visual SLAM systems in populated real-world environments, which are the target of several relevant applications like service robotics or autonomous vehicles. In this letter we present DynaSLAM, a visual SLAM system that, building on ORB-SLAM2, adds the capabilities of dynamic object detection and background inpainting. DynaSLAM is robust in dynamic scenarios for monocular, stereo, and RGB-D configurations. We are capable of detecting the moving objects either by multiview geometry, deep learning, or both. Having a static map of the scene allows inpainting the frame background that has been occluded by such dynamic objects. We evaluate our system in public monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets. We study the impact of several accuracy/speed trade-offs to assess the limits of the proposed methodology. DynaSLAM outperforms the accuracy of standard visual SLAM baselines in highly dynamic scenarios. And it also estimates a map of the static parts of the scene, which is a must for long-term applications in real-world environments.

AB The widespread use of communications technologies has changed the way people travel. Transport modeling offers the opportunity to analyze this impact and test innovations, policies, and future trends before they actually happen. The impact of smartphones, GPS, and telework has been researched insufficiently, despite the impact of these technologies on travel behavior. Autonomous vehicles are expected to be widely available in the near future, but their impact on travel behavior is largely unknown. Last but not least, social networks have a dominating impact on the activities people pursue, the destinations they choose, the mode they use, and with whom they travel. This paper describes a framework for an integrated land use-transport model for analyzing the impact of communications technologies on travel behavior. Social networks are simulated explicitly. The impact of communications technologies on both land use, such as the impact on a housing search, auto ownership, or work place choice, as well as travel behavior such as activity generation, destination choice, or mode choice, can be simulated with this modeling suite.

AB This paper focuses on the mechanism design of a slide-block structure and its application on a biomimetic modular robotic fish for three-dimensional swimming. First, as a barycenter-adjustor, the slide-block structure is integrated into a mechanical design of a robotic fish, which is constructed by a control module, a driving module, and a fan-shaped caudal fin. The three-dimensional locomotion of robotic fish is decomposed into two-dimensional locomotion in horizontal plane and ascent-descent locomotion in vertical plane. Both the kinematics of the horizontal swim and the dynamics of the ascent-descent swim are analyzed by the curve fitting method. Finally, experimental results validate the three-dimensional swimming capability of the robotic fish. Furthermore, the impact of two design parameters on the swimming capability of the robotic fish is discussed by the experimental method. The experimental results confirm that the robotic fish with one driving module and a fan-shaped low-aspect-ratio caudal foil can produce higher propulsive speed than other parameter combinations.

DE Neural control; Oscillation; Resonance; Harmonic balance; Tensegrity
ID DYNAMICS; DESIGN
AB Neuronal circuits known as central pattern generators (CPG) are responsible for the rhythmic motions in animal locomotion. These circuits exploit the resonant modes of the body to produce efficient locomotion through sensory feedback. As such, the neuronal mechanisms are of interest in the control of autonomous robotic vehicles. The objective of this study is to establish a design framework that integrates synthesized CPGs with tensegrity structures, with the goal of resonance entrainment. Tensegrities are novel, nonlinear dynamic structures featuring high strength to weight ratios, embedded actuation and sensing, and tunable stiffness. A two-neuron circuit known as a reciprocal inhibition oscillator is integrated with tensegrity structures with a pair of antagonistic actuators and collocated sensors. Each neuron has control of a cable length, and the sensory signal of cable length is fed back to the neuron. The frequency and amplitude of closed-loop oscillation are analyzed via harmonic balance, and a systematic method for control design is proposed to achieve entrainment to a prescribed resonance mode.

AB In this paper we address the constructive controllability problem for drift-free, left-invariant systems on finite-dimensional Lie groups with fewer controls than state dimension, We consider small (epsilon) amplitude, low-frequency, periodically time-varying controls and derive average solutions for system behavior, We show how the pth-order average formula can be used to construct open-loop controls for point-to-point maneuvering of systems which require up to (p - 1) iterations of Lie brackets to satisfy the Lie algebra controllability rank condition, In the cases p = 2, 3, we give algorithms for constructing these controls as a function of structure constants that define the control authority, i.e., the actuator capability, of the system, The algorithms are based on a geometric interpretation of the average formulas and produce sinusoidal controls that solve the constructive controllability problem with O(epsilon(P)) accuracy in general (exactly if the Lie algebra is nilpotent), The methodology is applicable to a variety of control problems and is illustrated for the motion control problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle with as few as three control inputs.

TI Predicting crash-relevant violations at stop sign-controlled
   intersections for the development of an intersection driver assistance

SO TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION

ID COLLISION
AB Objective: Intersection crashes resulted in over 5,000 fatalities in the United States in 2014. Intersection Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (I-ADAS) are active safety systems that seek to help drivers safely traverse intersections. I-ADAS uses onboard sensors to detect oncoming vehicles and, in the event of an imminent crash, can either alert the driver or take autonomous evasive action. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a predictive model for detecting whether a stop sign violation was imminent.Methods: Passenger vehicle intersection approaches were extracted from a data set of typical driver behavior (100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study) and violations (event data recorders downloaded from real-world crashes) and were assigned weighting factors based on real-world frequency. A k-fold cross-validation procedure was then used to develop and evaluate 3 hypothetical stop sign warning algorithms (i.e., early, intermediate, and delayed) for detecting an impending violation during the intersection approach. Violation detection models were developed using logistic regression models that evaluate likelihood of a violation at various locations along the intersection approach. Two potential indicators of driver intent to stopthat is, required deceleration parameter (RDP) and brake applicationwere used to develop the predictive models. The earliest violation detection opportunity was then evaluated for each detection algorithm in order to (1) evaluate the violation detection accuracy and (2) compare braking demand versus maximum braking capabilities.Results: A total of 38 violating and 658 nonviolating approaches were used in the analysis. All 3 algorithms were able to detect a violation at some point during the intersection approach. The early detection algorithm, as designed, was able to detect violations earlier than all other algorithms during the intersection approach but gave false alarms for 22.3% of approaches. In contrast, the delayed detection algorithm sacrificed some time for detecting violations but was able to substantially reduce false alarms to only 3.3% of all nonviolating approaches. Given good surface conditions (maximum braking capabilities = 0.8 g) and maximum effort, most drivers (55.3-71.1%) would be able to stop the vehicle regardless of the detection algorithm. However, given poor surface conditions (maximum braking capabilities = 0.4 g), few drivers (10.5-26.3%) would be able to stop the vehicle. Automatic emergency braking (AEB) would allow for early braking prior to driver reaction. If equipped with an AEB system, the results suggest that, even for the poor surface conditions scenario, over one half (55.3-65.8%) of the vehicles could have been stopped.Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of I-ADAS to incorporate a stop sign violation detection algorithm. Repeating the analysis on a larger, more extensive data set will allow for the development of a more comprehensive algorithm to further validate the findings.

TI Transformer for multiple object tracking: Exploring locality to vision
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS

DT Article
DE Multi-object tracking; Transformer; Deep learning; Locality to vision
AB Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a critical task in various domains, such as traffic analysis, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles. The joint-detection-and-tracking paradigm has been extensively researched, which is faster and more convenient for training and deploying over the classic tracking-by-detection paradigm while achieving state-of-the-art performance. This paper explores the possibilities of enhancing the MOT system by leveraging the prevailing convolutional neural network (CNN) and a novel vision transformer technique Locality. There are several deficiencies in the transformer adopted for computer vision tasks. While the transformers are good at modeling global information for a long embedding, the locality mech-anism, which learns the local features, is missing. This could lead to negligence of small objects, which may cause security issues. We combine the TransTrack MOT system with the locality mechanism in-spired by LocalViT and find that the locality-enhanced system outperforms the baseline TransTrack by 5.3% MOTA on the MOT17 dataset.

AB An efficient control of large-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm to establish a complex formation is one of the most challenging tasks. This paper investigates a novel multi-layer topology network and consensus control approach for a large-scale UAV swarm moving under a stable configuration. The proposed topology can make the swarm remain robust in spite of the large number of UAVs. Then a potential function-based controller is developed to control the UAVs in realizing autonomous configuration swarming under the consideration of mutual collision, and the stability of the controller from the individual UAV to the entire swarm system is analyzed by a Lyapunov approach. Afterwards, a yaw angle adjustment approach for the UAVs to reach consensus is developed for the multi-layer swarm, then the direction state of each UAV converges with a fast rate. Finally, simulations are performed on the large-scale UAV swarm system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB In some applications, a robot arm has to position instrumentation/payloads accurately relative to an unknown surface. This article describes an optical sensor system for doing so. The sensor is based on a number of different image processing techniques combined with optical stimulation. More specifically, the system utilizes a camera, floodlight, structured light illumination, terrain relative navigation (TRN), camera pose estimation, and circle finding. The sensor has been developed for the Planetary Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry (PIXL) instrument on NASA's Mars Perseverance rover. The sensor also has other applications such as exploration of polluted or inaccessible areas or locating a robotic arm relative to an unknown surface. The sensor can aid in placing an instrument relative to the unknown surface with an accuracy of 0.5 mm and maintaining a 3-D position lock utilizing TRN. This article will describe the sensor design and performance.

AB The assumption of scene rigidity is common in visual SLAM algorithms. However, it limits their applicability in populated real-world environments. Furthermore, most scenarios including autonomous driving, multi-robot collaboration and augmented/virtual reality, require explicit motion information of the surroundings to help with decision making and scene understanding. We present in this paper DynaSLAM II, a visual SLAM system for stereo and RGB-D camera configurations that tightly integrates the multi-object tracking capability. DynaSLAM II makes use of instance semantic segmentation and ORB features to track dynamic objects. The structures of the static scene and the dynamic objects are optimized jointly with the trajectories of both the camera and the moving agents within a novel bundle adjustment proposal. The 3D bounding boxes of the objects are also estimated and loosely optimized within a fixed temporal window. We demonstrate that tracking dynamic objects does not only provide rich clues for scene understanding but can be also beneficial for camera tracking.

AB Visible light communication (VLC) is nowadays envisaged as a promising technology to enable new classes of services in intelligent transportation systems ranging, e.g., from assisted driving to autonomous vehicles. The assessment of the performance of VLC for automotive applications requires as a basic step a model of the transmission pattern and propagation of the VLC signal when real traffic-lights and road scenarios are involved. In this paper an experimental measurement campaign has been carried out by using a regular traffic-light as source (red light) and a photoreceiver positioned, statically, at different distances and heights along the road. A linear regression technique is used to come up with different propagation models. The proposed models have been compared, in terms of accuracy and complexity, to the conventional Lambertian model to describe the VLC channel in a real urban scenario. The proposed models provides a significant higher accuracy with comparable complexity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Table tennis has long fascinated roboticists as a particularly difficult task which requires fast movements, accurate control and adaptation to task parameters. In addition, the development of such devices is useful for educating the undergraduate students. Up to now, several groups have developed robotic manipulators playing table tennis and other commercial interactive robots. Moreover, drones are booming right now, and they can cover a larger workspace than manipulators, for a lower device volume and at a lower price. In this context, this paper aims to propose a drone playing table tennis to analyze the benefits and the disadvantages for this task. Most vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicles are not fast enough to reproduce hitting motions. The proposed prototype is an innovative quadrotor combining a tilting propeller and a state-dependent iterative linear quadratic control (iLQR). The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated with real experiments that show the success of the approach, reaching hitting rates of 40%.

AB The new mobile edge network architecture has been required for an increasing amount of traffic, quality requirements, advanced driver assistance system for autonomous driving and new cloud computing demands on highway. This article proposes a hierarchical cloud computing architecture to enhance performance by using adaptive data load distribution for buses that play the role of edge computing server. A vehicular dynamic cloud is based on wireless architecture including Wireless Local Area Network and Long Term Evolution Advanced communication is used for data transmission between moving buses and cars. The main advantages of the proposed architecture include both a reduction of data loading for top layer cloud server and effective data distribution on traffic jam highway where moving vehicles require video on demand (VOD) services from server. Through the description of real environment based on NS-2 network simulation, we conducted experiments to validate the proposed new architecture. Moreover, we show the feasibility and effectiveness for the connected car media service on highway.

ID PERFORMANCE; NOISE
AB Underwater acoustic communication is a core enabling technology with applications in ocean monitoring using remote sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles. One of the more challenging underwater acoustic communication channels is the medium-range very shallow warm-water channel, common in tropical coastal regions. This channel exhibits two key features-extensive time-varying multipath and high levels of bon-Gaussian ambient noise due to snapping shrimp-both of which limit the performance of traditional communication techniques. A good understanding of the communications channel is key to the design of communication systems. It aids in the development of signal processing techniques as well as in the testing of the techniques via simulation. In this article, a physics-based channel model for the very shallow warm water acoustic channel at high frequencies is developed, which are of interest to medium-range communication system developers. The model is based on ray acoustics and includes time-varying statistical effects as well as non-Gaussian ambient noise statistics observed during channel studies. The model is calibrated and its accuracy validated using measurements made at sea. (c) 2007 Acoustical Society of America.

AB The energetic frontal region of the tidally pulsed Connecticut River plume was sampled with the T-REMUS Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) which navigated ten cross-front transects at various depths. Synchronous and high resolution hydrographic, microstructure, velocity and backscatter observations allowed the creation of detailed views of frontal structure and turbulent mixing in the reference frame of the propagating front. The front was defined by a sharp horizontal density gradient of similar to 18.5 kg m(-4) across only 0.7 m in the horizontal, and strong downwelling velocities of 0.17 m/s. Three successive zones were consistently identified. The first O (10 m) wide downwelling zone in which buoyant plume water was forced downward, thereby forming a highly energetic frontal head that extended down to 6 m depth and had TKE dissipation rates (epsilon) of order 10(-3) m(2)/s(3). Beyond the downwelling zone to O (100 m), a transition zone was observed, characterized by substantial entrainment of ambient water. This zone had high amplitude and high frequency density anomaly (sigma theta) variability consistent with elevated but decreasing turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates (epsilon) which ranged between 10(-4) and 10(-5) m(2)/s(3). Beyond O (100 m) from the front, stable stratification, high Ri values, and low Reb values, suppressed the growth of instabilities and diminished turbulent mixing. In this stable interior region the plume base shoaled to 2 m depth and e decreased further, from 10(-5) to 10(-7) m(2)/s(3). In ambient Long Island Sound waters, e ranged between 10(-6) and 10(-7) m(2)/s(3). The cross-front distributions of sigma(theta) and epsilon did not change substantially as the front transformed from a lateral boundary, where plume flow was primarily in the along-front direction, to one that was at the leading edge of the plume, where plume flow was mostly in the cross-front direction. In both cases, a significant convergence was present at the front due to strong ambient tidal velocities. The observed epsilon values and those from four previous studies of large and mid-sized plumes were nondimensionalized using the velocity and length scales associated with the downwelling region at the front. The effective normalization suggests that local dynamics primarily control e in the near-frontal region.

ID IMPACT ASSESSMENT
AB In this paper, we propose a trust model to be used in a hypothetical mixed environment where humans and unmanned vehicles cooperate. We address the inclusion of emotions inside a trust model in a coherent way to investigate the practical approaches to current psychological theories. The most innovative contribution of this work is the elucidation of how privacy issues play a role in the cooperation decisions of the emotional trust model. Both emotions and trust were cognitively modeled and managed with the beliefs, desires and intentions (BDI) paradigm in autonomous agents implemented in GAML (the programming language of the GAMA agent platform), that communicate using the IEEE FIPA standard. The trusting behavior of these emotional agents was tested in a cooperative logistics problem wherein agents have to move objects to destinations and some of the objects and places are associated with privacy issues. Simulations of the logistic problem show how emotions and trust contribute to improving the performance of agents in terms of both time savings and privacy protection.

AB 5G networks enable emerging latency and bandwidth critical applications like industrial IoT, AR/VR, or autonomous vehicles, in addition to supporting traditional voice and data communications. In 5G infrastructure, Radio Access Networks (RANs) consist of radio base stations that communicate over wireless radio links. The communication, however, is prone to environmental changes like the weather and can suffer from radio link failure and interrupt ongoing services. The impact is severe in the above-mentioned applications. One way to mitigate such service interruption is to proactively predict failures and reconfigure the resource allocation accordingly. Existing works like the supervised ensemble learning-based model do not consider the spatial-temporal correlation between radio communication and weather changes. This paper proposes a communication link failure prediction scheme based on the LSTM-autoencoder that considers the spatial-temporal correlation between radio communication and weather forecast. We implement and evaluate the proposed scheme over a huge volume of real radio and weather data. The results confirm that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the existing solutions.

AB Object detection has achieved significant progress in attaining high-quality performance without leaking private messages. However, traditional approaches cannot defend the poisoning attacks. Poisoning attacks can make the predictive model unusable, which quickly causes recognition errors or even traffic accidents. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving object detection with poisoning recognition (PR-PPOD) framework via distributed training with the help of the CNN, ResNet18, and classical SSD network. Specifically, we design a poisoning model recognition algorithm to remove the uploaded local poisoning parameters to guarantee a trained model's availability based on given privacy-preserving progress. More importantly, the PR-PPOD framework can effectively prevent the threat of differential attacks and avoid privacy leakage caused by reverse model reasoning. Moreover, the effectiveness, efficiency, and security of PR-PPOD are demonstrated via comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we simulate the performance of local poisoning model recognition based on the MNIST, CIFAR10, VOC2007, and VOC2012 datasets, which could achieve good performance compared with the case without poisoning recognition.

AB In systems of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), to achieve cooperative operation and cluster intelligence, information is often disseminated via broadcasting. However, due to the long propagation delay and slow transmission rate of underwater acoustic communication, traditional broadcast scheduling algorithms require a long broadcast period to avoid signal collision. To improve the channel utilization rate as much as possible and improve the update rate for broadcast information, we propose an optimal broadcast scheduling algorithm. This algorithm uses the location information of AUVs to adjust the broadcast sequence and broadcast schedule, to achieve the shortest possible collision-free broadcast period in the broadcast network for the current node distribution. Simulation experiments show that this algorithm can achieve a broadcast period much shorter than that of traditional TDMA and higher channel utilization without signal collision. In addition, the simulations prove the feasibility of applying the algorithm in an actual MAC protocol.

AB User trust plays a key role in determining whether autonomous computer applications are relied upon. It will play a key role in the acceptance of emerging AI applications such as optimisation. Two important factors known to affect trust are system transparency, i.e., how well the user understands how the system works, and system performance. However, in the case of optimisation, it is difficult for the end-user to understand the underlying algorithms or to judge the quality of the solution. Through two controlled user studies, we explore whether the user is better able to calibrate their trust in the system when: (a) They are provided feedback on the system operation in the form of visualisation of intermediate solutions and their quality; (b) They can interactively explore the solution space by modifying the solution returned by the system. We found that showing intermediate solutions can lead to over-trust, while interactive exploration leads to more accurately calibrated trust.

AB The autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles in a rapidly changing environment, such as avoiding small fast moving objects with onboard sensing, still remains a challenge. In this letter, we propose a complete system that only relies on a lightweight RGBD camera to achieve fast and accurate perception and avoidance of small dynamic obstacles, whereas navigating in a complex environment. Firstly, we detect the moving objects by Yolo-Fastest in RGB frame, obtain the 3D information with the depth image, and track the multiple detected objects with our proposed 3D-SORT (Simple Online and Real-time Tracking in Three-dimensional Space) algorithm. To achieve fast dynamic avoidance, we design an effective method to generate the optimized smooth trajectory to dodge all the static and dynamic obstacles with the predicted moving objects' trajectories. Finally, we integrate the above methods on our UAV platform, and demonstrate the performance of our system by testing thoroughly in simulation and real-world experiments.

AB This paper is devoted to the problem of prescribed performance trajectory tracking control for symmetrical underactuated unmanned surface vessels (USVs) in the presence of model uncertainties and input quantization. By combining backstepping filter mechanisms and adaptive algorithms, two robust control architectures are investigated for surge motion and yaw motion. To guarantee the prespecified performance requirements for position tracking control, the constrained error dynamics are transformed to unconstrained ones by virtue of a tangent-type nonlinear mapping function. On the other hand, the inaccurate model can be identified through radial basis neural networks (RBFNNs), where the minimum learning parameter (MLP) algorithm is employed with a low computational complexity. Furthermore, quantization errors can be effectively reduced even when the parameters of the quantizer remain unavailable to designers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controllers is verified via theoretical analyses and numerical simulations.

ID GENERATION
AB Quadrotors can achieve aggressive flight by tracking complex maneuvers and rapidly changing directions. Planning for aggressive flight with trajectory optimization could be incredibly fast, even in higher dimensions, and can account for dynamics of the quadrotor, however, only provides a locally optimal solution. On the other hand, planning with discrete graph search can handle non-convex spaces to guarantee optimality but suffers from exponential complexity with the dimension of search. We introduce a framework for aggressive quadrotor trajectory generation with global reasoning capabilities that combines the best of trajectory optimization and discrete graph search. Specifically, we develop a novel algorithmic framework that interleaves these two methods to complement each other and generate trajectories with provable guarantees on completeness up to discretization. We demonstrate and quantitatively analyze the performance of our algorithm in challenging simulation environments with narrow gaps that create severe attitude constraints and push the dynamic capabilities of the quadrotor. Experiments show the benefits of the proposed algorithmic framework over standalone trajectory optimization and graph search-based planning techniques for aggressive quadrotor flight.

AB Satellite navigation is more and more important in a plethora of very different application fields, ranging from bank transactions to shipping, from autonomous driving to aerial applications, such as commercial avionics as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In very precise positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) applications, such as in reference stations and precise timing stations, it is important to characterize all errors present in the system in order to account possibly for them or calibrate them out. Antennas play an important role in this respect: they are indeed the "sensor" that capture the signal in space from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and thereby strongly contribute to the overall achievable performance. This paper reviews the currently available antenna technologies, targeting specifically reference stations as well as precise GNSS antennas for space applications, and, after introducing performance indicators, summarizes the currently achievable performance. Finally, open research issues are identified, and possible approaches to solve them are discussed.

AB In domains such as electric vehicle charging, smart distribution grids and autonomous warehouses, multiple agents share the same resources. When planning the use of these resources, agents need to deal with the uncertainty in these domains. Although several models and algorithms for such constrained multiagent planning problems under uncertainty have been proposed in the literature, it remains unclear when which algorithm can be applied. In this survey we conceptualize these domains and establish a generic problem class based on Markov decision processes. We identify and compare the conditions under which algorithms from the planning literature for problems in this class can be applied: whether constraints are soft or hard, whether agents are continuously connected, whether the domain is fully observable, whether a constraint is momentarily (instantaneous) or on a budget, and whether the constraint is on a single resource or on multiple. Further we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms. We conclude by identifying open problems that are directly related to the conceptualized domains, as well as in adjacent research areas.

AB Stereo garage is kind of large capacity parking equipment to alleviate the parking problem. In order to reduce the construction cost and improve the garage performance, this paper introduces an automated stereo-garage with multiple cache parking spaces. The structure of the garage is simplified into a stacker and several storage units, and multiple cache parking spaces are set up. Two scheduling strategies are designed to improve the efficiency of the garage and reduce the process time consumption of customers, respectively. The running time under these two strategies is expressed mathematically, followed by the input data of the garage and its analyzed statistical regularity. Subsequently, operation processes of the garage during busy periods are simulated, and its service performance is analyzed by means of queuing theory. Results and comparisons show the superiority of the proposed garage system, and combined scheduling recommendations are provided for improving the overall working performance of the equipment.

AB In recent years, the emerging framework of the Internet of Things has been leading the technological landscape in a number of different fields and applications, from autonomous and connected vehicles to wearable devices. The healthcare system is benefiting from this continuously evolving environment since it leverages the opportunities offered by the ubiquitous and pervasive presence of connected objects and smart services. This attitude has given rise to the concept of eHealth, thus enabling new approaches and solutions for healthcare. In this framework we propose SmartPants, an IoT-based wireless system specifically designed for the remote rehabilitation of lower limbs in poststroke patients. The platform consists of multiple nodes used to monitor physical therapy and a software platform that provides real-time feedback on the execution by recognizing the type of exercise currently being performed by the patient. Our experimental results, evaluated through appropriate metrics, show that the proposed movement recognition algorithm provides very good results in terms of classification performance, independent of the considered classifier, with an average true positive rate of about 91 percent and an overall accuracy of around 96.5 percent.

AB This paper provides insight into the application of the quadrupedal robot ANYmal in outdoor missions of industrial inspection (autonomous robot for gas and oil sites [ARGOS] challenge) and search and rescue (European Robotics League (ERL) Emergency Robots). In both competitions, the legged robot had to autonomously and semiautonomously navigate in real-world scenarios to complete high-level tasks such as inspection and payload delivery. In the ARGOS competition, ANYmal used a rotating light detection and ranging sensor to localize on the industrial site and map the terrain and obstacles around the robot. In the ERL competition, additional real-time kinematic-global positioning system was used to colocalize the legged robot with respect to a micro aerial vehicle that creates maps from the aerial view. The high mobility of legged robots allows overcoming large obstacles, for example, steps and stairs, with statically and dynamically stable gaits. Moreover, the versatile machine can adapt its posture for inspection and payload delivery. The paper concludes with insight into the general learnings from the ARGOS and ERL challenges.

ID MODEL
AB A novel approach to estimating the detailed shape of arbitrary extended objects jointly with their kinematics in the absence of a priori information is presented. The proposed shape model represents the tightest enclosing bound of the object projected into the ego motion plane as a polygon with an unknown number of vertices. Probabilistic inference techniques are employed to overcome various sources of uncertainty by rigorously estimating the joint distribution over the object shape and kinematic states, rather than estimating these variables directly. Simulation and experimental results are presented for objects with complex shapes tracked from an autonomous vehicle research platform. In addition to providing a richer set of information for higher level reasoning about extended objects (e.g. about object type, or occupied space), the results demonstrate that detailed shape estimates enable efficient use of sensor information by way of explicit surface-based sensor models; this efficient use of sensor information improves observability of latent object states, thereby improving tracking precision.

AB This Australian benthic data set (BENTHOZ-2015) consists of an expert-annotated set of georeferenced benthic images and associated sensor data, captured by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) around Australia. This type of data is of interest to marine scientists studying benthic habitats and organisms. AUVs collect georeferenced images over an area with consistent illumination and altitude, and make it possible to generate broad scale, photo-realistic 3D maps. Marine scientists then typically spend several minutes on each of thousands of images, labeling substratum type and biota at a subset of points. Labels from four Australian research groups were combined using the CATAMI classification scheme, a hierarchical classification scheme based on taxonomy and morphology for scoring marine imagery. This data set consists of 407,968 expert labeled points from around the Australian coast, with associated images, geolocation and other sensor data. The robotic surveys that collected this data form part of Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) ongoing benthic monitoring program. There is reuse potential in marine science, robotics, and computer vision research.

DE Localization; Position estimation; Error growth; Dead reckoning error;

AB We examine how the estimation error grows with time when a mobile robot estimates its location from relative pose measurements without global position or orientation sensors. We show that, in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional space, both the bias and the variance of the position estimation error grows at most linearly with time asymptotically. Non-asymptotic bounds on the bias and variance are obtained, which provide insight into the mechanism of error growth. The bias is crucially dependent on the trajectory of the robot. Conclusions on the asymptotic growth rate of the bias continue to hold even with unbiased measurements or error-free translation measurements. Exact formulas for the bias and the variance of the position estimation error are provided for two specific two-dimensional trajectories - straight line and periodic. Experiments with a P3-DX wheeled robot and Monte Carlo simulations are provided to verify the theoretical predictions. A method to reduce the bias is proposed based on the lessons learned.

AB In this paper a new control system for a 4-leg Matrix Converter (MC) feeding an isolated load is discussed. The proposed system is appropriate for wind-diesel schemes or any other application where a path for the circulation of zero sequence currents is required, e.g. wind energy conversion systems feeding isolated loads, small portable diesel generators used in ambulances and similar emergency vehicles, wind hybrid generation systems, wind-diesel schemes, etc. In this work it is assumed that the 4-leg MC is fed from a variable speed diesel-driven Permanent Magnet (PM) generator. A vector control system based in two synchronous rotating d-q axes is used to regulate the load voltage. The frames are rotating clockwise and counter-clockwise respectively in order to control the positive and negative sequence of the output signals. A separate resonant controller is used to regulate the homopolar components of the load voltage. The design of the control system is discussed in this work and experimentally validated using a prototype. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Path-planning problems are fundamental in many applications, such as transportation, artificial intelligence, control of autonomous vehicles, and many more. In this paper, we consider the deterministic path-planning problem, equivalently, the single-pair shortest path problem on a given grid-like graph structure. Current commonly used algorithms in this area include the A* algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, and their numerous variants. We propose an innovative beamlet-based graph structure for path planning that utilizes multiscale information of the environment. This information is collected via a bottom-up fusion algorithm. This new graph structure goes beyond "nearest-neighbor" connectivity, incorporating "long-distance" interactions between the nodes of the graph. Based on this new graph structure, we obtain a multiscale version of A*, which is advantageous when preprocessing is allowable and feasible. Compared to the benchmark A* algorithm, the use of multiscale information leads to an improvement in terms of computational complexity. Numerical experiments indicate an even more favorable behavior than the one predicted by the theoretical complexity analysis.

DE effective area; long baseline; beacon cable; sound track; AUV
AB The long baseline (LBL) system is widely used to locate and track autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) through acoustic communication. Three important issues are presented here in LBL, system application with AUV. Those issues which regard the normal acoustic communication between LBL system and AUV are the depth of towed army, the length of beacon cable, and the effective area of the AUV. The first issue is the key of the LBL, system, which ensures the normal communication between towed array and beacons. The second issue which impacts the normal communication from the AUV to beacons in available range should be considered after the first one has been settled. Then the last issue determines the safe work area of the AUV. The ordinary differential equations (ODE) algorithm of ray is deduced from Snell's law. The ODE algorithm is applied to obtain sound rays from sound source to receiver. These problems are solved by the judgment that whether rays pinging from a sound source arrives at a receiver. The sea trial shows that these methods have much validity and practicality.

DT Article
DE Underwater; Sleep mode; Energy conservation; Idle-time power management
AB Interest in underwater sensor networks has increased recently due to the possibility of using autonomous underwater vehicles and sensors to explore the oceans and monitor underwater equipment. Such networks, due to the need for long term deployments, must be energy efficient, like their terrestrial counterparts. However, there are fundamental differences between radio interfaces and acoustic modems, both in terms of achievable performance (e.g. bit rate and latency) and in terms of energy consumption (i.e. transmit power, receive power, sleep power, etc.). These differences may cause techniques that are highly effective for radios to perform poorly in acoustic scenarios. This paper considers asynchronous idle-time power management techniques and the effects of acoustic modem properties on the optimal solutions. Specifically, we compare two main techniques, a sleep cycling solution and a wakeup mode solution. We show that for traffic rates of greater than one packet every few hours, using a wakeup, mode may be the most efficient way to save energy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Dynamic occupancy grid; object tracking; dynamic estimation;

ID VEHICLE TRACKING
AB LiDAR-basedframeworks combining dynamic occupancy grids and object-level tracking are a popular approach for perception of the environment in autonomous driving applications. This paper presents a novel backchannel from the object-level module to the grid-level module that procures the enhancement of overall performance. This feedback leads to an enhanced grid representation by the inclusion of two new steps that allow semantic classification of the occupied space and the improvement of the dynamic estimation. To this end, objects extracted from the grid are analyzed with respect to potential object classes and displacement. Class likelihoods are filtered over time at cell-level using particles and a naive Bayesian classifier. The displacement information is computed taking into account semantic information and comparing objects in consecutive frames. Then, it is used to obtain velocity measurements that are used to enhance grid's dynamic estimation. In contrast to other approaches in the literature seeking similar objectives, this proposal does not rely on additional sensing technologies or neural networks. The evaluation is conducted with real sensor data in challenging urban scenarios.

AB Fast and smooth driving is a preferable consideration in platooning algorithm development for intelligent autonomous vehicular systems. It can improve traffic efficiency while guaranteeing passenger comfort. To this end, this work investigates the fast distributed platooning problem of connected vehicular systems. Taking the inaccurate velocity measurement into consideration, an extended state observer (ESO) based on a fractional order faster nonsingular terminal sliding mode (FNTSM) is proposed for velocity and disturbance estimation simultaneously. An FNTSM control algorithm based on the double power reaching law is developed to reach fast platooning while guaranteeing string stability of the connected vehicular systems regardless of zero or nonzero initial spacing error conditions. The salient features of the proposed platoon controller are that system convergence can be achieved in finite time and the time-varying external disturbances can be estimated accurately. Finally, simulation and experiment studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control algorithm.

AB Defense systems are usually deployed to protect high-value targets or hot spots that are integral parts of the modern battlefield environment. However, in coastal defense operations (due to the variability of the maritime environment and the sustainability of combat), limited operational capabilities, the need for efficient coordination, and protracted combat are peculiarly challenging to meet by traditional manned fleets. In contrast, with lower costs, unmanned fleets can organize an autonomous defense against enemy targets that are capable of rapid response. This paper focuses on the typical defense scenario; we analyzed and modeled the objective functions of the intelligent defense system and propose a hierarchical distributed multi-agent-based system design scheme. Finally, to test the system's performance, we established simulation verification experiments in a typical scenario and compared the system based on the traditional central architecture. The results show that, in a defense operation, the hierarchically-distributed multi-agent-based system shows improvements in system decision-making efficiency and interception effect.

AB The automated warehouses currently in widespread use maintain highly efficient operations at the cost of consuming a large amount of energy. This study first considers the problem of operation optimization in multi-shuttle automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs) to reduce both time and energy consumption. A time and energy bi-objective integer programming model is proposed to jointly optimize the storage/retrieval (S/R) location assignment and S/R scheduling for a multi-shuttle AS/RS. The adaptive variable neighbourhood search algorithm and Lagrangian relaxation algorithm are developed to tackle large-size instances. The results demonstrate that the bi-objective model is effective at finding the compromise solution considering travel time and energy consumption simultaneously. The decrease in travel time is obtained at the expense of increasing energy consumption and vice versa. The study provides valuable insights for warehouse managers to operate a time-efficient and energy-efficient automated warehouse.

DE Scene layout; Instance interaction; Layout forecasting; Scene

AB Forecasting scene layout is of vital importance in many vision applications, e.g., enabling autonomous vehicles to plan actions early. It is a challenging problem as it involves understanding of the past scene layouts and the diverse object interactions in the scene, and then forecasting what the scene will look like at a future time. Prior works learn a direct mapping from past pixels to future pixel-wise labels and ignore the underlying object interactions in the scene, resulting in temporally incoherent and averaged predictions. In this paper, we propose a learning framework to forecast semantic scene layouts (represented by instance maps) from an instance-aware perspective. Specifically, our framework explicitly models the dynamics of individual instances and captures their interactions in a scene. Under this formulation, we are able to enforce instance-level constraints to forecast scene layouts by effectively reasoning about their spatial and semantic relations. Experimental results show that our model can predict sharper and more accurate future instance maps than the baselines and prior methods, yielding state-of-the-art performances on short-term, mid-term and long-term scene layout forecasting.

ID HISTOGRAMS
AB This paper presents a road detection method for autonomous driving based on an end-to-end neural network model. Our method takes advantage of both the characteristics of road boundary and multi-task learning of a deep convolutional network. By reassigning the label and rebalancing the loss of road pixels, we focus on the learning of hard examples on the boundary to refine its performance. Then, a road geometric transformation-based data augmentation method is proposed to enable the network model to be robust under traffic scenes. Based on these two novel methods, a unified architecture consisting of a shared deep residual encoder network and multi-branch decoder sub-networks is integrated. It adopts road scene classification as a supervised learning task to realize road segmentation and scene classification simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has achieved the highest MaxF value in most road scenes. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the KITTI-Road benchmark demonstrate our superior performance.

DE LiDAR; road detection; normalized inverse depth; line scanning; KITTI
AB In this paper, we propose to fuse the geometric information of a 3-D LiDAR and a monocular camera to detect the urban road region ahead of an autonomous vehicle. Our method takes advantage of both the high definition of 3-D LiDAR data and the continuity of road in image representation. First, we obtain an efficient representation of LiDAR data and an organized 2-D inverse depth map, by projecting the 3-D LiDAR points onto the camera's image plane. Through the new representation, we can acquire the intermediate representations of road scenes by extracting the vertical and horizontal histograms of the normalized inverse depth. The approximate road regions can be quickly estimated with both histogram-based schemes. To accurately find the road area, we propose a row and column scanning strategy in the approximate road region to refine the detected road area. We have carried out experiments on the public KITTI-Road benchmark, and have achieved one of the best performances among the LiDAR-based road detection methods without learning procedure.

AB The conventional long baseline (LBL) positioning system based on beacon ranging has a high positioning accuracy, but it need at least three acoustic beacons, when positioning the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The LBL positioning system has a high deployment and recovery cost. It also has the problem that LBL positioning model does not take AUVs motion into consideration, so the signal to transmit and receive at different locations. To solve this problem, this paper constructs a model based on indirect adjustment. The model uses single beacon distance information, velocity information of target motion as the observations. The simulation analysis and test results show that model can solve signal to transmit and receive at different locations, and it can improve the positioning accuracy effectively. When dynamic positioning, it doesn't have missed detection problem of LBL positioning system. When static positioning, it is stable and error fluctuation is small. The tracking trajectory is smooth and continuous, and the computational complexity is equivalent to the conventional LBL. It has good engineering application value.

DT Article
AB In this article, we investigate cost-effective 5G-enabled vehicular networks to support emerging vehicular applications, such as autonomous driving, in-car infotainment and location-based road services. To this end, self-sustaining caching stations (SCSs) are introduced to liberate on-road base stations from the constraints of power lines and wired backhauls. Specifically, the cache-enabled SCSs are powered by renewable energy and connected to core networks through wireless backhauls, which can realize "drop-and-play" deployment, green operation, and low-latency services. With SCSs integrated, a 5G-enabled heterogeneous vehicular networking architecture is further proposed, where SCSs are deployed along the roadside for traffic offloading while conventional MBSs provide ubiquitous coverage to vehicles. In addition, a hierarchical network management framework is designed to deal with high dynamics in vehicular traffic and renewable energy, where content caching, energy management and traffic steering are jointly investigated to optimize the service capability of SCSs with balanced power demand and supply in different time scales. Case studies are provided to illustrate SCS deployment and operation designs, and some open research issues are also discussed.

AB A method is proposed for improving the accuracy and self-consistency of bathymetric maps built using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to create precise prior maps for Terrain-Aided Navigation (TAN), when the Global Positioning System (GPS) or another precise location method is unavailable. This method consists of front-end and back-end. For the front-end, the AUV predicts the measurement of the bathymetry system through Terrain Elevation Measurement Extrapolation Estimation (TEMEE) and calculates the likelihood function using real measurements. After the final Inertial Navigation System (INS) error is obtained by communicating with sensor nodes, the process enters the back-end. A Terrain Correlation Correction Method (TCCM) and an Improved Terrain Correlation Correction Method (ITCCM) are proposed to solve the gradual distribution of the final INS error to each point on a path, and the accuracy of ITCCM was confirmed experimentally. Finally, a TAN simulation experiment was conducted to prove the importance and necessity of map correction using ITCCM. ITCCM was proven to be an effective and important method for correcting maps built using an AUV.

AB Autonomous following of ill-defined roads is an important part of visual navigation systems. This paper presents an adaptive method that uses a statistical model of the color of the road surface within a trapezoidal shape that approximately corresponds to the projection of the road on the image plane. The method does not perform an explicit segmentation of the images but instead expands the shape sideways until the match between shape and road worsens, simultaneously computing the color statistics. Results show that the method is capable of reactively following roads, at driving speeds typical of the robots used, in a variety of situations while coping with variable conditions of the road such as surface type, puddles, and shadows. We extensively evaluate the proposed method using a large number of datasets with ground truth (available from ). We moreover evaluate many color spaces in the context of road following, and we find that the color spaces that separate luminance from color information perform best, especially if the luminance information is discarded.

AB This paper presents a fully functional and highly portable mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system, HAWK, for conducting aerial localization. HAWK is a programmable mini helicopter-Draganflyer X6-armed with a wireless sniffer-Nokia N900. We developed custom PI-Control laws to implement a robust waypoint algorithm for the mini helicopter to fly a planned route. A Moore space filling curve is designed as a flight route for HAWK to survey a specific area. A set of theorems were derived to calculate the minimum Moore curve level for sensing all targets in the area with minimum flight distance. With such a flight strategy, we can confine the location of a target of interest to a small hot area. We can recursively apply the Moore curve-based flight route to the hot area for a fine-grained localization of a target of interest. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the feasibility of HAWK and our theory. A demo of HAWK in autonomous fly is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju86xnHbEq0.

AB Path planning is a crucial problem in the application of mobile robot and autonomous vehicle. Recently most of methods only achieve reliable results in some particular structured environments. In this paper, we describe a new navigation path detection algorithm in an unstructured environment. Natural frames are analyzed in RGB vector space to research the feasibility of curve path detection of unstructured roads. Perceptual color clustering and morphological image processing have been used as pre-processing to obtain the segmented path. The pixels of the segmented image are analyzed from right to left line-by-line to find the middle points of the path. In order to obtain the optimal navigation path, the least-squares curve fitting method has been used in our research. At last a new method of obtaining the navigation parameters is given. The experimental result shows that our algorithm has high speed and remarkable precision. The navigation parameters in our algorithm can control the robot movement well. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Turbulent and radiative exchanges of heat between the ocean and atmosphere (hereafter heat fluxes), ocean surface wind stress, and state variables used to estimate them, are Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) and Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) influencing weather and climate. This paper describes an observational strategy for producing 3-hourly, 25-km (and an aspirational goal of hourly at 10-km) heat flux and wind stress fields over the global, ice-free ocean with breakthrough 1-day random uncertainty of 15 W m(-2) and a bias of less than 5 W m(-2). At present this accuracy target is met only for OceanSITES reference station moorings and research vessels (RVs) that follow best practices. To meet these targets globally, in the next decade, satellite-based observations must be optimized for boundary layer measurements of air temperature, humidity, sea surface temperature, and ocean wind stress. In order to tune and validate these satellite measurements, a complementary global in situ flux array, built around an expanded OceanSITES network of time series reference station moorings, is also needed. The array would include 500-1000 measurement platforms, including autonomous surface vehicles, moored and drifting buoys, RVs, the existing OceanSITES network of 22 flux sites, and new OceanSITES expanded in 19 key regions. This array would be globally distributed, with 1-3 measurement platforms in each nominal 10 degrees by 10 degrees box. These improved moisture and temperature profiles and surface data, if assimilated into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, would lead to better representation of cloud formation processes, improving state variables and surface radiative and turbulent fluxes from these models. The in situ flux array provides globally distributed measurements and metrics for satellite algorithm development, product validation, and for improving satellite-based, NWP and blended flux products. In addition, some of these flux platforms will also measure direct turbulent fluxes, which can be used to improve algorithms for computation of air-sea exchange of heat and momentum in flux products and models. With these improved air-sea fluxes, the ocean's influence on the atmosphere will be better quantified and lead to improved long-term weather forecasts, seasonal-interannual-decadal climate predictions, and regional climate projections.

AB The problem of safe navigation of a human-multi-robot system is addressed in this paper. More precisely, we propose a novel distributed algorithm to control a swarm of unmanned ground robots interacting with human operators in presence of obstacles. Contrary to many existing algorithms that consider formation control, the proposed approach results in non-rigid motion for the swarm, which more easily enables interactions with human operators and navigation in cluttered environments. Each vehicle calculates distributively and dynamically its own safety zone in which it generates a reference point to be tracked. The algorithm relies on purely geometric reasoning through the use of Voronoi partitioning and collision cones, which allows to naturally account for inter-robot, human-robot and robot-obstacle interactions. Different interaction modes have been defined from this common basis to address the following practical problems: autonomous waypoint navigation, velocity-guided motion, and follow a localized operator. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated by outdoor and indoor field experiments.

AB In order to enhance the development of marine resources, this study investigates the problem of discrete-time multi-autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) formation coordination control with leader-following consensus under time-varying delays. First, a discrete-time second-order integration model for AUVs is presented. Second, considering the existence of time-varying delays in AUV communication, the communication between multiple AUVs is classified as valid or invalid based on the maximum delay limit. The problem of AUV formation control under invalid communication is transformed into a formation control problem under switching communication topologies. Then, a time-varying delay communication synchronization strategy is designed to convert asynchronous state information into synchronous state information. Based on synchronous state information, a leader-following consensus control protocol with time-varying delays is proposed, and a controllability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Finally, the stability and effectiveness of the proposed formation-coordination controller and delay synchronization strategy were validated through simulation experiments.

AB Integrity monitoring of a vehicular navigation system that utilizes multi-constellation global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals fused with terrestrial signals of opportunity (SOPs) is considered. An opportunistic advanced receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (OARAIM) framework is developed to detect faults and calculate protection levels (PLs). The influence of fusing SOPs on the integrity performance is analyzed. It is shown that fusing a single SOP with GNSS signals essentially increases both the horizontal PL (HPL) and vertical PL (VPL), while fusing two or more SOPs could reduce the PLs and improves fault detection. Performance sensitivity analysis for the probability of SOP fault and user range error is conducted to characterize the fault-free HPL under different regimes. Experimental results on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigating with GPS signals fused with cellular SOPs are presented to validate the effectiveness of the OARAIM framework and demonstrate the analysis of the integrity performance in the horizontal direction.

AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence algorithms are leveraging massive amounts of data to optimize, refine, and improve existing solutions in critical areas such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, robotics, social media, or human resources. The significant increase in the quantity of data generated each year makes it urgent to ensure the protection of sensitive information. Federated learning allows machine learning algorithms to be partially trained locally without sharing data, while ensuring the convergence of the model so that privacy and confidentiality are maintained. Federated learning shares similarities with distributed learning in that training is distributed in both paradigms. However, federated learning also decentralizes the data to maintain the confidentiality of the information. In this work, we explore this concept by using a federated architecture for a multimobile computing case study and focus our attention on the impact of unreliable participants and selective aggregation in the federated solution. Results with Android client participants are presented and discussed, illustrating the potential of the proposed approach for real-world applications.

AB A new intelligent adaptive control scheme was proposed that combines observer disturbance-based adaptive control and fuzzy adaptive control for a composite structure with a mass-adjustable damper. The most important advantage is that the control structures do not need to know the uncertainty limits and the interference effect is eliminated. Three adjustable parameters in LMI are used to control the gain of the 2D fuzzy control. Binary performance indices with weighted matrices are constructed to separately evaluate validation and training performance using the revalidation learning function. Determining the appropriate weight matrix balances control and learning efficiency and prevents large gains in control. It is proved that the stability of the control system can be ensured by a linear matrix theory of equality based on Lyapunov's theory. Simulation results show that the multilevel simulation approach combines accuracy with high computational efficiency. The M-TMD system, by slightly reducing critical joint load amplitudes, can significantly improve the overall response of an uncontrolled structure.

AB Autonomous exploration is a fundamental problem for various applications of unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). Existing methods, however, were demonstrated to insufficient exploration rate, due to the lack of efficient global coverage, conservative motion plans and low decision frequencies. In this letter, we propose FUEL, a hierarchical framework that can support Fast UAV ExpLoration in complex unknown environments. We maintain crucial information in the entire space required by exploration planning by a frontier information structure (FIS), which can be updated incrementally when the space is explored. Supported by the FIS, a hierarchical planner plans exploration motions in three steps, which find efficient global coverage paths, refine a local set of viewpoints and generate minimum-time trajectories in sequence. We present extensive benchmark and real-world tests, in which our method completes the exploration tasks with unprecedented efficiency (3-8 times faster) compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our method will be made open source to benefit the community(1.)

AB In cities around the globe companies are starting to provide alternative forms of transport. These include micro mobility, bike sharing, Mobility-as-a-Service and autonomous vehicles. One of the challenges of these businesses is to design and innovate business models that are able to extract value from providing their services. This study analyses the internal and external factors that influence business model innovation within mobility sector startups. The factors are identified and analysed using in-depth interviews with mobility sector players. The results indicate that client/customer influence, legislation and the partners of the businesses are experienced as external influencing factors of business model innovation, whilst the firm's societal impact vision, a dedicated employee responsible for looking after business model innovation, the decision making structure and internal use of technology are experienced as internal influencing factors of business model innovation. These findings are relevant for both firms and policy makers as it allows them to understand what factors help drive innovation in the mobility sector.

ID EXTRINSIC CALIBRATION
AB Accurate LiDAR-camera online calibration is critical for modern autonomous vehicles and robot platforms. Dominant methods heavily rely on hand-crafted features, which are not scalable in practice. With the increasing popularity of deep learning (DL), a few recent efforts have demonstrated the advantages of DL for feature extraction on this task. However, their reported performances are not sufficiently satisfying yet. We believe one improvement can be the problem formulation with proper consideration of the underneath geometry. Besides, existing online calibration methods focus on optimizing the calibration error while overlooking the tolerance within the error bounds. To address the research gap, a DL-based LiDAR-camera calibration method, named as the RGGNet, is proposed by considering the Riemannian geometry and utilizing a deep generative model to learn an implicit tolerance model. When evaluated on KITTI benchmark datasets, the proposed method demonstrates superior performances to the state-of-the-art DL-based methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/KleinYuan/RGGNet.

AB The formation of platelet ice is well known to occur under Antarctic sea ice, where subice platelet layers form from supercooled ice shelf water. In the Arctic, however, platelet ice formation has not been extensively observed, and its formation and morphology currently remain enigmatic. Here, we present the first comprehensive, long-term in situ observations of a decimeter thick subice platelet layer under free-drifting pack ice of the Central Arctic in winter. Observations carried out with a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) during the midwinter leg of the MOSAiC drift expedition provide clear evidence of the growth of platelet ice layers from supercooled water present in the ocean mixed layer. This platelet formation takes place under all ice types present during the surveys. Oceanographic data from autonomous observing platforms lead us to the conclusion that platelet ice formation is a widespread but yet overlooked feature of Arctic winter sea ice growth.

AB Today, automatic diving robots are used for research, inspection, and maintenance, extensively. Control of autonomous underwater robots (AUVs) is challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics, uncertain models, and the system underactuation. Data collection using underwater robots is increasing within the oceanographic research community. Also, the ability to navigate and cooperate in a group of robots has many advantages compared with individual navigations. Among them, the effectiveness of using resources, the possibility of robots' collaboration, increasing reliability, and robustness to defects can be pointed out. In this paper, the formation control of underwater robots has been studied. First, the kinematic model of the AUV is presented. Next, a novel Lyapunov-based tracking control algorithm is investigated for the leader robot. Subsequently, a control law is designed using Lyapunov theory and feedback linearization techniques to navigate a group of follower robots in a desired formation associated with the leader and follow it simultaneously. In the obtained results for different reference paths and various formations, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is represented.

AB The objective of this paper is to provide a multiuser transmission technique for underwater acoustic communication in the framework of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) fleet. By using a variant of a Hyperbolically Frequency-Modulated (HFM) signal, we describe a new family of transmission techniques called MultiUser Chirp Spread Spectrum (MU-CSS), which allows a very simple matched-filter-based decoding. These techniques are expected to provide good resilience against multiuser interference while keeping good robustness to Underwater Acoustic (UWA) channel impairments like Doppler shift. Their implementation for the UWA scenario is described, and the performance results over a simulated shallow-water UWA channel are analyzed and compared against conventional Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) transmission. Finally, the feasibility and robustness of the proposed methods are verified over the underWater AcousTic channEl Replay benchMARK (Watermark), fed by several channel responses from sounding experiments performed in a lake.

AB This paper studies the plume-tracing strategy for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the deep-sea turbulent environment. The tracing problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process with continuous state space and action space due to the spatio-temporal changes of environment. An long short-term memory-based reinforcement learning framework with full use of history information is proposed to generate a smooth strategy while the AUV interacting with the environment. Continuous temporal difference and deterministic policy gradient methods are employed to improve the strategy. To promote the performance of the algorithm, a supervised strategy generated by dynamic programming methods is utilized as transcendental knowledge of the agent. Historical searching trajectory's form and the exploration technology are specially designed to fit the algorithm. Simulation environments are established based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the effectiveness of the learned plume-tracing strategy is validated with simulation experiments.

DE Autonomous systems; Mobile robots; Stability; Rates of convergence
AB This paper presents a natural extension of the results obtained by Feintuch and Francis in (2012a,b) concerning the so-called robot rendezvous problem. In particular, we revisit a known necessary and sufficient condition for convergence of the solution in terms of Cesaro convergence of the translates S(k)x(0), k >= 0, of the sequence x(0) of initial positions under the right-shift operator S, thus shedding new light on questions left open in Feintuch and Francis (2012a,b). We then present a new proof showing that a certain stronger ergodic condition on x(0) ensures that the corresponding solution converges to its limit at the optimal rate 0(t(-1/2)) as t -> infinity. After considering a natural two-sided variant of the robot rendezvous problem already studied in Feintuch and Francis (2012a) and in particular proving a new quantified result in this case, we conclude by relating the robot rendezvous problem to a more realistic model of vehicle platoons.

DE Buoyancy control; Scuba diving; Mathematical modelling; Buoyancy vest
ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; DEPTH
AB Divers commonly use buoyancy vests for maintenance and changing depth. They do this by manually actuating two pneumatic valves that cause the jacket's volume to expand or shrink, thus changing its buoyancy. Divers desire for a device that would automatically modify or maintain depth has been present since the beginning of modern diving using a buoyancy vest. The need arises mainly when diving: where poor visibility is present; when both hands are needed for the job; during amateur dives; where decompression procedures are needed; to limit the maximum ascending speed; during a safety stop procedure; automatic ascending when a diver's life functions are critical but nevertheless using the same technology for changing depth in small modern submarines and submarine-like vessels. A prerequisite for successful buoyancy control is definitely knowledge of the system's behaviour based on mathematical modelling. This paper proposes a detailed dynamic model of a diver with all its accessories. The accuracy of the model was validated by comparing simulation results with the measurement results of various experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB The aim of this paper is to present a complete progressive development of object detection from underwater acoustic images. Object detection with respect to automatic target detection in underwater autonomous vehicle system is still in a severe problem in context of surveillance and other defense activity. The present work is based on robust method in perspective of segmentation and feature extraction. Underwater acoustic images suffer from typical noise associations and are often of low contrast. In this perspective, a multi-modal thresholding is adopted for automatic segmentation of the images thus obtained and a graph theoretic approach based on connected components is formulated in order to interpret features embedded within the image context. An imaging SONAR is used for carrying out necessary experimental work. The proposed algorithm is executed in comparison with multi-level thresholding and K-means clustering. Effectiveness is established in the context of both running time and quality of processed image as well. The latter aspect is determined by a Figure of Merit (FOM) parameter.

DT Article
DE Algorithms; Design; Governance; sociotechnical systems; adaptation
AB We understand a sociotechnical system as a multistakeholder cyber-physical system. We introduce governance as the administration of such a system by the stakeholders themselves. In this regard, governance is a peer-to-peer notion and contrasts with traditional management, which is a top-down hierarchical notion. Traditionally, there is no computational support for governance and it is achieved through out-of-band interactions among system administrators. Not surprisingly, traditional approaches simply do not scale up to large sociotechnical systems.
   We develop an approach for governance based on a computational representation of norms in organizations. Our approach is motivated by the Ocean Observatory Initiative, a thirty-year $400 million project, which supports a variety of resources dealing with monitoring and studying the world's oceans. These resources include autonomous underwater vehicles, ocean gliders, buoys, and other instrumentation as well as more traditional computational resources. Our approach has the benefit of directly reflecting stakeholder needs and assuring stakeholders of the correctness of the resulting governance decisions while yielding adaptive resource allocation in the face of changes in both stakeholder needs and physical circumstances.

AB Light-section (LS)-based range finders are commonly used for obstacle recognition in home service robots and autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a smart CMOS image sensor for LS-based range finding. The proposed sensor can detect the laser light, even under very strong ambient-illumination levels by using a multiple-capture frame-correlated double sampling (F-CDS), which is realized with an inverter-based switched-capacitor F-CDS accumulator. The proposed sensor also includes on-chip winner-take-all circuits that significantly reduce the software and hardware complexity of interpolation for the subpixel resolution. The prototype chip was fabricated using a 0.35-mu m CMOS process. The measurement results show that the proposed sensor can detect a laser line with an intensity that is 56.5 dB lower than that of the ambient illumination, providing a spatial resolution of +/- 0.16 pixels.

TI Friction coefficient measurement for autonomous winter road maintenance

DT Article
DE friction; filters; signal processing; quadratic mean filter
AB Real-time measurement of tyre-road friction coefficient is extremely valuable for winter road maintenance operations, since knowledge of tyre-road friction coefficient can be used to optimise application of deicing chemicals to the roadway. In this paper, a wheel-based tyre-road friction coefficient measurement system is developed for snowploughs. Unlike a traditional Norse meter, this system is based on measurement of lateral tyre forces, has minimal moving parts and does not use a brake actuator. Hence, it is reliable and inexpensive. A key challenge is quickly detecting changes in the estimated tyre-road friction coefficient while rejecting the high levels of vibratory noise in the measured force signal. Novel filtering and signal processing algorithms are developed to address this challenge, including a biased quadratic mean filter and an accelerometer-based vibration removal filter. Detailed experimental results are presented on the performance of the friction estimation system on different types of road surfaces. It is also shown that disturbances due to lateral and longitudinal vehicle manoeuvres on the estimated friction coefficient can be removed by using accelerometer-based filtering.

ID PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
AB This letter investigates a two-hop underwater optical wireless communication-radio frequency setup consisting of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), a communication buoy, and an onshore data center (ODC). The information transmission between AUV and ODC occurs in two phases. In the first phase, the AUV communicates to the buoy over the optical wireless link. The buoy harvests the energy by using simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer and also decodes the information. In the subsequent phase, the buoy transmits the decoded information to the ODC over an RF link by utilizing the harvested energy at the first phase. A joint optimization problem is proposed to minimize the total optical energy consumption at the AUV by optimally selecting the DC-bias and the time allocated to the first and second phases subject to the minimum required end-to-end rate. Due to the non-convexity of the original problem, an alternative approach is used to make it convex. For certain system parameters, our results show a significant energy savings of 9.7 J at the required rate of 2 bits per channel use.

TI 3D smooth path planning of AUV based on improved ant colony optimization
   considering heading switching pressure
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB A smooth and secure spatial path planning algorithm that integrates the improved ant colony optimization with the corrective connected spatial search strategy is proposed, aiming at heavy heading switching pressure of autonomous underwater vehicles sailing in complex marine environment. On the one hand, to overcome the low-dimensional search domain and inaccurate spatial communication information in traditional spatial path planning, the spatial connectivity adjacency domain search strategy is designed based on grid environment model. On the other hand, to alleviate heading switching pressure due to large path steering angles and redundant path turning points, the heuristic functions and pheromone update criterion based on ant colony optimization are introduced to improve the solution quality of smooth paths. The simulation results show that the space search strategy can improve the success probability of safe path planning without reducing the scope of explorable free space. Additionally, the simulations demonstrate that the improved ant colony optimization using the spatial search strategy can guarantee the shortest path with lowest tortuous degree and fewest turning times in the same grid environment.

AB This article investigates the practical prescribed-time trajectory tracking control problem for AUVs with parametric uncertainties under tracking error constraints and velocity constraints. A settling time regulator is combined to construct the performance function, with which we build a new adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme upon the transferred error, ensuring that the tracking error converges to an adjustably small residual set within the prescribed time with a continuous control action. Furthermore, with the specific velocity transformation techniques, the problem of velocity constraints is transformed into the boundedness of new variables, thus the feasibility conditions are eliminated, and the requirements of constrained boundary functions are relaxed. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed control method is an effective way to achieve pre-given tracking precision within the prescribed time, while avoiding the issue of explosion of complexity. The prescribed time is independent of system initial conditions and other parameters, and the tracking error will converge asymptotically. Simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Nowadays, quadcopters are used widely in different applications, but their flight time is limited during operation. In this paper, a precision landing method based on a Kalman filter is proposed for an autonomous indoor persistent drone system that aims to increase the flight time of quadcopters. First, a local positioning system is used for tracking performance. Second, instead of using this local positioning system during the landing phase, a multi-ranger sensor is proposed to increase the accuracy of horizontal errors. Next, based on the relative position provided by the multi-ranger sensor, a Kalman filter technique is applied to estimate the relative velocity of the system, which is then applied to control the position of the quadcopter during the landing phase. Finally, a charging state machine law is proposed to charge the battery of three quadcopters sequentially. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed concept based on a multi-ranger sensor can enhance the accuracy of the landing phase in comparison with the conventional method.

DE UAV; obstacle avoidance; DQN; overestimation; convergence rate
AB In the intelligent unmanned systems, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) obstacle avoidance technology is the core and primary condition. Traditional algorithms are not suitable for obstacle avoidance in complex and changeable environments based on the limited sensors on UAVs. In this article, we use an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to achieve the UAV autonomously avoid obstacles. For the problem of slow convergence in DRL, a Multi-Branch (MB) network structure is proposed to ensure that the algorithm can get good performance in the early stage; for non-optimal decision-making problems caused by overestimation, the Revise Q-value (RQ) algorithm is proposed to ensure that the agent can choose the optimal strategy for obstacle avoidance. According to the flying characteristics of the rotor UAV, we build a V-Rep 3D physical simulation environment to test the obstacle avoidance performance. And experiments show that the improved algorithm can accelerate the convergence speed of agent and the average return of the round is increased by 25%.

AB Marine organisms grow on the jackets of an offshore oil platform, thereby affecting its service life and safety. Therefore, these marine organisms need to be cleaned regularly. Correspondingly, an underwater pipe cleaning system is urgently needed because the conventional manual cleaning is severely limited in underwater missions in terms of duration, depth, and safety. Autonomous underwater intervention robots can provide a longer duration or deeper working depth and allow fast deployment and operation in adverse environments. Hence, an underwater cleaning robot equipped with a six degrees of freedom electric manipulator is developed for marine biofouling stripping tasks. An automatic trajectory planning approach based on the hierarchical task control framework is proposed for efficient and delicate manipulation. In this control approach, we transformed the jet pistol orientation relative to the target surface into an optimization problem on the basis of uncomplicated constraints. Simulations and experimental trials are successively presented to show that the developed robot system provides a solution for a less execution time and robotize pipe-cleaning process.

AB This paper describes highly configurable hardware modules, included in XIL XSGImgLib library, capable of speed up the hardware implementation of video and image processing systems using the model-based design flow provided by Xilinx System Generator. As part of this work, generic architectures were developed to exploit specific characteristics of some processing blocks, which can be self-modified using a novel software procedure developed for MATLAB (R). This procedure, along with the generic architecture and the configuration options, allows the abstraction about the specific details of the hardware implementation, as well as the adjustment of the resources consumption of the high-speed image and video processing application for embedded systems with weight, volume and power consumption constrains like smart cameras, video surveillance and autonomous vehicles. The use of this video and image processing library is illustrated by the development of a segmentation application on a Spartan-6 LX45 FPGA although any Xilinx's FPGA is supported.

AB We present the design, motion planning, and control of an aerial manipulator for non-trivial physical interaction tasks, such as pushing while sliding on curved surfaces-a task which is motivated by the increasing interest in autonomous non-destructive tests for industrial plants. The proposed aerial manipulator consists of a multidirectional-thrust aerial vehicle-to enhance physical interaction capabilities-endowed with a 2-DoFs lightweight arm-to enlarge its workspace. This combination makes it a truly-redundant manipulator going beyond standard aerial manipulators based on collinear multirotor platforms. The controller is based on a PID method with a "displaced" positional part that ensures asymptotic stability despite the arm elasticity. A kinodynamic task-constrained and control-aware global motion planner is used. Experiments show that the proposed aerial manipulator system, equipped with an Eddy current probe, is able to scan a metallic pipe sliding the sensor over its surface and preserving the contact. From the measures, a weld on the pipe is successfully detected and mapped.

ID CAR; MILLENNIALS; ATTITUDES
AB The ongoing demographic transition from baby boomers to millennials and technology-fueled evolution of transportation bring to the fore key trends that will determine how the future of transportation systems will unfold. This paper examines the implications of such trends on travel behavior by quantifying the impacts of a technologically engaged childhood-generally attributed to millennials-and an increased use of technology during travel on travel behavior now and in the future. Results indicate that individuals who grew up with a stronger childhood technology experience are more likely to be technologically engaged as adults, have stronger pro-environmental attitudes, lower car dependence, and stronger interest in autonomous vehicles. The results also support a simultaneous relationship between technology use during travel and car dependence, which posits that individuals with lower car dependence (or availability) are more likely to use technology during travel. Emanating results put forward potential benefits of policy starting at the childhood level. The implications of this work will only gain importance as the interplay between technology and travel deepens and as a larger share of the adult population become "digital natives."

AB In the last years, autonomous aerial vehicles have become promising mobile robotic platforms capable of manipulating external objects. In particular, quadrotors, rotorcrafts with four propellers, have been used for aerial transportation of cable-suspended loads. A critical step before transporting a payload is the lift maneuver. However, the analysis and planning of this maneuver have received a little attention in the literature so far. In this work, we decompose the cable-suspended load lifting into three simpler discrete states or modes: Setup, Pull, and Raise. Each of these states represents the dynamics of the quadrotor-load system at particular regimes during the maneuver. Furthermore, we define a hybrid system based on these states and show that it is a differentially-flat hybrid system. Exploiting this property, we generate a trajectory by using a series of waypoints associated with each mode. We design a nonlinear hybrid controller to track this trajectory and therefore execute the lift maneuver. We verify the proposed approach by carrying out experiments on an actual quadrotor with a cable-suspended load.

AB This paper presents a novel motion planning approach inspired by the Dynamic Programming (DP) applicable to multi degree of freedom robots (mobile or stationary) and autonomous vehicles. The proposed discrete-time algorithm enables a robot to reach its destination through an arbitrary obstacle field in the fewest number of time steps possible while minimizing a secondary objective function. Furthermore, the resulting optimal trajectory is guaranteed to be globally optimal while incorporating state constraints such as velocity, acceleration, and jerk limits. The optimal trajectories furnished by the algorithm may be further updated in real time to accommodate changes in the obstacle field and/or cost function. The algorithm is proven to terminate in a finite number of steps without its computational complexity increasing with the type or number of obstacles. The effectiveness of the global and replanning algorithms are demonstrated on a planar mobile robot with three degrees of freedom subject to velocity and acceleration limits. The computational complexity of the two algorithms are also compared to that of an A*-type search.

AB Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) has been widely employed in Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for autonomous navigation and object detection. In this paper, an efficient extrinsic parameter calibration approach, which is based on a pair of orthogonal normal vectors, is presented for an arbitrary equipped 3-D LiDAR. With the proposed approach, the whole calibration process can be easily and efficiently implemented in outdoor urban environment and no calibration equipment is required. The main advantages of this approach are twofold: (1) compared with traditional ways, the proposed approach employs an orthogonal normal vector pair, which is generated by ground plane and vertical wall in urban environment, so calibration equipments are not required anymore; (2) the normal vector is estimated from the point cloud data on a surface, thus a quite robust and accuracy estimation can be obtained. Experiments illustrate the effective and efficient performance of the proposed approach, compared with the state of the art.

AB Portable and inexpensive scientific instruments that are capable of performing point of care diagnostics are needed for applications such as disease detection and diagnosis in resource-poor settings, for water quality and food supply monitoring, and for biosurveillance activities in autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we describe the development of a compact flow cytometer built from three separate, customizable, and interchangeable modules. The instrument as configured in this work is being developed specifically for the detection of selected Centers for Disease Control (CDC) category B biothreat agents through a bead-based assay: E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Listeria, and Shigella. It has two-color excitation, three-color fluorescence and light scattering detection, embedded electronics, and capillary based flow. However, these attributes can be easily modified for other applications such as cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counting. Proof of concept is demonstrated through a 6-plex bead assay with the results compared to a commercially available benchtop-sized instrument. (c) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB This paper presents an analytical study of the depth estimation error of a stereo vision-based pedestrian detection sensor for automotive applications such as pedestrian collision avoidance and/or mitigation. The sensor comprises two synchronized and calibrated low-cost cameras. Pedestrians are detected by combining a 3D clustering method with Support Vector Machine-based (SVM) classification. The influence of the sensor parameters in the stereo quantization errors is analyzed in detail providing a point of reference for choosing the sensor setup according to the application requirements. The sensor is then validated in real experiments. Collision avoidance maneuvers by steering are carried out by manual driving. A real time kinematic differential global positioning system (RTK-DGPS) is used to provide ground truth data corresponding to both the pedestrian and the host vehicle locations. The performed field test provided encouraging results and proved the validity of the proposed sensor for being used in the automotive sector towards applications such as autonomous pedestrian collision avoidance.

AB This paper addresses task allocation to coordinate a fleet of autonomous vehicles by presenting two decentralized algorithms: the consensus-based auction algorithm (CBAA) and its generalization to the multi-assignment problem, i.e., the consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA). These algorithms utilize a market-based decision strategy as the mechanism for decentralized task selection and use a consensus routine based on local communication as the conflict resolution mechanism to achieve agreement on the winning bid values. Under reasonable assumptions on the scoring scheme, both of the proposed algorithms are proven to guarantee convergence to a conflict-free assignment, and it is shown that the converged solutions exhibit provable worst-case performance. It is also demonstrated that CBAA and CBBA produce conflict-free feasible solutions that are robust to both inconsistencies in the situational awareness across the fleet and variations in the communication network topology. Numerical experiments confirm superior convergence properties and performance when compared with existing auction-based task-allocation algorithms.

AB A methodology and several algorithms for interactive motion planning are developed for multi-equipment landfill operations in an automated landfill system (ALS). A system for establishing ALS is also proposed in the paper. To develop a multi-truck/multi-compactor ALS, the major problems can be classified into three principal categories: (1) navigation system for multiple devices, (2) job-site geometric model, and (3) instantaneous motion planning and control system for equipment in the work site. To solve the problems from the three categories, this paper will present a methodology to simulate the operational processes of landfill vehicles and equipment in pre-planning a landfill project as well as finding efficient and collision-free motion patterns to control autonomous landfill equipment during the construction phase. Furthermore, by linking this system to a global positioning system (GPS), the efficient traffic routing and collision-free path for each piece of equipment can be calculated by using real-time positional data acquisition in a 3-D geometric model of a landfill site.

AB To develop vector systems that combine high transcription activity with biologically safe delivery vehicles, we have explored the use of RNA replication to amplify mRNAs, by using flock house virus (FHV) as a model system. The FHV RNA replicase is encoded in the larger of the two segments that comprise the viral positive-sense RNA genome, A cDNA copy of this self-replicating RNA was precisely positioned between a promoter site for cellular RNA polymerase II and a cDNA encoding a self-cleaving ribozyme from hepatitis delta virus. Transfection of this plasmid into cultured BHK cells resulted in prolonged, autonomous FHV RNA replication in the cytoplasm and substantial amplification of the RNA replicon. The replicase also amplified RNA transcribed from a second plasmid of similar design that contained a cDNA copy of the other FHV genome segment. These results constitute a significant step toward the harnessing of nodaviral RNA replication as the basis of a versatile vector system.

AB Recent advances in precision manufacturing technology and a thorough understanding of the properties of piezoelectric materials have made it possible for researchers to develop innovative microrobotic systems, which draw more attention to the challenges of utilizing microrobots in areas that are inaccessible to ordinary robots. This review paper provides an overview of the recent advances in the application of piezoelectric materials in microrobots. The challenges of microrobots in the direction of autonomy are categorized into four sections: mechanisms, power, sensing, and control. In each section, innovative research ideas are presented to inspire researchers in their prospective microrobot designs according to specific applications. Novel mechanisms for the mobility of piezoelectric microrobots are reviewed and described. Additionally, as the piezoelectric micro-actuators require high-voltage electronics and onboard power supplies, we review ways of energy harvesting technology and lightweight micro-sensing mechanisms that contain piezoelectric devices to provide feedback, facilitating the use of control strategies to achieve the autonomous untethered movement of microrobots.

AB This paper presents a distributed scalable multi-robot planning algorithm for informed sampling of quasistatic spatials fields. We address the problem of efficient data collection using multiple autonomous vehicles and consider the effects of communication between multiple robots, acting independently, on the overall sampling performance of the team. We focus on the distributed sampling problem where the robots operate independent of their teammates, but have the ability to communicate their current state to other neighbors within a fixed communication range. Our proposed approach is scalable and adaptive to various environmental scenarios, changing robot team configurations, and runs in real-time, which are important features for many real-world applications. We compare the performance of our proposed algorithm to baseline strategies through simulated experiments that utilize models derived from both synthetic and field deployment data. The results show that our sampling algorithm is efficient even when robots in the team are operating with a limited communication range, thus demonstrating the scalability of our method in sampling large-scale environments.

TI Tactical-Level Explanation is Not Enough: Effect of Explaining AV's
   Lane-Changing Decisions on Drivers' Decision-Making, Trust, and

ID SITUATION AWARENESS; MODEL; TAKEOVER
AB Explanations have become increasingly vital in communicating with human drivers about the reasons for the decision-making of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in tactical-level driving tasks. Focusing on lane-changing scenarios, we examine whether providing tactical-level explanations and in addition, whether providing a confirmation option, influences drivers' decision-making, trust, and emotional experience. Thirty participants were equally assigned into three groups: indicator (I), explanation (E), and explanation + confirmation (EC), experiencing four lane-changing scenarios in a driving simulator. Real-time question probes and interviews were adopted to understand drivers' decision-making process, and post-drive questionnaires on trust and emotional experience were given. Results indicated that merely providing tactical-level explanations had little effect on driver's trust and experience, but caused worse decision-making performance. The option to confirm lane changes after an explanation promoted driver's trust, but brought two-sided effects on decision-making performance. Situational trust and decision-making performance varied significantly across lane-changing scenarios.

AB As COVID-19 has increased the need for connectivity around the world, researchers are targeting new technologies that could improve coverage and connect the unconnected in order to make progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, drones are seen as one of the key features of 6G wireless networks that could extend the coverage of previous wireless network generations. That said, limited onboard energy seems to be the main drawback that hinders the use of drones for wireless coverage. Therefore, different wireless and wired charging techniques, such as laser beaming, charging stations, and tether stations, are proposed. In this article, we analyze and compare these different charging techniques by performing extensive simulations for the scenario of drone-assisted data collection from ground-based Internet of Things devices. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each charging technique, and finally show that laser-powered drones strongly compete with, and outperform in some scenarios, other charging techniques.

AB The purpose of this paper is to develop a routine to semi-automatically identify the free span, condition when a pipe segment is not supported by the seabed, from the images of the Synthetic Aperture Sonar and Digital Surface Model (DSM) from an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) hydrographic survey. Currently, the free span is performed manually in sonar images, with slow and error-prone process, as it depends on human experience and attention. The methodology developed in this paper consists of extracting profiles of pipeline cross sections from the DSM, and then obtaining geometric information about each profile that will be modeled based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF) for free span condition classification. The ANN and RF allow evaluating and modeling the relationship between the variables extracted in the profile for the classification of free span condition. The results show that the ANN and RF provide satisfactory results for the free span condition classification with global accuracy of 86.8% and 89.9%, respectively.

AB Road safety is an essential issue of modern life that must be tackled and resolved. Using AI technology to develop autonomous vehicles and driver-assistant systems is a promising approach to reduce accidents and preserve user's security. In this regard, obstacle detection and identification have been a topic of much concern for researchers over the last few years. In this paper, we propose an embedded system that operates on low-level, lightweight algorithms, based on two types of data, namely, radar signals and camera images with the purpose of identifying and classifying obstacles on the road. The proposed system has two major contributions. The first is the use of machine-learning methods alongside signal processing techniques to optimize the overall computing performance and efficiency. Then, the second contribution consists of the use of the dynamic reconfiguration feature using DSP48 instead of standard CLBs to improve surface usage. The overall system was developed on Xilinx Zedboard Zynq-7000 FPGA.

AB Head direction cells (HDCs) in mammals' brains are thought to provide the sense of direction (function of a compass). They fire when the animal's head points to a specific orientation. In this paper, a bio-inspired neural compass with 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) which is consistent with neurophysiological characteristics of biological HDCs in three-dimensional (3-D) environments is proposed. The proposed model, which is based on continuous attractor neural network (CANN), is primarily driven by angular velocity of head turning to determine spatial orientations of unmanned vehicles in 3-D environments. By means of Hebbian learning, external perception information such as visual landmarks can be incorporated to calibrate cumulative errors of path integration based on self-motion information. Experimental results obtained by validating the model on a two-axis motion simulator are given. The neural system enables the simulator to track its spatial orientations in 3-D environments effectively.

AB Modern agriculture is related to a revolution that occurred in a large group of technologies (e.g., informatics, sensors, navigation) within the last decades. In crop production systems, there are field operations that are quite labour-intensive either due to their complexity or because of the fact that they are connected to sensitive plants/edible product interaction, or because of the repetitiveness they require throughout a crop production cycle. These are the key factors for the development of agricultural robots. In this paper, a systematic review of the literature has been conducted on research and commercial agricultural robotics used in crop field operations. This study underlined that the most explored robotic systems were related to harvesting and weeding, while the less studied were the disease detection and seeding robots. The optimization and further development of agricultural robotics are vital, and should be evolved by producing faster processing algorithms, better communication between the robotic platforms and the implements, and advanced sensing systems.

AB Driver and pedestrian behaviour significantly affect the safety and the flow of traffic at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. The driver behaviour models describe the driver decisions made in different traffic flow conditions. Modelling the pedestrian behaviour plays an essential role in the analysis of pedestrian flows in the areas such as public transit terminals, pedestrian zones, evacuations, etc. Driver behaviour models, integrated into simulation tools, can be divided into car-following models and lane-changing models. The simulation tools are used to replicate traffic flows and infer certain regularities. Particular model parameters must be appropriately calibrated to approximate the realistic traffic flow conditions. This paper describes the existing car-following models, lane-changing models, and pedestrian behaviour models. Further, it underlines the importance of calibrating the parameters of microsimulation models to replicate realistic traffic flow conditions and sets the guidelines for future research related to the development of new models and the improvement of the existing ones.

AB The online meal order and delivery business has scaled up in the last few years. The delivery process is currently performed by self-employed contractors (i.e. cyclists); however, in the future, it might be performed using drones, as some pilot tests are currently experimenting with this possibility. This paper outlines a scenario in which a fleet of drones, performing the deliveries, requires a network of strategically located charging stations to support the business. This paper shows how the strategic location of the charging stations affects the overall performance of the system, where the maximum time the customers are willing to wait is limited. To this end, an optimisation model addressing the trade-off between the number of stations and the coverage of the demand is presented. Although not imminent, due to technology and regulatory constraints, this scenario and the formulated model can open new perspectives in the delivery process of meals and other goods.

AB In this paper, a Next Best View (NBV) approach with a profiling stage and a novel utility function for 3D reconstruction using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is proposed. The proposed approach performs an initial scan in order to build a rough model of the structure that is later used to improve coverage completeness and reduce flight time. Then, a more thorough NBV process is initiated, utilizing the rough model in order to create a dense 3D reconstruction of the structure of interest. The proposed approach exploits the reflectional symmetry feature if it exists in the initial scan of the structure. The proposed NBV approach is implemented with a novel utility function, which consists of four main components: information theory, model density, traveled distance, and predictive measures based on symmetries in the structure. This system outperforms classic information gain approaches with a higher density, entropy reduction and coverage completeness.

AB In this article, we propose a new method for constraints evaluation during the path planning of a multi-legged walking robot. We propose the application of Gaussian Mixtures (GM) to build constraint models. With the proposed analytical constraint function we can compute the gradient and move the robot out of the bound configuration. The proposed method allows checking self-collisions, and a workspace of the robot in a few microseconds and efficiently plan the motion of the robot. The proposed path planning method uses RRT-Connect framework. We show how to efficiently apply the constraints evaluation methods to optimize the posture of the robot, optimize the position of the feet during the swing phase and efficiently explore the search space. We compare the proposed method with the standard constraints evaluation algorithms. Finally, we present the results of path planning for the six-legged robot in various scenarios to show properties of the proposed motion planning algorithm with GM-based constraints evaluation.

AB The speed of mobile robots moving in corridors is important for the efficiency of material transportation. This paper proposes a novel control method based on the viability theory for optimizing the flexibility of robots passing through narrow corridors. The viability theory can take both environmental constraints and robot dynamical limitation into account simultaneously. The viability of a straight corridor is first analyzed. Then, this analysis is extended to the corner. With these two typical environments, a general corridor working scenario for a mobile robot can be formulated. Through the viability analyses, the largest safety area of the corridor is provided with respect to the robot traveling at a high speed. Furthermore, with the facility of viability, a flexibility optimized control is derived by modifying a general model predictive control framework. The simulation results validate that the proposed flexible control method is secure, accurate, efficient, and lower computational burden. With these properties, this method can also be applied in the area of autonomous vehicle control.

AB Security incidents such as targeted distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on power grids and hacking of factory industrial control systems (ICS) are on the increase. This paper unpacks where emerging security risks lie for the industrial intemet of things, drawing on both technical and regulatory perspectives. Legal changes are being ushered by the European Union (EU) Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive 2016 and the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) (both to be enforced from May 2018). We use the case study of the emergent smart energy supply chain to frame, scope out and consolidate the breadth of security concerns at play, and the regulatory responses. We argue the industrial IoT brings four security concerns to the fore, namely: appreciating the shift from offline to online infrastructure; managing temporal dimensions of security; addressing the implementation gap for best practice; and engaging with infrastructural complexity. Our goal is to surface risks and foster dialogue to avoid the emergence of an Internet of Insecure Industrial Things. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB High-resolution and hyperspectral imaging has long been a goal for multi-dimensional data fusion sensing applications - of interest for autonomous vehicles and environmental monitoring. In the long wave infrared regime this quest has been impeded by size, weight, power, and cost issues, especially as focal-plane array detector sizes increase. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrated a new approach based on a metamaterial graphene spatial light modulator (GSLM) for infrared single pixel imaging. A frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) imaging technique is designed and implemented, and relies entirely on the electronic reconfigurability of the GSLM. We compare our approach to the more common raster-scan method and directly show FDM image frame rates can be 64 times faster with no degradation of image quality. Our device and related imaging architecture are not restricted to the infrared regime, and may be scaled to other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. The study presented here opens a new approach for fast and efficient single pixel imaging utilizing graphene metamaterials with novel acquisition strategies. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

DE Unmanned aerial vehicles; visual servoing
AB This paper addresses the problem of autonomous servoing an unmanned redundant aerial manipulator using computer vision. The overactuation of the system is exploited by means of a hierarchical control law, which allows to prioritize several tasks during flight. We propose a safety-related primary task to avoid possible collisions. As a secondary task, we present an uncalibrated image-based visual servo strategy to drive the arm endeffector to a desired position and orientation by using a camera attached to it. In contrast to the previous visual servo approaches, a known value of camera focal length is not strictly required. To further improve flight behavior, we hierarchically add one task to reduce dynamic effects by vertically aligning the arm center of gravity to the multirotor gravitational vector, and another one that keeps the arm close to a desired configuration of high manipulability and avoiding arm joint limits. The performance of the hierarchical control law, with and without activation of each of the tasks, is shown in simulations and in real experiments confirming the viability of such prioritized control scheme for aerial manipulation.

ID SCALE ESTIMATION
AB Drift and scale ambiguity are two main issues which reduce localization accuracy in monocular visual odometry (MVO). It is necessary to propose a unified model to represent these measurement uncertainties. In this paper, we present a geometric map-assisted localization approach for mobile robots equipped with MVO. We model the measurement of MVO as a group of particles, which obey uniform-Gaussian distribution and cover measurement uncertainties including scale ambiguity and measurement randomness. The saliency of each particle can be obtained fromthe distribution to indicate rawmeasurement certainty of MVO. Geometric map-assisted shape matching is implemented as the measurement model to assign consistency to the particles generated from the distribution. Both saliency and consistency are considered in particle weights determination. Furthermore, based on the statistical properties of the probability distribution, a parameter estimation scheme is proposed to narrow down the scale ambiguity of MVO while resampling particles. Experiments with KITTI dataset have demonstrated that the proposed approach greatly enhances positioning accuracy, with average localization error of 6.54 m in over 15.89 km run.

ID SENSOR; NETWORK
AB We focus on Internet of Things (IoT) environments where sensing and computing devices (nodes) are responsible to observe, reason, report, and react to a specific phenomenon. Each node (e. g., an unmanned vehicle or an autonomous device) cap-tures context from data streams and reasons on the presence of an event. We propose a distributed predictive analytics scheme for localized context reasoning under uncertainty. Such reasoning is achieved through a contextualized, knowledge-driven clustering process, where the clusters of nodes are formed according to their belief on the presence of the phenomenon. Each cluster enhances its localized opinion about the presence of an event through con-sensus realized under the principles of fuzzy logic (FL). The proposed FL-driven consensus process is further enhanced with semantics adopting type-2 fuzzy sets to handle the uncertainty related to the identification of an event. We provide a compre-hensive experimental evaluation and comparison assessment with other schemes over real data and report on the benefits stemmed from its adoption in IoT environments.

AB In this article, the autonomous mapping airship (AMA) equipped with lidar along with its basic properties is introduced. Other methods and technologies using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or conventional aircraft are then compared to the AMA. Specifically automatic reconstruction from photographs acquired with fixed wing UAVs and lidar taken from conventional aircraft. Comparison of technologies was realized in the locality of a brown coal mine spoil heap. The size of the spoil heap interest part is about three square kilometres and it is covered with wind-blown vegetation (trees, grass, bush). We also measured about 100 height check points (HCPs) using real-time kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System technology for the purpose of accuracy analysis in the locality. One group of the HCPs were measured on the vegetation-free ground and the second group on ground with low vegetation (grass). Other properties of the methods used and the data acquired were also compared. The most important of these were data density, vegetation penetrability, speed of data collection, and economical aspects.

AB Underwater glider, as a new kind of autonomous underwater vehicles, has many merits such as long-range, extended-duration and low costs. The shape of underwater glider is an important factor in determining the hydrodynamic efficiency In this paper, a high lift to drag ratio configuration, the Blended-Wing-Body (BWB), is used to design a small civilian under water glider. In the parametric geometric model of the BWB underwater glider, the planform is defined with Bezier curve and linear line, and the section is defined with symmetrical airfoil NACA 0012. Computational investigations are carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of the glider using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code Fluent. The Kriging-based genetic algorithm, called Efficient Global Optimization (EGO), is applied to hydrodynamic design optimization. The result demonstrates that the BWB underwater glider has excellent hydrodynamic performance, and the lift to drag ratio of initial design is increased by 7% in the EGO process.
