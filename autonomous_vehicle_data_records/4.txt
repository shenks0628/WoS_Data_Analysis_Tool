ID VEHICLE DETECTION
AB Detecting and tracking moving objects (DATMO) is an essential component for autonomous driving and transportation. In this paper, we present a computationally low-cost and robust DATMO system which uses as input only 2D laser rangefinder (LRF) information. Due to its low requirements both in sensor needs and computation, our DATMO algorithm is meant to be used in current Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to improve their reliability for the cargo transportation tasks at port terminals, advancing towards the next generation of fully autonomous transportation vehicles. Our method follows a Detection plus Tracking paradigm. In the detection step we exploit the minimum information of 2D-LRFs by segmenting the elements of the scene in a model-free way and performing a fast object matching to pair segmented elements from two different scans. In this way, we easily recognize dynamic objects and thus reduce consistently by between two and five times the computational burden of the adjacent tracking method. We track the final dynamic objects with an improved Multiple-Hypothesis Tracking (MHT), to which special functions for filtering, confirming, holding, and deleting targets have been included. The full system is evaluated in simulated and real scenarios producing solid results. Specifically, a simulated port environment has been developed to gather realistic data of common autonomous transportation situations such as observing an intersection, joining vehicle platoons, and perceiving overtaking maneuvers. We use different sensor configurations to demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of our approach. We additionally evaluate our system with real data collected in a port terminal the Netherlands. We show that it is able to accomplish the vehicle following task successfully, obtaining a total system recall of more than 98% while running faster than 30 Hz.

AB Through a review of long-range transportation plans and interviews with planners, this article examines how large metropolitan planning organizations are preparing for autonomous vehicles. In just a few years, the prospect of commercially available self-driving cars and trucks has gone from a futurist fantasy to a likely near-term reality. However, uncertainties about the new technology and its relationship to daily investment decisions have kept mention of self-driving cars out of nearly all long-range transportation plans. Nevertheless, interviewees are keeping a close watch on the new technology and actively looking to understand and plan for future impacts.

AB The introduction of autonomous vehicles can potentially lead to enhanced situational awareness and safety for road transport. However, the performance required for autonomous operations places stringent requirements on the vehicle navigation systems design. Relevant performance measures include not only the accuracy of the system but also its ability to detect sensor faults within a specified Time-to-Alert (TTA) and without generating an excessive number of false alarms. A new integrated navigation system architecture is proposed which utilizes Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), low-cost Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), visual odometry and Vehicle Dynamic Models (VDM). The system design is based on various navigation modes, each with independent failure mechanisms and fault-detection capabilities. A two-step data fusion approach is adopted to optimize the system accuracy and integrity performance. This includes a Knowledge-Based Module (KBM) performing a detailed sensor integrity analysis followed by a conventional Extended Kalman Filer (EKF). CAV navigation integrity requirement (i.e., alert limits and time-to-alert) are considered in the KBM where fault detection probabilities are calculated for each mode and translated to protection levels. A simulation case study is executed to verify the performance of each navigation mode in the presence of faults affecting the individual navigation sensors. Results confirm that the required CAV integrity performances are met, while the inclusion of visual odometry and VDM data provides significant performance enhancements both in terms of accuracy and integrity over existing INS/GNSS systems.

AB This article provides an adaptive asymptotic backstepping-based tracking control algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under the situation of non-vanishing uncertainties and input saturation. Firstly, the adaptive asymptotic control algorithm is developed to compensate the non-vanishing uncertainties. And then, virtual control stabilizing functions are reconstructed to improve the system performance by virtue of variable substitutions. Next, the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to handle the unknown input saturation problem. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the asymptotic stability of AUVs is proven. Finally, simulation results illustrate that the control strategy can effectively inhibit the effect of unknown model dynamics on the system.

TI Fail Safe Process of Vehicle Localization for Reliability Improvement of

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Autonomous driving; Fail safe; Localization; Dead reckoning
AB In this paper, a vehicle localization fail safe process is proposed for improving localization reliability for level 3 autonomous driving. This process does not necessitate additional and expensive sensor configuration using sensor fusion with practical usage and high density maps for localization fail safe. The proposed process also suggests a three-step safety mechanism. The first step is to detect and monitor in-vehicle sensors. The second step constitutes Dead Reckoning (DR) model-based fail monitoring. The final is a map-matching fail safe to detect and to identify fail level and this algorithm recovers abnormal positions of map-matching results. The fail detection algorithm and monitoring logic and thresholds were validated and identified by vehicle endurance run tests comprising over 100,000 km of driving. The performance of DR fail monitoring and map-matching base fail logic were evaluated by vehicle-simulations on sensor measurements. The results demonstrated that the proposed process achieves improvement of reliability with accuracy fault detection and identification for abnormal cases on the fail level.

AB Intersections are at the core of congestion in urban areas. After the end of the Second World War, the problem of intersection management has benefited from a growing body of advances to address the optimization of the traffic lights' phase splits, timing, and offset. These contributions have significantly improved traffic safety and efficiency in urban areas. However, with the growth of transportation demand and motorization, traffic lights show their limits. At the end of the 1990s, the perspective of autonomous and connected driving systems motivated researchers to introduce a paradigm shift for controlling intersections. This new paradigm is well known today as autonomous intersection management (AIM). It harnesses the self-organization ability of future vehicles to provide more accurate control approaches that use the smallest available time window to reach unprecedented traffic performances. This is achieved by optimizing two main points of the interaction of connected and autonomous vehicles at intersections: the motion control of vehicles and the schedule of their accesses. Considering the great potential of AIM and the complexity of the problem, the proposed approaches are very different, starting from various assumptions. With the increasing popularity of AIM, this paper provides readers with a comprehensive vision of noticeable advances toward enhancing traffic efficiency. It shows that it is possible to tailor vehicles' speed and schedule according to the traffic demand by using distributed particle swarm optimization. Moreover, it brings the most relevant contributions in the light of traffic engineering, where flow-speed diagrams are used to measure the impact of the proposed optimizations. Finally, this paper presents the current challenging issues to be addressed.

It was used to successfully explore hydrothermal fields on the Southwest Indian Ridge. Here, we summarized the exploration of hydrothermal systems using Qianlong-II, including detailed descriptions of its implementation along with the systems used for data management and fast mapping. We also introduced a method to remove platform magnetic interference using magnetic data while Qianlong-II is spinning. Based on hydrothermal anomalies collected by Qianlong-II, we developed a rapid method for locating hydrothermal vents. Taking one dive as an example, we systemically demonstrated the process for analyzing hydrothermal survey data to locate hydrothermal vents.

AB The VANET (Vehicle Ad Hoc Network) is gathering attention for autonomous vehicles and the MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network) is attracting interest as well. Therefore, efforts have been made to overcome the challenges of the VANET in which the topology changes in real time and instability exists due to the difference in speed and physical phase. Particularly in the IoT era, the total amount of network nodes in addition to vehicle nodes is expected to increase dramatically. Therefore, a clustering algorithm for a mesh network capable of autonomous configuration is suitable for reducing the load of the central control device and data redundancy on the network, which is expected to increase as the IoT era progresses. However, since clustering algorithms based on the existing research have been developed for the current traffic situation, inefficiency is inevitable in the future autonomous navigation period in which traveling path prediction can be accurately performed. Therefore, this paper discusses a clustering algorithm and a data propagation algorithm between clusters using path information. The main content of this paper is as follows. First, we propose a clustering algorithm using path information and considering the existing research results. In the autonomous navigation period, if the path is predictable, the probability that the nodes in the same cluster are in the same block for a longer time than the conventional one can converge to 100%. Therefore, the survival time of the cluster can be dramatically improved. Second, we developed a data propagation algorithm that can increase the information propagation rate of the entire network using path information. The cluster temporarily stores the data to be disseminated and then disseminates it when it encounters another cluster of neighbors. Therefore, data can be disseminated even for noncontiguous clusters. To summarize, this paper proposes clustering-based data dissemination algorithms and protocols using vehicle pathways for autonomous navigation and compares them with clustering-based data dissemination algorithms using existing directions.

AB This field report presents the results of a study of obstacle detection and avoidance (ODOA) by an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) in off-road driving conditions. This study included both real and simulated testing of the AGV and served as the third and final phase of a 3-year research project studying the influence of environmental conditions over autonomous driving. We compare and contrast the results of the real and experimental field testing and report our findings on the influence of soft soil in ODOA performance by an AGV. We find that rutting in soft soil results in higher throttle effort but lower steering effort and speed. The results of these experiments will inform future studies of autonomous driving on off-road environments.

AB Cooperative environmental perception is an effective way to provide connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with the necessary environmental information. The research goal of this paper is to achieve efficient sharing of cooperative environmental perception information. Hence, a novel vehicular edge computing scheme is proposed. In this scheme, the environmental perception tasks are selected to be offloaded based on their shareability, and the edge server directly delivers the task results to the CAVs who need the perception information. The experimental results show that the proposed task offloading scheme can decrease the perception information delivery latency up to 20%. Therefore, it is an effective way to improve cooperative environmental perception efficiency by taking the shareability of the perception information into consideration.

AB To assure safety and comfort for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the mixed traffic environment, a longitudinal potential field-based car-following model considering the cut-in behavior from an adjacent vehicle is established in this study. The longitudinal potential field (LPF), which includes the cut-in potential field, the hazard potential field and the velocity potential field, is constructed to quantitatively characterize the influence of the surrounding environment on the AVs. The cut-in potential field is created to indicate the possibility of cut-in behavior from the adjacent vehicle, the hazard potential field is intended to depict the risk of colliding with the preceding vehicle, and the velocity potential field is created to show how velocity impacts the following behavior. The proposed model is obtained by calculating the field force in the LPF, and its parameters are calibrated using the genetic algorithm. Comparative simulations are executed to verify the remarkable performance of the proposed model, in terms of acceleration, velocity, and headway tracking as well as responding to the cut-in behavior under three different driving conditions.

AB As promising candidate frequency bands, millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications can provide ultrahigh transmission rate to enable vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, beam alignment is extremely challenging in mmWave/THz communications due to its narrow beam width and fast mobility of CAV. In this article, we propose a new joint communication and control algorithm for beam alignment, where the mutual positive effect of communications and motion control of CAV on each other is discussed. Specifically, we first provide a framework to show the interaction between motion control of CAV and beam alignment of transmission from base station (BS) to CAV. Then, we analyze the effect of CAV control on beam alignment in communications, where a theorem is obtained to show the closed-form expression of their relationship. Finally, we discuss the CAV control design affected by beam alignment. Simulation results show remarkable performance of the proposed method.

AB Autonomous vehicles require accurate, and fast decision-making perception systems to know the driving environment. The 2D object detection is critical in allowing the perception system to know the environment. However, 2D object detection lacks depth information, which are crucial for understanding the driving environment. Therefore, 3D object detection is essential for the perception system of autonomous vehicles to predict the location of objects and understand the driving environment. The 3D object detection also faces challenges because of scale changes, and occlusions. Therefore in this study, a novel object detection method is presented that fuses the complementary information of 2D and 3D object detection to accurately detect objects in autonomous vehicles. Firstly, the aim is to project the 3D-LiDAR data into image space. Secondly, the regional proposal network (RPN) to produce a region of interest (ROI) is utilised. The ROI pooling network is used to map the ROI into ResNet50 feature extractor to get a feature map of fixed size. To accurately predict the dimensions of all the objects, we fuse the features of the 3D-LiDAR with the regional features obtained from camera images. The fused features from 3D-LiDAR and camera images are employed as input to the faster-region based convolution neural network (Faster-RCNN) network for the detection of objects. The assessment results on the KITTI object detection dataset reveal that the method can accurately predict car, van, truck, pedestrian and cyclist with an average precision of 94.59%, 82.50%, 79.60%, 85.31%, 86.33%, respectively, which is better than most of the previous methods. Moreover, the average processing time of the proposed method is only 70 ms which meets the real-time demand of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the proposed model runs at 15.8 frames per second (FPS), which is faster than state-of-the-art fusion methods for 3D-LiDAR and camera.

AB Context: This scoping review examines the literature as it relates to autonomous vehicles and impact on movement behavior (i.e., physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep) or mode choice (e.g., public transit), beliefs about movement behavior or mode choice, or impact on environments that may influence movement behavior or mode choice.
   Evidence acquisition: A search was conducted in June 2018 and updated in August 2019 of numerous databases (e.g., SPORTDiscuss, PubMed, and Scopus) and hand searching using terms such as autonomous cars and walking. Documents were included if they were databased studies, published in English, and related to the research question. They were then coded by 6 reviewers for characteristics of the document, design, sample, autonomous vehicles, movement behavior, and findings. The coding and analysis were conducted between August 2018 and September 2019.
   Evidence synthesis: Of 1,262 possible studies, 192 remained after a title and abstract scan, and 70 were included after a full-article scan. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe (42%) or North America (40%), involved simulation modeling (50%) or cross-sectional (34%) designs, and were published mostly in transportation (83%) journals or reports. Of the 252 findings, 61% related to movement behavior or mode choice. Though the findings were equivocal in some cases, impacts included decreased demand for active transportation, increased demand for autonomous vehicles, increased sitting and sleeping, and reduced walking.
   Conclusions: Though no experimental or longitudinal studies have been published to date, the available research suggests that autonomous vehicles will impact aspects of mode choice and the built environment of people residing in much of the developed world, resulting in reduced walking and more sitting.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) as a promising application of Internet of Things (IoT) has played a significant role in autonomous driving, by connecting intelligent vehicles. Autonomous driving needs to process the mass environmental sensing data in coordination with surrounding vehicles, and makes an accurate driving judgment accordingly. Since the vehicles always have limited computing resources, processing these data in parallel with efficient task scheduling is one of the most important topics. Most current work focuses on formulating special scenarios and service requirements as optimization problems. However, the complicated and dynamic environment of vehicular computing is hard to model, predict and control, making those previous methods unscalable and unable to reflect the real scenario. In this paper, a Multi-task Deep reinforcement learning approach for scalable parallel Task Scheduling (MDTS) is firstly devised. For avoiding the curse of dimensionality when coping with complex parallel computing environments and jobs with diverse properties, we extend the action selection in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to a multi-task decision, where the output branches of multi- task learning are fine-matched to parallel scheduling tasks. Child tasks of a job are accordingly assigned to distributed nodes without any human knowledge while the resource competition among parallel tasks is leveraged through shared neural network layers. Moreover, we design an appropriate reward function to optimize multiple metrics simultaneously, with emphasis on specific scenarios. Extensive experiments show that the MDTS significantly increases the overall reward compared with least- connection scheduling and particle swarm optimization algorithm from -16.71, -0.67 to 2.93, respectively.

AB This paper presents a formation controller for desired formation of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). We design the controller under the assumptions that the mass and damping matrices are not diagonal and that hydrodynamic damping terms are unknown. Since underactuated AUVs have no independent actuators in the sway direction, stability of the sway dynamics has been proved separately. To solve this problem, we introduce an additional control input and prove the stability using the Lyapunov stability theory. Moreover, unlike previous researches, we propose a new approach angle that requires only position information without using velocity data. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous decision making and motion planning in complex dynamic traffic environments, such as left-turn without traffic signals and multi-lane merging from side-ways, are still challenging tasks for intelligent vehicles. It is difficult to generate optimized behavior decisions while considering the motion capabilities and dynamic properties of intelligent vehicles. Aiming at the above problems, this article proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for autonomous decision making and motion planning in complex dynamic traffic scenarios. The proposed approach consists of two layers. At the higher layer, a kernel-based least-squares policy iteration algorithm with uneven sampling and pooling strategy (USP-KLSPI) is presented for solving the decision-making problems. The motion capabilities of the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles are evaluated with a high-fidelity dynamic model in the decision-making layer. By doing so, the consistency between the decisions generated at the higher layer and the operations in the lower planning layer can be well guaranteed. The lower layer addresses the motion-planning problem in the lateral direction using a dual heuristic programming (DHP) algorithm learned in a batch-mode manner, while the velocity profile in the longitudinal direction is inherited from the higher layer. Extensive simulations are conducted in complex traffic conditions including left-turn without traffic signals and multi-lane merging from side-ways scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in realizing optimized decision making and motion planning in complex environments.

AB Autonomous navigation of agricultural robots and vehicles in agricultural environments is a prerequisite for the accomplishment of various tasks. However, precision navigation of agricultural robots is still a challenging issue due to the complex and unstructured nature of the agricultural environment. With the development of electronics and information technology, machine vision technology has become a promising tool for real-time and accurate navigation of agricultural robots. Due to low hardware cost and rich visual information, machine vision tech-nology has been intensively studied and widely used in the field of autonomous navigation agricultural robots. Aiming at the special complexity of agricultural environment, this paper reviews the research advances of agricultural autonomous vehicle and robot navigation and guidance based on machine vision. A detailed sum-mary of the development and characteristics of various vision sensors and systems is given. Key visual navigation information processing technologies such as filtering-based data computation, segmentation-based data computation and line-detection-based data computation for agricultural robots are discussed. Special attention is paid to the application of vision-based navigation technology for agricultural robots, i.e., environment percep-tion and mapping, robot localization, and path planning. Finally, the challenges of machine vision in agricultural robot navigation are discussed, and the future development of vision sensor technology and autonomous navi-gation technology is prospected.

AB Car-following behavior is a common driving behavior. It is necessary to consider the following vehicle in the car following model of autonomous vehicle (AV) under the background of the vehicle-to-vehicle transportation system. In this study, a safe velocity control method for AV based on reinforcement learning with considering the following vehicle is proposed. First, the mixed driving environment of AVs and human-driven vehicles is constructed, and the trajectories of the leading and following vehicles are extracted from the naturalistic High D driving dataset. Next, the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is used as the velocity control algorithm, in which the agent is AV, the action is acceleration, and the state is the relative distance and relative speed between the AV and the leading and following vehicles. Then, a reward function based on state and corresponding action is designed to guide AV to choose acceleration without collision between the leading and following vehicles. Furthermore, AVs are gradually able to learn to avoid collisions between the leading and following vehicles after training the model. The test result of the trained model shows that the SAC agent can achieve complete collision avoidance, resulting in zero collision. Finally, the driving performance of the SAC agent and that of human driving are compared and analyzed for safety and efficiency. The results of this study are expected to improve the safety of the car-following process..

AB In this paper, a longitudinal control strategy in terms of model predictive control (MPC) and mass estimator is investigated for an autonomous electric vehicle (AEV). A driving force table (DFT) is established to represent the relationship among throttle opening, speed, and driving force. A mass estimator is designed to obtain the actual mass of AEV. An MPC-based controller with constraints is suggested to get the desired acceleration. Moreover, a feedforward controller is developed to calculate the throttle opening directly. Both the iterative feasibility and stability of the MPC are ensured. The experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of our strategy with mass estimator.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); navigation; range-only positioning
AB This paper describes a method for the precise post-processed positioning of a deep-diving autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using only a set of acoustic ranges from a surface ship while the AUV executes a closed path under the ship. This approach avoids the use of either a precisely calibrated (and consequently expensive) ultrashort baseline (USBL), or a long baseline (LBL) system (which is expensive in ship time to deploy). Results of Monte Carlo simulation and field results from the first trials of the Autosub6000 AUV are presented to support the hypothesis that an AUV at 6000-m depth can be positioned to an accuracy commensurate with global positioning system (GPS) quality or better, within a period of 1 h.

AB Antenna positioning is critical to the accuracy of a car's location systems. However, specifying the best placement for an antenna in an autonomous vehicle is challenging due to the signal's non-linear dependency on position and the surrounding material. In this article, we introduce Bayesian Optimization (BO) as a solution to the problem of maximizing gain and minimizing axial ratio in GNSS antenna placement. We also demonstrate in simulations how it converges to the global optima (best antenna position) in 96% less objective function calls when compared to more traditional optimization methods - namely particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm and differential evolution. Finally, we detail the use of BO in conjunction with CST Microwave Studio on a real-world scenario.

AB This paper presents an obstacle avoidance algorithm for low speed autonomous vehicles (AV), with guaranteed safety. A supervisory control algorithm is constructed based on a barrier function method, which works in a plug- and-play fashion with any lower level navigation algorithm. When the risk of collision is low, the barrier function is not active; when the risk is high, based on the distance to an "avoidable set," the barrier function controller will intervene, using a mixed integer program to ensure safety with minimal control effort. This method is applied to solve the navigation and pedestrian avoidance problem of a low speed AV. Its performance is compared with two benchmark algorithms: a potential field method and the Hamilton-Jacobi method.

AB Pothole avoidance may be considered similar to other obstacle avoidance, except that the potholes are depressions rather than extrusions from a surface. This study discusses a solution for detection of potholes in the path of an autonomous vehicle operating in an unstructured environment. Here, a vision approach is used since the simulated potholes are significantly different from the background surface. Furthermore, using this approach, pothole can only be detected in case of uniform lighting conditions. The solution to the problem is developed in a systematic manner. Initially, a specific camera and frame grabber are chosen, then camera is mounted on top of the autonomous vehicle and the images will be acquired. Then, a software solution is designed using MATLAB. The method is tested under real-time conditions and results demonstrate its reasonable efficiency.

AB Depth estimation is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to perceive their surrounding environment. However, the majority of current approaches rely on costly sensors, making wide-scale deployment or integration with present-day transportation difficult. This issue highlights the camera as the most affordable and readily available sensor for AVs. To overcome this limitation, this paper uses monocular depth estimation as a low-cost, data-driven strategy for approximating depth from an RGB image. To achieve low complexity, we approximate the distance of vehicles within the frontal view in two stages: firstly, the YOLOv7 algorithm is utilized to detect vehicles and their front and rear lights; secondly, a nonlinear model maps this detection to the corresponding radial depth information. It is also demonstrated how the attention mechanism can be used to enhance detection precision. Our simulation results show an excellent blend of accuracy and speed, with the mean squared error converging to 0.1. The results of defined distance metrics on the KITTI dataset show that our approach is highly competitive with existing models and outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that only use the detected vehicle's height to determine depth.

AB This paper is concerned with the problem of distributed joint state and sensor fault estimation for autonomous ground vehicles subject to unknown-but-bounded (UBB) external disturbance and measurement noise. In order to improve the estimation reliability and performance in cases of poor data collection and potential communication interruption, a multisensor network configuration is presented to cooperatively measure the vehicular yaw rate, and further compute local state and fault estimates. Toward this aim, an augmented descriptor vehicle model is first established, where the unknown sensor fault is modeled as an auxiliary state of the system model. Then, a new distributed ellipsoidal set-membership estimation approach is developed so as to construct an optimized bounding ellipsoidal set which guarantees to contain the vehicle's true state and the sensor fault at each time step despite the existence of UBB disturbance and measurement noises. Furthermore, a convex optimization algorithm is put forward such that the gain matrix of each distributed estimator can be recursively obtained. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In the paper, a robust controller using the back-stepping approach and the time delay estimation(TDE) is proposed for the trajectory tracking of torpedo-shape autonomous underwater vehicles(AUVs). The AUV has several difficult issues to design accurate tracking control: unsatisfaction of matching condition and highly nonlinear dynamics including external disturbances. To overcome the matching condition issues, the proposed controller is designed based on the back-stepping approach, which is a well-known method handling unmatched disturbances effectively and having well-established design procedure. To estimate nonlinear vehicle dynamics including sea currents and external disturbances, the TDE, an efficient estimation method using previous system information, is adopted. Owing simplicity of the TDE, the proposed controller does not need whole vehicle dynamics while requiring only the determination of control gains. The stability analysis of the proposed controller is studied, conducting the guidelines for selection of control gains. Through the simulation results using REMUS model, it is demonstrated that the proposed controller has accurate and robust tracking performance even when a vehicle moves under sea currents and external disturbing forces.

AB In this article, a robust H infinity observer-based static state-feedback controller is designed for the path following of autonomous ground vehicles. The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy modeling technique is used for modeling of vehicle dynamics with varying longitudinal velocity first. Then considering the high cost of direct lateral velocity measurement, an observer is designed to estimate the value of lateral velocity. Meanwhile, a robust controller is proposed to deal with the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances simultaneously, including the variation of the tire-cornering stiffness of both front and rear tires. Afterward, the condition of designing such an observer-based controller is transformed into the feasible problem of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical simulations using a high-fidelity and full vehicle model are performed based on a Carsim-Simulink joint platform. Simulation results under different conditions and comparison with other controller show that the proposed controller is effective irrespective of the variation in the road condition, the change in the vehicle longitudinal velocity and the external disturbances.

AB Semi-autonomous vehicles equipped with assistive control systems may experience degraded lateral behaviors when aggressive driver steering commands compete with high levels of autonomy. This challenge can be mitigated with effective operator intent recognition, which can configure automated systems in context-specific situations where the driver intends to perform a steering maneuver. In this article, an ensemble learning-based driver intent recognition strategy has been developed. A nonlinear model predictive control algorithm has been designed and implemented to generate haptic feedback for lateral vehicle guidance, assisting the drivers in accomplishing their intended action. To validate the framework, operator-in-the-loop testing with 30 human subjects was conducted on a steer-by-wire platform with a virtual reality driving environment. The roadway scenarios included lane change, obstacle avoidance, intersection turns, and highway exit. The automated system with learning-based driver intent recognition was compared to both the automated system with a finite state machine-based driver intent estimator and the automated system without any driver intent prediction for all driving events. Test results demonstrate that semi-autonomous vehicle performance can be enhanced by up to 74.1% with a learning-based intent predictor. Further, the learning-based model has a 30.9% higher driver intent recognition accuracy than the finite state machine-based method. The holistic framework that integrates human intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and vehicle control can help solve the driver-system conflict problem leading to safer operation.

AB Provision of public transport with autonomous vehicles may enable the implementation of more flexible services, characterised by a reduction of the vehicle's capacity (and increase in the number of vehicles) - leading to fewer stops, better frequencies, and more individualised services (origins and destinations). If public transport provision is centralised, increasing flexibility will lead to reductions in average travel times (although not to the optimal capacity), as the provider internalises congestion costs; however, if public transport is provided in competitive conditions, it may lead to situations in which the entire society ends up worse off, representing a clear transportation paradox.

AB This paper demonstrates that an autonomous vehicle can perform emergency lane changes up to the friction limits through real-time generation and evaluation of bi-elementary paths. Path curvature and friction determine the maximum possible speed along the path and, consequently, the feasibility of the path. This approach incorporates both steering inputs and changes in speed during the maneuver. As a result, varying path parameters and observing the maximum possible entry speed of resulting paths give insight about when and to what extent a vehicle should brake and turn during emergency lane change maneuvers. Tests on an autonomous vehicle validate this approach for lane changes near the limits of friction.

AB This work proposes a real-time implementable control strategy to optimize vehicle speed and transmission gear position simultaneously for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Co-optimization of vehicle speed and transmission gear position has the advantage to maximize the fuel benefits. Drivability is considered during the optimization to satisfy the acceleration requirement and avoid shift busyness. The target vehicle's speed and gear position are controlled intelligently using predicted future traffic conditions based on information enabled by connectivity. The optimal control problem is a hybrid one with both continuous (vehicle speed) and discrete (gear position) control inputs. The problem is formulated and simplified to a mixed-integer programming problem with a convex quadratic objective function and mixed-integer linear constraints. The optimal control solutions are obtained in real time using an efficient numerical solver in the model predictive control (MPC) fashion. Future traffic conditions are anticipated using a traffic prediction method based on a traffic flow model. The traffic prediction method can be applied to scenarios where both connected vehicles and nonconnected vehicles share the road. As a case study, a vehicle platooning scenario on an urban road is evaluated in both simulation and experiment. The target vehicle is at the end of the vehicle platoon and follows the preceding vehicle. The average computational time of the optimization is 0.44 s. By co-optimizing vehicle speed and gear position, the target vehicle can achieve 10.6% fuel benefits compared with the immediate preceding vehicle and 8.9% energy benefits compared with a human-driven vehicle (driven by VISSIM's car-following model). The proposed control strategy can be potentially extended to various CAV applications and traffic scenarios as well.

AB Modeling interactions among vehicles is critical in improving the efficiency and safety of autonomous driving since complex interactions are ubiquitous in many traffic scenarios. To model interactions under different traffic scenarios, most existing works consider interaction information implicitly in their specific tasks with hand-crafted features and predefined maneuvers. Extracting interaction representation, which can be commonly used among different downstream tasks, is not explored. In this article, we propose a general and novel graph self-attention network (GSAN) to learn the spatial-temporal interaction representation among vehicles by a framework consisting of pretraining and fine-tuning. Specifically, in the pretraining step, we construct the GSAN module based on a graph self-attention layer and a gated recurrent unit layer, and use trajectory autoregression to learn the interaction information among vehicles. In the fine-tuning step, we propose two different adaptation schemes to utilize the learned interaction information in various downstream tasks and fine-tune the entire model with only a few steps. To illustrate the effectiveness and generality of our spatial-temporal interaction model, we conduct extensive experiments on two typical interaction-related tasks, namely, lane-changing classification and trajectory prediction. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions of these two tasks. We also visualize the impact of surrounding vehicles on the ego vehicle in different interaction scenes. The visualization offers an intuitive explanation on how our model captures the dynamic changing interactions among vehicles and makes good predictions in various interaction-related tasks.

AB Software updates are highly significant in autonomous vehicles. These updates are utilized to provide enhanced features and updated security mechanisms. In order to ensure scalability and smooth roll-out Over-the-air (OTA) mechanism is a preferred option to propagate a software update. However, this approach is vulnerable to security attacks because of existence of wireless communication channel between the vehicle and the manufacturer. In that, an attacker can replace the legitimate software with a malicious software with an intent to get control over the vehicle. In this work, we are motivated to address this problem. We develop an enhanced uptane framework for detection of malicious OTA soft-ware updates in autonomous vehicles. For enhancing security, we incorporate convolutional neural net-work (CNN) in the uptane framework. The proposed framework is able to distinguish between malicious and benign software executables with high accuracy. For training and testing, we create two datasets by collecting executables of Windows and Linux operating system. We encourage the use of transfer learn-ing by exploiting the developed CNN models in order to detect malicious executable designed for auton-omous vehicles. We also benchmark the CNN models against state-of-the art models. Our work is highly beneficial for the community in providing a secure mechanism for software updates.(c) 2021 The Authors.

AB In this paper, we propose a new free space detection algorithm for autonomous vehicle driving. Previous free space detection algorithms often use only the location information of every frame, without information on the speed of the obstacle. In this case, there is a possibility of creating an inefficient path because the behavior of the obstacle cannot be predicted. In order to compensate for the shortcomings of the previous algorithm, the proposed algorithm uses the speed information of the obstacle. Through object tracking, the dynamic behavior of obstacles around the vehicle is identified and predicted, and free space is detected based on this. In the free space, it is possible to classify an area in which driving is possible and an area in which it is not possible, and a route is created according to the classification result. By comparing and evaluating the path generated by the previous algorithm and the path generated by the proposed algorithm, it is confirmed that the proposed algorithm is more efficient in generating the vehicle driving path.

External forces acting on the vehicle, such as hull and control plane hydrodynamic forces, are determined for the full 360degrees angle of attack range. An accurate through-body thruster model is also incorporated into the simulation. The model is used to simulate two configurations of the C-SCOUT AUV. We use the simulation as a predictive design tool to evaluate and compare the performance of the two configurations before they have been fully developed. Two oceanographic sampling missions are devised to help determine the relative benefits of each configuration. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) envisions the promising technology of future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, the complex road structures and increased vehicles cause traffic congestion and road safety, which eventually leads to horrible accidents. Cooperative driving of AVs, a groundbreaking initiative of vehicle platooning, epitomizes the next wave in vehicular technology through minimizing accident risks, transport times, costs, energy, and fuel consumption. However, the traditional machine learning-based platooning approaches fail to regulate the policy with the dynamic feature of AVs. This paper proposes a hybrid Deep Reinforcement learning and Genetic algorithm for Smart-Platooning (DRG-SP) the AVs. The leverage of the deep reinforcement learning mechanism addresses the computational complexity and accommodates the high dynamic platoon environments. Adopting the Genetic Algorithm in Deep Reinforcement learning overcomes the slow convergence problem and offers long-term performance. The simulation results reveal that the Smart-Platooning effectively forms and maintains the platoons by minimizing traffic congestion and fuel consumption.

AB Although Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will enhance mobility and safety, their impact on congestion is not clear yet. AVs may increase roadway capacity due to their connectivity features. The capacity enhancement highly depends on the AV proportion in traffic. This study models user equilibrium traffic assignment when the link capacity is a function of AV proportion of traffic. The mixed traffic flow of AVs and human-driven vehicles is considered as a multiclass traffic assignment problem. This problem is formulated as a non-linear complementarity problem which is solved to find optimal traffic management policies. We show that simple policies such as AV exclusive links can improve network performance in mixed traffic of AVs and human-driven vehicles. We also show that if these policies are implemented the network performance would be very close to system optimal condition even when users choose their routes selfishly following a user equilibrium. Results of numerical examples for a real size network show that management policies can decrease the gap between user equilibrium and system optimal to less than 1%.

AB Illustrating the associations between built environment characteristics and autonomous vehicle (AV) ownership helps policymakers understand where AVs emerge first and their impacts on society. However, few studies have addressed interest in AV ownership from the spatial perspective. Using regional travel survey data from the Twin Cities, we applied the gradient boosting decision tree method to test three hypotheses (diffusion of innovation, efficiency, and modal substitution) underlying the relationships between respondents' interest in owning AVs and its correlates. Results showed that the innovation-diffusion hypothesis dominates the motivations for owning AVs, followed by preference for efficiency and then modal substitution. However, its associations with built environment variables suggest more of preference for efficiency than of diffusion of innovation and modal substitution. Population density, road connectivity, and land use entropy are negatively associated with the interest. The results provide suggestions to address the externalities of AVs in different areas.

AB This paper presents a robust bounded control that prevents wheel skidding for an autonomous 4WS4WD vehicle under uncertain tire/road conditions with aerodynamic drag. Constraints on combined wheel slip are incorporated, a priori, in design to prevent skidding. A robust low-and-high gain technique is used to suppress the tracking error, and to enhance the utilization of the limited wheel slip. Simulation shows that, under uncertain tire/road conditions, with aerodynamic drag, the proposed control scheme can effectively limit the combined wheel slip, and it achieves the goal of path tracking. Moreover, the control inputs of wheel torque and wheel steering are coordinated well during vehicle cornering.

AB The complex traffic and road environment pose considerable challenges to the accuracy, timeliness, and adaptive ability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in making driving decisions. This paper uses vehicle collaboration and integrates the adaptive learning capabilities of machine learning and the interpretation capabilities of expert systems (ESs) in a unified architecture to form a hybrid autonomous driving guidance system, which not only solves the ``bottleneck'' of knowledge acquisition during the construction of expert systems but also solves the ``black box'' phenomenon of machine learning in the decision-making process. First, an autonomous driving strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed for CAVs to make decisions and extract corresponding rules. Next, we design an ES knowledge base expansion method including rule extraction, rule sharing, and rule test. Particularly, vehicular blockchain is adopted to ensure user privacy and data security during the rule-sharing process. Third, hybrid autonomous driving guidance combining ES and machine learning is proposed for CAVs to make accurate and efficient decisions in different driving environments. Once the strategy is well trained, it can effectively guide CAVs to cope with the complex traffic environment. Extensive simulations validate the performance of our proposal in terms of decision-making accuracy, effectiveness, and safety.

AB Self-propelled micro- and nanoscale robots represent a rapidly emerging and fascinating robotics research area. However, designing autonomous and adaptive control systems for operating micro/nanorobotics in complex and dynamically changing environments, which is a highly demanding feature, is still an unmet challenge. Here we describe a smart microvehicle for precise autonomous navigation in complicated environments and traffic scenarios. The fully autonomous navigation system of the smart microvehicle is composed of a microscope-coupled CCD camera, an artificial intelligence planner, and a magnetic field generator. The microscope-coupled CCD camera provides realtime localization of the chemically powered Janus microsphere vehicle and environmental detection for path planning to generate optimal collision-free routes, while the moving direction of the microrobot toward a reference position is determined by the external electromagnetic torque. Real-time object detection offers adaptive path planning in response to dynamically changing environments. We demonstrate that the autonomous navigation system can guide the vehicle movement in complex patterns, in the presence of dynamically changing obstacles, and in complex biological environments. Such a navigation system for micro/nanoscale vehicles, relying on vision-based close-loop control and path planning, is highly promising for their autonomous operation in complex dynamic settings and unpredictable scenarios expected in a variety of realistic nanoscale scenarios.

AB Over the past several decades, a concerted scientific effort has been made to estimate the drift and spread of spilled oil on the ocean surface. However, tracking spilled oil in open water remains challenging. This research focuses on the problem of autonomous oil spill tracking in oceanic marine environments. We describe a sensor-based guidance, navigation, and control system (GNCS) for oil spill tracking by an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) in unsteady and uncertain environments. First, we describe the design and development of a yacht-shaped ASV that can track spilled oil on the sea surface using data supplied by onboard sensors to control rudder angle and sail area for navigation. Second, we evaluate the performance of a Ultraviolet/fluorometry-based optical sensor for use as an oil detection sensor. Third, we describe an autonomous ASV decision-making algorithm for target speed and direction based on a complete time history of the scanned area around the ASV by the oil detection sensor. Finally, we describe field experiments conducted at the Osaka University pond to validate the performance of the ASV with regard to autonomous oil spill tracking using GNCS based on onboard sensors data for tracking artificial oil targets. This technology has profound implications for oil spill disaster recovery operations.

AB Existing intelligent driving technology often has difficulty balancing smooth driving and fast obstacle avoidance, especially when the vehicle is in a non-structural environment and is prone to instability during emergencies. Therefore, this study proposed an autonomous obstacle avoidance control strategy that can effectively guarantee vehicle stability based on an Attention-long short-term memory (Attention LSTM) deep learning model with the idea of humanoid driving. First, we designed the autonomous obstacle avoidance control rules to guarantee the safety of unmanned vehicles. Second, we improved the autonomous obstacle avoidance control strategy combined with the stability analysis of special vehicles. Third, we constructed a deep learning obstacle avoidance control based on the Attention-LSTM network model through experiments, and the average relative error of this system was 14.95%. Finally, the stability and accuracy of this control strategy were verified numerically and experimentally. The method proposed in this study can ensure that the unmanned vehicle can successfully avoid obstacles while driving smoothly.

AB Faced promising development of autonomous vehicles, the concept Mobility as a Service embraces AVs. The autonomous delivery has also been arising and tested for last-mile solution. Accordingly, passenger transportation and delivery service are to be jointly coordinated in the future MaaS. The research niche is summarized as how to embed crowdsourced parcel delivery into MaaS based on AVs. Electricity powered vehicles are to be applied considering energy consumption and air emission. Research questions are identified as what this novel service is and how it works, especially focusing on task coordination and the related information management. The system engineering process-oriented approaches, matching theory, and numerical method have been applied. The service concept has been elaborated, which contains information system architecture model and functional model. The matching condition of this service is summarized. As the embedded delivery can partially share the demand of traditional delivery service, the calculation scenarios of energy savings and emission decrease per parcel delivery are presented. The results facilitate service planning and development.

ID VISUAL-INERTIAL ODOMETRY; ROBUST; FRAMEWORK; FUSION
AB Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) is subjected to additional unobservable directions under the special motions of ground vehicles, resulting in larger pose estimation errors. To address this problem, a tightly-coupled Ackermann visual-inertial odometry (ACK-MSCKF) is proposed to fuse Ackermann error state measurements and the Stereo Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (S-MSCKF) with a tightly-coupled filter-based mechanism. In contrast with S-MSCKF, in which the inertial measurement unit (IMU) propagates the vehicle motion and then the propagation is corrected by stereo visual measurements, we successively update the propagation with Ackermann error state measurements and visual measurements after the process model and state augmentation. This way, additional constraints from the Ackermann measurements are exploited to improve the pose estimation accuracy. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results evaluated under real-world datasets from an Ackermann steering vehicle lead to the following demonstration: ACK-MSCKF can significantly improve the pose estimation accuracy of S-MSCKF under the special motions of autonomous vehicles, and keep accurate and robust pose estimation available under different vehicle driving cycles and environmental conditions. This paper accompanies the source code for the robotics community.

AB An obstacle avoidance method for use in person following for vision-based autonomous land vehicle (ALV) guidance is proposed. This method is based on the use of vehicle location estimation and a quadratic pattern classifier, and aims to guide the ALV to follow a walking person in front by navigating along a derived collision-free path. Before generating the collision-free path, the person's location is obtained from extracted objects in the image by a person detection method. The object closest to a predicted person location is regarded as the followed person and the remaining objects are regarded as obstacles. The collision-free navigation path is designed for ALV guidance in such a way that the ALV not only can keep following the person but also can avoid collision with nearby obstacles. The navigation path results from a quadratic classifier that uses the vehicle and all of the objects in the image as input patterns. A turn angle is then computed to drive the ALV to follow the navigation path. Successful navigation sessions confirm the feasibility of the approach.

   polynomial; multiple road types; lane selection
AB This paper combines A* algorithm and quintic polynomial to propose a novel hybrid trajectory planning method that can be used on both structured and unstructured roads for autonomous vehicle. The architecture of our approach can be generally divided into two layers. In the upper level, an improved A* algorithm is adopted to search for a feasible path as a reference based on the indication of global path, static and dynamic obstacles, road conditions and traffic rules. Particularly, relating to the road type, the evaluation functions are appropriately selected. According to this reference path, the relative position of the vehicle to the obstacles is evaluated. Hence, the target vehicle velocity and related position can be determined, and the desired velocity curve is then generated by a cubic polynomial. In the lower level, a segmented quintic polynomial is utilized for smooth the trajectory. Finally, the proposed method has been validated via Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) and real-vehicle tests. The experimental results show that it can not only ensure a safe, curvature-continuous and kinodynamically feasible trajectory planning, but also own good adaptability to complex scenarios.

AB The diffusion of autonomous vehicles (AVs) will expand the tools to manage congestion. Differently than fleets of traditional vehicles, operators of fleets of AVs will be able to assign different travelers to different routes, potentially inducing different congestion levels (and speed). We look at the effects of the technological transition from traditional to autonomous vehicles. Our model exhibits a unit mass of heterogeneous individuals. Some of them use the services of a fleet, while others do not, and travel independently. With few fleet users, the fleet technology (traditional vs automated vehicles) is immaterial to welfare. On the contrary, when there are many fleet users, we show that, if fleets do not price any individuals out of the market, the differentiation in congestion across routes under the automated fleet is welfare-reducing. When, instead, fleets price some individuals out of the market, the welfare effects of the transition are ambiguous and depend on the interplay between the extent of rationing by both types of fleets and the extent of differentiation by the AVs fleet. Finally, we characterize the tax restoring the first best with AVs. It involves charging different taxes across lanes, starkly different between independent travelers and the fleet. While independent travelers should be charged lane-specific congestion charges, the fleet should be imposed a scheme involving a congestion-based tax and a subsidy.

AB Multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are a potential alternative to conventional large manned vessels for mine countermeasure (MCM) operations. Online mission planning for cooperative multi-AUV network often rely on predefined contingencies of reactive methods and does not deliver an optimal end-goal performance. Markov decision process is a decision-making framework that allows an optimal solution, taking into account future decision estimates, rather than having a myopic view. However, most real-world problems are too complex to be represented by this framework. The authors deal with the complexity problem by abstracting the MCM scenario with a reduced state and action space, yet retaining the information that defines the goal and constraints coming from the application. Another critical part of the model is the ability of the vehicles to communicate and enable a cooperative mission. They use the rendezvous point (RP) method. The RP method schedules meeting points for the vehicles throughout the mission. The authors' model provides an optimal action selection solution for the multi-AUV MCM problem. The computation of the mission plan is performed in the order of minutes. This quick execution demonstrates the model is feasible for real-time applications.

AB In order to improve the trajectory tracking accuracy and vehicle lateral stability, the paper proposes a lateral and longitudinal dynamics control framework of autonomous vehicles considering multi-parameter joint estimation. First, the multi-parameter joint estimation based on adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) is constructed to decouple and estimate the longitudinal position of vehicle's center of gravity (CG), tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC), tire cornering stiffness (TCS), tire vertical force (TVF) and road grade. Then, focusing on the large lateral acceleration condition, a lateral control based on the optimal front-tire lateral force is proposed by constructing the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and combining the multi-parameter joint estimation. Additionally, a longitudinal control based on the drive and brake force compensation to realize the accurate speed tracking by combining road slop estimation is achieved. The fuzzy system employs the drive and brake force deviation as the input to implement the compensation of the throttle and brake. The proposed estimation and control framework are verified by co-simulation on PreScan and CarSim preliminarily. In order to further verify the effectiveness and practicability of algorithm, experiments are implemented on an autonomous vehicle platform, a hybrid Lincoln MKZ. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed estimation and control framework possess excellent performance and enhance the tracking accuracy and lateral stability.

AB This paper provides a systematic review of studies that model future autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban mobility and logistics using an agent-based model (ABM). Eighty relevant papers published between 2015-2020 are included. This review evaluates the quality of each model through the newly developed AAODD (Autonomous vehicle Agent-based Overview, Design concepts and Details) protocol in four perspectives: model transparency, research questions, network + agent behaviour and model execution. Then, similarities and particularities of the papers are summarised based on whether AVs are used for passenger mobility or for freight logistics.
   The reviewed mobility papers exhibit the ABMs' applicability and flexibility for studying different AV operational patterns. We summarise the respective modelling specifications in research questions, data collections, model platforms, model executions, and scenario variations. Overall, by combining AVs with different technical possibilities and operational strategies, the simulation results illustrate that AVs would bring vast benefits to urban mobility networks.
   Unlike AVs' usage in passenger mobility, it is still unclear how AVs will serve future urban logistics demands. Many operational patterns, including unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous robots, autonomous trucks, and autonomous cargo-hatching vehicles coexist in the research community. The number of relevant papers remains low due to the early stage of AV technology deployment. However, ABMs also prove their applicability for analysing the macro and mesoscopic impacts of freight AV transportation on urban network. The reviewed papers suggest that implementing AVs for urban logistics is more efficient and environmentally friendly than conventional delivery vehicles.
   Overall, ABMs are a powerful tool for simulating future urban scenarios with AVs. By calculating the average score of reviewed papers obtained via AAODD annually, we find that studies simulating AV systems in ABMs are getting more complex by combing diverse technological possibilities, supporting the simulation of more realistic future scenarios. The outcomes of reviewed ABM research reveals that AVs are a promising solution for solving current urban transport problems. Lastly, as nearly all current reviewed studies focus on AVs' usages in either mobility or logistics, research on an integrated simulation that combines AVs for both purposes has been scarcely addressed. We discuss its necessities, possibilities, and opportunities in this paper, to steer future research in this direction.

AB Assuring the safety of all road users, including non-motorized vehicles, is important in the autonomous driving environment. Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems have provided an effective way for automated vehicles to avoid collisions with the less easily detectable non-motorized vehicles. Automatic preventive braking (APB) is a new method proposed by Mobileye that promises to reduce crashes without reducing traffic throughput, but APB's effectiveness has not yet been evaluated. This study therefore calibrates and compares the performance of APB with that of one-stage and three-stage AEB braking systems in safety-critical events (SCEs) between motorized and non-motorized vehicles, using SCEs extracted from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study and simulated in MATLAB's Simulink. The evaluation results, which consider both safety and conservativeness, show that 1) one-stage AEB with a deceleration of 5.5,m/s(2) and a time-to-collision threshold of 1.6 seconds can prevent all SCEs from becoming crashes; 2) APB has the best driving stability but its safety performance is inferior to that of the two AEB systems; 3) APB's deceleration process is easily affected by its pre-defined parameters and changing kinetic parameters, which may be one cause of its crashes; 4) AEB's time-triggered braking process is more consistent and reliable than APB's distance-triggered process.

AB A comprehensive assessment of connected and automated driving is imperative before its large-scale deployment in reality, which can be economically and effectively implemented via a credible simulation platform. Nonetheless, the key components of traffic dynamics, vehicle modeling, and traffic environment are oversimplified in existing simulators. Current traffic simulators normally simplify the function of connected and autonomous vehicles by proposing incremental improvements to the conventional traffic flow modeling methods, which cannot reflect the characteristics of the realistic connected and autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, typical autonomous vehicle simulators only focus on individual function verification in some specific traffic scenarios, omitting the network-level evaluation by integrating both large-scale traffic networks and vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication. This paper designs a comprehensive simulation platform for conventional, connected and automated driving from a transportation cyber-physical system perspective, which tightly combines the core components of V2X communication, traffic networks, and autonomous/conventional vehicle model. Specifically, three popular open-source simulators SUMO, Omnet++, and Webots are integrated and connected via the traffic control interface, and the whole simulation platform will be deployed in a Client/Server model. As the demonstration, two typical applications, traffic flow optimization and vehicle eco-driving, are implemented in the simulation platform. The proposed platform provides an ideal and credible testbed to explore the potential social/economic impact of connected and automated driving from the individual level to the large-scale network level.

AB Obstacle avoidance problem for the autonomous vehicle has received more and more attention these years, especially for the autonomous heavy vehicle, which has the high gravity center, large carrying capacity and promising commercial prospect. However, the vehicle dynamic properties have been rarely considered for path planning, which is a crucial factor for driving safety. An integrated collision avoidance framework that consists of a new path planner and a tracking controller considering multiple dynamic constraints is proposed for an autonomous multi-axis distributed vehicle. In the upper level, a new optimal path generator based on the B-splines is designed for safety and stability purposes, and the collision avoidance path is optimized considering multiple dynamic constraints, including the tire nonlinear dynamic, lateral stability limits and the anti-slip constraints. Meanwhile, a safety assessment evaluator according to the time to collision calculation is designed for risk level recognition and path planning weight determination. In the lower level, a path tracking controller based on the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is designed to improve the control accuracy, and a high-fidelity nonlinear dynamic predictive vehicle model with 16 degrees of freedom is established to depict the vehicle dynamic properties comprehensively. To solve the nonlinear optimization problem and get the optimal control steering angle output, an adaptive weight adjustment strategy and a varying predictive duration method are formulated. The optimization constraints related to steering actuator ability, plane stability limits, rollover prevention thresholds and tire adhesion requirements are constructed and converted as the bounds of the vehicle dynamic states. To verify the proposed framework, the simulation and HIL test platform are built and different driving scenarios are validated. The test results show the satisfactory performance of path planning and path tracking considering the dynamic constraints for safety and stability.

AB This paper introduces a cellular automaton design for single lane highway sections with a reduced time step length of 0.1 s. It is able to model automated and human vehicle agents in heterogeneous as well as homogeneous traffic. Furthermore, it allows agents to adopt different behaviour patterns depending on whether they follow automated or human vehicle agents. A distinction between communicating and non-communicating automated vehicles is also possible. Simulations showed that autonomous vehicles are expected to increase road capacity, reduce the frequency and lifetime of traffic jams, and improve traffic synchronisation. Homogeneous communicating automated vehicles traffic can increase the capacity up to about 480% compared to conventional traffic. Furthermore, potential problems with the human-robot interaction that could result in accidents were identified and removed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Exiting from highways in crowded dynamic traffic is an important path planning task for autonomous vehicles (AVs). This task can be challenging because of the uncertain motion of surrounding vehicles and limited sensing/observing window. Conventional path planning methods usually compute a mandatory lane change (MLC) command, but the lane change behavior (e.g., vehicle speed and gap acceptance) should also adapt to traffic conditions and the urgency for exiting. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-enhanced highway-exit planner. The learning-based strategy learns from past failures and adjusts the vehicle motion when the AV fails to exit. The reinforcement learning is based on the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) approach. The proposed learning-enhanced highway-exit planner is tested 6000 times in stochastic simulations. The results indicate that the proposed planner achieves a higher probability of successful highway exiting than a benchmark MLC planner.

AB Several situations in a microgrid (MG) cause unbalances leading to voltage and frequency variations. Conventionally MG power balance is ensured by storage battery units along with unscheduled load shedding. This paper presents control and management strategies to coordinate MG resources including generation, smart electric vehicles, and loads for frequency and voltage regulation to achieve optimal autonomous operation. MG control is designed in two layers of network, i.e., neighbour area network (NAN) and house area network (HAN). MG central controller operates at NAN layer, local load controllers operate at HAN layer, and smart electric vehicle controllers operate at both NAN and HAN layers. Two strategies-comprehensive control (CC) and vehicle aided CC-are developed and implemented in 11/0.4 kV urban residential four-feeder distribution system operating as MG. Both strategies enable calculative load manipulation for demand response (DR) considering customer load priority, thus maximizing customer satisfaction. The simulation results validate the proposed strategies providing frequency regulation and DR for MG autonomous operation. The proposed control and management strategy also provides an online tool for household maximum demand allocation and load management.

SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID OCEANIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; LEADS; WINTER
AB The authors show that vertical turbulent fluxes in the upper ocean can be measured directly with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). A horizontal profile of vertical water velocity is obtained by applying a Kalman smoother to AUV motion data. The smoother uses a linearized model for vehicle motion and vehicle data such as depth, pitch, and pitch rate to produce an optimal estimate of the state of the system, which includes other vehicle variables and the vertical water velocity. Vertical water velocity estimated by applying the smoother to data from the autonomous microconductivity temperature vehicle (AMTV) is accurate at horizontal scales from three to several hundred meters, encompassing the energy-containing scales of most oceanic turbulence. The zero-lag covariances between vertical water velocity and concurrent measurements of temperature or salinity represent the heat and salt fluxes, respectively. The authors have measured horizontal profiles of turbulent fluxes with two different AUVs in three separate polar ocean experiments using this technique. Flux magnitudes and directions are reasonable and in general agreement with fixed turbulence sensors. With this technique, one can gather boundary layer data in inaccessible regions without disturbing or affecting the surface.

AB This paper presents a novel vehicular environment identification approach based on deep learning. It consists of exploiting the vehicular wireless channel characteristics in the form of Channel State Information (CSI) in the receiver side of a connected vehicle in order to identify the environment type in which the vehicle is driving, without any need to implement specific sensors such as cameras or radars. We consider environment identification as a classification problem, and propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to deal with it. The estimated CSI is used as the input feature to train the model. To perform the identification process, the model is targeted for implementation in an autonomous vehicle connected to a vehicular network (VN). The proposed model is extensively evaluated, showing that it can reliably recognize the surrounding environment with high accuracy (96.48%). Our model is compared to related approaches and state-of-the-art classification architectures. The experiments show that our proposed model yields favorable performance compared to all other considered methods.

AB The future of intelligent transportation system (ITS) is expected to be composed of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the development of which will have great impact on peoples everyday life. Unfortunately, this progress will be accompanied by all kinds of potential threats and attacks rising in CAV network. As a legacy from traditional wireless networks, jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. In this paper, we investigate the anti-jamming V2V communication in CAV networks through power control in conjunction with channel selection. Bringing into play a brain-inspired research tool called cognitive dynamic system (CDS), the general structure of cognitive risk control (CRC) is well-tailored to analyze and address the jamming problem. Specifically, power control is carried out first using reinforcement learning, the result of which is then examined by a module called task-switch control. Based on the risk assessment, a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is formulated to perform the channel-selection process when necessary. Through continuous perception-action cycles (PACs), the feature of predictive adaptation is realized for the legitimate vehicle in its behavioral interactions with the jammer. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has desirable performance in terms of several evaluation metrics.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING
AB In order to efficiently and exactly in tracking the desired path points, autonomous cleaning vehicles have to adapt their own behavior according to the perceived environmental information. This paper proposes a target points tracking control algorithm based on the Long Short-Term Memory network, which can generate the speed and yaw rate to arrive at the target point in real time. The target point is obtained by a parameter named foresight distance that is deduced based on the fuzzy control, whose inputs are the speed and yaw rate of the vehicle at the current point. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by the simulation and field experiments. Compared with other classical algorithms, this algorithm can track the point sequence on straight path and multiple curvature path more accurately. The field experiment indicates the proposed controller is efficient in following the pre-defined path points, furthermore, it can make the autonomous cleaning vehicle run smoothly in the path which is disturbed by bounded disturbances. The distance errors can meet the actual requirement of the cleaning vehicle during the tracking process.

AB Roundabouts are a highway engineering concept meant to reduce congestion and improve safety. However, experience shows that capacity of roundabouts is limited, and safety is not optimal. However, these improvements in capacity and safety should be compatible with both manually-driven and autonomous vehicles. Incorporating existing advanced technologies to the signaling and control of roundabouts will undoubtedly contribute to these improvements but should not restrict this compatibility. We approach roundabouts as synchronous switches of vehicles, and propose a roundabout system (synchronous roundabouts with rotating priorities) based on vehicle platoons arriving at the roundabout at a uniform speed and within the time slot assigned to their entry, avoiding conflicts and stops. The proposed signaling system is visual for human drivers and wireless for connected and autonomous vehicles. We evaluated analytically and with simulations roundabouts of different radii for several values of the average distance between vehicles. Results show that average delays are 28.7% lower, with negligible dispersion. The capacity improvements depend on design parameters, moderate for small roundabouts, but that goes up to 70-100% for short inter vehicular distances and medium and large roundabouts. Simulations with unbalanced traffic maintained the capacity improvement over standard roundabouts.

   pipeline corrosion inspection
AB Underwater robotics and imaging have emerged as an attractive field due to complications for human divers in a deepwater environment. Inspection of various installations in an underwater environment is carried out by underwater vehicles. The equipment that is used at present requires high computational cost and dedicated only to single task. This results in an expensive hardware and application-oriented technology, hence restricting the versatility of the underwater vehicle. This article proposes a visual feedback-based heading control and tracking method for the autonomous underwater vehicle to provide a versatile solution. The proposed method is used for subsea pipeline corrosion inspection subjected to hydrodynamic disturbances. There are two parts of this study: the first part includes the heading control of the underwater vehicle using visual feedback to follow the pipeline, whereas the second part involves underwater image enhancement and dehazing using wavelet-based fusion for corrosion estimation. The visual feedback and corrosion estimation rely on the same image data during the inspection of the pipeline, hence, reducing the complexity of the overall algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on image dataset acquired in an underwater environment where the camera is mounted on the underwater vehicle.

AB In this paper, two heuristic optimization techniques are tested and compared in the application of motion planning for autonomous agricultural vehicles: Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. Several preliminary experimentations are performed for both algorithms, so that the best neighborhood definitions and algorithm parameters are found. Then, the two tuned algorithms are run extensively, but for no more than 2000 cost function evaluations, as run-time is the critical factor for this application. The comparison of the two algorithms showed that the Simulated Annealing algorithm achieves the better performance and outperforms the Genetic Algorithm. The final optimum found by the Simulated Annealing algorithm is considered to be satisfactory for the specific motion planning application.

AB The use of unmanned autonomous sailing craft for sustained oceanographic observations could result in sea surface measurements that have higher spatial and temporal resolution that contemporary methods such as Lagrangian floats, moored buoys manned expeditions and satellite observations. Mission-specific autonomous sailing platforms could provide energetically sustainable mission-specific systems to forecast environmental events and to trace the distribution of meteorological and ocean conditions over a long-term period. This paper briefly discusses the motivation for using wind-powered unmanned autonomous vehicles for oceanographic/meteorological measurements, comments on significant historical considerations, outline some current and past work introduces aspects of such a vehicle developed at Florida Atlantic University and concludes by presenting policy issues and recommendations for future work.

AB In this paper, the low-level velocity controller of an autonomous vehicle is studied. The performance of the traditional controller used in this kind of system, a PID, is analyzed. This kind of controller cannot follow ramp references without error, so when the reference implies a change in the speed, the vehicle cannot follow the proposed reference, and there is a significant difference between the actual and desired vehicle behaviors. A fractional controller is proposed which changes the ordinary dynamics allowing faster responses for small times, at the cost of slower responses for large times. The idea is to take advantage of this fact to follow fast setpoint changes with a smaller error than that obtained with a classic non-fractional PI controller. Using this controller, the vehicle can follow variable speed references with zero stationary error, significantly reducing the difference between reference and actual vehicle behavior. The paper presents the fractional controller, studies its stability in function of the fractional parameters, designs the controller, and tests its stability. The designed controller is tested on a real prototype, and its behavior is compared to a standard PID controller. The designed fractional PID controller overcomes the results of the standard PID controller.

AB Verifying the safety of autonomous vehicles is one of the major challenges towards their deployment on public roads due to the vast number of possible situations that can occur in traffic. Scenario-based testing has been proposed to reduce the number of required tests using catalogs of abstractly defined scenarios. However, when specifying test scenarios abstractly, there is still an infinite number of possible concrete scenarios that can be derived from a specification. Available computational resources can thus be easily exceeded when using inefficient strategies for deriving concrete scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel method that synthesizes concrete scenarios complying with abstract scenario specifications. We compute the set of compliant trajectories for surrounding traffic participants and only sample trajectories within those sets. Our synthesis integrates a falsification algorithm that searches for specified failures of the vehicle under test. Compared to existing work, we can efficiently find scenario concretizations, especially for complex maneuver specifications. By directly considering failure specifications during the scenario synthesis, we avoid executing irrelevant simulations that cannot possibly result in failures. Our approach is demonstrated in several scenarios using Monte Carlo tree search as a search algorithm.

AB This paper presents a real-time motion planning approach for autonomous vehicles with complex dynamics and state uncertainty. The approach is motivated by the motion planning problem for autonomous vehicles navigating in GPS-denied dynamic environments, which involves non-linear and/or non-holonomic vehicle dynamics, incomplete state estimates, and constraints imposed by uncertain and cluttered environments. To address the above motion planning problem, we propose an extension of the closed-loop rapid belief trees, the closed-loop random belief trees (CL-RBT), which incorporates predictions of the position estimation uncertainty, using a factored form of the covariance provided by the Kalman filter-based estimator. The proposed motion planner operates by incrementally constructing a tree of dynamically feasible trajectories using the closed-loop prediction, while selecting candidate paths with low uncertainty using efficient covariance update and propagation. The algorithm can operate in real-time, continuously providing the controller with feasible paths for execution, enabling the vehicle to account for dynamic and uncertain environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate feasible trajectories that reduce the state estimation uncertainty, while handling complex vehicle dynamics and environment constraints.

AB Providing pedestrians and other vulnerable road users with a clear indication about a fully autonomous vehicle status and intentions is crucial to make them coexist. In the last few years, a variety of external interfaces have been proposed, leveraging different paradigms and technologies including vehicle-mounted devices (like LED panels), short-range on-road projections, and road infrastructure interfaces (e.g., special asphalts with embedded displays). These designs were experimented in different settings, using mockups, specially prepared vehicles, or virtual environments, with heterogeneous evaluation metrics. Promising interfaces based on Augmented Reality (AR) have been proposed too, but their usability and effectiveness have not been tested yet. This paper aims to complement such body of literature by presenting a comparison of state-of-the-art interfaces and new designs under common conditions. To this aim, an immersive Virtual Reality-based simulation was developed, recreating a well-known scenario represented by pedestrians crossing in urban environments under non-regulated conditions. A user study was then performed to investigate the various dimensions of vehicle-to-pedestrian interaction leveraging objective and subjective metrics. Even though no interface clearly stood out over all the considered dimensions, one of the AR designs achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of safety and trust, at the cost of higher cognitive effort and lower intuitiveness compared to LED panels showing anthropomorphic features. Together with rankings on the various dimensions, indications about advantages and drawbacks of the various alternatives that emerged from this study could provide important information for next developments in the field.

AB Efficient trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles in complex traffic scenarios is of interest both academically and in automotive industry. Time efficiency and safety are of key importance and here a two-step procedure is proposed. First, a convex optimization problem is solved, formulated as a support vector machine (SVM), in order to represent the surrounding environment of the ego vehicle and classify the search space as obstacles or obstacle free. This gives a reduced complexity search space and an A* algorithm is used in a state space lattice in 4 dimensions including position, heading angle and velocity for simultaneous path and velocity planning. Further, a heuristic derived from the SVM formulation is used in the A* search and a pruning technique is introduced to significantly improve search efficiency. Solutions from the proposed planner is compared to optimal solutions computed using optimal control techniques. Three traffic scenarios, a roundabout scenario and two complex takeover maneuvers, with multiple moving obstacles, are used to illustrate the general applicability of the proposed method.

AB Driving requires' forecasts. Forecasted movements of objects in the driving scene are uncertain. Inevitably, decision and control algorithms for autonomous driving need to cope with such uncertain forecasts. In assisted driving, the uncertainty in the human/vehicle interaction further increases the complexity of the control design task.
   Our research over the past ten years has focused on control design methods which systematically handle uncertain forecasts for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. This paper presents an overview of our findings and discusses relevant aspects of our recent results. (c) 2015 European Control Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the Dial-a-Ride-Problem (DARP) a fleet of vehicles provides shared-ride services to users specifying their origin, destination, and preferred arrival time. Typically, the problem consists of finding minimum cost routes, satisfying operational constraints such as time windows, origin-destination precedences, user maximum ride-times, and vehicle maximum route-durations. This paper presents a problem variant for the DARP which considers the use of electric autonomous vehicles (e-ADARP). The problem covers battery management, detours to charging stations, recharge times, and selection of destination depots, along with classic DARP features. The goal of the problem is to minimize a weighted objective function consisting of the total travel time of all vehicles and excess ride-time of the users. We formulate the problem as a 3-index and a 2-index mixed-integer-linear program and devise a branch-and-cut algorithm with new valid inequalities derived from e-ADARP properties. Computational experiments are performed on adapted benchmark instances from DARP literature and on instances based on real data from Uber Technologies Inc. Instances with up to 5 vehicles and 40 requests are solved to optimality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs), the integration of car-sharing, autonomous technology, and electrification, are anticipated to be the popular choice for future urban travel, offering more flexible demand-responsive services than traditional shared mobility. This study develops a mixed-integer linear model to optimize the SAEVs service, where the electric vehicles (EVs) are powered by the battery swapping stations (BSSs). The innovation of the model is the speed optimization on the travel arc while optimizing the service routes of the SAEVs fleet. A minimized weighted objective containing the total travel distance, the total travel time and the total energy consumption is considered. An adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm embedded in the speed optimization subroutine is designed to find the optimal solution. The good computational performance of ALNS is demonstrated through numerical comparisons to the solutions found by CPLEX and the best-known solutions of the similar dial-a-ride problem (DARP). The adapted set of instances was employed in the comparative experiment, from which the benefits of speed optimization for saving the objectives are obtained. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the minimum battery level, battery capacity, and the weight of energy consumption in the objective. The results provide SAEVs operators with alternative cost-saving solutions. Larger capacity batteries and lower minimum battery levels help reduce the travel distance, while smaller capacity batteries and feasible lower speeds help to save energy consumption.

AB The method of Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) is extended to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that are modeled as controlled particles. Controlled LPT (CLPT) evaluates the performance of ocean models used for the navigation of AUVs by computing the differences between predicted vehicle trajectories and actual vehicle trajectories. Such difference, measured by the controlled Lagrangian prediction error (CLPE), demonstrates growth rate that is influenced by the accuracy of the ocean model and the strength of the feedback control laws used for vehicle navigation. Despite the limited accuracy and resolution of the ocean model, the error growth can be bounded by feedback control when localization service is available, which is a unique property of CLPT. Theoretical relationship among CLPE growth rate, quality of ocean models, and feedback control are established for two control strategies: a transect-following controller and a station-keeping controller that are often used by AUVs. Upper bounds for error growth are derived and verified by both simulation and experimental data collected during the operations of underwater gliders in coastal ocean.

ID TRACKING
AB A Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for trajectory tracking with the obstacle avoidance of autonomous road vehicles traveling at realistic speeds is presented in this paper, with a focus on the performance of those controllers with respect to the look-ahead horizon of the NMPC. Two different methods of obstacle avoidance are compared and then the NMPC is tested in several simulated but realistic tracking scenarios involving static obstacles on constrained roadways. In order to simplify the vehicle dynamics, a bicycle model is used for the prediction of future vehicle states in the NMPC framework. However, a high-fidelity, nonlinear CarSim vehicle model is used to evaluate the vehicle performance and test the controllers in the simulation results. The CPU time is also analyzed to evaluate these schemes for real-time applications. The results show that the NMPC controller provides satisfactory online tracking performance in a realistic scenario at normal road speeds while still satisfying the real-time constraints. In addition, it is shown that the longer prediction horizons allow for better responses of the controllers, which reduce the deviations while avoiding the obstacles, as compared with shorter horizons.

AB The success of Electronic Stability Control (ESC) has demonstrated the potential life-saving benefits of vehicle control systems. Lanekeeping presents an obvious next step in vehicle control, but the performance of such systems must be guaranteed before lanekeeping can be viewed as a safety feature. This paper demonstrates that simple lookahead control schemes for lanekeeping are provably robust even at the limits of tire adhesion. By responding to the heading error relative to the desired path, these schemes provide the countersteer behavior necessary to compensate for rear tire saturation and stabilize the vehicle. Using a Lyapunov-based analysis, vehicle stability can be proven even with a highly saturated tire. Taking this a step further by developing a desired path based on the racing line, this lookahead controller can be coupled with longitudinal control based on path position and wheel slip to create an autonomous racecar. The performance of this algorithm shows the potential for lanekeeping control that can truly assist even the best drivers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles enables lower risk path planning in advance for autonomous vehicles, thus promising the safety of automated driving. A low-risk and high-efficiency path planning approach is proposed for autonomous driving based on the high-performance and practical trajectory prediction method. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is trained and tested using the highD dataset, and the validated LSTM is used to predict the trajectories of surrounding vehicles combining the information extracted from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology. A risk assessment and mitigation-based local path planning algorithm is proposed according to the information of predicted trajectories of surrounding vehicles. Two driving scenarios are extracted and reconstructed from the highD dataset for validation and evaluation, i.e., an active lane-change scenario and a longitudinal collision-avoidance scenario. The results illustrate that the risk is mitigated and the driving efficiency is improved with the proposed path planning algorithm comparing to the constant-velocity prediction and the prediction method of the nonlinear input-output (NIO) network, especially when the velocity and trajectory with sudden changes.

AB GPS spoofing attacks pose great challenges to connected vehicle (CVs) safety applications and localization of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we propose to utilize transportation and vehicle engineering domain knowledge to detect GPS spoofing attacks towards CVs and AVs. A novel detection method using learning from demonstration is developed, which can be implemented in both vehicles and at the transportation infrastructure. A computational-efficient driving model, which can be learned from historical trajectories of the vehicles, is constructed to predict normal driving behaviors. Then a statistical method is developed to measure the dissimilarities between the observed trajectory and the predicted normal trajectory for anomaly detection. We validate the proposed method using two threat models (i.e., attacks targeting the multi-sensor fusion system of AVs and attacks targeting the intersection movement assist application of CVs) on two real-world datasets (i.e., KAIST and Michigan roundabout dataset). Results show that the proposed model is able to detect almost all of the attacks in time with low false positive and false negative rates.

AB This paper proposes a path-following controller and a torque allocation strategy for a four-wheel-independent-drive (FWID) electric autonomous ground vehicle (EAGV) on the slope roads. To improve the realtime accuracy of the controller, a model-predictive-control (MPC) controller with a linear-parameter-varying (LPV) model is proposed to maintain the vehicle dynamic stability and follow the given path for the EAGV. By updating the parameters of the states, the proposed controller can minimize the effects of the unequal normal tire forces and the gravity components of the vehicle on the slope road. As a result, the desired trajectory of the lateral position, longitudinal position, yaw angle, and velocity can be tracked by controlling the front-wheel-steering angle and the driving torque of each wheel. Finally, the high-fidelity simulations have been implemented on the CarSim-Matlab platform, and the results show that the proposed LPV-MPC controller with the torque allocation strategy is effective to achieve the control targets.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to teach a vehicle how to drift, in a similar manner that professional drivers do. Specifically, a hybrid structure formed by a Model Predictive Controller and feedforward Neural Networks is employed for this purpose. The novelty of this work lies in a) the adoption of a data-based approach to achieve autonomous drifting along a wide range of road radii and body slip angles, and b) in the implementation of a road terrain classifier to adjust the system actuation depending on the current friction characteristics. The presented drift control system is implemented in a multi-actuated ground vehicle equipped with active front steering and in-wheel electric motors and trained to drift by a real test driver using a driver-in-the-loop setup. Its performance is verified in the simulation environment IPG-CarMaker through different open loop and path following drifting manoeuvres. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper a local trajectory planner is described and applied. This planner works in three dimensional environment populated with static and passive movable obstacles. The main contribution of this paper is a proposal of a new method of autonomous navigation. Novelty of this approach relies on splitting the motion planning problem into two stages: a decision mode and a trace mode. In the decision mode, vehicle selects its current direction of motion on the basis of the current value of a performance index. In the trace mode vehicle traces boundary and edges of obstacles using its on-board sensors. Depending on vehicle's environment, the two modes follow one another many times. Another new idea is a negative velocity feedback. The feedback stabilizes velocity of the vehicle around a value considered safe in a given environment. The planner, although autonomous, may be adjusted by higher order system (strategic behavior) by changing its parameters. It is not computationally intensive and therefore can be used in real-time applications.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; FUEL-ECONOMY; ALGORITHMS
AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the ability to use information obtained via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, and sensors to improve their fuel economy through predictive strategies, including velocity trajectory optimization and optimal traffic light arrival and departure. These powertrain control strategies operate on a slow timescale relative to the engine dynamics; hence, assume that the engine torque production is instantaneous. This assumption results in a torque command profile that may lead to engine dynamics constraint violation, actuator saturation, poor tracking performance, decreased efficiency, poor drivability, and increased emissions. To address this issue, a supplemental controller based on an iterative hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) is proposed in this paper. The constraint satisfaction is achieved through a novel two-way communication of the Lagrange multipliers. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on an autonomous diesel semitruck on two maneuvers. Compared to a traditional centralized approach, the proposed method achieves systematic constraints' satisfaction with negligible effect on fuel economy, less than 1%, and significantly improved computation time, more than ten times.

AB In this paper we present a queuing network approach to the problem of routing and rebalancing a fleet of self-driving vehicles providing on-demand mobility within a capacitated road network. We refer to such systems as autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. We first cast an AMoD system into a closed, multi-class Baskett-Chandy-Muntz-Palacios (BCMP) queuing network model capable of capturing the passenger arrival process, traffic, the state-of-charge of electric vehicles, and the availability of vehicles at the stations. Second, we propose a scalable method for the synthesis of routing and charging policies, with performance guarantees in the limit of large fleet sizes. Third, we explore the applicability of our theoretical results on a case study of Manhattan. Collectively, this paper provides a unifying framework for the analysis and control of AMoD systems, which provides a large set of modeling options (e.g. the inclusion of road capacities and charging constraints), and subsumes earlier Jackson and network flow models.

DT Article
DE modeling and simulation; autonomous systems; reliability; testing
AB Modeling and simulation (M&S) tools are used extensively throughout the Ground Vehicle Systems Center and the U.S. Army to perform an analysis of ground vehicles more quickly and less expensively than through physical testing. The Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments-Ground Vehicles (CREATE-GV) project is an M&S software effort that focuses on mobility and autonomous vehicle simulation and analysis, using physics-based three-dimensional modeling to accurately calculate a variety of ground vehicle metrics and parameters of interest. However, because these simulations are high fidelity, they often require a great deal of computational power and time. One approach to reducing simulation time that has proved effective in certain contexts is the creation of "surrogate models" through machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, it is often very challenging to accurately predict the mobility of a ground vehicle system in general, and there is no existing model that can predict the mobility of autonomous systems. A great deal of uncertainty exists in the mobility and autonomy area of physics-based simulation models related to modeling assumptions, terrain conditions, and insufficient knowledge of interactions between the vehicle and terrain. Understanding how the uncertainties inherent in autonomous mobility prediction affect model accuracy is still an open fundamental research question. We present a surrogate modeling approach leveraging ML algorithms to work with CREATE-GV to increase the computation speed of mobility assessments while still considering the reliability of the mobility predictions under uncertainty.

AB Accurate modelling of an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) is challenging due to strong nonlinearity, model perturbations and external disturbances. This necessitates the design of path tracking controllers with robustness. In this paper, an integrated control strategy for path tracking and handling stability of AGVs is proposed, leveraging a four-wheel steering (4WS) system. To address the path tracking problem, a fuzzy logic-based steering strategy is developed, which enables parameter self-adjustment based on displacement error. Additionally, a reference model is employed to transform the path tracking problem into a reference signal tracking problem, ensuring the handling stability of vehicles. A sliding mode controller is designed to track the reference signal, utilizing an extended state observer to estimate and compensate for unmodeled dynamics and unknown external disturbances in real-time. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in accurately tracking the desired path while maintaining the lateral stability of the vehicle. Furthermore, the strategy exhibits strong robustness against uncertainties and disturbances.

AB The discharge characteristics of seawater batteries can be used to prolong the working hours of autonomous underwater observation vehicles. However, the output voltage level of the seawater battery is low, so it cannot directly be used to power supply underwater observation vehicles. In this paper, a boost converter is proposed based on the seawater batteries to power supply autonomous underwater observation vehicles. The proposed converter greatly increases the voltage level of the seawater battery and directly supplies the underwater observation vehicles. Compared with the traditional boost converter, the voltage gain of the proposed converter is more than ten times higher than it under the same duty ratio condition. Its structure is asymmetric interleaved parallel, which can enable power devices to obtain lower voltage stress and ensure that the input current ripple is low. The operating principle and homeostasis property of the proposed converter are analyzed in detail. Finally, a prototype is built. Through simulation and experiment, the correctness of the theoretical design is verified and experimental results are analyzed.

AB In this paper, a novel technique is presented for using state observers in conjunction with an entropy source encoder to enable highly compressed telemetry of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) position vectors. In this work, both the sending vehicle and receiving vehicle or human operator are equipped with a shared real-time simulation of the sender's state based on the prior transmitted positions. Thus, only the innovation between the sender's actual state and the shared state need be sent over the link, such as a very low throughput acoustic modem. The distribution of this innovation can be modeled a priori or assembled adaptively. This distribution is then paired with an arithmetic entropy encoder, producing a very low cost representation of the vehicle's position vector. This system was analyzed on experimental data from the GLINT10 and AGAVE07 expeditions involving two different classes of AUVs performing a diverse number of maneuvers, and implemented on a fielded vehicle in the MBAT12 experiment. Using an adaptive probability distribution in combination with either of two state observer models, greater than 90% compression, relative to a 32-b integer baseline, was achieved.

AB As the transition towards connected and autonomous vehicles gradually happens, different phases with CAVs and human-driven vehicles sharing the same network will occur. This paper's purpose is to increase the knowledge of these mixed situations, studying the impacts of an increasing number of CAVs within the vehicle fleet on road capacity, travel time savings and energy consumption, providing new insights into the debate that is still open. The methodology focused on a microsimulation-based approach on an urban motorway in the city of Rome. Some of the outcomes from simulations, run with the software PTV Vissim (TM) 21, were used to analyse variations in general performances of the transportation system, whereas the remaining results were fed into the emission model COPERT for assessing the impacts of CAV penetration on the energy consumption of the fleet. Results show how, in congested cases, appreciable improvements can be recorded in terms of road capacity, mean speeds, and environmental impacts, while in lower-congested situations, any enhancement in traffic fluidification counteracts the environmental performances of the whole system.

ID DRIVING STYLES
AB Studies have shown that autonomous vehicles (AVs) behave conservatively in a traffic environment composed of human drivers and do not adapt to local conditions and socio-cultural norms. It is known that socially aware AVs can be designed if there exists a mechanism to understand the behaviors of human drivers. We present an approach that leverages machine learning to predict, the behaviors of human drivers. This is similar to how humans implicitly interpret the behaviors of drivers on the road, by only observing the trajectories of their vehicles. We use graph-theoretic tools to extract driver behavior features from the trajectories and machine learning to obtain a computational mapping between the extracted trajectory of a vehicle in traffic and the driver behaviors. Compared to prior approaches in this domain, we prove that our method is robust, general, and extendable to broad-ranging applications such as autonomous navigation. We evaluate our approach on real-world traffic datasets captured in the U.S., India, China, and Singapore, as well as in simulation.

ID DRIVING CARS; HARM; ROBOTS
AB There would seem to be a potential regulatory problem with the crash algorithms for connected and autonomous vehicles that (normally) "kick in" should a crash be inevitable. Although the general regulatory considerations which have been put forward tend to seek a "fair balance" that would protect various users of the roads, a configuration which shielded other parties at the cost of the car user could be seen as posing an existential threat to the user by encroaching on his or her right to self-preservation. "Hacking the system" (i.e. modifying the configuration in order to obtain a more favourable outcome for the user) could therefore be understood as acting on one's instinct for self-preservation and - though illegal - could in certain situations turn out to be an action that is not punishable in law. The present article argues that in certain real post-crash situations, a person who has modified the code for his or her own benefit could be exonerated on the basis of existing legal provisions and thus go unpunished. This could create unforeseen flaws in the connected autonomous vehicles regulatory system.

AB What might long-distance travel behaviour look like in a world of fully autonomous mobility options? Within this context, which of the transportation options, including autonomous cars, pilotless planes, driverless trains, and driverless buses would people choose for their long-distance travel? We examine the extent to which people's attitudes towards fully autonomous mobility options, habits, and the level of satisfaction with current travel modes, as well as individual and socioeconomic variables, influence the choice/preference for fully autonomous modes. Data for this study were collected through an online survey (n = 811). A choice model was used to analyse the effects of attitudinal factors and other variables on the probability of choosing four fully autonomous alternatives. The results of the model show that (1) the preferred order of autonomous mobility options is: Autonomous Car (AC), Autonomous Train (AT), Autonomous Flight (AF), and Autonomous Bus (AB), (2) AT was evaluated the safest, most relaxing, and most economical alternative, and (3) both attitudes and habit influence the choice of fully autonomous vehicles. However, sensitivity analyses show that attitudes will have a greater impact on travel behaviour compared to habits. Policy-wise, a demographically differentiated campaign for changing attitudes can be employed.

TI Autonomous Vehicles Testing Considering Utility-Based Operable Tasks

DT Article
DE Autonomous Vehicle (AV); intelligence testing; operable tasks
AB Virtual simulation testing of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is gradually being accepted as a mandatory way to test the feasibility of driving strategies for AVs. Mainstream methods focus on improving testing efficiency by extracting critical scenarios from naturalistic driving datasets. However, the criticalities defined in their testing tasks are based on fixed assumptions, the obtained scenarios cannot pose a challenge to AVs with different strategies. To fill this gap, we propose an intelligent testing method based on operable testing tasks. We found that the driving behavior of Surrounding Vehicles (SVs) has a critical impact on AV, which can be used to adjust the testing task difficulty to find more challenging scenarios. To model different driving behaviors, we utilize behavioral utility functions with binary driving strategies. Further, we construct a vehicle interaction model, based on which we theoretically analyze the impact of changing the driving behaviors on the testing task difficulty. Finally, by adjusting SV's strategies, we can generate more corner cases when testing different AVs in a finite number of simulations.

AB In this paper, contraction theory is applied to design a control law to address the horizontal trajectory tracking problem of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle. Suppose that the vehicle faces challenges such as model uncertainties, external environmental disturbances, and actuator saturation. Firstly, a coordinate transformation is introduced to solve the problem of underactuation. Then, a disturbance observer is designed to estimate the total disturbances, which are composed of model uncertainties and external environmental disturbances. Next, a saturated controller is designed based on singular perturbation theory and contraction theory. Meanwhile, contraction theory is used to analyse the convergence properties of the observer and the full singular perturbation system, and make quantitative analysis of the estimation error and the tracking error. Finally, the results of numerical simulations prove that the method in this paper enables the vehicle to track the desired trajectory with relatively high accuracy, while the control inputs do not exceed the limitations of the actuators.

AB As fully automated valet parking systems are being developed, there is a transition period during which both human-operated vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) are present in the same parking infrastructure. This paper addresses the problem of allocation of a parking space to an AV without conflicting with the parking space chosen by the driver of a HV. A comprehensive assessment of the key factors that affect the preference and choice of a driver for a parking space is established by the fuzzy comprehensive method. The algorithm then generates a ranking order of the available parking spaces to first predict the driver's choice of parking space and then allocate a space for the AV. The Floyd algorithm of shortest distance is used to determine the route for the AV to reach its parking space. The proposed allocation and search algorithm is applied to the examples of a parking lot with three designed scenarios. It is shown that parking space can be reasonably allocated for AVs.

AB This study intended to provide potential safety consideration that will pave the way for evaluation of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) in public buses. The geo-localized crash data of Las Vegas metropolitan area from 2014 to 2017 were collected, involving 27 arterials with 466 bus crash samples, and Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) decision tree model was proposed to examine the effect of CAV technologies in bus crash severity so that the drivers & x2019; factors can be determined and controlled if CAV technologies were employed. Results suggest that contributory predictors of crash severity outcomes are from driver & x2019;s action of vehicles with main responsibility (including going straight, making U-turn and passing other vehicles/racing), and crash type (angle and rear-end). If these factors are controlled by CAV technologies, it is suggested that severe crashes involving buses could be reduced significantly. The findings provide useful insights for CAV companies and policy makers to improve the driving state and traffic safety in public buses.

AB Trajectory smoothing design (TSD) may significantly reduce fuel consumption and improve driving comfort at intersections. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model with discrete time is formulated to jointly optimize autonomous intersection management and TSD, aiming to improve traffic efficiency, fuel economy and driving comfort simultaneously. Driving safety of car-following and collision avoidance at conflict points, diverge points and converge points, as well as constraints of acceleration and jerk are considered. To reasonably describe vehicle movement within intersection areas, the vehicle trajectory within the intersection is treated as a channel considering the vehicle width. A rolling horizon framework is used to solve the model. We have compared the traffic efficiency, fuel economy, monetary cost and driving comfort of the joint optimization model with that of the state-of-the-art two-stage strategy. Finally, sensitivity analysis with respect to left-turn ratio, weighted coefficient of TSD and control zone length is conducted.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper proposes an autonomous coil alignment system (ACAS) for electric vehicles (EVs) with dynamic wireless charging (DWC) to mitigate the reduction in received power caused by lateral misalignment between the source and load coils. The key component of the ACAS is a novel sensor coil design, which can detect the load coil's left or right position relative to the source coil by observing the change in voltage phase. This allows the lateral misalignment to be estimated through the wireless power transfer (WPT) system alone, which is a novel tracking method for vehicular applications. Once misalignment is detected, the vehicle's lateral position is self-adjusted by an autonomous steering function. The feasibility of the overall operation of the ACAS was verified through simulation and experiments. In addition, an analysis based on experimental results was conducted, demonstrating that 26% more energy can be transferred during DWC with the ACAS, just by keeping the vehicle's load coil aligned with the source coil.

AB This article presents a novel fuzzy-logic based multi-sensor data fusion algorithm for combining heading estimates from three separate weighted interval Kalman filters to construct a robust, fault-tolerant heading estimator for the navigation of the Springer autonomous surface vehicle. A single, low-cost gyroscopic unit and three independent compasses are used to acquire data onboard the vehicle. The gyroscope data, prone to sporadic bias drifts, are fused individually with readings from each of the compasses via a weighted interval Kalman filter. Unlike the standard Kalman filter, the weighted interval Kalman filter is able to provide a robust heading estimate even when subject to such gyroscope bias drifts. The three ensuing weighted interval Kalman filter estimates of the vehicle's heading are then fused via a fuzzy logic algorithm designed to provide an accurate heading estimate even when two of the three compasses develop a fault at any time. Simulations and real-time trials demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI External Interface-based Autonomous Vehicle-to-Pedestrian Communication

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
LA English
DT Article
AB External interface-based autonomous vehicle-to-pedestrian (AV2P) communication will facilitate the interaction between autonomous vehicle (AV) and pedestrian in future urban traffic. However, there are still no designs of external interface that could be generally accepted nowadays. In this regard, more sufficient research should be conducted to understand pedestrian's needs for the communication and explore the considerations for the external interface design. To investigate these issues in this work, two focus groups and a design study were conducted with 14 users (i.e., pedestrians) and 4 experienced designers, respectively. Based on the obtained results, the pedestrian-required communication information from the vehicle for the AV-pedestrian interaction were extracted and classified into the state of vehicle, the intention of vehicle, and the vehicle advice to pedestrians. A taxonomy of AV-pedestrian interaction situations was developed in accordance with the different situation features subsequently. Finally, considerations about the design of external AV2P communication interface were summarized. The results showed that the interface design should be made with consideration of specific situation features. It also revealed that the communication interface should be understandable, concise, salient, and unambiguous. Findings in this work is expected could serve as valuable design bases or principles for the development of interface-based AV2P communication in the future.

ID CIRCULATION
AB The miniature autonomous submersible explorer (MASE) was designed as a vehicle for astrobiology science by Behar et al. [1]. This paper focuses on the MASE concept and extrapolates a future design based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), multifunctional microsystems (MMS), and three-dimensional multichip modules (3-D-MCM). Miniaturization of the electronics increases the payload volumes and power capabilities significantly and this is the main rationale for pursuing extreme miniaturization. The original MASE vehicle accommodated 1-2 instruments while the MEMS enhanced miniature autonomous submersible explorer (MEMSEMASE) accommodates up to six instruments. It is shown that the occupied area of the electronics components is reduced eight times, and the volume 25 times. The vehicle is shaped as a tube with 5 cm in diameter and 20 cm in length and can support 8 W continuously over 5 h. The maximum range is 25 km while the typical onboard instrumentation is conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD), and a high resolution camera. An optical fiber is used for bidirectional communication with the vessel. The goal of this enriched concept is to present an extremely miniaturized submersible design. The vehicle volume is defined to fit inside host vehicles with the goal of future deployment on Europa, oceans on Earth, and bore holes. The paper will focus on showing how electronics can be densely packed into micromachined silicon modules and how these can be designed and interconnected theoretically.

ID VISION
AB With 5G mobile communication systems having been commercially rolled out, research discussions on next generation mobile systems, that is, 6G, have started. On the other hand, vehicular technologies are also evolving rapidly, from connected vehicles called V2X (vehicle to everything) to autonomous vehicles to the combination of the two, that is, the networks of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV). How fast the evolution of these two areas will go hand-in-hand is of great importance, which is the focus of this article. After a brief overview of the technological evolution of V2X to CAV and 6G key technologies, this article explores two complementary research directions, namely, 6G for CAVs versus CAVs for 6G. The former investigates how various 6G key enablers, such as THz, cell free communication and artificial intelligence (AI), can be utilized to provide CAV mission-critical services. The latter discusses how CAVs can facilitate effective deployment and operation of 6G systems. This article attempts to investigate the interactions between the two technologies to spark more research efforts in these areas.

AB This paper proposes a method that improves autonomous vehicles localization using a modification of probabilistic laser localization like Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) algorithm, enhancing the weights of the particles by adding Kalman filtered Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) information. GNSS data are used to improve localization accuracy in places with fewer map features and to prevent the kidnapped robot problems. Besides, laser information improves accuracy in places where the map has more features and GNSS higher covariance, allowing the approach to be used in specifically difficult scenarios for GNSS such as urban canyons. The algorithm is tested using KITTI odometry dataset proving that it improves localization compared with classic GNSS + Inertial Navigation System (INS) fusion and Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL), it is also tested in the autonomous vehicle platform of the Intelligent Systems Lab (LSI), of the University Carlos III de of Madrid, providing qualitative results.

AB This article proposes a virtual leader-based coordinated controller for the nonlinear multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) with the system uncertainties. To achieve the coordinated formation, a virtual AUV is set as the leader, while the desired command is designed using the relative position between each AUV and the virtual leader. The controller is designed based on the back-stepping scheme, and the online data-based learning scheme is used for uncertainty approximation. The highlight is that compared with previous learning methods which mostly focus on stability, the learning performance index is constructed using the collected online data in this article. The index is further used in the composite update law of the neural weights. The closed-loop system stability is analyzed via the Lyapunov approach. The simulation test on the five AUVs under fixed formation shows that the proposed method can achieve higher tracking performance with improved approximation accuracy.

ID DATA STREAMS
AB Autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs) are widely used to transfer wafers in semiconductor manufacturing. However, in such systems, robust traffic control is a significant challenge because all vehicles must be monitored and controlled in real time to cope with traffic congestion. Several predictive approaches have been proposed to prevent traffic congestion in stationary traffic environments. However, in real-life traffic situations, concept drifts exist, which are characterized by time-varying traffic conditions that hinder the accurate prediction of congestion. In this study, we propose a concept drift modeling framework for a robust vehicle control system. The proposed method combines a drift-adaptation learning technique with a drift detector to achieve adaptive traffic prediction in time-varying AVSs. We compare the effectiveness of the prediction and efficiency of model updates with representative methods. High-fidelity simulations based on actual data confirm that the proposed method outperforms alternative methods by detecting change patterns and updating prediction models whenever significant concept drifts occur in traffic patterns.

AB This paper presents a novel speed tracking control approach based on a model predictive control (MPC) framework for autonomous ground vehicles. A switching algorithm without calibration is proposed to determine the drive or brake control. Combined with a simple inverse longitudinal vehicle model and adaptive regulation of MPC, this algorithm can make use of the engine brake torque for various driving conditions and avoid high frequency oscillations automatically. A simplified quadratic program (QP) solving algorithm is used to reduce the computational time, and the approach has been applied in a 16-bit microcontroller. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via simulations and vehicle tests, which were carried out in a range of speed-profile tracking tasks. With a well-designed system structure, high-precision speed control is achieved. The system can robustly model uncertainty and external disturbances, and yields a faster response with less overshoot than a PI controller. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The popularity of Electric Autonomous Vehicles (EAVs) is rising continuously because they offer lower emissions, less energy consumption, safer, and more comfortable driving technologies. In this paper, a dynamic model of the EAV is derived, and analysed extensively in terms of the corresponding stability region for the linear and nonlinear EAV with a DC motor. Considering the dynamic environment, there are various uncertainties such as the puddles, bumps, and roundabout turnings that the vehicles must interact in real life applications. In order to model such uncertainties, the motions of the EAV have been analysed through observing the responses of the vehicles in the dynamic environments and then physical laws are utilized to accurately model them. Finally, a performance-based Proportional Derivative (PD) controller, specified with the desired maximum overshoot, settling time, rising time is constructed to handle such environmental uncertainties. To justify the developed model and controller, the corresponding motion, stability region and control of the EAV results obtained in the simulation environment are analysed comprehensively.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to provide new paradigms to enhance the safety, mobility, and environmental sustainability of surface transportation. However, as vehicles become more computerized and internally interconnected by electronic control systems, their vulnerability to cyber-attacks is a fast-growing concern and a national priority. Evidence from the Internet virus suggests that AVs will have critical challenges posed by epidemic-style malware like Stuxnet. This self-propagating malware is a fast and powerful way of disrupting the AV system and transportation infrastructure. This study presents a mathematical model for Stuxnet-style malware's temporal and spatial spread. Taking cues from the field of epidemiology and ecology, the malware will be described as an infectious epidemic to capture the dynamics of temporal and spatial propagation behavior. This study is the first attempt to analyze the spread of Stuxnet-style malware on AVs. The future uses of such a model for the temporal-geographic spread of AVs-based infectious malware are discussed.

AB This paper describes the development and application of an autonomous register and measurement system (ARMS), and the application of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers to the assessment of blast threat to armored vehicle crews. Taking measurements with reference to an explosion is one of the principal issues in the protection of crews of special vehicles. The proposed ARMS reduces research costs and contributes to the development of an autonomous, wireless test stand, applicable in various research areas and industry. The ARMS performs data acquisition with simultaneous measurement in multiple channels. The maximum sampling rate is 100 kHz and the sensor range is +/- 500 g. This solution is an alternative to cable systems, which have a high energy demand. The functionality of the developed autonomous measuring system is demonstrated experimentally. The paper concludes with a field study of the proposed system and the application of MEMS accelerometers via a mine blast test of a military vehicle at level 4 of STANAG 4569.

AB Autonomous driving has gradually moved towards practical applications in recent years. It is particularly critical to provide reliable real-time environmental information for autonomous driving systems. At present, vehicle video surveillance systems based on multi-source video and target detection algorithms can effectively solve these problems. However, the previous vehicle video surveillance systems are often unable to balance the surveillance effect and the surveillance frame rate. Therefore, we will introduce a vehicle video surveillance system based on parallel computing and computer vision in this article. First, multiple fisheye cameras are used to collect surround-view environmental information. Second, we will use a low-light camera, infrared thermal imager, and millimeter-wave radar to provide forward-view environmental information at night. Correspondingly, we designed the surround-view image fusion algorithm and the forward-view image fusion algorithm based on parallel computing. At last, a monocular camera and detection algorithms are used to provide forward-view detection results. In a word, this vehicle video surveillance system will benefit the practical application of autonomous driving.

AB The wave of modernization around us has put the automotive industry on the brink of a paradigm shift. Leveraging the ever-evolving technologies, vehicles are steadily transitioning towards automated driving to constitute an integral part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS). The term autonomous vehicle has become ubiquitous in our lives, owing to the extensive research and development that frequently make headlines. Nonetheless, the flourishing of AVs hinges on many factors due to the extremely stringent demands for safety, security, and reliability. Cutting-edge technologies play critical roles in tackling complicated issues. Assimilating trailblazing technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), edge intelligence (EI), 5G, and Blockchain into the AV architecture will unlock the potential of an efficient and sustainable transportation system. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in the literature on the impact and implementation of the aforementioned technologies into AV architectures, along with the challenges faced by each of them. We also provide insights into the technological offshoots concerning their seamless integration to fulfill the requirements of AVs. Finally, the paper sheds light on future research directions and opportunities that will spur further developments. Exploring the integration of key enabling technologies in a single work will serve as a valuable reference for the community interested in the relevant issues surrounding AV research.

AB Trust in autonomous vehicles (AV) is of critical importance and demands comprehensive interdisciplinary research. While most studies utilize subjective measures, we employ electroencephalography (EEG) to study in a more objective manner the cognitive states associated with trust during AV driving. Subjects drove a simulated AV in Conditional Automation Driving (SAE L3) and Full Automation Driving (SAE L5) modes. In the experimental design, malfunctions were induced at both automation levels. Self-reported trust in the AV was reduced immediately after Full Automation malfunctions, but not after Conditional Automation malfunctions when subjects were able to take over vehicle control to avoid danger. EEG analyses reveal that during Full Automation malfunctions, there was a significant enhancement in approach motivation (i.e. desire to re-engage) and a disruption of right frontal functional clustering that supports executive cognition (i.e. planning and decision-making). No neurocognitive disruptions were observed during Conditional Automation malfunctions. Our results demonstrate that it is not automation malfunctions per se (e.g. failure to decelerate) that deteriorate trust, but rather the inability for human drivers to adaptively mitigate the risk of negative outcomes (e.g. risk of crashing) resulting from those malfunctions. This is reflected in changes in brain activity associated with motivational state and action planning. Keeping the human driver on-the-loop protects against trust loss. Frontal alpha EEG is a neural correlate of trust-in-automation, with potential for trust monitoring using wearable technology to support driver-vehicle adaptivity.

AB This study proposes an optimal control method for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) through signalized intersections to reduce the energy consumption of mixed human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAV traffic. A real-time optimal control model was developed to optimize the trajectory of each CAV by minimizing energy consumption during the control period while ensuring traffic efficiency and safety. The control conditions of the CAVs were analyzed under different driving scenarios considering the impact of signal phase timing and preceding vehicles. Additionally, a method is proposed for CAVs to guide other vehicles directly and reduce the energy consumption of the entire signalized intersection. Simulation experiments using MATLAB and SUMO were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under various traffic conditions, such as different levels of saturation, market penetration rates (MPRs), and the green ratio. The performance was measured using average energy consumption and an average time delay. The results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce vehicle energy consumption without compromising traffic efficiency under various conditions. Moreover, under traffic saturation, the proposed method performs better at a high MPR and green ratio, especially at 40-60% MPR.

AB This paper proposes a lateral control strategy for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and develops an evolutionary learning framework for off-ramps. Random forest (RF) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) integrated with model predictive control (MPC) algorithm are respectively used to capture the decision-making and trajectory characteristics during the lane-changing maneuver based on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset. Then, a running cost function is calculated to optimize the trajectory dataset. Finally, the numerical simulation is conducted to investigate the characteristics of the proposed framework. Simulation results indicate that the performance of our method is much better than some other methods in lane-changing gap choice and trajectory execution. Moreover, the traffic system controlled by the evolutionary algorithms reaches the highest capacity and safest level when all vehicles are equipped with cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems. On the contrary, the scenario with 50% CACC vehicles shows the lowest travel efficiency and the worst safety because of the CACC vehicles' degradation. Furthermore, three iterations and 500 vehicle trajectories at each optimization cycle are recommended for the application in the off-ramp traffic control.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are underwater robots which are able to perform certain tasks without the help of a human operator. The key skill of each AUV is the capability to avoid collisions. To this end, appropriate devices and software are necessary with the potential to detect obstacles and to take proper decisions from the point of view of both the task and safety of the vehicle. The paper presents a neural collision avoidance system (NCAS) designed for the biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV). The NCAS is a component of the path following and collision avoidance system (PFCAS), which as the name implies is responsible for safely leading the vehicle along a desired path with collision avoidance. The task of NCAS is to make decisions regarding vehicle maneuvers in the horizontal plane, but only in the close proximity of the obstacles. It is implemented as an evolutionary artificial neural network designed by means of a neuro-evolutionary technique called assembler encoding with evolvable operations (AEEO). The paper outlines operation and construction of the BAUV as well as the PFCAS, the role of the NCAS in the entire system, and briefly presents AEEO as well as reporting on the experiments performed in simulation.

AB Many control techniques are proposed in literature for the lateral tracking of autonomous vehicles. Unfortunately, most of these demonstrate control efficiency based on supportive results from simulation only. A lack of evidence in experimental verification raises questions about the design performance. This research proposes a practical tracking algorithm using iterative learning control (ILC) with the expectation of achieving a lower tracking error in each iteration. ILC observes an error sequence from the past to adjust the steering command in a real vehicle. This work also develops a localization system to achieve the real-time positioning data based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Signals obtained from the inertial measurement unit (IMU), global navigation satellite system (GNSS) module, and vehicle encoders are fused to determine the real-time vehicle position. Experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the ILC-based tracking control. The results show that the ILC designs can clearly improve the tracking performance from a typical control system by reducing the tracking error in the iteration domain. In addition, using more gains in the ILC design results in a smoother path.

AB The primary objective of this study is to quantify the role of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and vehicular communication on post-accident traffic flow. We propose an analytical framework embedding car-following models for safety analysis for mixed traffic flow of human-driven vehicles and AVs, especially under vehicular communication. We then calibrate car-following models with real-world data. Through the model-based simulation experiments, we examine and discuss in details traffic flow stability, throughput, and post-accident safety. The results show that the traffic congestion resulting from the primary accident lasted shorter with the growing penetration of AVs. It is appealing that relaxing the safety grade of AVs can increase the throughput and this enables us to balance the safety level of AV operation and traffic throughput. In addition, incorporating vehicular communication can alleviate the risk of relaxing safety requirement and strikingly reduce the number and the severity of the secondary accidents.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; BEHAVIOR; UNCERTAINTY; STABILITY
AB Different types of automated vehicles (AVs) have emerged promptly in recent years, each of which might have different potential impacts on traffic flow and emissions. In this paper, the impacts of autonomous automated vehicles (AAVs) and cooperative automated vehicles (CAVs) on capacity, average traffic speed, average travel time per vehicle, and average delay per vehicle, as well as traffic emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM10) have been investigated through a microsimulation study in VISSIM. Moreover, the moderating effects of different AV market penetration, and different freeway segments on AV's impacts have been studied. The simulation results show that CAVs have a higher impact on capacity improvement regardless of the type of freeway segment. Compared to other scenarios, CAVs at 100% market penetration in basic freeway segments have a greater capacity improvement than AAVs. Furthermore, merging, diverging, and weaving segments showed a moderating effect on capacity improvements, particularly on CAVs' impact, with merging and weaving having the highest moderating effect on CAVs' capacity improvement potential. Taking average delay per vehicle, average traffic speed, and average travel time per vehicle into account, simulation results were diverse across the investigated scenarios. The emission estimation results show that 100% AAV scenarios had the best performance in emission reductions in basic freeway and merging sections, while other scenarios increased emissions in diverging and weaving sections.

AB In the future driverless scenario, pedestrian-vehicle conflict is an unavoidable traffic problem at unsignalized mid-block crosswalks. Autonomous vehicles are obviously impossible to make eye contact with pedestrians the way a human driver can. Therefore, there is an urgent need for autonomous vehicles to achieve accurate predictions of pedestrian crossing behavior. In order to better solve the problem of high uncertainty of pedestrian crossing behavior, in this paper, a modeling framework combines Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Deep MEIRL) and reinforcement learning is employed to predict pedestrian crossing behaviors. The dataset of drone-based video footage is collected in Xi'an (China) to train and validate the model. The trajectory dataset, extracted by computer vision algorithm, is implemented to derive state features of pedestrian behavior, including pedestrian to target area distance, vehicle type, vehicle speed, lateral/longitudinal distances, pedestrian lateral/longitudinal velocities. The results reveal that Deep MEIRL performs better than a baseline model MEIRL at micro-scales such as predicting pedestrian trajectories and evasive actions. Specifically, in predicting pedestrian trajectories, the Deep MEIRL outperforms the MEIRL by 33.09% and 15.16% on the basis of the MAE and HD, respectively. Meanwhile, the Deep MEIRL is 28.7% and 17.6% respectively more accurate than the MEIRL in predicting pedestrian evasive actions on lateral and longitudinal directions. Furthermore, we also found that there is heterogeneity in pedestrian crossing behavior when interacting with different vehicles. This research can contribute to a critical step toward addressing the safe and efficient movement at unsignalized mid-block crosswalks for autonomous vehicles.

ID SYSTEM
AB Drunk drivers, who critically and continuously threaten road safety, are usually detected using biological sensors within the same vehicle or after drunk driving behavior is observed by police patrols. Observing an obvious drunk driving behavior indicates a relatively high blood alcohol concentration, and thus, detecting drunk drivers with a relatively low blood alcohol concentration is difficult. This study uses output-only measurements available from motion sensors in the longitudinal drive of mixed autonomous and human-driven platoons to detect drunk drivers' behavior in human-driven vehicles within the same platoon. The human-driven vehicle is assumed to be between two autonomous vehicles that are able to share information with each other. The proposed approach relates a set of motion sensor measurements with another within the platoon and does not require the knowledge of the excitation signal or the dynamics of the platoon. Numerical simulations are first implemented to test the proposed approach, and then, VISSIM software is implemented to simulate realistic road topography. Further validations on laboratory mobile robots are presented in this article, where a class of abnormal driving conditions that includes human-driven vehicles is simulated. Experiments are carried out by measuring abnormal human-driven vehicles within connected autonomous robots. This method is shown to deal with various system uncertainties, and the approach can deal with the drunk driver case. The drunken driving conditions are modeled mathematically with different blood alcohol concentration levels, which correspond to different effects and different drunk driving behaviors. The proposed transmissibility-based drunk driver detection algorithm is shown to detect drivers with risky relatively low alcohol concentrations.

AB This study addresses the path-tracking control issue of autonomous vehicles (AVs) when the GPS measurement is temporarily unavailable. In such a case, the vehicle states, location or the curvature of the reference path might be unobtainable, while the camera can be potentially used to detect the pathtracking states. To this end, this paper proposes a fuzzy-observerbased composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) controller with a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) vehicle lateral dynamic model to guarantee the normal path-tracking maneuver and improve the transient performance. A parallel distributed compensation (PDC)-based CNF control method is developed to realize the control objective with the T-S vehicle model considering the transient performance and actuator saturation. The closed-loop stability and H-infinity index performance integrating the tracking and estimation errors have been proved with a Lyapunov approach. The observer-based controller design has been implemented based on the formulation of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). High-fidelity simulations using CarSim-Matlab/Simulink have demonstrated the validity of the proposed approach in terms of enhancing the tracking performance under the input saturation and disturbances in GPS-denied environments.

AB Cooperative trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles has garnered significant attention in structured environments, but corresponding methodologies for unstructured environments remains relatively underexplored. The unloading area, an integral component of open-pit mines, exemplifies a quintessential unstructured environment. Implementing cooperative planning for autonomous mining trucks (AMTs) within these unloading areas is crucial as the optimization of processes in these areas substantially enhances the overarching safety, productivity, and cost-effectiveness of mining operations. Hence, enhancing the operational efficiency of AMTs in the unloading area can considerably elevate productivity levels of open-pit mines. This article focuses on the real-time cooperative trajectory planning problem for AMTs in such areas, which is challenging due to i) small and irregular space ii) complex operations iii) need for path stability and speed flexibility. We propose a decoupled multi-vehicle trajectory planning (MVTP) method that decomposes trajectory planning into path planning and speed planning. Specifically, we present driving behavior enhanced path planning and sequential real-time cooperative speed planning methods. Our method is compared with several state-of-the-art MVTP methods and proves to be both secure and efficient.

AB In this article, the trajectory tracking control is considered for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subjected to model uncertainties and output constraints. The tan-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is adopted to deal with the requirement of output constraints. In order to cope with the existing system uncertainties, the adaptive fuzzy is employed to approximate the unknown system parameters of an AUV. Both state feedback tracking controller and output feedback tracking controller are proposed in this article. The state feedback tracking control scheme is designed by comprehensive application of tan-type BLF and adaptive control design provided that all system states are measurable. The output feedback tracking control scheme is proposed by employing a high-gain observer. Through analysis, it can be shown that the designed control laws are able to achieve the desired output constraints. In addition, all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly bounded. Finally, simulation is carried out to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the designed control strategies.

AB Artificial intelligence is an enabling technology for autonomous surface vehicles, with methods such as evolutionary algorithms, artificial potential fields, fast marching methods, and many others becoming increasingly popular for solving problems such as path planning and collision avoidance. However, there currently is no unified way to evaluate the performance of different algorithms, for example with regard to safety or risk. This paper is a step in that direction and offers a comparative study of current state-of-the art path planning and collision avoidance algorithms for autonomous surface vehicles. Across 45 selected papers, we compare important performance properties of the proposed algorithms related to the vessel and the environment it is operating in. We also analyse how safety is incorporated, and what components constitute the objective function in these algorithms. Finally, we focus on comparing advantages and limitations of the 45 analysed papers. A key finding is the need for a unified platform for evaluating and comparing the performance of algorithms under a large set of possible real-world scenarios.

AB Knowing the course of the road, together with the corresponding road boundaries is an essential component of many advanced driver-assistance systems and of autonomous vehicles. This work presents an indirect grid-based approach for road course estimation. Due to the grid representation, it is independent of specific features or particular sensors and is able to handle continuous as well as sparse road boundaries of arbitrary shape. Furthermore, the number of road courses in the scene is determined to detect road junctions and forks in the road, and the boundaries of each road course are individually estimated. The approach is based on local path planning and path clustering to find the principal moving directions through the environment. They separate the boundaries and are used for their extraction. The set of local paths and principal moving directions is reduced with approximate knowledge of the road velocity paired with system constraints, and validation and tracking assure the required robustness. Experimental results from autonomous navigation of a vehicle through an unmapped road construction site as well as quantitative evaluations demonstrate the performance of the method.

AB The automation level of autonomous marine vehicle is limited which is always semi-autonomy and reliant on operator interactions. In order to improve it, an autonomous collision avoidance method is proposed based on the visual technique as human's visual system. A deep convolutional neural network (Alexnet), with strong visual processing capability, is adopted for encounter pattern recognition. European Ship Simulator is used to generate some encounter scenes and record the corresponding maneuver operation conforming to the COLREGs (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea) rules as samples. After the training phase, of Alexnet, it can successfully predict the collision avoidance operation according to the input scene image like crewman; moreover, this can provide operation guidance for the automatic navigation, guidance and control system. Some different encounter situations are simulated, and used to testify the validity of the proposed approach.

AB Unstructured off-road environments with complex terrain obstacles and pavement properties bring obvious challenges for special purpose autonomous vehicle control. A cascade direct yaw moment control strategy (CDYC), which contains a main loop and a servo loop, is proposed to enhance the accuracy and stability of an independent eight in-wheel motor-driven autonomous vehicle with rear-wheel steering (8WD/RWS). In the main loop, double PID controllers are designed to generate the desired drive moment and yaw rate. In the servo loop, the quadratic programming (QP) algorithm with the tire force boundaries optimally allocates the demanded yaw moment to individual wheel torques. The 8WD/RWS prototype is virtually established using TruckSim and serves as the control object for co-simulation. The proposed cascade controller is verified by simulations in customized off-road driving scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed control architecture can effectively enhance the path-tracking ability and handling stability of the 8WD/RWS, as to ensure the maneuverability and control stability under extreme off-road conditions.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB This paper presents a first-order approach integrated with activity-based modeling and dynamic traffic assignment framework to model the impact of autonomous vehicles on household travel and activity schedules. By considering shared rides among household members, mode choices, re-planning of departure times, and the rescheduling of activity sequences, two optimization models-basic personal owned autonomous vehicle (POAV) model and enhanced POAV model-are presented. The proposed approach is tested for the different models at the household level with different household sizes. The activity schedules of each household were generated in the Chicago sub-area network. The results show that each POAV can effectively replace multiple conventional vehicles, however, using POAV will lead to more vehicle miles traveled because of detour trips. The proposed enhanced POAV model considers mode choice decision with a household-based approach instead of a trip-based approach to capture the impacts of repositioning trips on mode choice. The results show that, if the generalized travel cost of POAV remains at the same level as conventional vehicles, more passengers will choose to use transit because the repositioning trips increase the total cost.

The authors first construct an integrated state and clock model, which allows the co-design of communication and control strategies. Then, an asynchronous localisation algorithm is developed to estimate the position of AUV, where the asynchronous clock and the stratification effect are both considered. With the estimated position information, a reinforcement learning based tracking controller is developed for the AUV to track the reference point. Particularly, the multivariate probabilistic collocation method is adopted to evaluate the model uncertainty. Moreover, the convergence analyses for the localisation algorithm and tracking controller are also given. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is demonstrated that the communication energy consumption and tracking error can be significantly reduced, through the co-design of localisation and tracking strategies.

AB With the rapid development of automated vehicles (AVs), more and more demands are proposed towards environmental perception. Among the commonly used sensors, MMW radar plays an important role due to its low cost, adaptability In different weather, and motion detection capability. Radar can provide different data types to satisfy requirements for various levels of autonomous driving. The objective of this study is to present an overview of the state-of-the-art radar-based technologies applied In AVs. Although several published research papers focus on MMW Radars for intelligent vehicles, no general survey on deep learning applied In radar data for autonomous vehicles exists. Therefore, we try to provide related survey In this paper. First, we introduce models and representations from millimeter-wave (MMW) radar data. Secondly, we present radar-based applications used on AVs. For low-level automated driving, radar data have been widely used In advanced driving-assistance systems (ADAS). For high-level automated driving, radar data is used In object detection, object tracking, motion prediction, and self-localization. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and future development direction of related studies.

AB Aiming at the requirements of lightweight, low energy consumption and low inertia of the manipulators for autonomous underwater vehicles, this article presents a novel underwater cable-driven manipulator for autonomous underwater vehicles. Thanks to the cable-driven mechanism, the motors are installed remotely from joints, which can reduce the disturbance of the motion of the manipulator to the system and extend the operation time under the premise of limited energy. Cable-sheath mechanism is used to realize the motors to be fixedly mounted on the base (postposition). A prototype named Polaris-II is assembled, and experiments are carried out with the time-delay control scheme. Although the control effect of a single time-delay controller is good, there exist large errors caused by the reversing of joints. Therefore, a fuzzy compensator is designed and added to the time-delay controller to suppress the large errors. The experimental results show that the time-delay controller with a fuzzy compensator has a good inhibitory effect on the large errors while maintaining good control effect.

AB Human drivers take instant decisions about their speed, acceleration and distance from other vehicles based on different factors including their estimate of the road roughness. Having an accurate algorithm for real-time evaluation of road roughness can be critical for autonomous vehicles in order to achieve safe driving and passengers comfort. In this paper, we investigate the problem of interactive road roughness identification. We propose a novel inverse algorithm based on the knowledge of a vehicle dynamic characteristics and dynamic responses. The algorithm construct the road profile in time using one-iteration to update the wheels forces which are then used to identify the road roughness. The relation between the forces and the road profile is defined by a system of ordinary differential equations that are solved using the composite Gaussian quadrature. To reduce the error accumulation in time when noisy data is used for the vehicle response, a bidirectional filter is also implemented. We assume a simple model that is based on four degrees-of-freedom system and vibration acceleration measurements to evaluate the road roughness in real time. Although we present the results for this specific model, the algorithm can also be utilised with models of any number of degrees of freedom and can deal with models where the dynamic response is only available at some of the degrees of freedom. This is achieved by introducing a matrix reduction technique that is discussed in details. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of uncertainty in the vehicle parameters on the algorithm estimation accuracy. The proposed algorithm is evaluated for different types of road roughness. The simulation results show that the proposed method is robust and can achieve high accuracy. The algorithm offers excellent potential for road roughness estimation not only for autonomous vehicle but also for vehicles and roads designing purposes.

AB This study aims to quantify the impact of discretionary lane-changing (DLC) on following vehicles (FVs) in the target lane using real-world dataset. The Waymo Open Dataset is used to identify the differences between autonomous vehicles (AVs) DLC and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) DLC maneuvers and compare their impacts on the driving volatility. Then, a block maxima (BM) model is applied to estimate crash risks. Finally, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is adopted to model gap acceptance behaviors of AV and HDV. Compared to HDV DLC, AV DLC leads to lower speed and yaw rate volatility and smaller acceleration rates of FVs. Further, the BM model reveals that the crash risk in AV DLC events is half of that in HDV DLC events. Additionally, MARS show that AV and HDV accept different lead gap. These findings highlight the benefits of mixing AVs in traffic and guide the improvement of AV controllers.

AB An adaptive neural network-based steering control algorithm is proposed for yaw rate tracking of autonomous ground vehicles with in-vehicle signal time delay. The control system consists of two neural networks: the observer neural network and the controller neural network. The observer neural network adapts itself to the system dynamics during the training phase. Once trained, the observer neural network cooperates with the controller neural network, which constantly adapts itself during the control task. In this way, an adaptive and intelligent control structure is proposed. Through simulation studies, it has been shown that while a proportional-integral-derivative type steering controller fails to perform its control task in case of steering signal delay, the proposed control algorithm manages to adapt itself according to the control problem and achieves reference yaw rate tracking. The robustness of the control algorithm according to the signal delay magnitude has been demonstrated by simulation studies. A rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis of the control algorithm is also presented.

AB Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) for high-level Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) has evolved from rule-based to optimisation-based policies. However, at congested major-minor intersections, optimising solely for efficiency can negatively impact vehicle fairness. This study addresses this issue by proposing a deep reinforcement learning approach that optimises both traffic efficiency and fairness for AIM. In the modelled multi-objective Markov decision process, traffic fairness is measured by the difference between the crossing order and the approaching order of CAVs, while traffic efficiency is measured by average travel time. With unknown preferences of the objectives, Bellman optimality equation is generalised to obtain the optimal policies over the space of all possible preferences during the iterative training process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated in a simulated real-world intersection and compared with three benchmark policies, including the fairest policy for AIM: first-come-first-served. The learned policies perform best in reducing overall average vehicle delay, and demonstrate outstanding performance in balancing traffic fairness and efficiency.

AB Generating safe and non-conservative behaviors in dense, dynamic environments remains challenging for automated vehicles due to the stochastic nature of traffic participants' behaviors and their implicit interaction with the ego vehicle. This letter presents a novel planning framework, Multipolicy And Risk-aware Contingency (MARC) planning, that systematically addresses these challenges by enhancing the multipolicy-based pipelines from both behavior and motion planning aspects. Specifically, MARC realizes a critical scenario set that reflects multiple possible futures conditioned on each semantic-level ego policy. Then, the generated policy-conditioned scenarios are further formulated into a tree-structured representation with a dynamic branchpoint based on the scene-level divergence. Moreover, to generate diverse driving maneuvers, we introduce risk-aware contingency planning, a bi-level optimization algorithm that simultaneously considers multiple future scenarios and user-defined risk tolerance levels. Owing to the more unified combination of behavior and motion planning layers, our framework achieves efficient decision-making and human-like driving maneuvers. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance to other strong baselines in various environments.

TI An Initial Investigation of the Effects of a Fully Automated Vehicle
   Fleet on Geometric Design
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper investigates the potential changes in the geometric design elements in response to a fully autonomous vehicle fleet. When autonomous vehicles completely replace conventional vehicles, the human driver will no longer be a concern. Currently, and for safety reasons, the human driver plays an inherent role in designing highway elements, which depend on the driver's perception-reaction time, driver's eye height, and other driver related parameters. This study focuses on the geometric design elements that will directly be affected by the replacement of the human driver with fully autonomous vehicles. Stopping sight distance, decision sight distance, and length of sag and crest vertical curves are geometric design elements directly affected by the projected change. Revised values for these design elements are presented and their effects are quantified using a real-life scenario. An existing roadway designed using current AASHTO standards has been redesigned with the revised values. Compared with the existing design, the proposed design shows significant economic and environmental improvements, given the elimination of the human driver.

ID MOTION ESTIMATION; SEARCH ALGORITHM
AB Autonomous vehicles engaged in terrain exploration are typically equipped with a camera. The camera is subjected to vibration as the vehicle moves so that the videos captured require stabilisation to facilitate accurate interpretation by remote operators. Dedicated architectures for video stabilisation that offer high performance while consuming low area and power are desirable for this application. This study presents a pipelined very large-scale integration architecture. It is based on exploiting the separability property of the two-dimensional (2-D) Sobel matrix and the 2-D Gaussian filtering matrix to obtain an efficient corner point detection architecture. It also employs the coordinate rotation digital computer architecture for global motion vector calculation. The proposed architecture has been coded in Verilog and synthesised for a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which offers massive parallelism at fairly low power. The proposed architecture is shown to be highly area efficient. An FPGA-based autonomous vehicle has been fabricated, and experiments with a camera mounted on the vehicle are presented and analysed.

AB Emerging technologies in the context of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) have drastically evolved the industry's qualification requirements. AVs incorporate complex perception and control systems. Teaching the associated skills that are necessary for the analysis of such systems becomes a very difficult process and existing solutions do not facilitate learning. In this study, our efforts are devoted to proposingan open-source scale model vehicle platform that is designed for teaching the fundamental concepts of autonomous vehicles technologies that are adapted to undergraduate and technical students. The proposed platform is as realistic as possible in order to present and address all of the fundamental concepts that are associated with AV. It includes all on-board components of a stand-alone system, including low and high level functions. Such functionalities are detailed and a proof of concept prototype is presented. A set of experiments is carried out, and the results obtained using this prototype validate the usability of the model for the analysis of time- and energy-constrained systems, as well as distributed embedded perception systems.

AB According to industry research, the automation of vehicles promises a revolution in traffic safety, mobility, and quality of life. However, the success of such vehicles depends on their acceptance. This study investigates the influence of trust in technology, concerns of giving up control, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, the personality factor innovativeness, and the enjoyment of driving a car on the a priori intention to adopt an autonomous vehicle. By means of an online survey with 369 German participants, our study shows that trust in the technology and the concern about handing over control to a machine go hand in hand as respondents' cognitive and affective perception of this innovation. Moreover, perceived usefulness represents an influential factor, while the enjoyment of driving a car is a barrier to the technology's acceptance. Innovators represent a promising target for campaigns, as they are more likely to adopt an autonomous vehicle.

AB This paper investigates the development of a new guidance algorithm for a formation of unmanned aerial vehicles. Using the new approach of bifurcating potential fields, it is shown that a formation of unmanned aerial vehicles can be successfully controlled such that verifiable autonomous patterns are achieved, with a simple parameter switch allowing for transitions between patterns. The key contribution that this paper presents is in the development of a new bounded bifurcating potential field that avoids saturating the vehicle actuators, which is essential for real or safety-critical applications. To demonstrate this, a guidance and control method is developed, based on a six-degree-of-freedom linearized aircraft model, showing that, in simulation, three-dimensional formation flight for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles can be achieved.

AB Autonomous underwater gliders are a class of underwater vehicles that transit without the help of a conventional propeller. The vehicle uses a buoyancy engine to vary its buoyancy and with the help of the wings attached executes its motion. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the vehicle affect the longitudinal and turning motion. This paper discusses the effect of the wing's position on the vehicle's lift and drag characteristics. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool is used to estimate the lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficients of the vehicle. The numerical methodology is validated using flow over NACA0012 wing results for low Reynolds numbers, and the results of CFD are discussed for possible application in estimation of glider motion.

AB Existing potential functions (PFs) utilized in autonomous vehicles mainly focus on solving the path-planning problems in some conventional driving scenarios; thus, their performance may not be satisfactory in the context of emergency obstacle avoidance. Therefore, we propose a novel model predictive path-planning controller (MPPC) combined with PFs to handle complex traffic scenarios (e.g., emergency avoidance when a sudden accident occurs). Specifically, to enhance the safety of the PFs, we developed an MPPC to handle an emergency case with a sigmoid-based safe passage embedded in the MPC constraints (SPMPC) with a specific triggering analysis algorithm on monitoring traffic emergencies. The presented PF-SPMPC algorithm was compiled in a comparative simulation study using MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim. The algorithm outperformed the latest PF-MPC approach to eliminate the severe tire oscillations and guarantee autonomous driving safety when handling the traffic emergency avoidance scenario.

ID LANE; DESIGN
AB Traffic congestion or accidents may occur as a consequence of the difficulty of performing a safe, comfortable, and efficient overtaking in a timely manner when there is a slow or stopped vehicle, cyclist, or partial lane blockage on the road. Specifically, most drivers find it challenging to overtake a sluggish vehicle on a single-lane road in the presence of vehicles coming from other directions. To resolve such overtaking concerns, this paper proposes a novel optimal trajectory generating scheme for autonomous vehicle overtaking that is both smooth and safe and can be used in a variety of traffic scenarios. The proposed scheme is based on the solution of an optimal predictive problem with the goal of minimizing driving costs while limiting collision risks in the presence of any opposite vehicle on the overtaking lane. The computational burden of the scheme is almost negligible and can be implemented in real-time. The scheme is evaluated in a variety of traffic conditions, including stopped and slow vehicles in the lane, as well as the presence or absence of a nearby opposite vehicle. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively obtains the optimal trajectories even in the difficult overtaking contexts considering various constraints imposed by the road curve, opposite vehicles, and slow preceding vehicles. Finally, the optimal overtaking costs are obtained for various states of the associated vehicles, which provide an indication of the best state to initiate the overtake. The proposed technology can be employed as a fully automated system or an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) to improve the vehicle flows at challenging driving conditions and enhance transportation sustainability.

AB Motor vehicle crashes remain a leading cause of life and property loss to society. Autonomous vehicles can mitigate the losses by making appropriate emergency decision, and the crash injury severity prediction model is the basis for autonomous vehicles to make decisions in emergency situations. In this paper, based on the support vector machine (SVM) model and NASS/GES crash data, three SVM crash injury severity prediction models (B-SVM, T-SVM, and BT-SVM) corresponding to braking, turning, and braking + turning respectively are established. The vehicle relative speed (REL_SPEED) and the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) are introduced into the impact indicators of the prediction models. Secondly, the ordered logit (OL) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models are established to validate the accuracy of the SVM models. The results show that the SVM models have the best performance than the other two. Next, the impact of REL_SPEED and GVWR on injury severity is analyzed quantitatively by the sensitivity analysis, the results demonstrate that the increase of REL_SPEED and GVWR will make vehicle crash more serious. Finally, the same crash samples under normal road and environmental conditions are input into B-SVM, T-SVM, and BT-SVM respectively, the output results are compared and analyzed. The results show that with other conditions being the same, as the REL_SPEED increased from the low (0-20 mph) to middle (20-45 mph) and then to the high range (45-75 mph), the best emergency decision with the minimum crash injury severity will gradually transition from braking to turning and then to braking + turning.

AB Recently, there are so many researches on Autonomous Distributed Manufacturing Systems (ADMSs), where cooperation among agents is used to solve problems, such as the scheduling problem and the vehicle routing problem. We target ADMSs where an ADMS consists of two sub-systems: a Production System (PS) and an Autonomous Transportation System (ATS). This paper discusses an on-line Tasks Assignment and Routing Problem (TARP) for ATSs under conditions of given production schedule and finite buffer capacity. The TARP results in a constrained version of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW), and this paper gives a mathematical formulation of the problem. This paper, also, proposes a cooperative algorithm to obtain suboptimal solutions in which no deadlocks and buffer overflows occur. By computational experiments, we will examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain efficient and deadlock-free routes even though the buffer capacity is less.

AB Autonomous vehicles have gained popularity over the past few years. In this paper, we present a nonlinear model predictive control approach for autonomous vehicles to follow the desired path in various driving environments. Instead of utilizing Euler discretization method which is common in the literature related to MPC-based path tracking, our formulated nonlinear optimal control problem is discretized by orthogonal collocation method for higher tracking accuracy. The presented methodology considers the maximization of longitudinal progression along the reference path, target accurate tracking and comfortable ride. The single-track dynamic model combined with a simplified but effective enough tire model is used. Then the proposed controller is tested and compared with the controller based on Euler discretization in two simulation scenarios to validate its effectiveness. The simulation results demonstrate the integration of longitudinal and lateral motion control of our proposed controller and the better performance in tracking accuracy. Real-time performance of the proposed controller is also discussed.

AB As one of the typical applications of cyberphysical system (CPS), autonomous vehicles (AVs) are vulnerable to malicious disturbance from cyberattacks while tracking the desired path. This article focuses on CPS-based path tracking control problem of AVs under cyberattacks. First, the nonlinear state and measurement equations of AVs under cyberattacks are established based on vehicle dynamics model. Second, to improve the robustness of AVs against cyberattacks, sensor redundancy is introduced. A cyberattack detection method is designed by using extended Kalman filter, and the computational complexity of the cyberattack detection method is analyzed. In addition, sensor switching rules are developed to isolate the disturbance of cyberattacks. Then, the control problem of the AVs is formulated based on model predictive control. Input-to-state stability of the control system under cyberattacks is established, and a link between the tolerable attack intensity and the detection thresholds is clearly revealed. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB The development of self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles has progressed at an unanticipated pace. Ironically, the driver or the driver vehicle interaction is a largely neglected factor in the development of enabling technologies for autonomous vehicles. Therefore, this paper discusses the advantages and challenges faced by aging drivers with reference to in-vehicle technology for self-driving cars, on the basis of findings of recent studies. We summarize age-related characteristics of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions on the basis of extensive age-related research, which can provide a familiar to better aging drivers. Furthermore, we discuss some key aspects that need to be considered, such as familar to learnability, acceptance, and net effectiveness of new in-vehicle technology, as addressed in relevant studies. In addition, we present research-based examples on aging drivers and advanced technology, including a holistic approach that is being developed by MIT AgeLab, advanced navigation systems, and health monitoring systems. This paper anticipates many questions that may arise owing to the interaction of autonomous technologies with an older driver population. We expect the results of our study to be a foundation for further developments toward the consideration of needs of aging drivers while designing self-driving vehicles.

AB In this article, a channel-level event-triggered communication scheme is investigated for path tracking control of autonomous ground vehicles via an in-vehicle network to ensure path tracking performance while reducing network resource utilization. First, a path tracking system is established considering the effect of norm bounded uncertainty on lateral vehicle dynamics, and a state feedback path tracking controller is designed within the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework. Next, a decentralized event-triggered communication scheme is adopted between the sensors and controller, which makes it possible to save communication resources at the channel level. Finally, the results in the CarSim-Simulink joint-simulation environment show that the proposed controller can ensure a reliable path tracking performance in both lateral offset and heading error. At the same time, compared with the simple time-triggered scheme, the proposed method can effectively reduce the usage of communication resources by more than 80%.

TI Intersection management for autonomous vehicles with
   vehicle-to-infrastructure communication
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes an intersection management strategy for autonomous vehicles under the vehicle-to-infrastructure circumstance. All vehicles are supposed to be fully autonomous and can communicate with the intersection management unit to check the traffic situation. Priority of passing the intersection is decided by a static conflict matrix which represents the potential conflict between lanes of different directions and a dynamic information list which could capture the real-time occupation of each lane in the intersection. Compared with the existing approaches in the literature, the intersection management unit in our strategy is more like a database rather than a computational center, and therefore, requires less computational resource and more likely satisfies the real-time requirement in heavy traffic situations. Simulations are conducted using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), in which the proposed strategy is compared with both fixed and adaptive traffic light methods. The results indicate that the proposed strategy could significantly reduce the average time delay caused by the intersection and the corresponding variance, which shows the efficiency and fairness of the proposed strategy in intersection management.

AB This paper addresses the generalized set-point and region control problem for an underwater vehicle. It is known that the desired target is usually defined as a point or a region. However, in some applications, it is required to navigate the underwater vehicle to the surface or a boundary of a region. In this work, a novel control law is proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle where the desired position is specified as a boundary in lieu of a region or a point. Hence, the system can be initialized from either inside or outside of the region. For a mapping of the uncertain persistent effects i.e.: the restoring forces, a least-squares estimation algorithm along with the inverse Jacobian matrix is utilized in the adaptive control law. The unit quaternion representation is used for the attitude representation. The stability analysis is carried out using the Lyapunov type approach. The simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This type of system is known as Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM). AIM has been discussed in different articles, but most of them have not considered the communication latency between the AV and the Intersection Manager (IM). Due to the lack of works studying the impact that the communication network can have on the decentralized control of AVs by AIMs, this paper presents a novel latency-aware deep reinforcement learning-based AIM for the 5G communication network, called AIM5LA. AIM5LA is the first AIM that considers the inherent latency of the 5G communication network to adapt the control of AVs using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL), thus obtaining a robust and resilient multi-agent control policy. Beyond considering the latency history experienced, AIM5LA predicts future latency behavior to provide enhanced security and improve traffic flow. The results demonstrate huge safety improvements compared to other AIMs, eliminating collisions (on average from 27 to 0). Further, AIM5LA provides comparable results in other metrics, such as travel time and intersection waiting time, while guaranteeing to be collision-free, unlike the other AIMs. Finally, compared to other traffic light-based control systems, AIM5LA can reduce waiting time by more than 99% and time loss by more than 95%.

AB Next to environmental aspects, establishing areas for safe and economically viable automated driving in mixed-traffic settings is one major challenge for sustainable development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). This work investigates safety in the interactions between AVs, human-driven vehicles, and vulnerable road users, including cyclists and pedestrians, within a simulated urban environment in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. New junction and pedestrian models are introduced, and virtual AVs with an occlusion-aware driving system are deployed to deliver cargo autonomously. The safety of applying this autonomous cargo delivery service is assessed using a large set of Surrogate Safety Indicators (SSIs). Furthermore, Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs) and travel time loss are incorporated to evaluate the network efficiency. By assessing the impact of various measures involving Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, infrastructure modifications, and driving behavior, we show that traffic safety and network efficiency can be achieved in a living lab setting for the considered case. Our findings further suggest that V2X gets implemented, new buildings are not placed close to intersections, and the speed limit of non-arterial roads is lowered.

AB This article addresses the event-triggered dynamic surface control of an underactuated autonomous surface vehicle with unknown kinetics for circumnavigating a dynamic target with unknown velocity. A modular design approach to the event-triggered dynamic surface control is proposed for target enclosing. In the estimator module, an extended state observer is employed for estimating the relative motion between the target and the surface vehicle. A fuzzy system is used for online modeling the unknown vehicle kinetics. In the controller module, an event-triggered dynamic surface control law is constructed by using the estimated relative velocities and vehicle kinetics in the estimator module. In the control law, a triggered mechanism is introduced to reduce the transmission load and the execution rate of actuators. Besides, the control inputs are bounded with the aid of a projection operator and saturated functions. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop target enclosing system is proven through Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of the event-triggered dynamic surface control method for circumnavigating a maneuvering target.

   Task analysis; Cameras; Force-vision sensor fusion; door opening; door

AB Multiple sensors are often used in robotic applications for better situational awareness. Hence, sensor fusion becomes a key technology to manage multiple sources of information and plays a critical role to the success in robotic tasks such as object detection and tracking, autonomous navigation, and interaction with humans. With these capabilities, wheeled autonomous vehicles can be used to automate some public services. However, there are still challenges for wheeled vehicles to safely and agilely maneuvering in human-centered environments. One of these challenges is lacking the capability of autonomously opening doors and traversing doorways without using a general-purpose robotic arm (manipulator). An autonomous door-opening operation is a complex task consisting of identifying the door and door handle, navigating the vehicle to the door, operating the door handle, and pulling or pushing the door to open while traversing the doorway. A self-closing door adds significant difficulty for the last step because the door usually needs to be held open while the vehicle is traversing the doorway. This paper presents a method using force-vision sensor fusion to enhance a deep reinforcement learning (RL) process for a wheeled vehicle to perform the most difficult step of a door-opening and pass-through operation. That step is to pull and hold a self-closing door open while the vehicle is traversing the doorway. In our solution, the vehicle is equipped with a camera, a force sensor, and a concise door-opening mechanism. The method was simulated in Gazebo and the results demonstrated that the deep RL-based force-vision sensor fusion method can be successfully applied to the task of self-closing door pulling by a wheeled vehicle without using a robotic arm and without a pre-planned trajectory. The vehicle control was trained without using domain randomization, but it still works in variant environments.

AB This paper describes a multisensor data-fusion system for driving an autonomous earthwork vehicle operating in a sanitary landfill. The system acquires data from a set of ultrasonic sensors, a laser range finder, and several charge-coupled device cameras, and produces as output alarms that indicate potential dangerous situations, e.g., the presence of fixed or mobile obstacles in the vehicle working area. The proposed system adds to the vehicle important functionalities such as to avoid terrain holes or down slopes or to discriminate between heaps of waste to be compacted and other man-made obstacles. Data fusion allows one to increase the system's reliability and to compensate for the inaccuracies and limited operating ranges of individual sensors. Experimental results show the system's functioning both under normal operational conditions and in the presence of dangerous situations. Moreover, the performances of the system in bad environmental situations (e.g., rain, low lighting) have been evaluated.

AB The paper addresses the leader tracking problem for a platoon of connected autonomous vehicles in the presence of both homogeneous time-varying parameter uncertainties and vehicle-to-vehicle time-varying communication delay. To this aim, leveraging the multiagent systems (MAS) framework, a novel distributed robust proportionalintegral-derivative control is proposed. The stability of the cohesive formation is analytically proved with a Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach by exploiting the descriptor transformation for time-delayed systems of neutral type. The delaydependent robust stability conditions are expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities allowing the proper tuning of the proportional, integral, and derivative actions implemented on each of the vehicles within the fleet. Extensive simulation analysis in different driving scenarios confirms the effectiveness of the theoretical derivation.

AB A least-restrictive supervisor for vehicle collision avoidance is a control algorithm that can detect an unsafe maneuver by a set of human-driven or autonomous vehicles, intervening with a corrective action only when needed to avoid a collision. It can help prevent collisions, and facilitate coexistence of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. Such an algorithm is based on a formal verification problem which, unfortunately, is known to be NP-hard in many cases of interest, for instance at traffic intersections. Here, we propose a strategy to dynamically decompose the formal verification problem of a large road network, exploiting vehicle dynamics and the constraints induced by road topology to separate nonconflicting vehicles. We split the global problem into smaller and treatable subproblems, while still allowing to compute an exact solution. We illustrate our results on three different scenarios.

TI Security Vulnerabilities of Connected Vehicle Streams and Their Impact

SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles capable of navigating unpredictable real-world environments with little human feedback are a reality today. Such systems rely heavily on onboard sensors such as cameras, radar/LIDAR, and GPS as well as capabilities such as 3G/4G connectivity and V2V/V2I communication to make real-time maneuvering decisions. Autonomous vehicle control imposes very strict requirements on the security of the communication channels used by the vehicle to exchange information as well as the control logic that performs complex driving tasks such as adapting vehicle velocity or changing lanes. This study presents a first look at the effects of security attacks on the communication channel as well as sensor tampering of a connected vehicle stream equipped to achieve CACC. Our simulation results show that an insider attack can cause significant instability in the CACC vehicle stream. We also illustrate how different countermeasures, such as downgrading to ACC mode, could potentially be used to improve the security and safety of the connected vehicle streams.

TI A max-algebra approach to the robust distributed control of repetitive
   AGV systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; NAVIGATION
AB This paper presents a new approach for distributed control of automatic guided vehicle systems (AGVS) that uses max-algebra formalism to model system operation. The proposed method differs from previous works on performance analysis and control of such systems in that it constructs a feasible schedule by exploiting the repetitive character of the flow of automated guided vehicles. The AGVS is treated as a distributed system composed of autonomous and repetitive processes of AGV flows. Its periodic behaviour follows from the type of operation characterizing the job shops considered. The proposed approach employs a concept of asynchronous traffic semaphores that provide the local mechanism for vehicle flow synchronization. Setting the timing of particular semaphores results in distributed control of vehicle flows possessing self-synchronization capabilities.

DE Reinforcement Learning; self-driving vehicles; traffic rules
AB Autonomous vehicles raise many ethical and moral issues that are not easy to deal with and that, if not addressed correctly, might be an obstacle to the advent of such a technological revolution. These issues are critical because autonomous vehicles will interact with human road users in new ways and current traffic rules might not be suitable for the resulting environment. We consider the problem of learning optimal behavior for autonomous vehicles using Reinforcement Learning in a simple road graph environment. In particular, we investigate the impact of traffic rules on the learned behaviors and consider a scenario where drivers are punished when they are not compliant with the rules, i.e., a scenario in which violation of traffic rules cannot be fully prevented. We performed an extensive experimental campaign, in a simulated environment, in which drivers were trained with and without rules, and assessed the learned behaviors in terms of efficiency and safety. The results show that drivers trained with rules enforcement are willing to reduce their efficiency in exchange for being compliant to the rules, thus leading to higher overall safety.

AB This paper presents a path planning algorithm that can efficiently check for interference with potential obstacles while piecewise continuously computing the required space of moving car-like vehicles using cubic Bezier curves. Our collision-checking algorithm uses trajectories generated from a vehicle's front outer corner and rear inner axle, as well as partially overlapped rectangles. These outer and inner trajectories are computed from the trajectory generated by the center of the rear axle of the vehicle, which considers the dimensions of the vehicle, and the tangential and normal vectors of the trajectory. To validate the continuity and efficacy of our collision-checking algorithm, the collision-checking algorithm is applied to a spline-based RRTau, where the kinematics (or minimum turning radius) of car-like vehicles is satisfied using cubic Bezier curves. We show the benefits of our method through simulations and experimental results by using an autonomous ground vehicle.

AB In this study, a collision avoidance system is presented, based on the information provided by a laser-scanner sensor, in which two actions could be taken in case of danger. Firstly, the system tries to stop the vehicle in order to avoid the accident. If a reduction in speed is not sufficiently effective, the control system takes control of the steering and deviates the vehicle's trajectory in order to escape from the hazardous situation. The control system evaluates the situation and decides the most appropriate action in each case considering free areas on the surroundings using the information of a detailed digital map. This system has been implemented in a vehicle and has been tested with pedestrians and vehicles circulating along the private test track with satisfactory results.

AB Autonomous vehicles need to solve the road keeping problem and the existing solutions based on reinforcement learning are mainly implemented in the simulators. The key of transferring the well-trained models to the real world is bridging the gaps between the simulator scenarios and the real scenarios. In this paper, we propose a method called ReinforcementDriving which explores navigation skills and trajectories from simulator for full-sized road keeping. Based on the real scenario, a driving simulator is firstly established to train an intelligent driving agent. The well-trained ReinforcementDriving agent is evaluated in a real-world scenario. We compare our work with human driving, optimal control-based tracking methods and other reinforcement learning-based lane following methods. The results demonstrate that the ReinforcementDriving system can effectively achieve lane keeping in a realistic scenario with satisfactory running time and lateral accuracy.

AB Micro aerial vehicles, such as multirotors, are particular well suited for the autonomous monitoring, inspection, and surveillance of buildings, e.g., for maintenance in industrial plants. Key prerequisites for the fully autonomous operation of micro aerial vehicles in restricted environments are 3D mapping, real-time pose tracking, obstacle detection, and planning of collision-free trajectories. In this article, we propose a complete navigation system with a multimodal sensor setup for omnidirectional environment perception. Measurements of a 3D laser scanner are aggregated in egocentric local multiresolution grid maps. Local maps are registered and merged to allocentric maps in which the MAV localizes. For autonomous navigation, we generate trajectories in a multi-layered approach: from mission planning over global and local trajectory planning to reactive obstacle avoidance. We evaluate our approach in a GNSS-denied indoor environment where multiple collision hazards require reliable omnidirectional perception and quick navigation reactions.

AB BackgroundGaze is the primary way for pedestrians to obtain clues from traffic scenes before making decisions. Therefore, understanding pedestrian gaze pattern is vital for traffic safety in general and for the design of autonomous vehicles.MethodsIn this study, participants made road-crossing decisions in a naturalistic traffic scene, with an eye-tracker recording their gaze behaviors. We manually encoded the recorded videos with 14,898 fixations, and then analyzed the gaze pattern at three levels from general to specific: gaze towards overall scenes, gaze towards vehicles and gaze towards components of vehicles.FindingsAt the first level, our findings indicate that frequent fixations began to appear at the distance of 100 m and peaked around 5-30 m away from pedestrians. Transversely pedestrians mainly gazed at the two lanes adjacent to themselves. Pedestrians allocated 53% gaze duration to motor vehicles. For a specific vehicle, which is the second level, the gaze duration varied with vehicles' attributes such as distances, sizes, and types. Finally, at the third level, we discovered that pedestrians' gaze duration on different vehicle components varied with the longitudinal distance. As vehicles approach, the main area of fixation expanded from the near side headlight to the whole front and near side, and finally shift to the near side of a vehicle.ImplicationsThe distribution of fixations in space and vehicle components before pedestrian crossing can provide fundamental information for understanding and modeling of pedestrian's road-crossing behaviors. In practice, our findings can guide the timing and position of information displays on autonomous vehicles to facilitate friendly interaction with pedestrians.

AB Due to the hostile marine environment, there will inevitably be unpredictable factors during the operation of unmanned underwater vehicles, including changes in ocean currents, hull dimensions, and velocity measurement uncertainties. An improved finite-time adaptive tracking control issue is considered for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with uncertain dynamics, unknown external disturbances, and unavailable speed information. A state observer is designed to estimate the position and velocity of the vehicle via a neural network (NN) approach. The NN is used to estimate uncertainties and external disturbances. A finite-time controller is designed via backstepping and command filter techniques. A multi-input multi-output (MIMO) filter for AUVs is established, and the corresponding MIMO filter compensation signal is constructed to eliminate the effect of filtering error. All the signals of the closed-loop system are proved to be finite-time bounded. An example with comparison is given to show the effectiveness of our method.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Rule-based autonomous driving systems may suffer from increased complexity with large-scale intercoupled rules, so many researchers are exploring learning-based approaches. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied in designing autonomous driving systems because of its outstanding performance on a wide variety of sequential control problems. However, poor initial performance is a major challenge to the practical implementation of an RL-based autonomous driving system. RL training requires extensive training data before the model achieves reasonable performance, making an RL-based model inapplicable in a real-world setting, particularly when data are expensive. We propose an asynchronous supervised learning (ASL) method for the RL-based end-to-end autonomous driving model to address the problem of poor initial performance before training this RL-based model in real-world settings. Specifically, prior knowledge is introduced in the ASL pre-training stage by asynchronously executing multiple supervised learning processes in parallel, on multiple driving demonstration data sets. After pre-training, the model is deployed on a real vehicle to be further trained by RL to adapt to the real environment and continuously break the performance limit. The presented pre-training method is evaluated on the race car simulator, TORCS (The Open Racing Car Simulator), to verify that it can be sufficiently reliable in improving the initial performance and convergence speed of an end-to-end autonomous driving model in the RL training stage. In addition, a real-vehicle verification system is built to verify the feasibility of the proposed pre-training method in a real-vehicle deployment. Simulations results show that using some demonstrations during a supervised pre-training stage allows significant improvements in initial performance and convergence speed in the RL training stage.

AB Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication techniques enable the collaboration between vehicles and many other entities in the neighboring environment, which could fundamentally improve the perception system for autonomous driving. However, the lack of a public dataset significantly restricts the research progress of collaborative perception. To fill this gap, we present V2X-Sim, a comprehensive simulated multi-agent perception dataset for V2X-aided autonomous driving. V2X-Sim provides: (1) multi-agent sensor recordings from the road-side unit (RSU) and multiple vehicles that enable collaborative perception, (2) multi-modality sensor streams that facilitate multi-modality perception, and (3) diverse ground truths that support various perception tasks. Meanwhile, we build an open-source testbed and provide a benchmark for the state-of-the-art collaborative perception algorithms on three tasks, including detection, tracking and segmentation. V2X-Sim seeks to stimulate collaborative perception research for autonomous driving before realistic datasets become widely available.

AB Featured Application This paper is mainly dedicated to research on a trajectory planning strategy for intelligent vehicle autonomous lane changing in the V2V scenario of an urban multi-vehicle traffic environment. Autonomous driving technology in urban environments is a very important avenue of research. Notably, the question of how to plan safe lane-changing trajectories is a challenge in multi-vehicle traffic environments. In our research, three kinds of polynomial lane changing mathematical models were analyzed and compared. It was found that the fifth polynomial is the most suitable for lane changing trajectories; it is defined as a generalized lane-changing trajectory cluster, whereby the minimum lane change time is determined by the vehicle lateral stability threshold. Here, a collision avoidance algorithm is proposed to eliminate unsafe trajectories. Finally, the TOPSIS algorithm is used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem, and the optimal lane-changing expected trajectory is obtained from the safe trajectory cluster. The simulation results showed improvements in lane-changing efficiency of 6.67% and no collisions in the overtaking condition. In general, the proposed method of identifying the optimal lane changing trajectory can achieve safe, efficient and stable lane changing.

ID NONLINEAR DISTURBANCE OBSERVER; FEEDBACK; SENSOR
AB Identification of human driver intervention is important for the safety and performance of autonomous vehicles. Effective sensing of driver steering torque will enable human drivers to take over controls when needed. Due to the special operation mode of autonomous vehicles, both the human driver and the actuator motor apply active torque to the steering wheel simultaneously during the take-over process. This makes it impossible to detect the human interventions by simply using a torque sensor due to the coupled torques. To tackle this new problem, a model-based strategy to estimate human steering intervention torque is presented for autonomous vehicles in this paper. The model of autonomous steering wheel actuation system is established first. Online human steering torque estimation algorithm is then proposed and the stability condition is given to guarantee both the estimation convergence and accuracy. Numerical simulation is performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed estimator based upon three typical steering intervention cases. The influence factors of the estimation performance are discussed, and a trade-off policy is utilized to determine the optimal estimation gain. Furthermore, experimental studies are carried out on a passenger car equipped with an autonomous driving actuation system. Both the simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

ID ROLLING HORIZON CONTROL; DRIVER; FRAMEWORK
AB Group control of connected and autonomous vehicles on automated highways is challenging for the advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and the automated driving systems (ADS). This paper investigates the differential game-based approach to autonomous convoy control with the aim of deployment on automated highways. Under the noncooperative differential games, the coupled vehicles make their decisions independently while their states are interdependent. The receding horizon Nash equilibrium of the linear-quadratic differential game provides the convoy a distributed state-feedback control strategy. This approach suffers a fundamental issue that neither a Nash equilibrium's existence nor the uniqueness is guaranteed. We convert the individual dynamics-based differential game to a relative dynamics-based optimal control problem that carries all the features of the differential game. The existence of a unique Nash control under the differential game corresponds to a unique solution to the optimal control problem. The latter is shown, as well as the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the presented convey control scheme and how it well suits automated highway driving scenarios.

AB This paper presents the results and the procedure for measuring the efficiency of a single-speed reduction gearbox developed for an autonomous electric utility vehicle. The resulting efficiency of the gearbox was investigated on three different driving cycles, which were selected because their speed profiles most closely matched the expected use of the autonomous vehicle. The required torque for each cycle was obtained from simulations of the vehicle???s driving behaviour including its predicted mass and dimensional parameters after a given driving cycle. The results of this research represent the achieved efficiency and average power loss of the gearbox on each driving cycle. The resulting gearbox efficiency was around 50 % in the predominant areas of driving cycles.

AB There are concerns about the impact that global warming will have on our environment, and which will inevitably result in expanding deserts and rising water levels. While a lot of underwater vehicles are utilized, AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) were considered and chosen, as the most suitable tool for conduction survey concerning these global environmental problems. AUVs can comprehensive survey because the vehicle does not have to be connected to the support vessel by tether cable. When such underwater vehicles are made, it is necessary to consider about the following things. 1) Seawater and Water Pressure Environment, 2) Sink, 3) There are no Gas or Battery Charge Stations, 4) Global Positioning System cannot use, 5) Radio waves cannot use. In the paper, outline of above and how deal about it are explained.

AB Road condition is an important environmental factor for autonomous vehicle control. A dramatic change in the road condition from the nominal status is a source of uncertainty that can lead to a system failure. Once the vehicle encounters an uncertain environment, such as hitting an ice patch, it is too late to reduce the speed, and the vehicle can lose control. To cope with unforeseen uncertainties in advance, we study a proactive robust adaptive control architecture for autonomous vehicles' lane-keeping control problems. In the proposed framework, the data center generates a prior environmental uncertainty estimate with a quantified uncertainty by combining weather forecasts and measurements from anonymous vehicles through a spatio-temporal filter. The prior estimate and quantified uncertainty contribute to designing a robust heading controller and nominal longitudinal velocity for proactive adaptation to each new abnormal condition. Then the control parameters are updated based on posterior information fusion with on-board measurements.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present a practical approach to address the vehicle lateral control problem. The proposed method can overcome practical problems associated with vehicle lane changes on highways. The vehicle state with respect to the road, which is called lateral offset, jumps in camera vision sensors when the vehicle changes lanes. Thus, in this study, we solve the state jump problem by translating it into a new domain called the cylinder domain. In addition, we proposed the design of a parameter-varying controller to overcome the nonlinear term of vehicle dynamics by considering it as a varying parameter. The proposed method does not consider the lateral offset jump when changing lanes. Furthermore, its significant advantage in terms of computation time makes it suitable for implementation in low-cost electronic control units (ECUs). The proposed algorithm is validated using MATLAB/Simulink with the vehicle dynamics analysis program CarSim.

AB We consider the problem of autonomous mobile robot exploration in an unknown environment, taking into account a robot's coverage rate, map uncertainty and state estimation uncertainty. In this article, we present a novel exploration framework for underwater robots operating in cluttered environments, built upon simultaneous localization and mapping with imaging sonar. The proposed system comprises path generation, place recognition forecasting, belief propagation and utility evaluation using a virtual map, which estimates the uncertainty associated with map cells throughout a robot's workspace. We evaluate the performance of this framework in simulated experiments, showing that our algorithm maintains a high coverage rate during exploration while also maintaining low mapping and localization error. The real-world applicability of our framework is also demonstrated on an underwater remotely operated vehicle exploring a harbor environment.

AB Recent advancements in autonomous vehicles and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have presented diverse solutions for vehicle safety and automation. The demand to establish a connection between the two worlds has increased significantly to augment road safety and provide benefits to end users. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) vehicle station leaves a signed trace of its geographic location that is rated as personal data. An attacker can misuse existing V2V communication to track a vehicle's CAM-trace and to avoid misusing CAMs to harm privacy, selectives communication approaches for CAMs should be chosen instead of continuous communication of current CAMs. In this article we propose a VANET topology learning methodology prioritizing anonymization that can use any existing Graph Learning framework. Further, this work enhances the quality of graph models applied to the context of VANETs and autonomous vehicles. With the real coordinates, establishment of a grid of cells and the generation and training of the graph, we can compare different frameworks generally used in these issues and one can chose the one that fits better to each scenario.

AB This article provides an overview of the use of inertial and visual sensors and discusses their prospects in the Arctic navigation of autonomous vehicles. We also examine the fusion algorithms used thus far for integrating vehicle localization measurements as well as the map-matching (MM) algorithms relating position coordinates with road infrastructure. Our review reveals that conventional fusion and MM methods are not enough for navigation in challenging environments, like urban areas and Arctic environments. We also offer new results from testing inertial and optical sensors in vehicle positioning in snowy conditions. We find that the fusion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and inertial navigation systems (INSs) does not provide the accuracy required for automated driving, and the use of optical sensors is challenged by snow covering the road markings. Although extensive further research is needed to solve these problems, the fusion of GNSS, INSs, and optical sensors seems to be the best option due to their complementary nature.

AB Based on the two-lane, symmetric traffic model (STCA), a modified traffic model, including Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication (STCA V2I model, for short), is presented. The combined full-autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles are able to exchange information as well as the intentions of the driver with the surrounding vehicles through V2I communication. In the analyzed case, the communication between vehicles includes the sending of information to vehicles to the rear about the traffic situation ahead. Numerical simulations present a greater dispersion of vehicles with the same traffic density and fewer lane changes, while maintaining the same average vehicle speed as in the STCA model. Spatial-temporal profiles of traffic flow indicate that vehicles moving in accordance with the STCA V2I model are not subject to unnecessary concentration. Numerical studies have shown the positive and negative effects of transmitting traffic congestion messages.

ID MODEL
AB Aggressive vehicle maneuvers such as those performed by professional racing drivers achieve high agility motion at the edge of handling limits. These aggressive maneuvers can be used to design human-inspired active safety features for next-generation "accident-free " vehicles. We present a motion planning and control design for autonomous aggressive vehicle maneuvers. The motion planner takes advantages of the sparse stable trees and the enhanced rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithms. The use of the sparsity property helps to reduce the computational cost of the RRT* method by removing non-useful nodes in each iteration and therefore to rapidly converge to the optimal solution. The proposed motion control design allows the vehicle to operate outside the stability region to accomplish a safe, agile maneuver. A safety region is computed to augment the stability region and the motion control is built on a modified nonlinear model predictive control method. We implement the proposed planner and controller and demonstrate the autonomous aggressive maneuvers on a 1/7-scale racing vehicle platform. Comparison with human expert driver and other existing methods is also presented to demonstrate the performance and robustness. Note to Practitioners-Motion planning and control of human driver-inspired aggressive vehicle maneuvers is a challenging task because of high-agility, unstable fast vehicle motions. This paper is motivated by addressing this challenge in autonomous driving technologies. Instead of restricting vehicle motions within a stability region that is taken by existing methods, we augment the conservative stability region to a safety region with guaranteed performance. To improve the computational efficiency of sampling-based motion planners, we take advantage of sparsity and also integration of a nonlinear predictive control method to compute feasible vehicle motion in searching space. The stability of the vehicle motion controller and sub-optimality of the motion planner are analyzed and guaranteed. Using a scaled vehicle testbed, we validate and compare the proposed motion planning and control design with other existing methods and human expert driver. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance than the other methods and comparable with human expert driving skills.

AB This study proposes a distributed, real-time and easy-to-extend strategy for missions of autonomous aircraft squadrons, which considerably improves the autonomy of the squa-dron. The squadron is called autonomous because there is no need for pilots or remote con-trol. The fleet is able to exhibit a collective behavior without any communication among the aerial vehicles, and if one aircraft is lost, the other vehicles are not affected. Furthermore, the generated number of time steps is kept linear as the number of aerial vehicles increases, and each aircraft is capable of avoiding static and dynamic obstacles, even in the presence of noise. The proposed designing pattern reduces the programming effort necessary for including new formations in the scheme. Besides, all subroutines' run-ning times are finished within the proposed real-time scheduling. Conclusions are vali-dated by means of simulations.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Processing dynamic vehicle detection and tracking tasks based on three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds is computationally overconsuming, which hinders its practical realization on embedded devices. To release the processing burden, we attempt to transform 3-D LiDAR data to 360 FOCUS points (FS points) before this task. Then, a novel detecting and tracking dynamic vehicle approach is designed based on the obtained 2-D scan. The approach classifies the FS points into static points and unstatic points by generating a Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory-based static obstacle map (SOM). At first, the SOM is predicted and updated by interacting with the model-free dynamic vehicle clustering and tracking module (MFCTM). Then, the unstatic points determined in SOM are clustered in the MFCTM, and each obtained cluster is initialized as a new track or assigned to the existing tracks. Finally, the dynamic states are calculated. The computational burden performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the other state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, it is also applied to three simulation scenarios and three field tests, and its validity is demonstrated through comparison with the results of the L-shape-based tracking method.

AB Autonomous logistics vehicles are characterised by large changes in mass and their performances are greatly influenced by slope. In addition, sensors on autonomous vehicles are expensive and difficult to be installed considering application environment. To address these problems, a novel integrated estimation strategy for vehicle mass and road slope, which is based on the joint iteration of multi-model recursive least square (MMRLS) and Sage-Husa adaptive filter with the strong tracking filter (SH-STF), is proposed by utilising information involving speed, nominal engine torque and inherent parameters of vehicles. Firstly, due to the separate slowly-changing and time-dependent characteristics, the vehicle mass and road slope are estimated by using MMRLS and SH-STF separately. Secondly, the longitudinal dynamics gain and the steering dynamics gain are calculated separately based on each model's residual probability distribution. Then, the two estimations module are combined by employing an iterative algorithm. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified by simulation and real vehicle tests. The tests result reveals that the estimation algorithm can effective estimate vehicle mass and road slope in real-time under straight going and steering conditions.

AB Collision or occlusion avoidance is one of the most important functions of autonomous unmanned vehicles when maneuvering or conducting missions, including monitoring or following targets in environments with various obstacles such as trees and buildings. While considering the minimum distance to obstacles or approximating the shape of obstacles is convenient, incorporating the shape of the original obstacles, sometimes, can provide more effective strategies for collision and occlusion avoidance of obstacles with complex shapes or arrangements. This article presents an obstacle magnification algorithm that magnifies but retains the original shape of the detected obstacles. Two simple parameters can adjust the position and magnification of the virtual obstacles. The simulation and outdoor experimental results for the obstacle magnification, implemented on an onboard embedded system, demonstrate the effectiveness of this concept, which should be useful in various applications for small autonomous multirotor aircrafts.

AB As driving scenarios and autonomous vehicles (AVs) become increasingly intricating, there is an increasing need for innovative frameworks that can enhance and test AV capabilities across diverse scenarios. At present, the design and validation for AVs predominantly rely on simulation software or real-road testing methodologies. However, these approaches possess inherent limitations, leading to inaccuracy, reduced efficiency, and potential hazards during the development process. This letter reports our first DHW (decentralized and hybrid workshop) on Scenarios Engineering (SE), that aims to calibrate and validate AV modules through advanced scenarios. Specifically, the DHW discusses combining SE with existing simulation software and real-road testing strategies, enabling developers to maximize the advantages of each approach while ensuring the safety and efficacy in the development of autonomous vehicles. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of enhancing realism of simulation scenarios in the aspects of both content and appearance. Furthermore, the use of scenarios engineering is explored in order to enhance the diversity and safety of real-road testing by means of integrating virtual and physical components.

AB Emerging technologies play important roles in shaping future mobility systems and impacting sustainability performance of the transportation sector in major economies, such as the United States of America (USA) and China. This study applies a life cycle framework to demonstrate and evaluate the synergies of the following four emerging transportation system technologies both qualitatively and quantitatively: (1) wireless charging; (2) shared mobility services; (3) autonomous driving; and (4) battery electric vehicles (BEV). The new concept of a wireless charging and shared autonomous battery electric vehicle (W+SABEV) system is introduced and modeled. First, an analytical framework is presented to assess the pros and cons of the W+SABEV system vs. a conventional plug-in charging BEV system, adhering to the principles of sustainable mobility and highlighting the impacts and dynamics of the disruptive technologies on the key parameters that define sustainable mobility. Second, a quantitative analysis presents the synergies of the four technologies by modeling a W+SABEV system and demonstrates that the combination of the four technologies can shorten the payback time of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission burdens for infrastructure and vehicles. Compared to a plug-in charging BEV system, a W+SABEV system pays back the additional GHG emission burdens of wireless charging infrastructure deployment within 5 years if the wireless charging utility factor (ratio of en route charging time vs. trip time) is above 19%.

AB Some criticize the data-driven study of driverless car ethics for relying on deterministic crash scenarios where the focus should be on minimizing the occurrence of accidents instead. Indeed, decisions in road traffic are taken in the domain of risk. A relevant ethical question is, however, whether autonomous vehicles should actually minimize an accident's probability or rather balance the accident's probability and severity. While ethicists' introspections might lead them to different conclusions, a participatory paradigm in ethics demands to include laypeople's intuitions into the societal debate. In three online studies, we found that the mere minimization of accident probability in ethical dilemmas does not correspond to the views of our sample. Our participants favor a balanced consideration of accident probability and severity. This remains true even if the underlying dilemma is based on a more realistic scenario of allocating minor risks among road users. Our findings furthermore illustrate that trolley problems may be informative for autonomous vehicles and emphasize the importance of transparency if manufacturers and the public do not agree on guiding principles in road traffic.

AB In this paper, an event-triggered neural network control method is proposed for autonomous surface vehicles subject to uncertainties and input constraints over wireless network. An event-triggered mechanism with three logic rules is employed to determine the wireless data transmission of states and control inputs. An event-driven neural network is applied to approximate the uncertainties using aperiodic sampled states. In addition, a predictor is employed to update the weights of neural network. An event-based bounded kinetic control law is applied to address the actuator constraints. The advantage of the proposed event-triggered neural network control approach is that the network traffic can be reduced while guaranteeing system stability and speed following performance. The closed-loop control system is proved to be input-to-state stable via cascade theory. The Zeno behavior can be avoided via the proposed event-triggered neural network control approach. A simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered neural network control approach for autonomous surface vehicles.

AB Among autonomous surface vehicles, sailing robotics could be a promising technology for long-term missions and semipersistent presence in the oceans. Autonomy of such vehicles in terms of energy will be achieved by renewable solar and wind power sources. Autonomy in terms of sailing decision will be achieved by innovative perception and navigation modules. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a complete hardware and software architecture for an autonomous sailing robot. The hardware architecture includes a comprehensive set of sensors and actuators as well as a solar panel and a wind turbine. For obstacle detection, a segmentation is performed on data coming from an omnidirectional camera coupled with an inertial measurement unit and a sonar. For navigation and control of the vehicle, a potential-based reactive path-planning approach is proposed. The specific sailboat kinematic constraints are turned into virtual obstacles to compute a feasible and optimal heading in terms of cost of gybe and tack maneuver as well as safety relative to obstacle danger. Finally, field test experiments are presented to validate the various components of the system.

AB Autonomous air refueling is an important capability for the future deployment of unmanned air vehicles, because it permits unmanned air vehicles to be ferried in flight to overseas theaters of operation instead of being shipped unassembled in containers. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of precise and reliable boom and receptacle autonomous air refueling, without a human operator or supervisor, for nonmicrosized unmanned air vehicles. The system is composed of a vision sensor based on active deformable contour algorithms (visual snakes) and its relative navigation system integrated with a boom controller. The sensor camera is mounted on the tanker aircraft near the boom and images a single passive target image.painted near the refueling receptacle on a receiver unmanned air vehicle. Controllers are developed in the paper for the refueling boom, and the stationkeeping controllers of the receiver unmanned air vehicle and tanker aircraft. Performance and feasibility ofthe total system is demonstrated by simulated docking maneuvers in the presence of various levels of turbulence. Results presented in the paper show that the integrated sensor and controller enables precise boom and receptacle air refueling, including consideration

ID QUADROTOR
AB For unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), landing on a moving vehicle robustly is an open challenge, especially under cluttered surroundings with the presence of unknown obstacles. Those undesired environmental factors could induce collisions and thus affect flight safety significantly. Currently, there are few solutions to address such a challenge. In this paper, we propose a systematic autonomous landing scheme that enables the robust autonomous landing performance of a quadrotor UAV. The proposed scheme integrates target detection, state estimation, trajectory planning, and landing control. The position and attitude information of the target ground vehicle and the test quadrotor are estimated by the onboard vision system and GPS. In order to detect landing markers at different altitudes, a particular landing pad with an Apriltag bundle is implemented. As a typical aerial-terrestrial cooperation system, the trajectory planner of the quadrotor updates continuously to avoid obstacles via real-time sensing and re-planning. A finite state machine is used to label the current flight status and triggers the control laws correspondingly. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated in a high-fidelity simulator with environmental obstacles.

AB After the awareness-raising of recent years for coping with the global societal, economic and environmental challenges, the need for sustainable planning in the transport sector has become even more evident. Initiatives aiming at promoting sustainable and innovative mobility solutions, especially in urban areas where mobility needs are higher and transport problems are more intense, have been launched by different organizations around the world. In this context, autonomous electric vehicles are emerging as a promising solution; however, they are accompanied by new infrastructure requirements, along with safety concerns. Policymakers will be confronted with an array of choices, such as plug-in or wireless, dynamic or stationary charging and mixed flow with conventional vehicles or dedicated lanes, taking into account the uncertain impacts of innovation on safety and sustainability. Within this scope, these infrastructure alternatives are evaluated and prioritized, for the first time, in the present study, through the combined application of two hybrid multi-criteria analysis models, with the participation of experts. The analysis is based on a set of safety and sustainability criteria. Road safety and exposure to electromagnetic radiation emerge as the most important criteria, with the optimum solution-based on current data-consisting of plug-in charging and the circulation of autonomous electric vehicles in dedicated lanes.

AB Autonomous vehicles and smart roads are not new concepts and the undergoing development to empower the vehicles for higher levels of automation has achieved initial milestones. However, the transportation industry and relevant research communities still require making considerable efforts to create smart and intelligent roads for autonomous driving. To achieve the results of such efforts, the CCAM infrastructure is a game changer and plays a key role in achieving higher levels of autonomous driving. In this paper, we present a smart infrastructure and autonomous driving capabilities enhanced by CCAM infrastructure. Meaning thereby, we lay down the technical requirements of the CCAM infrastructure: identify the right set of the sensory infrastructure, their interfacing, integration platform, and necessary communication interfaces to be interconnected with upstream and downstream solution components. Then, we parameterize the road and network infrastructures (and automated vehicles) to be advanced and evaluated during the research work, under the very distinct scenarios and conditions. For validation, we demonstrate the machine learning algorithms in mobility applications such as traffic flow and mobile communication demands. Consequently, we train multiple linear regression models and achieve accuracy of over 94% for predicting aforementioned demands on a daily basis. This research therefore equips the readers with relevant technical information required for enhancing CCAM infrastructure. It also encourages and guides the relevant research communities to implement the CCAM infrastructure towards creating smart and intelligent roads for autonomous driving.

AB Lateral control of an autonomous guided vehicle is influenced strongly by both the longitudinal speed and the position input command ( magnitude of the reference signal) of the vehicle. For that reason some suitable strategies for governing the vehicle are adaptive and robust controllers. In this article, an adaptive scheme which combines a model reference approach with a fractional order adjustment rule for a feedforward gain adjustment is proposed. Two parameters can be tuned to obtain robustness with respect to variations in speed and magnitude of the reference signal: Adaptation gain, and derivative order of the adjustment rule. A model is developed for the vehicle, the design procedure is discussed, and simulation results are obtained to show the advantages the proposed fractional adaptation scheme.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will form the backbone of future next-generation intelligent transportation systems (ITS) providing travel comfort, road safety, along with a number of value-added services. Such a transformation-which will be fuelled by concomitant advances in technologies for machine learning (ML) and wireless communications-will enable a future vehicular ecosystem that is better featured and more efficient. However, there are lurking security problems related to the use of ML in such a critical setting where an incorrect ML decision may not only be a nuisance but can lead to loss of precious lives. In this paper, we present an in-depth overview of the various challenges associated with the application of ML in vehicular networks. In addition, we formulate the ML pipeline of CAVs and present various potential security issues associated with the adoption of ML methods. In particular, we focus on the perspective of adversarial ML attacks on CAVs and outline a solution to defend against adversarial attacks in multiple settings.

AB According to World Health Organization (WHO), the leading cause of fatalities and injuries is rear-ending collision in vehicles. The critical challenge of the technologically rich transportation system is to reduce the chances of accidents between vehicles. For this purpose, it is especially important to analyze the factors that are the cause of accidents. Based on these factors' results, this paper presents a driver assistance system for collision avoidance. There are many factors involved in collisions in the existing literature from which we identified some factors which can affect the accident occurrence probability. However, with advancements in the technologies of autonomous vehicles, these factors can be controlled using an onboard driver assistance system. We used MATLAB's Fuzzy Inference System Tool to analyze the categories of accident contributing factors. Fuzzy results are validated using the VOMAS agent in the NetLogo simulation model. The proposed system can inform the vehicle's automated system when chances of an accident are higher so that the vehicle may take control from the driver. The proposed research is extremely helpful in handling various kinds of factors involved in accidents. The results of the experiments demonstrated that multi-factor-enabled vehicles could better avoid collision as compared to other vehicles.

TI Genetic optimization of a vehicle fuzzy decision system for

   cooperation
AB This paper presents a case study in which an autonomous vehicle must cooperate with a supposedly manually driven one to carry out a cross-roads manaceuvre without risk The main difference with other intersection systems is that the manual vehicle is driven without paying attention to the controlled one, so a cooperative coordination between vehicles is not possible. In this case is the autonomous vehicle the responsible of adapting its speed to the state of the manually driven, for finalizing the manceuvre both in a safe and efficient way.
   For this purpose, a three layer hierarchical fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) is developed with the aim of dealing with such a situation: the first layer is in charge of detecting the kind of manceuvre that will be necessary; the second, in the case that an intersection is going to be crossed, is in charge of determining the suitable speed to do so without risk; and the third acts on the vehicle's real speed. The first two layers are implemented by means of fuzzy decision systems, with the second being optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA). The GA evaluates candidates in random simulated scenarios taking into account different factors to calculate the fitness. These factors are: implementing a free collision policy, avoiding unnecessary stops, and terminating the manceuvre as rapidly as possible. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the predefined-time formation tracking problem of networked autonomous surface vehicles (NASVs) with external disturbances under limited communication resources. To solve this complicated problem, a novel hierarchical event-triggered control scheme with predefined-time stability is proposed, being consisted of the distributed event-triggered estimator with fully discontinuous communication and the local predefined-time controller to respectively estimate the virtual leader state information and regulate the local state of each autonomous surface vehicle. Particularly, the employed distributed event-triggered estimator can significantly reduce the control signals update frequency and the communication burden, and the local predefined-time controller based on the sliding manifold can guarantee that the system forms the designated formation and reaches a stable state within a predefined time in the settable time interval. On the basis of Lyapunov stability theory, the sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the predefined-time convergence and stability of the closed-loop system are derived. Finally, the simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The multi-autonomous underwater vehicles (Multi-AUVs) cluster is an important means to solve the marine tasks effectively. The heterogeneous Multi-AUVs are constrained by cooperative relationship, and a model of multi-autonomous underwater vehicles role-based collaborative task planning is proposed. The Multi-AUVs are set to different roles depending on the functional properties. To analyze the accountability of each role, and to ensure the reliability, the desired behavior and the estimate state of each role are described in the model. Task allocation needs to be implemented dynamically in path planning, for the existing of the cooperative relationships and the demand of tasks changes. Role-based task assessment and allocation methods are proposed to achieve dynamic adjustment of roles according to task requirements. Due to poor underwater communication conditions, the implicit coordination framework is implied to the coordinate information interaction to compensate the large delays in underwater communications and the reliance between Multi-AUVs. To adapt to the implicit collaborative framework and poor communication conditions, a variable communication radius (contract network) is proposed. The simulation result shows that the proposed method has well performance.

AB Platoon of connected autonomous vehicles has the potential to increase traffic flow while also alleviating congestion. However, there are several challenging problems with heterogeneous connected autonomous vehicles control currently. Platoons with heterogeneous vehicles are especially susceptible to the negative effects of wireless communication. A multi-objective heterogeneous asymmetric sliding mode control strategy is proposed in this paper to solve this problem. In this paper, a nonlinear vehicle dynamic model is considered. Then, a sliding mode controller is designed to achieve consensus. Moreover, Riccati inequality and Lyapunov analysis are used to find the controller's gains and guarantee Lyapunov stability and string stability with the linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is utilized to find the Pareto optimal heterogeneous asymmetric degrees regarding the overall performance of the platoon, including tracking index, fuel consumption and acceleration standard deviation. The results show that the proposed strategy can effectively deal with platoons of heterogeneous vehicles while ensuring stability. At the same time, Pareto optimal heterogeneous asymmetric degrees can be obtained for each vehicle in the platoon. The proposed method improves platoon's tracking ability by 76.2%, fuel economy by 3.53% and driving comfort by 3.52%.

DE Autoencoder; deep learning; unmanned aerial vehicles; autonomous flight;
   candidate waypoint generation
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles may collide with obstacles, such as trees or other unmanned aerial vehicles, while flying. A waypoint-based flight path is an approach to avoid such obstacles. To specify waypoints for the safe flight of unmanned aerial vehicles, it is necessary to define a flight path in advance by analyzing the flight records of unmanned aerial vehicles and thereby designate the waypoints automatically. However, there is a problem in that pilots tend to make errors in controlling unmanned aerial vehicles and collecting flight records. This article proposes a method to generate candidate waypoints for a flight path by removing such unintended flight records. In this method, images representing the positions in the collected flight records are generated. The candidate waypoints are generated as positions corresponding to the overlapping pixels of the images generated via image accumulation based on the flight records and the ones generated by accumulating the images reconstructed using an Autoencoder. The unmanned aerial vehicles can be set the waypoints for an autonomous flight using the candidate waypoints. An experiment was conducted in a university to generate candidate waypoints for road monitoring. The results obtained using the proposed method and K-means algorithm were compared. The candidate waypoints generated using the proposed method were reduced by 84.21% compared to those generated using the K-means algorithm.

TI PotNet: Pothole detection for autonomous vehicle system using

SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Advancement in vision-based techniques has enabled the autonomous vehicle system (AVS) to understand the driving scene in depth. The capability of autonomous vehicle system to understand the scene, and detecting the specific object depends on the strong feature representation of such objects. However, pothole objects are difficult to identify due to their non-uniform structure in challenging, and dynamic road environments. Existing approaches have shown limited performance for the precise detection of potholes. The study on the detection of potholes, and intelligent driving behaviour of autonomous vehicle system is little explored in existing articles. Hence, here, an improved prototype model, which is not only truly capable of detecting the potholes but also shows its intelligent driving behaviour when any pothole is detected, is proposed. The prototype is developed using a convolutional neural network with a vision camera to explore, and validates the potential, and autonomy of its driving behaviour in the prepared road environment. The experimental analysis of the proposed model on various performance measures have obtained accuracy, sensitivity, and F-measure of 99.02%, 99.03%, and 98.33%, respectively, which are comparable with the available state-of-art techniques.

ID LATERAL CONTROL; DYNAMICS
AB In this work, the coupled control of the lateral and the longitudinal dynamics of an autonomous vehicle is addressed. As a first step, a multi-body modeling technique is used to develop a four wheeled vehicle planar model. This technique considers the vehicle as a robot consisting of articulated bodies. The geometric description of the vehicle system is derived using the modified Denavit-Hartenberg parameterization and then the dynamic model of the vehicle is computed by applying a recursive method used in robotics, namely Euler-Lagrange based Algorithm. The validation of the developed vehicle model was then conducted using an automotive simulator, the Scaner-Studio simulator. The developed vehicle model is then used to derive coupled control laws for the lateral and the longitudinal vehicle dynamics. Two coupled controllers are proposed: In the first controller, the control is realized using Lyapunov control techniques while in the second one an Immersion and Invariance with sliding mode approach is used. Both of the controllers aim to ensure a robust tracking of the reference trajectory and the desired speed while taking into account the strong coupling between the lateral and the longitudinal vehicle dynamics. In fact, the coupled controller is a key step for the vehicle safety handling, especially in coupled maneuvers such as lane-change maneuvers, obstacle avoidance maneuvers and combined maneuvers in critical driving situations.
   The developed controllers were validated in simulation under Matlab/Simulink using experimental data. Subsequently, an experimental validation of the proposed controllers was conducted using a robotized vehicle (Renault-ZOE) present in the Heudiasyc laboratory within the Equipex Robotex project.

However, accurate manipulation requires the ROV to have excellent maneuverability, which limits the design flexibility and capabilities of the vehicle. This paper instead proposes the use of a small, deployable, and highly maneuverable agent ROV as an end effector, which is connected to the main vehicle by a flexible smart cable. This cable tracks the relative position of the agent, thus eliminating the need for additional positioning sensors and allowing significant size reduction for the agent. In addition, to compensate for the limited lifting capability of the small agent, it is equipped with active buoyancy control. The proposed system can be applied to common autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with minimal modification for coarse station-keeping. The whole system is operated as a conventional AUV under normal operating conditions, but the agent is deployed when manipulation or precise monitoring is necessary. Numerical simulations were performed for dynamic analysis and prototype design of the agent vehicle, and this design was implemented as a model-scale system for experiments in a test tank. This implementation confirmed the feasibility and potential capabilities of the proposed manipulation system concept. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles have evolved rapidly in the recent past for their widespread utilization for both commercial and military purposes. It is extremely desirable while designing unmanned aerial vehicles, to enable them to accomplish their tasks with little human intervention. To achieve full autonomy, an optimal and robust control algorithm that covers complete flight phases is needed. Being propriety in nature, very little information is available in the literature that encompasses all modalities related to UAV design and development. Literature is even more dreath when it comes to near-actual implementation of the developed strategies. This study provides a comprehensive and in-depth review of the most recent and state-of-the-art control and estimation techniques for UAVs, as well as an examination of the flight phases in which those controllers and estimators are utilized. This study also suggests UAV-related research that would improve the overall quality of UAV design and facilitate the transition from software simulations to hardware implementation. Through this paper, a comprehensive platform is established that not only examines the controller and state estimators used for the development of autonomous UAVs but also identifies and discusses the limitations of existing research. In conclusion, several practical implementation considerations and future research directions are proposed.

AB In order to improve the path following performance and solve the stability problems of autonomous distributed drive electric buses, this paper proposed a path following and lateral-yaw-roll stability integrated control method. Firstly, to cope with the varying speed during different maneuvers and roll motion of autonomous distributed drive electric buses, a nonlinear 4-DOF vehicle dynamic model which includes rolling and longitudinal movement is established. Secondly, a hierarchical control method is built, in the upper layer, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to generate the control inputs, which is obtained through an optimization problem including path following error and vehicle stability condition, especially the roll stability for buses, and for the lower layer, the torque of each drive wheel is distributed through solving an optimization problem about drive requirement and tire utilization. Finally, the validation of the proposed method is carried out through TruckSim-Simulink co-simulation, the results illustrate that both following accuracy and vehicle stability are obtained more effectively than the popular linear MPC method, especially roll stability is guaranteed under extreme condition.

AB In this paper, a method is presented for antidisturbance constrained control of autonomous underwater vehicles subject to uncertainties and constraints. The uncertainties stem from uncertain hydrodynamic parameters, modeling errors, and unknown forces due to the ocean currents in an underwater environment. An antidisturbance constrained controller is developed by designing a command governor and a disturbance observer. Specifically, the disturbance observer is developed to estimate the lumped disturbance composed of parametric model uncertainties, modeling errors, and unknown environmental forces. The command governor is designed for optimizing command signals in the receding horizon within the state and input constraints. The command governor is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem. To facilitate online implementations, a neurodynamic optimization method based on a one-layer recurrent neural network is employed for solving the quadratic optimization problem subject to inequality constraints with finite-time convergence. The efficacy of the proposed antidisturbance constrained control method for autonomous underwater vehicles is substantiated via simulations and comparisons.

AB The paper proposes a method for the correct by design coordination of autonomous driving systems (ADS). It builds on previous results on collision avoidance policies and the modeling of ADS by combining descriptions of their static environment in the form of maps, and the dynamic behavior of their vehicles. An ADS is modeled as a dynamic system involving a set of vehicles coordinated by a Runtime that based on vehicle positions on a map and their kinetic attributes, computes free spaces for each vehicle. Vehicles are bounded to move within the corresponding allocated free spaces. We provide a correct by design safe control policy for an ADS, if its vehicles and the Runtime respect corresponding assume-guarantee contracts. The result is established by showing that the composition of assume-guarantee contracts is an inductive invariant that entails ADS safety. We show that it is practically possible to define speed control policies for vehicles that comply with their contracts. Furthermore, we show that traffic rules can be specified in a linear-time temporal logic as a class of formulas that constrain vehicle speeds. The main result is that, given a set of traffic rules, it is possible to derive free-space policies of the Runtime such that the resulting system behavior is safe by design with respect to the rules.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are in-demand future technologies for intelligent driving applications. The fast-decision-making techniques like artificial intelligence (AI) are required to train AV. Recently deep learning achieves tremendous results in fast computation and training models. Due to the sensing devices' data generation, AI has been used to process big data for making the appropriate decision in motion. Full automation system of AV can be achieved using AI techniques, and it is the recent research focus. In this paper, AI and deep learning-based approaches are used for AV in the applications such as vehicle detection, localization & mapping, and decision-making. With the large structural and variations of vehicle appearances, vehicle detection is a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed an efficient vehicle object detection method using a multi-task 2D deep convolution neural network (CNN) and a Cartesian product. Then the network loss is optimized with an evolutionary algorithm called grasshopper optimization. In this paper, localization and mapping are performed using the Kalman filter with fast correlation-based elephant herding optimization. The Kalman filter is used here to address the limitation on the sensory unit. Decision-making on vehicle parking of AV is done using deep bagging CNN. This proposed system works better than the traditional AV approach.

AB Autonomous driving technology, especially motion planning and the trajectory tracking method, is the foundation of an intelligent interconnected vehicle, which needs to be improved urgently. Currently, research on path planning methods has improved, but few of the current studies consider the vehicle's nonlinear characteristics in the reference model, due to the heavy computational effort. At present, most of the algorithms are designed by a linear vehicle model in order to achieve the real-time performance at the cost of lost accuracy. To achieve a better performance, the dynamics and kinematics characteristics of the vehicle must be simulated, and real-time computing ensured at the same time. In this article, a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy-model-based closed-loop rapidly exploring random tree algorithm with on-line re-planning process is applied to build the motion planner, which effectively improves the vehicle performance of dynamic obstacle avoidance, and plans the local obstacle avoidance path in line with the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. A nonlinear vehicle model is integrated into the motion planner design directly. For fast local path planning mission, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy modelling method is applied to the modeling process in the planner design, so that the vehicle state can be directly utilized into the path planner to create a feasible path in real-time. The performance of the planner was evaluated by numerical simulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed motion planner can effectively generate a reference trajectory that guarantees driving efficiency with a lower re-planning rate.

ID MOBILE ROBOT; NAVIGATION; STRATEGIES; GUIDANCE
AB Autonomous vehicles can be used in a variety of applications such as hazardous environments or intelligent highway systems. Fuzzy logic is an appropriate choice for this application as it can describe human behavior well. This paper proposes two fuzzy logic controllers for the steering and the velocity control of an autonomous vehicle. The two controllers are divided into separate modules to mimic the way humans think while driving. The steering controller is divided into four modules; one module drives the vehicle toward the target while another module avoids collision with obstacles. A third module drives the vehicle through mazes. The fourth module adjusts the final orientation of the target. The velocity controller is divided into three modules; the first module speeds up the vehicle to reach the target and slows it down as it moves toward the target. The second module controls the velocity in the neighborhood of obstacles. A third module controls the velocity of the vehicle as it turns sharp corners. A method for automatic tuning of the first module of the velocity controller is proposed to stabilize the velocity of the vehicle as it approaches the target. Two examples to demonstrate the interaction among the seven control modules are included. Results of the simulation are compared with those in the literature. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The introduction of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs), expected within the next decade, can transform the car into a service, accelerate electrification of the transport sector, and allow for large scale control of electric vehicle charging. In this work, we investigate the potential for this system to provide aggregated storage when combined with intermittent renewable energy sources. We develop a simulation methodology for the optimization of vehicle charging in the context of a virtual power plant or microgrid, with and without grid connection or distributed dispatchable generators. The model considers aggregate storage availability from vehicles based on transport patterns taking into account the necessary vehicle redistribution. We investigate the case of a grid-connected VPP with rooftop solar and the case of a isolated microgrid with solar, wind, and dispatchable generation. We conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to study the effect of several parameters on the results for both cases.

TI Efficiency of Semi-Autonomous and Fully Autonomous Bus Services in
   Trunk-and-Branches Networks
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID VEHICLES; MODEL
AB Automation technology is expected to change the public transport sector radically in the future. One rising issue is whether to embrace the intermediate stage of semi-autonomous buses or to wait until fully autonomous buses are available. This paper proposes a cost model of bus operations considering automation technology. The generalized cost, which is the sum of waiting, riding, operating, and capital cost, is modeled for conventional, semi-autonomous, and fully autonomous bus services on a generic trunk-and-branches network. Semi-autonomous buses achieve reduced unit operating cost through automated platooning on the corridor. The relative efficiency of the different services is studied under a range of scenarios for commercial speed, network structure, and demand distribution. Analytical and numerical results show that fully autonomous buses exhibit great potential through reduced operating and waiting costs even if the additional capital cost is high. The advantages of semi-autonomous buses are weaker and most prominent in networks with low demand along a long corridor such as interurban networks. For both automation levels a commercial speed comparable to conventional vehicles is crucial. The established criteria provide input to planners and operators for understanding the potential of automated bus services.

AB Thermal management in automobiles is necessary to minimize energy usage while achieving a high level of occupant thermal perception. As the freedom of in-vehicle activity increases with autonomous driving, considering convenience becomes even more important, and, at the same time, the need for thermal management in electric vehicles is expected to increase. While it is necessary to consider the characteristics of the future mobility environment, there is still a lack of research that takes into account these changes in thermal management and proposes future research directions. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore basic research directions based on national R&D project cases and to provide a comprehensive overview. The environmental changes that need to be considered in thermal management research include the diversification of future transportation types and usage purpose diversification, the characteristics of electric vehicles, changes in the interior and exterior design of autonomous vehicles, personalized air conditioning environments, and dynamic thermal management according to occupant in-vehicle activity. This study provides an understanding of the overall field, and can help identify challenges, solutions, and ideas. Although this study provides conceptual considerations for research directions, future research is needed to identify detailed factors related to technology, environment, and human factors.

AB Merging areas on freeways are key locations due to vehicles' fixed lateral differences. Though, such challenges are considerably unnecessary with connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology. In recent times, the existing studies focusing on CAV methodology intend to merge the maneuvers among an incoming ramp and a single-lane mainline. This paper develops the lane optimization model for CAV system for solving the complexities of multilane merging areas. The two major stages of the proposed model are lane changing and lane merging control optimization. For performing the lane changing control optimization, a self adaptive-electric fish optimization (SA-EFO)-based "cooperative lane changing control (CLCC)" is developed. The significant aim of the SA-EFO-based CLCC is to exploit the average velocity concerning the entire vehicles. Once the lane changing control strategies is done, lane merging control is performed through "cooperative merging control" optimization using the same proposed SA-EFO with the intention of maximizing the vehicle's average velocity. Finally, the simulation of the designed model reveals that the developed model is superior to existing merging algorithms over the existing models under different demand scenarios.

AB We present a new simulation framework for learning control policies for autonomous vehicles (AVs) based on real-world vehicle data and maps. The framework we propose consists of three major components: a) creating a detailed lane-level map (i.e., a high definition (HD) map) for a region of interest, b) generating an environment on the HD-map using the sensor outputs (e.g., GPS, radar) from vehicles driving in the same region, and c) learning a control policy based on the realistic environment constructed. We created the lane-level HD-maps using open street maps (OSM) and aerial imagery, fromwhichwe extracted the lane-level marking and edge features. The extracted image features are then utilized to calculate higher level attributes (e.g., curvature, heading, cross-sections etc.) for each point in the HD-map. The data acquired from vehicle sensors is combined with the constructed map to create a realistic environment. Based on the constructed environment, we learned a policy to control the vehicle laterally using a reinforcement learning algorithm and longitudinally using proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework works well, offering a flexible and scalable solution for learning control policies for AVs in realistic environments.

AB Automated vehicle safety systems present a challenge for transportation safety: the more a vehicle does to manage a driver's safety, the lower the demand placed on the driver. This can lead drivers to become less attentive, leaving them with insufficient information when faced with a situation that requires them to quickly resume control of the automated task. Keeping drivers aware of their situation and knowledgeable about the capabilities and limitations of a semi-autonomous system, so that they can intervene when appropriate, is critical to the success of automated transportation.

AB In this article, a neural adaptive intermittent output feedback control is investigated for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with full-state quantitative designs (FSQDs). To achieve the prespecified tracking performance determined by quantitative indices (e.g., overshoot, convergence time, steady-state accuracy, and maximum deviation) at both kinematic and kinetic levels, FSQDs are designed by transforming constrained AUV model into an unconstrained model via one-sided hyperbolic cosecant boundaries and nonlinear mapping functions. An intermittent sampling-based neural estimator (ISNE) is devised to reconstruct the matched and mismatched lumped disturbances as well as immeasurable velocity states of transformed AUV model, where only system outputs after intermittent sampling are required. Using the estimations of ISNE and the system outputs after triggering, an intermittent output feedback control law incorporated with hybrid threshold event-triggered mechanism (HTETM) is designed to achieve ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB) results. Simulation results are provided and analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the studied control strategy with application to an omnidirectional intelligent navigator (ODIN).

AB With the improvements in sensor performance (cameras, Lidars) and the application of deep learning in object detection, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are gradually becoming more notable. After 2019, AV has produced a wave of enthusiasm, and many papers on object detection were published, boasting both practicality and innovation. Due to hardware limitations, it is difficult to accomplish accurate and reliable environment perception using a single sensor. However, multi-sensor fusion technology provides an acceptable solution. Considering the AV cost and object detection accuracy, both the traditional and existing literature on object detection using image and point-cloud was reviewed in this paper. Additionally, for the fusion-based structure, the object detection method was categorized in this paper based on the image and point-cloud fusion types: early fusion, deep fusion, and late fusion. Moreover, a clear explanation of these categories was provided including both the advantages and limitations. Finally, the opportunities and challenges the environment perception may face in the future were assessed.

AB In this article, a fully distributed control structure named distributed linear time-varying model predictive controller is proposed for motion control of multiple vehicles in dynamic environments with uncertainty resources based on local communication and local controllers. Efficient operation of this structure in such real-world conditions needs reasoning about the future and the uncertainties over environmental objects; therefore, future evolution of vehicles and environmental objects is accounted as a planning strategy. A general planning framework is proposed, which integrates estimation, prediction, and planning. Simulation results for different dynamic scenarios demonstrate the benefit and applicability of this approach.

AB The reasonable and orderly traffic in vicinity of traffic signals is essential for the traffic efficiency of any signalized intersection. Under mixed traffic condition, adverse traffic impact of unreasonable vehicle merging behavior will be expected to be suppressed by designing active cyber-physical interaction mechanism in this section. From cyber-physical system (CPS) perspective, this paper proposes a vehicle group based merging control method for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). A vehicle group merging control protocol considering the physical driving disturbances is designed. Two kinds of stability proofs are given, which are asymptotic stability of the system with respect to vehicle internal disturbance and string stability of the system with respect to vehicle external disturbance. Simulation results show that through vehicle group merging control in vicinity of traffic signals, the proposed method can increase the traffic flow, average speed, and reduce traffic congestion in the vicinity of traffic signals.

AB Despite many advances in vehicle safety technology, traffic fatalities remain a devastating burden on society. With over two-thirds of all fatal single-vehicle crashes occurring off the roadway, run-off-road (ROR) crashes have become the focus of much roadway safety research. Current countermeasures, including roadway infrastructure modifications and some on-board vehicle safety systems, remain limited in their approach as they do not directly address the critical factor of driver behaviour. It has been shown that ROR crashes are often the result of poor driver performance leading up to the crash. In this study, the performance of two control algorithms, sliding control and linear quadratic control, was investigated for use in an autonomous ROR vehicle recovery system. The two controllers were simulated amongst a variety of ROR conditions where typical driver performance was inadequate to safely operate the vehicle. The sliding controller recovered the fastest within the nominal conditions but exhibited large variability in performance amongst the more extreme ROR scenarios. Despite some small sacrifices in lateral error and yaw rate, the linear quadratic controller demonstrated a higher level of consistency and stability amongst the various conditions examined. Overall, the linear quadratic controller recovered the vehicle 25% faster than the sliding controller while using 70% less steering, which combined with its robust performance, indicates its high potential as an autonomous ROR countermeasure.

AB Private Autonomous Vehicles (PAV) and Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV) are known to improve safety, mobility, roadway capacity, driver productivity and reduce parking costs (due to better utilization of space and self-parking to less expensive spots). However, the increased vehicle miles traveled (VMT), might increase overall emission production, system travel time, and operating costs. Also, the purchase price of autonomous vehicle (AV) is expected to be higher than that of human-driven (conventional) vehicles. A multi-objective mathematical model is proposed to minimize the purchase and operating costs, time spent, and emission production. The proposed model captures the tradeoff between the benefits of increased mobility, reduction in the value of travel of time (VOTT), efficient driving pattern, and the negative impacts of increased VMT, ownership cost due to the adoption of AVs. The proposed framework assists with the development of simplified adoption models that can be used by the policymakers and/or investors. SAVs would be the optimal solution if the replacement rate or CO2 costs are significantly low, or CO costs are sufficiently high. SAVs can also be the optimal solution if the travel time is used efficiently, or the purchase price is below certain relative threshold while minimizing system cost. Considering the private mobility system, PAVs can be the optimal solution only if the on-board amenities are improved, lifetime mileage is increased, AV technology is installed in luxurious cars, and is being adopted by people with high VOTT.

AB A driverless or autonomous vehicle requires significant support from information technology, both from central databases and from local sensors. The requirements for route guidance are in many ways more demanding than those of current guidance technologies, especially in the last mile' of a route. Significant extensions are needed for both street-centerline and point-of-interest databases. How these should be captured and structured present significant research challenges for GIScience. The societal and longer term impacts of such extensions are perhaps even more in need of focused research by the GIScience community.

ID SYSTEM
AB Cooperative trajectory planning of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) generally admits strong nonlinearity and non-convexity, rendering great difficulties in finding the optimal solution. Existing methods typically suffer from low computational efficiency and poor scalability, which hinder the appropriate applications in large-scale scenarios involving an increasing number of vehicles. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel decentralized iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) algorithm by leveraging the dual consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). First, the original non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a series of convex optimization problems through iterative neighbourhood approximation. Then, the dual of each convex optimization problem is shown to have a consensus structure, which facilitates the use of consensus ADMM to solve for the dual solution in a fully decentralized and parallel architecture. Finally, the primal solution corresponding to the trajectory of each vehicle is recovered by solving a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem iteratively, and a novel trajectory update strategy is proposed to ensure the dynamic feasibility of vehicles. With the proposed development, the computation burden is significantly alleviated such that real-time performance is attainable. Two traffic scenarios are presented to validate the proposed algorithm, and thorough comparisons between our proposed method and baseline methods (including centralized iLQR, IPOPT, and SQP) are conducted to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach.

AB Nowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing by leaps and bounds in almost all fields of technology, and Autonomous Vehicles (AV) research is one more of them. This paper proposes the using of algorithms based on Deep Learning (DL) in the control layer of an autonomous vehicle. More specifically, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are implemented in order to compare results between them. The aim of this work is to obtain a trained model, applying a DRL algorithm, able of sending control commands to the vehicle to navigate properly and efficiently following a determined route. In addition, for each of the algorithms, several agents are presented as a solution, so that each of these agents uses different data sources to achieve the vehicle control commands. For this purpose, an open-source simulator such as CARLA is used, providing to the system with the ability to perform a multitude of tests without any risk into an hyper-realistic urban simulation environment, something that is unthinkable in the real world. The results obtained show that both DQN and DDPG reach the goal, but DDPG obtains a better performance. DDPG perfoms trajectories very similar to classic controller as LQR. In both cases RMSE is lower than 0.1m following trajectories with a range 180-700m. To conclude, some conclusions and future works are commented.

AB Capturing the evolution mechanism of traffic dynamics is of great significance when alleviating traffic congestion and improving traffic efficiency. While several studies have presented stability analyses of various traffic systems, most have relied on linear analysis methods, which cannot capture the complex nonlinear dynamic behavior of heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this shortcoming, this paper derives a generic Hopf bifurcation structure that can be applied to multiclass traffic models. The proposed bifurcation structure is investigated to understand the characteristics of heterogeneous traffic flow in a connected and autonomous environment as case studies. The results, based on selected on-field calibrated traffic models, show that (1) the linear analysis results deviate significantly from the actual instability of the mixed traffic system, which illustrates the necessity of a bifurcation analysis; and (2) connected human-driven vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles have the ability to alleviate the formation and propagation of traffic oscillations. Finally, the theoretical analysis results are verified through simulation experiments.

AB Recently, Vulnerable Traffic Participants (VTPs) trajectory prediction has got some attention, which can help autonomous vehicles better understand complex traffic environments. This paper systematically investigates VTPs (pedestrians, cyclists, and electric cyclists) trajectory prediction based on a fresh data-driven stacking model. Firstly, a micro-dynamic Modified Social Force Model (MSFM) is proposed, pedestrian-cyclist-electric cyclist-dynamic vehicle interactions, the effect of zebra crossing and pedestrian heterogeneity (age and gender) are taken into account. Then an Attention-Long Short Term Memory Network (AN-LSTM) is developed, AN is used to achieve the influence weights of pedestrian heterogeneity and road users. Finally, a fresh stacking model by combining the MSFM and AN-LSTM is proposed for VTPs trajectory prediction. The stacking model is evaluated with the current state-of-the-art models. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves an increased accuracy of more than 12%. Moreover, a real-time online integrated vision system which combines target detection, multi-target tracking, pedestrian heterogeneity recognition and distance measurement is developed. The proposed model is tested with the integrated vision system, and high accuracy and good real-time performance (0.030 seconds) are achieved, which can give us great confidence to use the proposed model in the autonomous vehicles for improving VTPs safety and transportation efficiency.

ID ATTENUATION; DEFORMATION; SEDIMENTS
AB OpenSWAP is a class of innovative open architecture, low cost autonomous vehicles for geological/geophysical studies of shallow water environments. Although they can host different types of sensors, these vehicles were specifically designed for geophysical surveys, i.e., for the acquisition of bathymetric and stratigraphic data through single- and multibeam echosounders, side-scan sonars, and seismic-reflection systems. The main characteristic of the OpenSWAP vehicles is their ability of following pre-defined routes with high accuracy under acceptable weather and sea conditions. This would open the door to 4D (repeated) surveys, which constitute a powerful tool to analyze morphological and stratigraphic changes of the sediment/water interface and of the shallow substratum eventually caused by sediment dynamics (erosion vs. deposition), slumps and gravitative failures, earthquakes (slip along seismogenic faults and secondary effects of shaking), tsunamis, etc. The low cost and the open hardware/software architectures of these systems, which can be modified by the end users, lead for planning and execution of cooperative and adaptive surveys with different instruments not yet implemented or tested. Together with a technical description of the vehicles, we provide different case studies where they were successfully employed, carried out in environments not, or very difficultly accessed through conventional systems.

AB In this paper, to address the vehicle state estimation problem, we propose an approach that can overcome the practical problems associated with vehicle lane changes on highways. The vehicle state with respect to the road, which is called the lateral offset, jumps in camera vision sensors when the vehicle changes lanes. Thus, we solve this state jump problem by translating the state estimation problem into a new domain called the cylinder domain. We propose a linear parameter varying (LPV) observer to estimate the vehicle states by considering the lane width variation during a lane change. The lane information is estimated by the proposed LPV observer in the cylinder domain; thus, the estimated lane information does not jump. Consequently, the lane estimation performance can be improved during the transient response when the lateral position of the autonomous vehicle crosses over between the original and target lanes in the event of a lane change. The proposed algorithm is validated with real vehicle driving data obtained using a camera vision sensor.

ID DESIGN
AB Lane-change (LC) is one of the most important topics in autonomous vehicles (AVs) on highways. To enhance the implementation of effective LC in AVs, this paper proposes a framework based on deep reinforcement learning, which takes into account heuristic actions and multiple constraints related to the centerline of the road and speed, to improve the overall performance of LC in AVs. Firstly, the influence of unreasonable vehicle actions on the algorithm training process is studied. To improve the rationality of the to-be-trained actions, a novel reasonable action screening mechanism is proposed. Secondly, to keep the vehicle on the centerline of the lane and avoid the collision with other vehicles, a method is designed to calculate the center position of the vehicle. Thirdly, a segmented speed reward mechanism is proposed to constrain vehicle speed. Subsequently, a dynamic reward function is established to train the control algorithm. Lastly, the proposed strategy is evaluated in two simulation scenarios of highways. The simulation results show that the proposed method can increase the number of reasonable actions by more than 30% and improve the success rate of obstacle avoidance with the increase of over 52% in both static and dynamic scenarios compared with the benchmark algorithms.

AB This paper is concerned with autonomous forest full coverage search using multiple micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). Due to the complex and cluttered environment, i.e., many obstacles under the forest canopy, it is quite challenging to achieve full coverage search using fully autonomous MAVs, e.g., quadrotors. In this work, we propose a two-stage multi-MAV forest search strategy. The first batch of MAVs provides a coarse search and mapping result using pre-defined or auto-generated paths. Based on that, the second batch of MAVs continues to search the multiple isolated regions missed by the first batch. The main difficulties fall in the autonomous task allocation and optimal cooperative coverage path planning for the second batch of MAVs, to achieve the full coverage goal. To address this problem, a task allocation algorithm based on the branch and bound principle is introduced to find the optimal search order of the missed regions. Furthermore, an optimal coverage path planning algorithm considering obstacle avoidance is proposed to cover each region. Simulation results show that our proposed method improves the efficiency of coverage path planning for cooperative search and guarantees full area coverage.

AB Image acquisition from autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is useful for mapping objects on the seabed. However, there are few studies on the interpretation of data collected with side-scan sonar during autonomous underwater vehicle missions. By recording the seabed with 3D multibeam sonar, a large number of survey points can be obtained. The collected data are processed using applications based on remote sensing image processing. The data collected during AUV missions (or other sonar carriers) needs to be pre-processed to reach the proper effectiveness level. This process includes corrections of signal amplification (Time Varying Gain, or TVG) and geometric distortions of sonar images (Slant Range Corrections). It should be mentioned that, when carrying out the interpretation process for structures on the sea floor, sonar users need to understand the process of visualising seabed projections and depressions, as well as the resolution limitations of the sonar sensors.

ID TRAVEL-TIME; PREFERENCES; VEHICLES; SERVICE; FUTURE; POLICY; COST
AB The introduction of autonomous buses and taxis is expected to generate such benefits as cost reductions-and particularly for regional bus operations with a substantial deficit-as well as enhancing public transit accessibility through decreased trip costs. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the impacts of introducing autonomous buses and taxis on metropolitan transportation systems by quantifying the costs of travel in Japan, and to discuss the potential benefits. First, this study sets the assumptions on autonomous driving technology, including its impacts on vehicle costs, the decreased labor costs for driving and safety monitoring in buses and taxis, and decreased driving stress for private car users. Next, operating costs are computed for autonomous buses and taxis in Japanese metropolitan areas. The costs of travel, or the sum of monetary and time costs, are then computed with and without vehicle automation for different trip types in high- and low-density metropolitan areas. The results highlight that the costs of public transit trips that currently have a smaller share of time costs in overall trip costs could decrease considerably due to vehicle automation. For instance, costs for 10-20-km trip lengths could decrease by 44-61% for taxi trips and 13-37% for rail/bus trips with taxi access, followed by a decrease of 6-11% for bus trips and 1-11% for rail trips with bus access. Further, private car trip costs could decrease by 11-16%. More substantial cost reductions in rail/bus trips with taxi access could occur in the case of smaller trip distances and/or in residential areas far from stations; larger reductions in rail trips with bus access could occur in low-density metropolitan areas. Finally, it is expected that vehicle automation in more fixed modes of public road transit could primarily benefit the transit industry and government, with such effects as improved labor productivity and reduced subsidies, while vehicle automation in more flexible modes could benefit metropolitan residents as well as the transit industry. This further suggests that a deficit of regional bus operations could be recovered during the transition to the full performance of autonomous buses.

AB This paper provides a study on the development and the use of a small autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) that automatically follows programmed mission transects, while measuring sensor outputs along the tracks. It discusses the mechanical construction of the ASV, the distributed architecture of controller area network (CAN)-based nodes for science and vehicle payloads, highspeed radio-frequency (RF) communications, the performance of the heading autopilot, global positioning system (GPS)-based guidance algorithm, and the mission programming technique. The field trials of the ASV, performed off the coast of Goa, India, are focused on retrieving the 2-D spatial distribution of surface chlorophyll, which is one of the useful parameters in characterizing the nature of calibration-validation (CALVAL) sites for ocean remote sensing needs. A further benefit of ASVs is that they can be built at a low cost and used in monitoring applications of diverse coastal ecosystems.

AB Vehicles with automated driving systems are called by many names, which are used interchangeably in public discourse, with different and at times misleading meanings. In two studies (total N = 908), we examined the naming effects on people's cognitive (perceived benefit and risk), affective (negative and positive affect), and behavioral responses (behavioral intention) to and trust in these vehicles in the Chinese context. Study 1 considered four names (intelligent, automated, autonomous, and driverless vehicles). Study 2 presented an identical description of vehicles with full automation and considered their five names (fully intelligent, fully automated, fully autonomous, fully driverless, and driverless vehicles). We corroborated the naming effects on affective responses and trust. The framing of "driverless vehicle" was less favorable in Study 1 but more favorable in Study 2. Technology names indirectly influenced behavioral intention through certain cognitive and affective responses. Theoretical and practical implications of our results are discussed.

AB This paper describes insights gained from a decade of autonomous marine systems development at the University of Sydney's Australian Centre for Marine Robotics. Over the course of this time, we have deployed numerous vehicles and imaging platforms in support of applications in engineering science, marine ecology, archaeology and geoscience. We have operated an Australia-wide benthic observing program designed to deliver precisely navigated, repeat imagery of the seafloor. This initiative makes extensive use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to collect high-resolution stereo imagery, multibeam sonar and water column measurements on an annual or semi-annual basis at sites around Australia, spanning the full latitudinal range of the continent from tropical reefs in the north to temperate regions in the south. We have also contributed to expeditions to document coral bleaching, cyclone recovery, submerged neolithic settlement sites, ancient shipwrecks, methane seeps and deepwater hydrothermal vents. We briefly consider how automated tools for working with this imagery have facilitated the resulting science outcomes.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a general-purpose electric off-road robot vehicle by using automatic control technologies. The vehicle prototype used in this study was a commercially-purchased electricity utility vehicle that was designed originally for manual operations. A manipulating unit, an automatic steering system and a speed control system were developed and integrated into a CAN-bus network for operating on functions (forward, reverse, park or stop), realizing desired steering angles and maintaining a constant speed, respectively, in the mode of automation. An autonomous navigation system based on RTK-GPS and IMU was used to evaluate the performance of the newly developed off-road robot. Field tests showed that the maximum error in speed control was 0.29 m/s and 0.22 m/s for speed tests and autonomous runs, respectively. The lateral offset was less than 10 cm in terms of straight paths, indicating that the automatic steering control system was of good performance.

AB Modern vehicle is equipped with autonomous features, such as precollision system or adaptive cruise control to help people perform driving in a safer and more convenient way. The software complexity of those autonomous features is growing to accommodate various needs from users, which makes it more difficult to test their correctness. Virtual prototyping allows one to test the vehicle software in the virtual road environment. Even though several tools are available, original equipment manufacturers seem to be hesitating to fully integrate the virtual test as a part of the vehicle development plan. One of the obstacle is due to a lack of well-defined test criteria that can reasonably abstract the physical environment and test case generation methods that automatically visualize the virtual road environment. In this letter, we propose several associated research directions and potential approaches from the perspective of test criteria and test case generation.

AB In a level-5 autonomous driving system, the autonomous driving vehicles (AVs) are expected to sense the surroundings via analyzing a large amount of data captured by a variety of onboard sensors in near-real-time. As a result, enormous computing costs will be introduced to the AVs for processing the tasks with the deployed machine learning (ML) model, while the inference accuracy may not be guaranteed. In this context, the advent of edge intelligence (EI) and sixth-generation (6G) wireless networking are expected to pave the way to more reliable and safer autonomous driving by providing multi-access edge computing (MEC) together with ML to AVs in close proximity. To realize this goal, we propose a two-tier EI-empowered autonomous driving framework. In the autonomous-vehicles tier, the autonomous vehicles are deployed with the shallow layers by splitting the trained deep neural network model. In the edge-intelligence tier, an edge server is implemented with the remaining layers (also deep layers) and an appropriately trained multi-task learning (MTL) model. In particular, obtaining the optimal offloading strategy (including the binary offloading decision and the computational resources allocation) can be formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is solved via MTL in near-real-time with high accuracy. On another note, an edge-vehicle joint inference is proposed through neural network segmentation to achieve efficient online inference with data privacy-preserving and less communication delay. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and open research topics are finally listed.

ID IMPLEMENTATION
AB In this paper, a new control algorithm for active suspension systems is presented. Latter is designed to improve low frequency comfort, which gains importance with autonomous driving and the possibility for nondriving tasks like in-car working. The algorithm is based on model predictive controllers and makes use of environment sensor information and extends preview by taking the future trajectory of the vehicle into account. A simulative benchmark demonstrates the advantages compared to existing control algorithms. Vertical- as well as roll- and pitch-acceleration can be significantly reduced by at least 20% compared to a non-preview controller up to a frequency of 5 Hz. A prototype vehicle implementation of the new controller enables a subjective and objective review of the resulting vehicle motion and confirms the results of the simulation. Despite of limitations on the precision of the preview information, vertical acceleration could be reduced by 5.5% in this implementation. It was shown that a future series implementation is possible and can be used to improve autonomous driving comfort by increasing low frequency suspension performance and efficient integration of additional features such as curve tilting.

AB This article presents a unified approach to the problem of learning-based optimal control of connected human-driven and autonomous vehicles in mixed-traffic environments including both the freeway and ring road settings. The stabilizability of a string of connected vehicles including multiple autonomous vehicles (AVs) and heterogeneous human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is studied by a model reduction technique and the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) test. For this problem setup, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem is formulated and a solution based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques is proposed without a priori knowledge on model parameters. To start the learning process, an initial stabilizing control law is obtained using the small-gain theorem for the ring road case. It is shown that the obtained stabilizing control law can achieve general L-p string stability under appropriate conditions. Besides, to minimize the impact of external disturbance, a linear quadratic zero-sum game is introduced and solved by an iterative learning-based algorithm. Finally, the simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and the proposed methods achieve desirable performance for control of a mixed-vehicular network.

AB Four-wheel independent drive autonomous vehicle (4WIDAV) is constantly influenced by uncertainties, including parameter fluctuation, modeling error, and external disturbance during the path following process. If those uncertainties are not handled properly, 4WIDAV may deviate from the desired path or even become unstable. Motivated by this issue, a path following lateral control scheme based on modified sliding mode prediction control (SMPC) is proposed for 4WIDAV. First, an SMPC framework is built, which introduces the prediction process into the approaching process of sliding mode dynamic trajectory to alleviate the chattering phenomenon. Second, a lumped uncertainty term containing the modeling error, parameter fluctuation, and external disturbance is introduced in the prediction process of the SMPC framework. The accurate estimation of lumped uncertainty aforementioned is realized through an extended state observer (ESO). Third, the torque distribution method based on tire force observation is designed to ensure the driving stability of the 4WIDAV. Finally, typical driving maneuvers are performed in simulations and experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed control scheme can improve the tracking performance up to 69.4% and 52.8% in simulation and experiment, respectively. Therefore, the proposed scheme can be used as a theoretical reference for path following lateral control of autonomous vehicle.

AB The application of multi-disciplinary automotive technologies to hybrid vehicles has resulted in the integration of alternative propulsion sources and drive-by-wire components for enhanced ground vehicle performance, fuel economy, and occupant safety. The integration of steer-by-wire systems in vehicles facilitates autonomous and semi-autonomous operations, better lateral vehicle behavior, an adjustable steering "feel," and elimination of problems arising due to potential engine cycling. In this paper, a continuous time-varying tracking controller is designed for the vehicle's position/orientation using a simplified vehicle description and reference model for tracking. The tracking error is globally, exponentially forced to a neighborhood of about zero by transforming the system into a flat input-state system and then fusing a filtered tracking error transformation with the dynamic oscillator design. Mathematical models are presented for a steer-by-wire rack and pinion unit, vehicle chassis, and tire/road interface dynamics. Representative numerical results are discussed to demonstrate the vehicle's transient response for a prescribed trajectory profile.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are expected to be an essential component in developing efficient and sustainable transportation systems. This paper focuses on optimizing the opera-tional decisions of SAV systems when the mode choices between SAVs and human-driven private vehicles are considered. A time-space network flow model is formulated to optimize the vehicle assignment and relocation decisions, while a binary logit model is used to describe the nonlinear relationship between the elastic demand and its various important attributes, including the trip price and the level of service. An enhanced outer-inner approximation approach is proposed for solving the mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). For reducing the approximation error, a dynamic programming algorithm is developed to select the optimal breakpoints. The proposed modeling and solution approaches are tested based on a case study in Singapore. Our computational experiments show that the proposed solution approaches can efficiently obtain the optimal solutions. Numerical results reveal that a SAV system can achieve higher performance by the active relocation activities under the elastic demand. And the SAV system with a high level of service could produce a higher operating profit if users are more sensitive to the level of service.

AB In this paper, the finite-time output feedback trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is investigated. The vehicle model is constructed in six degrees of freedom and the vehicle attitude is represented by quaternions to avoid representation singularities. The control design consists of three steps. First, by using the finite-time control technique, two global finite-time stabilizing controllers based on state feedback are proposed for the vehicle translational and rotational tracking error subsystems, respectively. Second, considering the estimation problem of the vehicle translational velocities, a global finite-time convergent observer is employed to reconstruct the information of the vehicle translational velocities. Finally, based on the proposed state feedback controllers and the finite-time convergent observer, a finite-time output feedback trajectory tracking control scheme for AUVs is derived. Global finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved by using Lyapunov theory. Compared with the conventional back-stepping control scheme via output feedback, the proposed finite-time output feedback control scheme offers not only a faster convergence rate but also a higher tracking accuracy for trajectory tracking control of AUVs. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Establishing a persistent presence in the ocean with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of observing temporal variability of large-scale ocean processes requires a unique sensor platform. In this paper, we examine the utility of vehicles that can only control their depth in the water column for such extended deployments. We present a strategy that utilizes ocean model predictions to facilitate a basic level of autonomy and enables general control for these profiling floats. The proposed method is based on experimentally validated techniques for utilizing ocean current models to control autonomous gliders. With the appropriate vertical actuation, and utilizing spatio-temporal variations in water speed and direction, we show that general controllability results can be met. First, we apply an A* planner to a local controllability map generated from predictions of ocean currents. This computes a path between start and goal waypoints that has the highest likelihood of successful execution. A computed depth plan is generated with a model-predictive controller (MPC), and selects the depths for the vehicle so that ambient currents guide it toward the goal. Mission constraints are included to simulate and motivate a practical data collection mission. Results are presented in simulation for a mission off the coast of Los Angeles, CA, USA, that show encouraging results in the ability of a drifting vehicle to reach a desired location.

AB This article describes the development and testing of a passive sonar, multitarget tracker, and adaptive behavior that enable an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to detect and actively track nearby surface vessels. A planar hull-mounted hydrophone array, originally designed for active sonar, is repurposed for passive sonar use and provides acoustic data to a time-delay-and-sum beamformer that generates multiple angle-only contacts. A particle filter tracker assimilates these contacts with a single-hypothesis data association strategy to estimate the position and velocity of targets. Summary statistics of each track are periodically reported to an onboard database along with qualitative labels. To improve tracking performance, detections trigger an adaptive behavior that maneuvers the AUV to maintain multiple targets in the field of view by minimizing the worst case aspect angle deviation from broadside (across all targets). The tracking system is demonstrated through at-sea experiments in which a Bluefin-21 AUV adaptively tracks multiple surface vessels, including another autonomous platform, in the approaches to Boston Harbor.

AB In the context of coordination of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the platooning operation is a promising application. The formulation of a single stream of CAVs is conducive to traffic efficiency and merging operations extend the benefits for multilane road users. However, the problem of simultaneous merging and platooning lacks comprehensive investigation. A solution is formulated in this paper through a new scheme that considers inter-vehicle safety distance constraints and distributed deployment utilizing local inter-vehicle information exchanges. A distributed consensus-based controller synthesized with a collision avoidance design is developed to direct the CAVs to maintain the velocity and spacing required to avoid inter-vehicle collisions. Furthermore, a framework fusing an agent motion model with vehicle controllers based on a dynamics model that facilitates both longitudinal and lateral controls is proposed, contributing to a cross-model planning-tracking controller. Theoretical proof of asymptotic stability of the proposed controller and its collision avoidance capability are also elaborated. The merging and platooning function was tested in a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) experiment, demonstrating the precise tracking performance and comparable merging responses to a typical multiagent system. In comparison with trajectory-based merging algorithms, the proposed framework is able to achieve finer stepwise tracking results without centralized coordination or predefined trajectories.

AB Underwater visual inspection is an important task for checking the structural integrity and biofouling of the ship hull surface to improve the operational safety and efficiency of ships and floating vessels. This paper describes the development of an autonomous in-water visual inspection system and its application to visual hull inspection of a full-scale ship. The developed system includes a hardware vehicle platform and software algorithms for autonomous operation of the vehicle. The algorithms for vehicle autonomy consist of the guidance, navigation, and control algorithms for real-time and onboard operation of the vehicle around the hull surface. The environmental perception of the developed system is mainly based on optical camera images, and various computer vision and optimization algorithms are used for vision-based navigation and visual mapping. In particular, a stereo camera is installed on the underwater vehicle to estimate instantaneous surface normal vectors, which enables high-precision navigation and robust visual mapping, not only on flat areas but also over moderately curved hull surface areas. The development process of the vehicle platform and the implemented algorithms are described. The results of the field experiment with a full-scale ship in a real sea environment are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and practical performance of the developed system.

AB A fully autonomous road traffic has already been desired for years but could not be realized until now. Aside from the capability of the vehicles to communicate with each other (C2C) or with the infrastructure (C2I), the main obstacle for the realization of a fully autonomous traffic is a sufficiently accurate and reliable localization. The localization of vehicles, i.e., the real-time measurement of the position of moving objects, is still a challenging task, as each vehicle has to be localized at every time and at any place of the road network with a high accuracy and availability. Since fully autonomous traffic is a safety-relevant application, a proof of safety for all safety-relevant components is indispensable. Therefore, the measurement quality of the applied measurement devices has to be verified. For a determination of the accuracy and availability performance of localization systems, an accredited testing and calibration laboratory for vehicle localization is necessary, which does not exist yet. Such a laboratory has to provide a measurement standard for vehicle position measurements and an uncertainty evaluation for the reference value according to standards. This paper suggests a measurement standard for automotive vehicle localization and its measurement uncertainty evaluation according to the International Organization for Standardization Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement.

AB Owing to the development of information and communication technology (ICT), autonomous cooperative vehicles are being developed. Autonomous cooperative driving combines vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technology in existing autonomous driving and provides safe driving by sharing information between communication entities. However, security factors should be considered during communication. Security Credential Management System (SCMS) has been proposed as one of these elements, but it is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks due to message authentication costs. In congested situations, the number of messages exchanged between vehicles becomes very large. However, the performance of the on-board unit (OBU) is not sufficient to handle huge number of messages, which can lead to a DoS attack. Therefore, a technique to prevent DoS attacks on autonomous cooperative driving vehicles using SCMS has been proposed in this paper. The proposed technique reduces authentication costs by classifying similar messages into multiple categories and authenticating only the first message represented in the group for a unit time. The effectiveness of this technique has been demonstrated by comparing the time it takes to verify huge number of message signatures in each method.

AB Topics concerning autonomous navigation, especially those related to positioning systems, have recently attracted increased research attention. The commonly available global positioning system (GPS) is unable to determine the positions of vehicles in GPS-shaded regions. To address this concern, this paper presents a fuzzy-logic system capable of determining the position of a moving robot in a GPS-shaded indoor environment by analyzing the chromaticity and frequency-component ratio of LED lights installed under the ceiling. The proposed system's performance was analyzed by performing a MATLAB simulation of an indoor environment with obstacles. During the simulation, the mobile robot utilized a fuzzy autonomous navigation system with behavioral rules to approach targets successfully in a variety of indoor environments without colliding with obstacles. The robot utilized the x and y coordinates of the fuzzy positioning system. The results obtained in this study confirm the suitability of the proposed method for use in applications involving autonomous navigation of vehicles in areas with poor GPS-signal reception, such as in tunnels.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly being used for underwater survey and exploration missions. The expanding mission scope for AUVs highlights the need for a long-endurance operational capability, which mainly depends on propulsion system efficiency and battery capacity. The use of submerged docking stations permitting battery recharge and data download/upload offers a means of enabling persistence without compromising propulsion and payload power budgets, while also reducing associated deployment/recovery costs and risks. Autonomous docking with an underwater station is, however, complicated by the presence of currents and obstacles in the water, and by the relative dynamic differences in pose between the dock and the vehicle. A robust docking guidance system is identified as a core and crucial component for ensuring successful AUV docking. This paper presents a detailed literature review summarizing the current state-of-the-art in AUV docking guidance methodologies, identifying their relative merits and shortcomings, and revealing the docking guidance methodologies that seems to be the most prominent.

AB Nowadays, the most widely used method for estimating location of autonomous vehicles in real time is the use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, positioning in urban environments using GNSS is hampered by poor satellite geometry due to signal obstruction created by both man-made and natural features of the urban environment. The presence of obstacles is the reason for the decreased number of observed satellites as well as uncertainty of GNSS positioning. It is possible that in some sections of the vehicle route there might not be enough satellites necessary to fix position. It is common to use software for static GNSS measurement campaign planning, but it is often only able to predict satellite visibility at one point. This article presents a proposal for dynamic GNSS mission planning using a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and dead reckoning. The methodology and sample results of numerical experiments are also described. They clearly show that proper dynamic GNSS mission planning is necessary in order to complete a task by an autonomous vehicle in an obstructed environment.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) industry has evolved rapidly during the past decade. Research and development in each sub-module (perception, state estimation, motion planning etc.) of AVs has seen a boost, both on the hardware (variety of new sensors) and the software sides (state-of-the-art algorithms). With recent advancements in achieving real-time performance using onboard computational hardware on an ego vehicle, one of the major challenges that AV industry faces today is modelling behaviour and predicting future intentions of road users. To make a self-driving car reason and execute the safest motion plan, it should be able to understand its interactions with other road users. Modelling such behaviour is not trivial and involves various factors e.g. demographics, number of traffic participants, environmental conditions, traffic rules, contextual cues etc. This comprehensive review summarizes the related literature. Specifically, we identify and classify motion prediction literature for two road user classes i.e. pedestrians and vehicles. The taxonomy proposed in this review gives a unified generic overview of the pedestrian and vehicle motion prediction literature and is built on three dimensions i.e. motion modelling approach, model output type, and situational awareness from the perspective of an AV.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched public health resources to the limits, and the only realistic way to keep the infection rates low is effective testing to prevent community transmission. In this research study, we propose an innovative method to empower autonomous vehicle-driven mobile assessment facilities to support early detection of the cases contracted with the virus, and enable early detection of sources for hot spots. We describe a self organizing feature map (SOFM) approach to the allocation of the mobile assessment centers, and also use the same method to determine the travel route of the autonomous vehicles, and provide critical decision support to the supply chain manager. Our results reveal that the optimal number of neurons under varying test times can be obtained by 5 different zero-day coordinates of initially contracted cases and worst-case scenario to find out the contracted cases in 17 days and 27 days under two different test time scenarios.

AB In this paper, we describe the hardware and software components of a fully autonomous prototype delivery vehicle. Equipped with a robotic arm, the demonstrator is capable of delivering packages and picking up new ones by interacting with custom-made delivery boxes. As highly accurate positioningw. r. t. a box is required for successful handover of packages, we track the pose (position and orientation) of the box using a high-resolution on-board camera. The resulting estimate is relayed to our planning and control modules, which ensure that the vehicle reaches its required pose with centimeter-level accuracy.
   In order to deliver packages, the car needs to autonomously navigate our test facility, avoiding static and dynamic obstacles while obeying simple traffic rules. As one focus is on the practical challenges encountered when building a prototype, we cover issues ranging from sensor calibration and system identification to perception, planning, control, and the implementation of high-level behaviors. While some of the proposed solutions to these problems are not necessarily novel, they allowed us to demonstrate the vehicle's capabilities after a development phase of less than 12 months.

AB Class imbalance is one of the common problems faced by the researchers in their learning or analyzing datasets. The learning precision and accuracy using the real-time datasets and simulated datasets vary at large scale. The learning conducted by simulated datasets may not be matching with the learning carried using real-time generated datasets; moreover, the learning vector deviates away for the real-time datasets. Similar kind of issue is observed in the VeReMi dataset that is used extensively to train the intelligent models for detecting misbehavior nodes in autonomous vehicles network. In this research, the learning impact of an intelligent model is evaluated, which is trained by the VeReMi dataset, treated for avoiding class imbalance and resampled based on well-known class imbalance techniques such as SMOTE and DSSTE, and observe the variations in the model's performance, whose primary target is to identify behavioral anomalies in autonomous vehicles and systems. The work aims to evidently show how imbalanced the VeReMi dataset is and its impact on training intelligent models to classify the attacks.

AB This paper describes the design, implementation, and field testing of an infrastructureless system for autonomous tramming (or hauling) of a center-articulated underground mining vehicle. Such vehicles are ubiquitous in underground mining, and effective automation of their tramming function has been a sought-after technology for more than a decade. This paper reports on the successful development of a fast, reliable, and robust "autotramming" technology that does not require the installation of fixed infrastructure. Included are descriptions of the chosen control architecture, map-based localization technique, and the results of integration and field testing. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Due to the rapid growth of the smart automotive industry, there has been a strong rise in interest in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology recently. Establishing rapid and reliable Vehicle-toEverything (V2X) connections between several different cars and smart devices are another challenge. This research suggests unique method for autonomous vehicle communication that combines an ensemble of machine learning approaches with sliding window-based fourier transform signal processing. Here, a sliding window-based Fourier transform is used to handle the vehicle communication data together with ensemble reinforcement, spatial gradient, and radial encoder neural networks. Data throughput, energy use, QoS(quality of service), and communication costs are all considered in the experimental study. The outcomes demonstrate the viability of the strategy: applying ML techniques to V2X data allowed for prediction of majority of simulated incidents. Existence of a large number of FPs prevents the use of automated safety systems as a result, drivers must avoid collisions manually.

AB In this article, the problem of collaborative tracking of an underwater target using autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) is studied. Distance-based formation control with a collision-avoidance potential function is employed as a solution. A formation control protocol is devised and applied to the formation tracking problem. With the protocol, the vehicles form a desired formation around a moving target in order to continuously estimate its position, while the centroid of the formation tracks the target. Almost global stability is proved for the case with three tracking agents. A fully operational platform with four ASVs was built to implement the derived algorithms. One of the vehicles was used to simulate a target and the rest to form a triangular formation around it. Power usage of a naval vessel is highly affected by water resistance forces which increases significantly with the velocity. This was accounted for by adding an additional term to the formation tracking protocol, thereby increasing the overall system endurance. Experimental results are presented.

AB Lane change maneuver is one of the most conventional behaviors in driving. Unsafe lane change maneuvers are key factor for traffic accidents and traffic congestion. For drivers' safety, comfort and convenience, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are presented. The main problem discussed in this paper is the development of an autonomous lane change system. The system can be extended applied in intelligent vehicles in future. It solves two crucial issues - trajectory planning and trajectory tracking. Polynomial method was adopted for describing the trajectory planning issue. Movement of a host vehicle was abstracted into time functions. Moreover, collision detection was mapped into a parameter space by adopting infinite dynamic circles. The second issue was described by backstepping principle. According to the Lyapunov function, a tracking controller with global convergence property was verified. Both the simulations and the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed method for autonomous lane change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID AVOIDANCE; ENVIRONMENTS; LIMITS
AB Unsafe lane-changing maneuvers contribute to accidents and merging conflicts due to variations in traffic states and driver behaviors at on-ramp merging areas. Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies promise significant improvements to traffic management systems, including the possibility of reducing collisions. CAVs provide various driving supports, which are expected to reduce collisions by exploiting information from surrounding vehicles. This paper proposes a collision avoidance (CA) model that predicts the occurrence of collision events associated with different vehicle movements in merging areas. A decision-making system consisting of a threat assessment model is proposed to assess the risks associated with different movements, and to avoid collisions based on safe lateral and longitudinal acceleration of the on-ramp vehicle in the merging area. Then, evasive action of the main lane vehicle is assessed based on its braking response during the merging interaction with the on-ramp vehicle. Finally, in emergency situations, a vehicle stabilization mechanism is introduced to preserve the vehicle states within the envelope of danger. The results show that the model could be used to avoid collisions in multiple scenarios and predict the occurrence of collision events associated with different vehicle movements. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model using the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) I-80 trajectory dataset. The findings show that the proposed model can be useful for avoiding collisions in real-time scenarios. In summary, the proposed CA model provides a valuable safety management tool.

AB This paper proposes an autonomous relay access algorithm that provides an intelligent wireless network structure for inter-vehicle communication systems. The proposed algorithm introduces a special classification among mobile terminals and assigns terminals to one of several terminal groups, which are adaptively and autonomously constructed according to traffic conditions. The proposed algorithm uses the terminal groups to conduct relay access transmission among terminals, and achieves a high rate of successful inter-terminal transmission. Computer simulation confirms that the proposed algorithm can achieve a lower blocking probability than that without a relay access scheme.

AB This paper presents a systematic review of the perception systems and simulators for autonomous vehicles (AV). This work has been divided into three parts. In the first part, perception systems are categorized as environment perception systems and positioning estimation systems. The paper presents the physical fundamentals, principle functioning, and electromagnetic spectrum used to operate the most common sensors used in perception systems (ultrasonic, RADAR, LiDAR, cameras, IMU, GNSS, RTK, etc.). Furthermore, their strengths and weaknesses are shown, and the quantification of their features using spider charts will allow proper selection of different sensors depending on 11 features. In the second part, the main elements to be taken into account in the simulation of a perception system of an AV are presented. For this purpose, the paper describes simulators for model-based development, the main game engines that can be used for simulation, simulators from the robotics field, and lastly simulators used specifically for AV. Finally, the current state of regulations that are being applied in different countries around the world on issues concerning the implementation of autonomous vehicles is presented.

ID THRUSTER DYNAMICS
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are expected to function in an unstructured underwater environment. One of the main requirements for effective operation in such an environment is to accommodate faults. In this paper, we have investigated a new approach to the allocation of thruster forces of an autonomous underwater vehicle under thruster faults. Generally, an AUV is equipped with more thrusters than what is minimally required to produce the desired motion. The proposed framework exploits the excess number of thrusters to accommodate thruster faults during operation. First, a redundancy resolution scheme is presented that considers the presence of excess number of thrusters along with any thruster faults and determines the reference thruster forces to produce the desired motion, These reference thruster forces are then utilized in the thruster controller to generate the required motion. This approach resolves the thruster redundancy in the Cartesian space and allows the AUV to track the task-space trajectories with asymptotic reduction of the task-space errors. Results from actual underwater experiments are provided to demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme.

AB This paper is concerned with the issue of platoon fault-tolerant control of the system with time-varying actuator faults. By obtaining the relative state information of neighboring vehicles, two event-triggered fault-tolerant controllers are designed for the two cases of the leader vehicle speed. Then the vehicle platoon system is transformed into error system, and the event-triggered control strategy is designed, in an effort to further save resources. Moreover, by the related theory of Lyapunov, it is shown that the error system is bounded. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In this paper we present a novel method for the acoustic tracking of multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. While the problem of tracking a single moving vehicle has been addressed in the literature, tracking multiple vehicles is a problem that has been overlooked, mostly due to the inherent difficulties on data association with traditional acoustic localization networks. The proposed approach is based on a Probability Hypothesis Density Filter, thus overcoming the data association problem. Our tracker is able not only to successfully estimate the positions of the vehicles, but also their velocities. Moreover, the tracker estimates are labelled, thus providing a way to establish track continuity of the targets. Using real word data, our method is experimentally validated and the performance of the tracker is evaluated.

AB Most autonomous navigation systems used in underground mining vehicles such as load-haul-dump (LHD) vehicles and trucks use 2D light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors and 2D representations/maps of the environment. In this article, we propose the use of 3D LIDARs and existing 3D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) jointly with 2D mapping methods to produce or update 2D grid maps of underground tunnels that may have significant elevation changes. Existing mapping methods that only use 2D LIDARs are shown to fail to produce accurate 2D grid maps of the environment. These maps can be used for robust localization and navigation in different mine types (e.g., sublevel stoping, block/panel caving, room and pillar), using only 2D LIDAR sensors. The proposed methodology was tested in the Werra Potash Mine located at Philippsthal, Germany, under real operational conditions. The obtained results show that the enhanced 2D map-building method produces a superior mapping performance compared with a 2D map generated without the use of the 3D LIDAR-based mapping solution. The 2D map generated enables robust 2D localization, which was tested during the operation of an autonomous LHD, performing autonomous navigation and autonomous loading over extended periods of time.

ID LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS; STABILITY ANALYSIS
AB The automated steering for lane keeping is an important technique used in the autonomous vehicles. To achieve satisfactory lane keeping performance, the steering control scheme is required to be robust against the vehicle uncertainties and the external disturbances, and be easy to be implemented. To this end, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is applied to the steering controller design in this paper. The ADRC scheme estimates the vehicle uncertainties and the external disturbances in real-time and then compensates them actively. The stability analysis based on the concept of Lyapunov exponents shows that the ADRC control system is exponentially stable around the equilibrium point. Simulations under varying vehicle parameters and disturbances show that the ADRC scheme is able to keep the vehicle within the lane with maximum lateral offset of 0.1 m. Finally, the ADRC scheme is implemented on a scale vehicle. Some necessary electronic devices are installed into the scale vehicle to realize the automated steering. The comparisons between the ADRC scheme and the PID controller show that the scale vehicle controlled by the ADRC scheme performs better with maximum 0.03 m and 0.16 m lateral offsets during the straight and curved lane keeping, respectively. It is also shown that the ADRC scheme is able to perform the lane change. Since the ADRC scheme and the software developed in this paper are independent on a specific platform, they can be implemented on a full-size vehicle.

AB This study aims to identify young adults' travel behavior using ridesharing services. We analyze data from an online survey of university students, regarding three free ridesharing services, including fixed-route, on-demand, and shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Ordinal regression and structural equation model (SEM) are employed to explore the frequency of service usage. Results indicate that most students had never taken a ride by available ridesharing services due to their preferences for using private vehicles and lack of service information. Regression results reveal that individuals' usual mode of transportation and residential location significantly influence ridesharing behavior. Our results also show significant associations between travel attitudes and students' travel behavior. We also found that shared on-demand and autonomous vehicle services could complement fixed-route services. Further research is needed on the link between young people's adoption of integrated ridesharing transportation services.

AB This paper introduces an Intelligent Parking platform for a neighborhood electric vehicle in intelligent multimedia service environment that automatically maneuvering from a traffic lane to the designated spot guided by roadside servers and mobile device. Three challenging problems are considered: one is to consider both low-speed forward driving and several parking maneuvers at the same time with a few in-vehicle sensors and the second one is to control the various sizes and types of passengers vehicles. And the last one is localization and tracking based on video sequences. With the assumptions of low speed and well installed roadside sensors, the platform to deal with two types of parking missions is proposed in this paper. We conduct a feasibility test for verification of our proposed architecture, and we suggest a possible approach to car-sharing service that autonomous mobility vehicle can drive and valet-charge within the limited area in intelligent multimedia service environment.

The autopilot designs are based on the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), a simulated, annealing-tuned control algorithm and a traditional proportional-derivative controller. In addition, each autopilot is integrated with a line-of-sight (LOS) guidance system to test its effectiveness in steering round a series of waypoints with and without the presence of sea current disturbance. Simulation results are presented that show the overall superiority of the ANFIS approach.

TI Evaluation on Braking Stability of Autonomous Vehicles Running along
   Curved Sections Based on Asphalt Pavement Adhesion Properties
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB As the main objective influencing factor on the brake safety of autonomous vehicles, pavement texture information is directly related to road surface antiskid performance. However, in the brake system of autonomous vehicles, the influence of road surface adhesion characteristics on braking stability is seldomly considered. To study the braking stability of autonomous vehicles on curved sections under different road conditions, the advanced close-range photogrammetry system was utilized to extract the road surface texture information. Thereafter, the power spectral density (PSD) of the road surface was calculated by MATLAB to obtain the pavement adhesion coefficient curves based on the Persson friction theory model under different road conditions. Considering the pavement adhesion characteristics, the braking model of autonomous vehicles was built in Simulink, and then, the braking performance on curved sections was analyzed with CarSim/Simulink cosimulation. The results indicate that, according to the adhesion coefficient of different asphalt pavement types under different road conditions, the ranking order is open-grade friction course (OGFC) > stone matrix asphalt (SMA) > dense-graded asphalt concrete (AC). In addition, both the maximum lateral offset distances and the maximum lateral forces of the tires decrease as the curve radius gradually increases under different road conditions. It can also be found that there is a relatively uniform vertical forces distribution of the tire when the curve radius is no less than 100 m, and the limit speed of the vehicle varies parabolically with increasing in curve radius. Compared with dry road, the reduction of vehicle braking deceleration is more significant and the yaw rate is greater on wet road. Last but not least, the braking comfort with a radius of 200 m is the best according to the comfort index (CI) in International Standard ISO, in which the comfort level can be sorted into six levels.

DT Article

AB For an autonomous vehicle that travels off-road, the driving speed is limited by the driving circumstances. To decide on a stable manoeuvring speed, the driving system should consider road conditions such as the height of an obstacle and road roughness. In general, an autonomous vehicle has many sensors to preview road conditions, and the information gathered by these sensors can be used to find the proper path for the vehicle to avoid unavoidable obstacles. However, sensor data are insufficient for determining the optimal vehicle speed, which could be obtained from the dynamic response of the vehicle. This paper suggests an algorithm that can determine the optimal vehicle speed running over irregular rough terrains such as when travelling off-road. In the determination of the manoeuvring speed, the vehicle dynamic simulation is employed to decide whether the vehicle response is within or beyond the prescribed limits. To determine the manoeuvring speed in real time, the dynamic simulation should be finished much more quickly than the real motion speed of the vehicle. In this paper, the equation of motion of the vehicle is derived in terms of the chassis local coordinates to reduce the simulation time. The velocity transformation technique, which combines the generality of Cartesian coordinates and the efficiency of relative coordinates, was combined with a symbolic computation to enhance further the computational efficiency. First the developed algorithm calculates the level of the previewed road roughness to determine the manoeuvring speed. Then, the maximum stable speed is judged against the database, which already has stored the maximum vertical accelerations as a function of the road roughness and vehicle speed.

AB The reliability of environmental perception is the key to ensuring the stability and safety of autonomous vehicles. Complex road environments pose attentional challenges to automated driving, especially for vehicle perception systems. Therefore, evaluating the performance of autonomous driving algorithms in complex road environments is of great significance. However, as road geometry is complex, with many factors, including curvature, slope, lane marking conditions, and so on, the existing approach in assessing an algorithm through detection tests is of low efficiency. Therefore, this study relies on failure prediction modeled by extreme gradient boosting and recursive feature elimination. An evaluation model that could accomplish a quick set of road evaluations is developed. The proposed model generates recognition reliability merely by such features as road design parameters. In addition, road curvature is the most significant environmental factor affecting the perception of autonomous vehicles. The failure rates of the algorithm in different scenarios demonstrate a negative correlation between the radius of curvature and failure perception. The partial dependence involving the radius of curvature and the perception ability is obtained. Furthermore, other features, such as missing lane lines and illumination conditions, are taken into consideration to explore the potential failure perception mode. The proposed method has a particular significance for finding the failure mode of an autonomous driving perception algorithm.

AB This research deals with the autonomous landing maneuver of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). It is assumed that the UGV moves independently, and there is no communication and collaboration between the two vehicles. This paper aims at the design of a closed-loop vision-based control system for quadrotor UAV to perform autonomous landing maneuvers in the possible minimum time despite the wind-induced disturbance force. In this way, a fractional-order fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative controller is introduced for the nonlinear under-actuated system of a quadrotor. Also, a feedback linearization term is included in the control law to compensate model nonlinearities. A supervisory control algorithm is proposed as an autonomous landing path generator to perform fast, smooth, and accurate landings. On the other hand, a compound AprilTag fiducial marker is employed as the target of a vision positioning system, enabling high precision relative positioning in the range between 10 and 350 cm height. A software-in-the-loop simulation testbed is realized on the windows platform. Numerical simulations with the proposed control system are carried out, while the quadrotor system is exposed to different disturbance conditions and actuator dynamics with saturated thrust output are considered.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) integration poses a significant challenge for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). The ability to automatically coordinate complex AV operations at scale is crucial for advancing the quality of core transportation services, such as ride-sharing and parcel delivery. However, existing studies have only considered either of these two services independently from the other, disregarding the potential benefits of their combined optimization. To address this open problem, we design an autonomous vehicle intelligent system (AVIS) providing joint ride-sharing and parcel delivery services under realistic ride and route constraints. We formulate the joint optimization problem through the scope of mixed-integer linear programming and solve it using the Lagrangian dual decomposition method to ensure scalability. We conduct extensive case studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed AVIS and its constituting components. Our experimental results demonstrate that AVIS can effectively provide both ride-sharing and parcel delivery services while satisfying service requests in transportation networks of various scales. In addition, the distributed method is shown to generate near-optimal solutions in reduced computation time.

AB The behavior decision-making algorithm plays an important role in ensuring the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. However, existing behavior decision-making methods lack the capability to cope with future motion uncertainty in traffic, because the historical state of vehicles are not considered. This article proposes a novel driving behavior decision-making method EnMFO-ImGRU based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Moth-Flame Optimization algorithm (MFO). Four improvements are proposed in EnMFO-ImGRU. First, to consider the driving information of the vehicles on the road, ImGRU is designed based on a double-layer GRU. Second, to promote decisions accuracy, Support Vector Machine (SVM), which has good performance in classification problems, replaces the softmax classifier to train the output of the ImGRU. Third, to promote the classification capability of SVM, MFO is introduced to optimize the key parameters that affect the performance of SVM. Finally, to promote the optimization capability of MFO, we propose the Enhanced Moth-Flame Optimization algorithm (EnMFO). A new position updating method is proposed in EnMFO. The experimental results on the NGSIM dataset show that EnMFO-ImGRU brings higher accuracy than existing methods for the behavior decision-making results of autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper proposes an envelope control framework for four-wheel independently actuated autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) to regulate it on desired path and simultaneously control it to the driving limits. The envelope control framework is achieved based on the integrated control of active front-wheel steer and direct yaw-moment control. In a speed controller, the G-G diagram is used to describe the driving limits on each path segment. The desired traction and braking force is calculated according to the G-G diagram and desired path. In a path-following controller, a feedforward-feedback lateral controller is designed to calculate the desired steering angle to follow the desired path. In a yaw-moment controller, the beta-r phase portraits are utilized to describe the handling limits. The yaw-moment controller aims at keeping the AGV from losing stability in limit driving, which is calculated through a sliding mode controller and provided by the independent motors actuation. Through an independent driving technique, the tyre cornering stiffness is estimated online based on the predefined Magic Formula model to improve the controller's robustness. An autonomous Formula Student racecar developed by the authors is used as testbed. The autonomous driving experiments on racetrack validate the efficiency of the proposed controller.

AB Reinforcement learning promises to provide a state-of-the-art solution to the decision making problem of autonomous driving. Nonetheless, numerous real-world decision making problems involve balancing multiple conflicting or competing objectives. In addition, passengers may typically prefer to explore diversified driving modes through their specific preferences (i.e., relative importance of different objectives). Taking into account these demands, traditional reinforcement learning algorithms with applications in personalized self-driving vehicles remain challenging. Consequently, here we present a novel constrained multi-objective reinforcement learning technique for personalized decision making in autonomous driving, with the goal of learning a single model for Pareto optimal policies across the space of all possible user preferences. Specifically, a nonlinear constraint incorporating a user-specified preference and a vectorized action-value function is introduced to ensure both diversity in learned decision behaviors and efficient alignment between the user-specified preference and the corresponding optimal policy. Additionally, a constrained multi-objective actor-critic approach is advanced to approximate the Pareto optimal policies for any user-specified preferences while adhering to the nonlinear constraint. Finally, the proposed personalized decision making scheme for autonomous driving is assessed in a highway on-ramp merging scenario with dynamic traffic flows. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with classical and state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Traffic situations with interacting participants pose difficulties for today's autonomous vehicles to interpret situations and eventually achieve their own mission goal. Interactive planning approaches are promising solutions for solving such situations. However, most approaches are only assessed in simulation, as researchers lack the resources to operate an autonomous vehicle. Likewise, open-source stacks for autonomous driving, such as Apollo, provide competitive and resource-efficient state-of-the-art planning algorithms. However, promising planning concepts from research are usually not included within a reasonable time, possibly due to resource restrictions or technical limitations. Without evaluating these novel algorithms in reality, the benefits and shortcomings of proposed approaches cannot be thoroughly assessed. This work aims to contribute methodology and implementation to integrate a novel mixed-integer optimization-based planning algorithm in Apollo's planning component and assess its performance and real-time capability in theory and practice. It discusses the necessary modifications of Apollo for deployment on a different vehicle and presents three real-world driving experiments on a public road alongside a detailed experience report. The driving experiments show a smooth trajectory tracking performance operating robustly under varying perception data quality and the real-time capability of the closed-loop system.

AB Naturally, the unmanned armoured vehicle is important in military missions and to minimise the casualty of military personnel. Steering control is one of the most important aspects of unmanned vehicles. Therefore, in this research, a trajectory following control from Stanley autonomous vehicle is employed and optimised for a light armoured vehicle (LAV) to follow a predefined trajectory. The proposed controller is developed on a validated armoured vehicle model which consists of a 7-degree-of-freedom handling model and other vehicle interactions. To study the controller's behaviour with respect to each parameter, the sensitivity analysis was carried out. The controller is then optimised using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm and then tested on a physical Pitman arm steering actuator system through hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation. It was shown that the PSO-tuned Stanley controller is able to automatically steer the vehicle to follow the predefined path with an average lateral cross-track error of 0.26 m.

ID FAULT-TREE ANALYSIS; ALGORITHM
AB Autonomous systems are becoming more commonly used, especially in hazardous situations. Such systems are expected to make their own decisions about future actions when some capabilities degrade due to failures of their subsystems. Such decisions are made without human input, therefore they need to be well-informed in a short time when the situation is analysed and future consequences of the failure are estimated. The future planning of the mission should take account of the likelihood of mission failure. The reliability analysis for autonomous systems can be performed using the methodologies developed for phased mission analysis, where the causes of failure for each phase in the mission can be expressed by fault trees.
   Unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) are of a particular interest in the aeronautical industry, where it is a long term ambition to operate them routinely in civil airspace. Safety is the main requirement for the UAV operation and the calculation of failure probability of each phase and the overall mission is the topic of this paper. When components or subsystems fail or environmental conditions throughout the mission change, these changes can affect the future mission. The new proposed methodology takes into account the available diagnostics data and is used to predict future capabilities of the UAV in real time. Since this methodology is based on the efficient BDD method, the quickly provided advice can be used in making decisions, When failures occur appropriate actions are required in order to preserve safety of the autonomous vehicle. The overall decision making strategy for autonomous vehicles is explained in this paper. Some limitations of the methodology are discussed and further improvements are presented based on experimental results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As autonomous driving technology continues to develop, communication for vehicles is becoming more important to provide an efficient and secure driving environment. Currently, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) based on fifth-generation (5G) is the only solution to meet the demanding requirements of self-driving cars in terms of ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliable connectivity under high mobility conditions, earning this technology more attention. Secure communication for vehicle-to-vehicle based on 5G (5G-V2V) is essential because vehicles decide how to maneuver and perceive situations based on the data exchanged. In this paper, we not only propose a new architecture for V2X based on 5G (5G-V2X) by utilizing network slicing (NS) to guarantee different features of V2X services but also analyze security requirements according to V2X service type. We also propose a secure V2V communication scheme based on 5G that satisfies these requirements. The security evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is secure against attacks on a V2V environment via both security proof and verification tool ProVerif. Through the performance evaluation, we prove that our scheme is more effective than the existing schemes while meeting end-to-end delay requirements for autonomous driving.

AB Reliable assessment methods of driver acceptance are needed due to increased interest in high levels of autonomous driving systems. Subjective evaluation methods have mostly been utilized to assess the acceptance of newly developed advanced driver assistance systems because acceptance varies depending on the individual. In this paper, an objective evaluation methodology of driver acceptance for an autonomous driving system was proposed based on objective measurable parameters in the case of automatic lane change situations. To this end, a massive driver-vehicle interaction database was utilized, constructed by a specially designed experimental program. The experiment was carried out with 19 selected drivers (9 experts and 10 novices), supposed as an autonomous driving system. The database consisted of not only various measurable parameters on control commands, vehicle behaviors, and relations with other vehicles but also subjective acceptances. To interpret the driver acceptance, objective parameter sets were derived by two different methods: a statistical significance test and an acceptance sensitivity analysis. Then, a modeling method based on stochastic estimation to evaluate driver acceptance was suggested as an objective evaluation method for the driver acceptance of an automatic lane change system. The data set of the expert drivers was only used for the acceptance evaluation modeling; the other data sets of the novice drivers were used for verifications for the suggested model. The estimation accuracies of the two different models using a significance test and sensitivity analysis were 90.2% and 99.5%, respectively. This objective method for acceptance evaluation can not only be expanded to other functions of an autonomous driving system but also to an entirely autonomous driving vehicle.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) have great potential for achieving beneficial changes to the society. Although recent studies have explored the traffic safety, economic benefits and environmental impact, parking decisions of SAVs is rarely considered. SAVs need to park to avoid cruising during the interval between services. Appropriate parking decisions can contribute to reduce the vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT). This study synergistically considers routing and parking of SAVs for system optimization. Since the problem is NP-hard, we develop a variable neighborhood search (VNS) heuristic to solve it. The heuristic aims to minimize the VKT, the number of SAVs and the parking cost by systematic changes of neighborhood. A series of experiments based on the Anaheim network prove the high solving efficiency and quality of the heuristic. Results also indicate that the marginal cost of the system decreases with the increase in travel demand and the VKT increases with the increase in parking fees.

AB This paper presents a model predictive control-based obstacle avoidance algorithm for autonomous ground vehicles at high speed in unstructured environments. The novelty of the algorithm is its capability to control the vehicle to avoid obstacles at high speed taking into account dynamical safety constraints through a simultaneous optimization of reference speed and steering angle without a priori knowledge about the environment and without a reference trajectory to follow. Previous work in this specific context optimized only the steering command. In this paper, obstacles are detected using a planar light detection and ranging sensor. A multi-phase optimal control problem is then formulated to simultaneously optimize the reference speed and steering angle within the detection range. Vehicle acceleration capability as a function of speed, as well as stability and handling concerns such as preventing wheel lift-off, are included as constraints in the optimization problem, whereas the cost function is formulated to navigate the vehicle as quickly as possible with smooth control commands. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of safely exploiting the dynamic limits of the vehicle while navigating the vehicle through sensed obstacles of different sizes and numbers. It is also shown that the proposed variable speed formulation can significantly improve performance by allowing navigation of obstacle fields that would otherwise not be cleared with steering control alone.

AB The achievements of high driving performance and error minimization of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in harsh weather are the biggest challenges for the society of autonomous research area. AVs are mainly driven by the sensor fusion technology of light detection and ranging (LiDAR), radio detection and ranging (RADAR), and camera sensors. In harsh weather such as rain, storm, law lighting, snowfall, and vapor, the detection performances of all the sensors are obstructed. The camera imaging for object detection systems is highly affected by different types of noise in adverse weather conditions and its performance is very anxious for error-free AV driving. This article proposes the prediction-based adaptive fusion alignment (AFA) algorithm of the robust path and object tracking systems with the deep convolutional neural networking (D-CNN) model for detection accuracy improvement, calculative error reduction, and overall driving error minimization of AVs in harsh weather conditions. RADAR and LiDAR are not deep learning (DL) based yet. The D-CNN model of DL algorithms for camera image processing and the segmentation process of object classification is used for actual object detection and localization. The AV-simulated driving accuracy in harsh weather is significantly increased with the proposed AFA and D-CNN algorithms.

AB People's perceptions of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are critical to understanding the role of AVs in future transportation systems. Most previous work on AVs perceptions is based on large cities or metropolitan areas. This study provides a unique perspective regarding perceptions of impacts of AVs in small and rural communities through an online survey in Central Texas (n = 1153). Our questionnaires gathered basic socio-demographic characteristics and AV impacts variables identified from the literature. We used summary statistics and ordered logistic regression models to reveal the perceived impacts of AVs. Residents of small and rural communities, particularly older adults (65 + years), were more enthusiastic about the development of AVs than the national average. Our findings reveal that being an employed, married male with a higher income increases the likelihood of accepting the impacts of AVs, suggesting further research to explore a feasible approach to utilizing AVs in small, rural communities.

AB Nowadays, road maintenance is a crucial planning task for all road authorities across the world, making them spend vast amounts of money on identification and rehabilitation programmes every year. Thus, many researchers, road engineers, and decision-makers have turned to a system called pavement management system, the critical step of which is pavement inspection. So far, several methods have been proposed for pavement distress data collection and evaluation. These methods have also evolved with the advancement of technology and intelligent transportation systems. Today, researchers have acknowledged autonomous vehicles as a sophisticated tool monitoring right of way for appropriate operating; however, little attention has been paid to using collected pavement condition data for pavement management. This study reviews the technologies and algorithms proposed so far to investigate the feasibility of using the data regularly collected by these vehicles to evaluate pavement conditions. We hope our paper paves the way for further research.

AB Based on an analysis of vehicle mobility performance indices in use, it is shown that an index for the opti-mization of autonomous vehicle mobility performance should be constituted as a set of technical param-eters that should result directly from the interactive dynamics of tires and terrain and should be measurable and controllable in real-time. Besides, the combination of the parameters should characterize the vehicle's technical productivity/efficiency (not energy efficiency), and thus, enable the estimation and control of vehicle mobility performance. If such requirements are satisfied, the index can be optimized and optimization results can facilitate autonomous control design. This article provides results of a study to address the above-formulated requirements in the proposed mobility performance index.Part II discusses the computational results of mobility performance optimization for a 4x4 vehicle sim-ulated on three homogeneous terrains and split terrains on flat surface and on slopes, with and without drawbar pull. Additionally, the vehicle with three conventional driveline systems is simulated in the same terrain conditions, and a detailed analysis establishes dependences between the optimal tire slip-pages and optimal circumferential forces of the wheels and their correlation to those provided by the driveline systems. Advantages of the mobility optimization for control design are explained and dis-cussed. It is also concluded that the use of energy efficiency indices in mobility performance assessment can be considered as a supplementary, but not the primary subject-heading of the vehicle mobility per-formance.The mobility performance optimization directly contributes to mobility design that is illustrated by conceptual implementation of the optimization results in two driveline systems of the 4x4 vehicle: a driveline with positive engagement of the power-dividing units and a virtual driveline that serves for fully electric vehicles with in-wheel motors.Finally, a verification of the mobility optimization results and validation of the proposed mobility per-formance index is conducted through statistics-based assessment against experimental wheel circumfer-ential forces and tire slippages.(c) 2022 ISTVS.

TI Spoofing Attack on Ultrasonic Distance Sensors Using a Continuous Signal

AB Ultrasonic distance sensors use an ultrasonic pulse's time of flight to calculate the distance to the reflecting object. Widely used in industry, these sensors are an important component in autonomous vehicles, where they are used for such tasks as object avoidance and altitude measurement. The proper operation of such autonomous vehicles relies on sensor measurements; therefore, an adversary that has the ability to undermine the sensor's reliability can pose a major risk to the vehicle. Previous attempts to alter the measurements of this sensor using an external signal succeeded in performing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, in which the sensor's reading showed a constant value, and a spoofing attack, in which the attacker could control the measurement to some extent. However, these attacks require precise knowledge of the sensor and its operation (e.g., timing of the ultrasonic pulse sent by the sensor). In this paper, we present an attack on ultrasonic distance sensors in which the measured distance can be altered (i.e., spoofing attack). The attack exploits a vulnerability discovered in the ultrasonic sensor's receiver that results in a fake pulse that is produced by a constant noise in the input. A major advantage of the proposed attack is that, unlike previous attacks, a constant signal is used, and therefore, no prior knowledge of the sensor's relative location or its timing behavior is required. We demonstrate the attack in both a lab setup (testbed) and a real setup involving a drone to demonstrate its feasibility. Our experiments show that the attack can interfere with the proper operation of the vehicle. In addition to the risk that the attack poses to autonomous vehicles, it can also be used as an effective defensive tool for restricting the movement of unauthorized autonomous vehicles within a protected area.

AB Lane-changing (LC) is a critical task for autonomous driving, especially in complex dynamic environments. Numerous automatic LC algorithms have been proposed. This topic, however, has not been sufficiently addressed in existing on-road manoeuvre decision methods. Therefore, this paper presents a novel LC decision (LCD) model that gives autonomous vehicles the ability to make human-like decisions. This method combines a deep autoencoder (DAE) network with the XGBoost algorithm. First, a DAE is utilized to build a robust multivariate reconstruction model using time series data from multiple sensors; then, the reconstruction error of the DAE trained with normal data is analysed for LC identification (LCI) and training data extraction. Then, to address the multi-parametric and nonlinear problem of the autonomous LC decision-making process, an XGBoost algorithm with Bayesian parameter optimization is adopted. Meanwhile, to fully train our learning model with large-scale datasets, we proposed an online training strategy that updates the model parameters with data batches. The experimental results illustrate that the DAE-based LCI model is able to accurately identify the LC behaviour of vehicles. Furthermore, with the same input features, the proposed XGBoost-based LCD model achieves better performance than other popular approaches. Moreover, a simulation experiment is performed to verify the effectiveness of the decision model.

AB This letter presents a hierarchical motion planner for generating smooth and feasible trajectories for autonomous vehicles in unstructured environments with static and moving obstacles. The framework enables real-time computation by progressively shrinking the solution space. First, a graph searcher based on combined heuristic and partial motion planning is proposed for finding coarse trajectories in spatiotemporal space. To enable fast online planning, a time interval-based algorithm that considers obstacle prediction trajectories is proposed, which uses line segment intersection detection to check for collisions. Second, to practically smooth the coarse trajectory, a continuous optimizer is implemented in three layers, corresponding to the whole path, the near-future path and the speed profile. We use discrete points to represent the far-future path and parametric curves to represent the near-future path and the whole speed profile. The approach is validated in both simulations and real-world off-road environments based on representative scenarios, including the "wait and go " scenario. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the success rate and travel efficiency while actively avoiding static and moving obstacles.

AB In practical autonomous vehicle systems, model uncertainty and measurement noise are two challenging factors that deteriorate path tracking accuracy and system stability. This article proposes an adaptive robust controller to deal with these two factors and enhance path tracking accuracy. First, the path tracking model considering time-varying uncertainty is built and represented as nominal and uncertain portions. Second, the control law is designed separately for both portions. A linear quadratic regulator controller is utilized to stabilize the nominal system. An additional robust control law is proposed to suppress the matched uncertainty and measurement noise, with an adaptive scheme aimed at estimating the bound outside uncertainty. The path tracking system with the developed control law is proved to possess uniform boundedness, uniform ultimate boundedness properties, and robustness against mismatched uncertainty. Eventually, the effectiveness of the developed controller is validated using both MATLAB/Simulink-TruckSim co-simulation and an autonomous vehicle platform. The results demonstrate that the designed adaptive robust control can achieve accurate path tracking in the presence of time-varying uncertainty and measurement noise.

AB Position tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle is not trivial as its accuracy is affected by process noise, measurement noise, and uncertain hydrodynamic parameters. Thus, in this article, we studied the position control of an autonomous underwater vehicle that operates under largely unbounded system uncertainties and large noise levels and proposed a method that reduces the interference and thereby enhances the overall autonomous underwater vehicle position estimation. Our technique extended the ensemble Kalman filter by combining it with a time-delay estimator to compensate against extended uncertainty of the system dynamics which cannot be solved by the traditional ensemble Kalman filter. Our synthetic simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed controller, highlighting its appealing position-control accuracy under simultaneous noise and uncertain hydrodynamics parameters. In addition, our simulation results showed that the proposed controller outperforms the conventional time-delay controller by a percentage range of approximately 30.8%-92.6% in terms of root-mean-square error and requires on average less than 88.2% calculation time than the conventional model predictive control.

AB This paper presents a 2D route planner to support operations for an autonomous vehicle conducting missions at high speeds in a large natural terrain. A configurable search engine is used to search a pre-prepared digitized map of the natural terrain and to generate a suboptimal route in terms of distance, safety, and maneuvering. The suboptimal route is more optimized and smoothed by a route filter that produces the optimal route under some conditions. A high-level intelligent supervisory module configures the search engine and assigns weights to the three route cost components to satisfy the mission objectives and the time constraints of the mission. To take advantage of previous route planning experience, an intelligent learning support engine is used to collect route cost data and to build a knowledge base that is used to provide better heuristics to the search engine. The presented approaches and results contribute towards a truly autonomous vehicle capable of conducting complex missions efficiently and in real time. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Autonomous intersection management (AIM) guides vehicles to pass through signal-free intersections individually. Since vehicles are permitted to turn in any direction from any lane in AIM, it is desired to erase lane changes on the entry lane to achieve high traffic efficiency. However, erasing lane changes exposes intersections to complex conflicts. To study the trade-off between lane changes on the entry lanes and conflicts inside the intersection, this paper makes a comprehensive comparison of two kinds of intersection systems. First, all-direction turn lanes (ADTL) and specific-direction turn lanes (SDTL) are designed to distinguish lane change behaviors. Second, a two-stage method is proposed to manage the oncoming vehicles at the intersection. The first stage is timing schedule optimization and the second stage is trajectory optimization. Then, a method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is designed to solve the timing schedule optimization model at high traffic demands. Finally, two parts of simulation experiments are conducted in this paper. The first part verifies the performance of the MCTS-based method. The second part compares ADTL and SDTL in multiple scenarios. The results show that ADTL outperforms SDTL in the efficient system, but the opposite conclusion appears in the fault-tolerant system. Besides, combining ADTL with lane changes may bring out the full value of ADTL.

AB This article proposes a fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy for path following of autonomous vehicles considering faults in the braking actuator. Distinguished from other relevant research, a fault model is designed, and a synthetic fault factor is calculated for the electrohydraulic brake (EHB) system in the case of differential braking. By considering the synthetic fault factor as a time-varying parameter, robust gainscheduling linear parameter- varying (LPV) synthesis H-infinity performance fault-tolerant controller (LPV/H-FTC) is designed to ensure autonomous vehicle stability and safety. In order to deal with different types of braking actuator faults, a generalized fault model is built first. Then, in the case of differential braking, a fault model is proposed for the EHB system based on the generalized fault models, which makes for the analysis and design of the controller. After that, an LPV/H infinity output feedback faulttolerant controller and a braking allocation scheme are designed to ensure the autonomous vehicle's stability and safety under the faults in braking actuators. Finally, the experiments in the HIL system are carried out to verify the effectiveness and real-time performance of the proposed control strategy, and the results show that the proposed control strategy can improve the vehicle's stability and safety under a wide range of types of faults in the EHB system.

AB This article describes the development and implementation of a 3D lidar perception framework to guarantee the precise cognition of the surrounding environment for urban autonomous driving. The proposed framework consists of two different detection modules operating in parallel: a deep learning-based and a geometric model-free cluster-based method. The first module utilizes the convolutional gated recurrent unit (ConvGRU)-based residual network (CGRN). The module aims to repredict 3D objects based on results from a continuous single-frame detection network. A vision-fusion methodology based on 2D projection is adopted for postprocessing in the first module. The second module utilizes geometric model-free area (GMFA) cluster detection and is designed to cope with false-negative cases of unclassified objects from the prior module. For the second module, a cluster variance-based ground removal is conducted to prevent false-positive cases. A kinematic model-based particle filter (PF) is then applied to estimate the dynamic states of detection. The suggested framework has been developed with real-time operation in mind, to be implemented in autonomous vehicles equipped with automotive lidars and low-cost cameras. The test results show that the framework with CGRN and GMFA successfully improved the surrounding object detection and state estimation accuracy in urban autonomous driving.

We develop a procedure of measurement uncertainties modeling directly on the graph. By using the structural and causal properties of the bond graph, the robust diagnosis is performed. The interest of the developed methodology consists in using the graphical tool not only for measurement uncertainties modeling, but also for designing robust fault detection and isolation algorithms. Moreover, this method can be easily automated. The developed approach is validated by an application to an electromechanical traction system of intelligent autonomous vehicle. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we present an innovative approach to steering control, based on torque overlay, for the smooth and efficient transfer of the steering control from an autonomous driving system to the driver, and to control the pinion angle of the rack-mounted electric power steering for lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. The novelty of our approach lies in the formulation of hybrid impedance control, which employs steering control for both lateral and impedance controls. The proposed method, nonlinear hybrid impedance controller, consists of desired impedance pinion angle generator and a super-twisting sliding mode controller for pinion angle tracking. The desired impedance transfer function of the driver's torque to the steering wheel angle reflects the driver's torque to the steering control. The desired impedance pinion angle is generated using the desired impedance transfer function and the desired pinion angle derived by the lateral controller. The sliding mode control method is designed, based on a super-twisting algorithm for the pinion angle, to track the desired impedance pinion angle. Consequently, without the driver's torque, the proposed method is activated as a pinion angle tracking controller for lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. Moreover, with the driver's torque, the proposed method is activated as an impedance controller.

AB This paper presents a high-fidelity autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and an above-water environment simulator developed for, and used by, the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) team at the 2016 Maritime RobotX Challenge. This simulator was developed to address a gap in an existing robotic marine vehicle simulation software by producing high-fidelity sensor data from a realistic operating environment and simulating ASV motion dynamics as a direct interface for hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The key functions required for the simulator to be an effective model of the QUT ASV included a high-fidelity camera, LiDAR (Velodyne HDL-32E), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and GPS sensor simulation, as well as buoyancy and physics simulation for vehicle motion and control performance in a spatiotemporally varying modeled sea state. Another key feature of the simulator was the provision to directly interface the Robotic Operating System (ROS) to publish and subscribe to sensor topics (in real time) and allow hardwarein-the-loop simulation of the ASV systems for algorithm development. The fidelity and performance of the simulator was benchmarked against the existing best available alternative simulator, V-Rep, with results shown to demonstrate that the autonomous marine surface vessel simulator achieved improved computational performance and sensor fidelity when simulating above surface marine environments.

AB This paper proposes a double-layer model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for the integrated path planning and trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles on roads. The upper module is responsible for generating collision-free lane trajectories, while the lower module is responsible for tracking this trajectory. A simplified vehicle model based on the friction cone is proposed to reduce the computation time for trajectory planning in the upper layer module. To achieve dynamic and accurate collision avoidance, a polygonal distance-based dynamic obstacle avoidance method is proposed. A vertical load calculation method for the tires is introduced to design the anti-rollover constraint in the lower layer module. Numerical simulations, with static and dynamic obstacle scenarios, are conducted on the MATLAB platform and compared with two state-of-the-art MPC algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms regarding computation time and collision avoidance efficiency.

AB In this article, the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle is addressed. The vehicle is assumed to be underactuated and the system parameters and the external disturbances are unknown. First, the five degrees of freedom kinematics and dynamics model of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle are acquired. Following this, reduced-order linear extended state observers are designed to estimate and compensate for the uncertainties that exist in the model and the external disturbances. A backstepping active disturbance rejection control method is designed with the help of a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function to constrain the position tracking error. Furthermore, the controller system can be proved to be stable by employing the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the simulation and comparative analyses demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of the proposed controller in the presence of internal parameter uncertainties and external time-varying disturbances.

AB The paper proposes a general framework to manage a team of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), while keeping the communication constraints, during missions execution. Virtual spring-damper couplings (passive by definition) define the distributed interaction forces between neighbouring vehicles. In this way, through passivity theory, a suitable Lyapunov function for the closed loop system is built to ensure stable convergence of the network vehicles to an equilibrium point, also providing robustness in presence of communication fading and delays, very common in the marine environment. Simulations of typical missions show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. An equivalence between this typical port-Hamiltonian framework and a specific class of potential games, the Bilateral Symmetric Interaction (BSI) one, is also established. Hence, modelling the network with passive elements, it is possible to shape the transient behaviour of the players and the reached equilibria at the end of the game.

AB In this paper we propose a novel model-based control method for an autonomous agricultural vehicle that operates in tree fruit orchards. The method improves path following performance by taking into account the vehicle's motion model, including the effects of wheel sideslip, to calculate speed and steering commands. It also generates turn paths that improve visibility of the orchard rows, thus increasing the probability of a successful turn from one row into another, while respecting maximum steering rate limits. The method does not depend on GPS signals for either state estimation or path following, relying instead only on data from a planar laser scanner and wheel and steering encoders. This makes it suitable for real agricultural applications where acquisition cost is key to a farmer's decision to invest in new technologies. We show the controller's stability using Lyapunov functions and demonstrate its feasibility in experiments conducted in an orchard-like nursery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous intersection management has become a state-of-the-art control strategy customized for connected and autonomous vehicles. Combining the advantages of tile-based and conflict point-based approaches, this paper proposes a two-stage optimization method based on a developed intersection modeling approach. The first stage is a timing schedule optimization model, assigning vehicle arrival times at an intersection. Based on the output of the first stage, the second stage is a trajectory optimization model, which gives the eco-driving strategies. Moreover, a rolling optimization with a variable cycle length is adopted to run the method continuously. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the genetic algorithm-based method in terms of computation time, and can reduce vehicle delay and fuel consumption by 89.48% and 46.84%, respectively, under different traffic demands compared to the first-come-first-serve method. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method under asymmetric traffic demand is discussed. Sensitivity analyses suggest that (1) a long cycle length benefits the proposed method within certain limits and (2) a proper deceleration within the intersection can balance traffic delay with fuel consumption. In addition, an additional model with a heuristic rule is compared with the original timing schedule optimization model. It is found that reducing binaries in the first stage can make a tradeoff between the quality of the solution and efficiency, which can be used in conjunction with long cycles.

AB Autonomous transportation is a new paradigm of an Industry 5.0 cyber-physical system that provides a lot of opportunities in smart logistics applications. The safety and reliability of deep learning-driven systems are still a question under research. The safety of an autonomous guided vehicle is dependent on the proper selection of sensors and the transmission of reflex data. Several academics worked on sensor-based difficulties by developing a sensor correction system and fine-tuning algorithms to regulate the system's efficiency and precision. In this paper, the introduction of vision sensor and its scene terrain classification using a deep learning algorithm is performed with proposed datasets during sensor failure conditions. The proposed classification technique is to identify the mobile robot obstacle and obstacle-free path for smart logistic vehicle application. To analyze the information from the acquired image datasets, the proposed classification algorithm employs segmentation techniques. The analysis of proposed dataset is validated with U-shaped convolutional network (U-Net) architecture and region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) architecture model. Based on the results, the selection of 1400 raw image datasets is trained and validated using semantic segmentation classifier models. For various terrain dataset clusters, the Mask R-CNN classifier model method has the highest model accuracy of 93%, that is, 23% higher than the U-Net classifier model algorithm, which has the lowest model accuracy nearly 70%. As a result, the suggested Mask R-CNN technique has a significant potential of being used in autonomous vehicle applications.

AB Modern autonomous vehicles are required to perform various visual perception tasks for scene construction and motion decision. The multiobject tracking and instance segmentation (MOTS) are the main tasks since they directly influence the steering and braking of the car. Implementing both tasks using a multitask learning neural network presents significant challenges in performance and complexity. Current work on MOTS devotes to improve the precision of the network with a two-stage tracking by detection model, which is difficult to satisfy the real-time requirement of autonomous vehicles. In this article, a real-time multitask network named YolTrack based on one-stage instance segmentation model is proposed to perform the MOTS task, achieving an inference speed of 29.5 frames per second (fps) with slight accuracy and precision drop. The YolTrack uses ShuffleNet V2 with feature pyramid network (FPN) as a backbone, from which two decoders are extended to generate instance segments and embedding vectors. Segmentation masks are used to improve the tracking performance by performing logic AND operation with feature maps, proving that foreground segmentation plays an important role in object tracking. The different scales of multiple tasks are balanced by the optimized geometric mean loss during the training phase. Experimental results on the KITTI MOTS data set show that YolTrack outperforms other state-of-the-art MOTS architectures in real-time aspect and is appropriate for deployment in autonomous vehicles.

AB Vehicles have been proven to be an ideal means for terrorists because they can be meticulously prepared well in advance before being deployed in urban and public places. To increase the risk and burden of explosive ordnance disposal teams, third-party vehicles have also been used to block the access path to the explosive loaded vehicle. In this paper, we present a multirobot system that can remove vehicles from confined spaces with delicate handling, swiftly and in any direction to a safer disposal point. The new lifting robots, capable of omnidirectional movement, autonomously underride the identified vehicle and dock to its wheels for a synchronized lifting and extraction. The validity and efficiency of the novel robotic system is illustrated via experiments in an indoor parking lot, demonstrating successful autonomous navigation, docking, lifting, and extraction of a conventional car for a total covered distance of 20 m.

AB Technological advancement of vehicle platforms exposes opportunities for new attack paths and vulnerabilities. Static cyber defenses can help mitigate certain attacks, but those attacks must generally be known ahead of time, and the cyber defenses must be hand-crafted by experts. This research explores reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to achieve autonomous, intelligent cyber defense of vehicle control networks-namely, the controller area network (CAN) bus. We train an RL agent for the CAN bus using Toyota's Portable Automotive Security Testbed with Adaptability (PASTA). We then apply the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Army Research Laboratory's methodology for quantitative measurement of cyber resilience to assess the agent's effect on the vehicle testbed in a contested cyberspace environment. Despite all defenses having similar traditional performance measures, our RL agent averaged a 90% cyber resilience measurement during drive cycles executed on hardware versus 41% for a naive static timing defense and 98% for the bespoke timing-based defense. Our results also show that an RL-based agent can detect and block injection attacks on a vehicle CAN bus in a laboratory environment with greater cyber resilience than prior learning approaches (1% for convolutional networks and 0% for recurrent networks). With further research, we believe there is potential for using RL in the autonomous intelligent cyber defense agent concept.

AB This research aims to study the safety effectiveness of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in reducing pedestrian crashes in various scenarios. The proposed methodology involves (1) identifying factors that contribute to pedestrian crashes, (2) developing crash-frequency models to predict the pedestrian crash and identifying the model that performs the best, (3) identifying the AV and CAV technologies that can minimize and remove those identified factors, and (4) assessing the effectiveness of AV and CAV technologies in reducing pedestrian crashes for various road classifications. Using crash data obtained from San Francisco Transportation Injury Mapping System (TIMS) for 2016 to 2020, a two-level Bayesian Poisson lognormal (TLBPL) model is developed to assess the effectiveness of AVs and CAVs in reducing pedestrian crashes. The outcomes of the TLBPL model suggest that weather, lighting, and road classifications tend to influence more vehicle-pedestrian crashes in all road classifications. The results of TLBPL indicate that driver faults related to prediction ability contribute more to pedestrian crashes for all road classifications, while driver fault related to sensing (perception) on urban arterials is the factor contributing most to pedestrian crashes. This paper provides a framework for researchers and engineers to evaluate AVs' and CAVs' safety effectiveness by considering crash contributing factors and road classifications.

DE LiDAR sensor processor; low-power circuit design; 3D object recognition;
   autonomous vehicle
AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors help autonomous vehicles detect the surrounding environment and the exact distance to an object's position. Conventional LiDAR sensors require a certain amount of power consumption because they detect objects by transmitting lasers at a regular interval according to a horizontal angular resolution (HAR). However, because the LiDAR sensors, which continuously consume power inefficiently, have a fatal effect on autonomous and electric vehicles using battery power, power consumption efficiency needs to be improved. In this paper, we propose algorithms to improve the inefficient power consumption of conventional LiDAR sensors, and efficiently reduce power consumption in two ways: (a) controlling the HAR to vary the laser transmission period (TP) of a laser diode (LD) depending on the vehicle's speed and (b) reducing the static power consumption using a sleep mode, depending on the surrounding environment. The proposed LiDAR sensor with the HAR control algorithm reduces the power consumption of the LD by 6.92% to 32.43% depending on the vehicle's speed, compared to the maximum number of laser transmissions (Nx.max). The sleep mode with a surrounding environment-sensing algorithm reduces the power consumption by 61.09%. The algorithm of the proposed LiDAR sensor was tested on a commercial processor chip, and the integrated processor was designed as an IC using the Global Foundries 55 nm CMOS process.

ID TRANSITION
AB We investigated the effect of driver posture on driving control following a takeover request (TOR) from autonomous to manual driving in level 3 autonomous vehicles. When providing a TOR, driving behaviors need to be investigated to develop driver monitoring systems, and it is important to clarify the effect of driver postures. Experiments were conducted using driver postures that are likely to be adopted in autonomous driving. Driver postures were set based on combinations of two types of upper-body posture and three types of foot posture. The driver's upper body and head were set to either a forward or sideways orientation. For each of these there were three types of foot posture: both feet on the floor, crossed legs, and cross-legged sitting. Following a TOR, we compared the braking and steering maneuvers of subjects driving normally and examined the effects of posture on driver reaction time. The results show that both the upper-body and foot postures of the driver affect the steering and braking reaction time. The driver monitoring system should be able to detect posture and activate a TOR warning, and detection times up to 2 and 1.3 times faster than those for normal postures should be considered for different upper-body and foot postures, respectively.

AB In recent years, the growing development of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), and 5G communication networks have led to the advent of Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems. AIMs present a new paradigm for CAV control in future cities, taking control of CAVs in scenarios where cooperation is necessary and allowing safe and efficient traffic flows, eliminating traffic signals. So far, the development of AIM algorithms has been based on basic control algorithms, without the ability to adapt or keep learning new situations. To solve this, in this paper we present a new advanced AIM approach based on end-to-end Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) and trained using Curriculum through Self-Play, called advanced Reinforced AIM (adv.RAIM). adv.RAIM enables the control of CAVs at intersections in a collaborative way, autonomously learning complex real-life traffic dynamics. In addition, adv.RAIM provides a new way to build smarter AIMs capable of proactively controlling CAVs in other highly complex scenarios. Results show remarkable improvements when compared to traffic light control techniques (reducing travel time by 59% or reducing time lost due to congestion by 95%), as well as outperforming other recently proposed AIMs (reducing waiting time by 56%), highlighting the advantages of using MADRL.

AB Autonomous driving vehicles require both a precise localization and mapping solution in different driving environment. In this context, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology is a well-study settlement. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and camera sensors are commonly used for localization and perception. However, through ten or twenty years of evolution, the LIDAR-SLAM method does not seem to have changed much. Compared with the LIDAR based schemes, the visual SLAM has a strong scene recognition ability with the advantages of low cost and easy installation. Indeed, people are trying to replace LIDAR sensors with camera only, or integrating other sensors on the basis of camera in the field of autonomous driving. Based on the current research situation of visual SLAM, this review covers the visual SLAM technologies. In particular, we firstly illustrated the typical structure of visual SLAM. Secondly, the state-of-the-art studies of visual and visual-based (i.e. visual-inertial, visual-LIDAR, visual-LIDAR-IMU) SLAM are completely reviewed, as well the positioning accuracy of our previous work are compared with the well-known frameworks on the public datasets. Finally, the key issues and the future development trend of visual SLAM technologies for autonomous driving vehicles applications are discussed.

AB As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become widely used in various civil applications, many civil aerodromes are being transformed into a hybrid environment for both manned and unmanned aircraft. In order to make these hybrid aerodromes operate safely and efficiently, the autonomous taxiing system of UAVs that adapts to the dynamic environment has now become increasingly important, particularly under poor visibility conditions. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic self-learning approach for the situation awareness of UAVs' autonomous taxiing. First, the probabilistic representation for a dynamic navigation map and camera images are developed at the pixel level to capture the taxiway markings and the other objects of interest (e.g., logistic vehicles and other aircraft). Then, we develop a self-learning approach so that the navigation map can be maintained online by continuously map-updating with the obtained camera observations via Bayesian learning. An indoor experiment was undertaken to evaluate the developed self-learning method for improved situation awareness. It shows that the developed approach is capable of improving the robustness of obstacle detection via updating the navigation map dynamically.

AB The reliability of perception is crucial for developing higher levels of autonomy to enhance the safety and performance of fully autonomous vehicles. As a result, fault detection in the perception module is an essential function for autonomous vehicles. While many approaches rely on hardware redundancy, necessitating additional sensors, achieving analytical redundancy in perception is a pivotal factor in reducing the cost and complexity of the autonomous system. This paper utilizes a motion predictor for surrounding vehicles and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to evaluate the confidence level of the perception module without requiring additional sensor installations. The motion predictor is designed based on a long short-term memory-based recurrent neural network. The error between the motion prediction and detection results is leveraged to estimate the confidence level of the perception module. In essence, the motion prediction results are treated as redundant sensor measurements. The error distribution is modeled using a GMM, and the cumulative probability density of the GMM is employed to assess the confidence level. The proposed algorithm's effectiveness is evaluated through a driving data-based simulation study with fault injection. This study shows an enhanced sensitivity to injected faults and a reduced time for fault detection. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm provides a quantitative estimate of the performance degradation level of the perception module. This estimation can serve as an indicator of uncertainty that the motion planner should account for.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has been used in many fields, such as medical treatment, video monitoring, and transport. In these regions, the rapid adoption and development of IoT produce a large amount of evidence. For instance, IoT devices such as cameras capture the different facial emotions of drivers in Autonomous driving systems. In completely autonomous vehicles, drivers have trouble in takeover transfers as they become discon-nected from the actual aspect of driving. Factors affecting takeover effectiveness, such as lead time and the par-ticipation of non-driving-related tasks, have been concentrated. Nevertheless, considering the vital role of emotions, human communication and manual driving affect drivers' takeover efficiency. Face identity is essential for emotional sensitivity detection for drivers in autonomous vehicles. Automated and intelligent face recogni-tion (FR) devices are highly accurate in a comfortable condition and unregulated, with poor reliability in auton-omous vehicles. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can significantly perceive and express feelings in well-being and similar fields. This study suggests an optimized IoT architecture that facilitates the physiological signal with wire-less transmission to the database management center. Face Recognition and Emotion Detection based on IoT (FRED-IoT) has been proposed to track drivers' emotional and face recognition in autonomous vehicles. A low delay of 2 milliseconds is achieved in the proposed IoT Protocols. In contrast with cutting-edge technology, FRED-IoT improves reliability and achieves a high rating (F-score) of 96%.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

To ensure the successful adoption of AVs, an increasing number of studies have been conducted to understand public acceptance. This paper used the bibliometric technique to understand the distribution, emerging trend, and the research cluster in the context of AV technology acceptance through knowledge mapping. The Web of Science database was used to retrieve 401 scientific articles from 2000 to June 2022. The findings reported that the previous studies mainly focused on the research clusters related to the domains of attitude, trust, technology, impact, and models. Finally, this study added to the existing body of literature by providing the current knowledge landscape to guide the future research.

A ranked choice stated preference design is used to elicit responses from Austin area residents regarding AV adoption. Our results underscore the need to examine the adoption of technology through a psycho-social lens. In particular, technology developments and design should not be divorced from careful investigations of habits and consumption motivations of different groups of individuals in the population. The findings from our analysis are translated to specific policy actions to promote AV adoption and accelerate the adoption time frame.

DT Article
DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); Sliding mode control; Fuzzy logic
   control; Lyapunov stability
AB In this study, a robust and adaptive tracking control is designed for a complete nonlinear model of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The tracking control is accomplished by proposing an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control (AFSMC) scheme. Firstly, the fuzzy control rules are derived using the Lyapunov energy function to minimize the chattering in the control signal, which is commonly appeared in conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, an adaptive control law is obtained to adapt the fuzzy consequent parameter of a fuzzy logic controller which enhances the stability of the whole system. Simulations were carried out under different sets of reference trajectories to test the potency of the AFSMC. The proposed method not only eliminates the problem of chattering but also reduces the steady-state errors in tracking control. In addition, due to adaptive control law, the proposed AFSMC is effective in adapting the unknown lumped uncertainty acting on the vehicle dynamics.

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; OUTPUT REGULATION; REINFORCEMENT
AB This paper investigates the resilient distributed secure output path following control problem of heterogeneous autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) subject to cyber attacks based on reinforcement learning algorithm. Most existing results are subject to the same attack models for all communication channels, however multiple channels launched by different attackers are considered in this paper. First, a predictor-acknowledgement clock algorithm for each vehicle is proposed to judge whether the communication channel among neighboring vehicles is attacked or not by receiving or transmitting an acknowledgement. Then, a resilient distributed predictor is proposed to predict the pinning vehicle's state for each vehicle. In addition, a resilient local control protocol consisting of the feedforward state provided by the predictor and the local feedback state of each vehicle is developed for the output path following problem, which is further converted to the optimal control problem by designing a discounted performance function. Discounted algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) are derived to address the optimal control problem. An off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is put forward to learn the solution of discounted AREs online without any prior knowledge of vehicles' dynamics. It is shown that the RL-based output path following control problem of AGVs imposed by cyber attacks can be achieved in an optimal manner. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.

TI Robust control strategy for platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles

DE Connected and autonomous vehicle; control barrier function; falsified
   information injection; platoon control; robust control; state observer
ID MODEL; FLOW
AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in a platoon can exchange real-time information using Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technology to enhance platoon control performance. However, the V2V communication technology also provides opportunities for cyber-attacks, where falsified information can be injected into vehicle controllers to disrupt the platoon operation and even induce vehicle collisions. To address this problem, this study proposes a robust platoon control strategy for CAVs to mitigate the impacts of the falsified information to maneuver the CAV platoon to achieve consensus safely. The proposed control strategy consists of three components: (i) a H-infinity robust control law, which consistently negates the disturbance induced by falsified information; (ii) a state observer which estimates the vehicle states and disturbance induced by falsified information and inputs the estimated results into the H-infinity robust control law to compute a synthesized control decision; and (iii) a control decision regulator which applies a Control Barrier Function-based Quadratic Programming (CBF-QP) to regulate the control decision computed by the H-infinity robust control law to avoid actuator saturation issue and ensure safe spacing for each vehicle in the platoon. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can effectively drive the CAV platoon to the desired consensus safely and efficiently under the impacts of falsified information injection.

AB Advances in IoT and IoV technology have made connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) data sources. Using CAVs as data sources and in incident management algorithms can create faster, more reliable, and more effective algorithms. This paper proposes a modified standard normal deviation (MSND) incident detection algorithm that uses CAVs as data sources and considers multiple traffic parameters. MSND is utilized in conjunction with two other incident detection algorithms, Standard Normal Deviation (SNS) and California (CAL), in a method of incident management known as Variable Speed Limits (VSL). SUMO Traffic Simulation Software is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A 10.4-kilometer road network is developed. Numerous scenarios are simulated on this road network, with variables including traffic demand, autonomous vehicle penetration rate, incident location, incident length, and incident lane. On the effectiveness metrics of detection rate, false alarm rate, and mean time to detect, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the SND and California methods. In terms of detection rate, the MSND algorithm performs the best, with a 12.27% improvement over the SND algorithm and a 21.99% improvement over the California method. After integrating all incident detection algorithms with the VSL traffic management method and simulating each combination, it was determined that the MSND-VSL integration reduced average density in the critical region by 19.73 percent, followed by SND-VSL with a 13.94 percent reduction and CAL-VSL with a 9.9 percent reduction.

DE autonomous; routing; last-mile delivery
AB We seek to determine in what geographies autonomous vehicle assisted delivery is most valuable for last-mile delivery. To build insights across urban-to-rural settings, we conduct a case study by generating test instances that reflect real-world geographies. We integrate real-world data for these instances, including driving and walking times, as well as obstacles, such as one-way streets, and their impact on last-mile delivery. We model the capacitated autonomous vehicle assisted delivery problem as an integer program on a general graph. To solve this model on realistically sized instances, we exploit the structure of the optimal solution to develop a number of preprocessing techniques to reduce the large number of variables present in the generic problem. We also introduce valid inequalities that raise the lower bound and reduce the size of the branch-and-bound tree. Autonomous vehicle assisted delivery reduces the completion time of the delivery tour and provides the most cost-effective business model in all customer geographies. In particular, a delivery person saves more time in urban environments than in rural environments. These savings are the result of both a reduction in the time to park but also in the amount of walking that the delivery person does. This increased productivity could reduce fleet size and ultimately the number of vehicles on the road. These conclusions support businesses with urban deliveries considering investment in this technology. However, higher savings in rural environments may be achieved by reducing the loading time.

AB In this paper, an optimal lateral control method for autonomous vehicle based on multi-stage handling inverse dynamics is proposed. By applying this method, the vehicle can be controlled to complete the corresponding driving task without tracking a certain ideal state variable trajectory. Firstly, a separate-stage handling inverse dynamics problem is described; and by setting the connections between each stage, a multi-stage handling inverse dynamics model is developed; then we convert the inverse dynamics problem into an optimal control problem (OCP). Secondly, an improved hp-adaptive Radau pseudospectral method (hp-RPM) is applied to discrete the continuous OCP; and then the sequential quadratic programming is used to solve the problem. In addition, the results of contrast verification show that, when solving non-smooth problem, the improved hp-RPM has higher computational efficiency than hp-RPM. Finally, simulations under three typical cases and bench tests illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB 3D object detection from LiDAR point cloud is a challenging task in autonomous driving systems. Collaborative perception can incorporate information from spatially diverse sensors and provide significant benefits for accurate 3D object detection from point clouds. In this work, we consider that the autonomous vehicle uses local point cloud data and combines information from neighboring infrastructures through wireless links for cooperative 3D object detection. However, information sharing among vehicles and infrastructures in predefined communication schemes may result in communication congestion and/or bring limited performance improvement. To this end, we propose a novel collaborative 3D object detection framework using an encoder-decoder network architecture and an attention-based learnable communications scheme. It consists of three components: a feature encoder network that maps point clouds into feature maps; an attention-based communication module that propagates compact and fine-grained query feature maps from the vehicle to support infrastructures, and optimizes attention weights between query and key to refine support feature maps; a region proposal network that fuses local feature maps and weighted support feature maps for 3D object detection. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on CARLA-3D, a new dataset that we synthesized using CARLA for 3D cooperative object detection. Experimental results and bandwidth consumption analysis show that the proposed collaborative 3D object detection framework achieves a better detection performance and communication bandwidth trade-off than five baseline 3D object detection models under different detection difficulties.

AB As an important content in intelligent vehicle technology, the design of lane changing path directly decides the quality of control in autonomous lane changing realization. This paper first summarizes the design principle of existing intelligent vehicle lane changing techniques. Then a novel lane changing path based on the X-Sin function is constructed. The X-Sin function is designed to combine the outstanding smoothness of sine function and the linear characteristic of the constant-speed shift function. With parameters including vehicle velocity, lane width and the maximum lateral acceleration, the proposed design solves the problems in lane changing path including jump point in lane changing path curvature and nonsmooth lane changing path. A tracking controller is designed using quadratic optimum control to track the lane changing path. The effectiveness and steadiness of the proposed lane changing path is demonstrated by MATLAB simulation and real-vehicle experiments.

AB In this paper, we propose a driving system consisting of an autonomous and manual system for a four-wheel independent steering and four-wheel independent driving (4WIS4WID) vehicle. The autonomous driving system consists of three applications, lane following, reverse parking, and parallel parking, and is based on machine vision and fuzzy control theory. The vehicle implements these functions by using four webcams to detect lines on the ground and by using related control technologies to command all the server motors. The webcams are installed on all sides of the 4WIS4WID vehicle for all around viewing, but the vehicle still has many blind spots and the view is not wide enough. In additon, a parking space cannot be viewed completely in one image. Therefore, the integrating judgements of vision with the fuzzy control methods is necessary to make sure that the 4WIS4WID vehicle can perform the correct motions. By using the proposed fuzzy rules, the 4WIS4WID vehicle can change its velocity in a timely way under any condition and can successfully move in a narrow and curved lane. Moreover, the manual driving system is designed based on the traditional driving system, so that people can easily adapt to it. In order to verify the feasibility of these applications for the 4WIS4WID vehicle, an indoor real-time experiment is conducted.

AB Fundamental design principles are presented for vehicle systems governed by autonomous cruise control devices. By analyzing the corresponding delay differential equations, it is shown that for any car-following model short-wavelength oscillations can appear due to robotic reaction times, and that there are tradeoffs between the time delay and the control gains. The analytical findings are demonstrated on an optimal velocity model using numerical continuation and numerical simulation.

ID ROBOT NAVIGATION; VISION; REPRESENTATION; IMAGES
AB In this paper, we present a complete framework for autonomous vehicle navigation using a single camera and natural landmarks. When navigating in an unknown environment for the first time, usual behavior consists of memorizing some key views along the performed path to use these references as checkpoints for future navigation missions. The navigation framework for the wheeled vehicles presented in this paper is based on this assumption. During a human-guided learning step, the vehicle performs paths that are sampled and stored as a set of ordered key images, as acquired by an embedded camera. The visual paths are topologically organized, providing a visual memory of the environment. Given an image of the visual memory as a target, the vehicle navigation mission is defined as a concatenation of visual path subsets called visual routes. When autonomously running, the control guides the vehicle along the reference visual route without explicitly planning any trajectory. The control consists of a vision-based control law that is adapted to the nonholonomic constraint. Our navigation framework has been designed for a generic class of cameras (including conventional, catadioptric, and fisheye cameras). Experiments with an urban electric vehicle navigating in an outdoor environment have been carried out with a fisheye camera along a 750-m-long trajectory. Results validate our approach.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB This article presents an approach to address the problem of localisation within the autonomous driving framework. In particular, this work takes advantage of the properties of polytopic Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems and set-based methodologies applied to Kalman filters to precisely locate both a set of landmarks and the vehicle itself. Using these techniques, we present an alternative approach to localisation algorithms that relies on the use of zonotopes to provide a guaranteed estimation of the states of the vehicle and its surroundings, which does not depend on any assumption of the noise nature other than its limits. LPV theory is used to model the dynamics of the vehicle and implement both an LPV-model predictive controller and a Zonotopic Kalman filter that allow localisation and navigation of the robot. The control and estimation scheme is validated in simulation using the Robotic Operating System (ROS) framework, where its effectiveness is demonstrated.

The AI agent, which is equipped with multiple rangefinder sensors for obstacle detection, is trained and evaluated in a challenging, stochastically generated simulation environment based on the OpenAI gym Python toolkit. Notably, the agent is provided with real-time insight into its own reward function, allowing it to dynamically adapt its guidance strategy. Depending on its strategy, which ranges from radical path-adherence to radical obstacle avoidance, the trained agent achieves an episodic success rate close to 100%.

AB Connected autonomous driving is considered as a potential way to improve traffic safety. However, when positioning information is delivered through network, the network time delay could result in additional positioning errors, which has been proved by the experiment done in this paper in XuChang automatic driving center that the influence of one-way time delay will lead to meter-scale positioning error. In this paper, we propose a positioning calibration mechanism for connected autonomous vehicles called PCM. PCM firstly estimates the network time delay and then saves the calibrated location information in the MEC server to reduce the positioning error caused by network time delay. Experiments in FangShan and XuChang automatic driving centers verify the performance of PCM, and the result shows that PCM can reduce the positioning error to centimeter-level. For example, under 100ms time delay, the average positioning error without PCM is 119.67cm, while the average positioning error with PCM is 3.03cm. Experimental results show that PCM can effectively reduce the positioning error caused by a one-way time delay to centimeter-level, which is strictly required for positioning autonomous vehicles in automatic driving.

AB The path planning issue of the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under ocean current disturbance is studied in this paper. In order to improve the AUV's path planning capability in the unknown environments, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) path planning method based on double deep Q Network (DDQN) is proposed. It is created from an improved convolutional neural network, which has two input layers to adapt to the processing of high-dimensional environments. Considering the maneuverability of underactuated AUV under current disturbance, especially, the issue of ocean current disturbance under unknown environments, a dynamic and composite reward function is developed to enable the AUV to reach the destination with obstacle avoidance. Finally, the path planning ability of the proposed method in the unknown environments is validated by simulation analysis and comparison studies.

AB Localization is a key task for autonomous vehicles. It is often solved with GNSS but due to multipath the performance is often not sufficient. Feature localization systems using LiDAR can deliver an accurate localization but the creation of the necessary feature maps is an effortful task. With digitization of urban planning processes a lot of street level data is being generated and increasingly becomes openly available. We propose a novel feature localization system which utilizes geometric fingerprinting to robustly associate features to a feature map generated from this open data from the city of Berlin. With this association, we perform a precise localization of a vehicle in areas spanning over several square kilometers using an optional IMU, the vehicle's CAN-odometry and an initial pose estimate. We evaluated our system with our autonomous car in real world scenarios and achieved a centimeter precision localization accuracy outperforming a high-cost GNSS. The source code will be published at https://github.com/dcmlr/fingerprint-localization.

AB Cooperative Vehicle and Infrastructure System (CVIS) and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) are two mainstream technologies to improve urban traffic efficiency and vehicle safety in the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). However, there remain significant obstacles that must be overcome before fully unmanned applications are ready for widespread adoption in a transportation system. To achieve fully driverless driving, the perception ability of vehicle should be accurate, fast, continuous, and wide-ranging. In this paper, an interactive perception framework is proposed, which combines the visual perception of AV and information interaction of CVIS. Based on the framework, an interactive perception-based multiple object tracking (IP-MOT) method is presented. IP-MOT can be divided into two parts. First, a Lidar-only multiple object tracking (L-MOT) method obtains the status of surroundings using the voxel cluster algorithm. Second, the preliminary tracking result is fused with the interactive information to generate the trajectories of target vehicles. Two simulation platforms are established to verify the proposed methods: CVIS simulation platform and Virtual Reality (VR) test platform. The L-MOT algorithm is tested on a public dataset and the IP-MOT algorithm is tested on our simulation platform. The results show that the IP-MOT algorithm can improve the accuracy of object tracking as well as expand the vehicle perception range via combination of CVIS and AV.

AB The three-dimensional (3D) perception of autonomous vehicles is crucial for localization and analysis of the driving environment, while it involves massive computing resources for deep learning, which can't be provided by vehicle-mounted devices. This requires the use of seamless, reliable, and efficient massive connections provided by the 6G network for computing in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework with 6G enabled transport system for joint optimization of depth and ego-motion estimation, which is an important task in 3D perception for autonomous driving. A novel loss based on feature map and quadtree is proposed, which uses feature value loss with quadtree coding instead of photometric loss to merge the feature information at the texture-less region. Besides, we also propose a novel multi-level V-shaped residual network to estimate the depths of the image, which combines the advantages of V-shaped network and residual network, and solves the problem of poor feature extraction results that may be caused by the simple fusion of low-level and high-level features. Lastly, to alleviate the influence of image noise on pose estimation, we propose a number of parallel sub-networks that use RGB image and its feature map as the input of the network. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of the depth map and the localization accuracy and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

AB To solve the problem of trajectory tracking for 4WS autonomous vehicles under high speed emergency obstacle avoidance, an improved trajectory tracking controller combining four-wheel steering (4WS) feed-forward control and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feed-back control is proposed. First, a polynomial obstacle avoidance trajectory of small radius and sharp curve is established and its several variables are analysed. Second, in order to make actual yaw rate follow steady-state value based on reference model, the steering gain of the improved 4WS feed-forward control can change with steering angular frequency and vehicle speed. Third, combined with the LQR feed-back control, the deviations between actual lateral displacement and desired lateral displacement are controlled under 0.05 m. Finally, CarSim (R) simulation results show that 4WS autonomous vehicles based on the controller can not only avoid obstacles in time, but also improve active safety and handling stability under high speed emergency obstacle avoidance.

AB In this paper, an autonomous vehicle function management methodology is studied. At the decision-making level, the proposed system chooses the optimal function [adaptive cruise control (ACC) or a lane change maneuver (LCM)] that is consistent with the user-selected driving mode, such as fast travel, cautious driving, and efficient travel mode, whereas the control level is implemented via a neuromorphic strategy based on the brain limbic system. To realize the decision-making strategy, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used by considering driving safety, traffic flow, and fuel efficiency as objectives, while LCM and ACC are chosen as the alternative functions. The adaptive AHP is further suggested to cope with the dynamically changing traffic environment. The proposed adaptive AHP algorithm provides an optimal relative importance matrix that is essential to making decisions under varying traffic situations and driving modes. The simulation results show that the proposed structure produces an effective approach to autonomous vehicle function management.

AB With the increasing speeds of modern microprocessors, it has become ever more common for computer-vision algorithms to find application in real-time control tasks. In this paper we present an analysis of the problem of steering an autonomous vehicle along a highway based on the images obtained from a CCD camera mounted in the vehicle. We explore the effects of changing various important system parameters like the vehicle velocity, the look-ahead range of the vision sensor; and the processing delay associated with the perception and control systems.
   We also present the results of a series of experiments that were designed to provide a systematic comparison of a number of control strategies. The control strategies that were explored include a lead-lag control law, a full-state linear controller and an input-output linearizing control law. Each of these control strategies was implemented and tested at highway speeds on our experimental vehicle platform, a Honda Accord LX sedan.

AB This article describes a method for real-time integrated motion planning and control aimed at autonomous vehicles. Our method leverages feedback control, positive invariant sets, and equilibrium trajectories of the closed-loop system to produce and track trajectories that are collision-free with guarantees according to the vehicle model. Our method jointly steers the vehicle to a target region and controls the velocity while satisfying constraints associated with future motion of surrounding obstacles. We develop a receding-horizon implementation of the control policy and verify the method in both a simulated road scenario and an experimental validation using a scaled mobile robot with car-like dynamics using only onboard sensing. The results show that our method generates dynamically feasible and safe (i.e., collision-free) trajectories in real time, and indicate that the proposed planner is robust to sensing and mapping errors.

The control input for each ASV is composed of two parts: the optimal nominal control input and the ancillary control input. The optimal nominal control input is generated by solving a distributed MPC (DMPC) problem based on the state information of itself and its neighbors. The offline ancillary control law aims to ensure that the actual system state trajectory evolves in a hyper-tube centered along the optimal nominal state trajectory. A coupled inter-vehicle safety constraint is designed for the DMPC optimization problem to guarantee the inter-ASV collision avoidance. Theoretical results on ensuring the feasibility of the proposed robust DMPC algorithm are provided and the closed-loop systems are proved to be input-to-state stable. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical results.

AB This paper presents an offline mapping algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AV) with low-cost sensors. The mapping algorithm consists of five key steps. First, data pre-processing is conducted to calibrate the original odometry data. Then, based on a 2D laser scanner and the calibrated odometry data, a virtual 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is built. In the third step, loop closure is performed to search the revisited region and calculate the distance displacement. Afterward, the optimizer is applied to generate the final trajectory. Finally, by fusing the point cloud data from virtual 3D LiDAR and the final trajectory, the point cloud map is generated. Field experiments are conducted in both open and urban areas. In these two cases, satisfactory point cloud maps are built even the vehicle travels a long distance with loop closure, and the constructed point cloud map can be used for AV localization.

AB Expert drivers have the ability to perform high side-slip angle maneuvers, like drifting, during racing to minimize lap time or avoid obstacles. Designing planning and control algorithms for autonomous drift maneuvers, however, is challenging because of the high lateral motion and nearly full saturation of rear tires. In this paper, the authors propose a complete path planning and motion control framework to plan and track a reference drift trajectory along a sharp bend in a track. The path planner divides the path horizon into three regions, finds a path using different planning sub-modules, and then concatenates the solutions to generate the reference trajectory. The controller then applies a mixed open-loop and closed-loop scheme to track the reference trajectory. We validate the planning and control algorithms in simulation using a high-fidelity model in Simulink/Carsim, and through experimentation using 1/10 scale Radio-Control (RC) vehicle.

AB This article presents a computational framework to efficiently generate feasible and safe trajectories for multiple autonomous vehicle operations. We formulate the optimal motion planning problem as a continuous-time optimal control problem, and approximate its solutions in a discretized setting using Bernstein polynomials. The latter possess convenient properties that allow to efficiently compute and enforce constraints along the vehicles' trajectories, such as maximum speed and angular rates, minimum distance between trajectories and between the vehicles and known obstacles, etc. Thus, the proposed method is particularly suitable for generating trajectories in real-time for safe operations in complex environments and multiple vehicle missions. We show, using a rigorous mathematical framework, that the solution to the discretized optimal motion planning problem converges to that of the continuous-time one. The advantages of the proposed method are investigated through numerical examples.

AB This work brings a novel planning and operational concept of the foreseen use of autonomous public transport vehicles through a new coupling-decoupling strategy. The defined problem covers vehicle scheduling, fleet composition, and the combined station location infrastructure in a joint optimization framework taking into consideration simultaneously supplier (operator) and user (passenger) standpoints. The formulation consists of multi-objective, mixed integer, linear programming model to integrate multiple demand configurations and various fleet sizes. A Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm is developed to solve a decision-making, strategy-based, integration problem. In addition, classical deficit function graphical theory is applied to capture the unit circulation process. Finally, the solution approach is validated by a small case study in Auckland, New Zealand. The results of two scenarios indicate cost reductions of 6.79% and 14.29%.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) formation may be carried out in a complex maritime environment. The formation-containment tracking problem is faced with challenges due to limited input saturation and maritime safety constraints. Based on communication-measurement union, a navigation control integration framework is proposed to solve the poor observability of underwater acoustic communication interactions. Moreover, a control protocol based on distributed robust model predictive control is designed to efficiently coordinate cooperation between AUVs. With the proof of the Lyapunov theory, the proposed control method can achieve formation-containment tracking even in the presence of external disturbances. Finally, a 7-AUV formation-containment tracking numerical simulation is designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB An increasing number of studies employ virtual reality (VR) to evaluate interactions between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and pedestrians. VR simulators are valued for their cost-effectiveness, flexibility in developing various traffic scenarios, safe conduct of user studies, and acceptable ecological validity. Reviewing the literature between 2010 and 2020, we found 31 empirical studies using VR as a testing apparatus for both implicit and explicit communication. By performing a systematic analysis, we identified current coverage of critical use cases, obtained a comprehensive account of factors influencing pedestrian behavior in simulated traffic scenarios, and assessed evaluation measures. Based on the findings, we present a set of recommendations for implementing VR pedestrian simulators and propose directions for future research.

AB This paper presents a biologically inspired architecture for rapid real-time control of autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles based on a neural model of the escape response of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana. The architecture fuses exteroceptive and proprioceptive inputs in a manner similar to the insect to produce commands for collision avoidance and, in some cases, orientation for target strike. It functions as a reflexive subsystem that integrates smoothly with higher-level planning and behavioral control systems. The performance of the reflex is demonstrated in simulation and in hardware experiments on both air and ground vehicles, even in the presence of noisy, false or disruptive sensor data.

AB The selection of an appropriate control strategy is essential for ensuring safe operation in autonomous driving. While numerous control strategies have been developed for specific driving scenarios, a comprehensive compar-ative assessment of their performance using the same tuning methodology is lacking in the literature. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art model-free and model-based control strategies. The objective is to evaluate and contrast the performance of these controllers across a wide range of driving scenarios, reflecting the diverse needs of autonomous vehicles. To facilitate the comparative analysis, a comprehensive set of performance metrics is selected, encompassing accuracy, robustness, and comfort. The contributions of this research include the design of a systematic tuning methodology, the use of two novel metrics for stability and comfort comparisons and the evaluation through extensive simulations and real tests in an experimental instrumented vehicle over a wide range of trajectories.

AB Understanding driver interaction behavioral semantics has potential benefits to autonomous car's decisionmaking design. This article presents a framework of analyzing various encountering behaviors through decomposing driving encounter sequential data into small building blocks, called traffic primitives, using a Bayesian nonparametric learning (BNPL) approach. This framework offers a flexible way to gain semantic insights into complex driving encounters without any prerequisite knowledge of interaction behavior categories. Its effectiveness is then validated using 976 naturalistic driving encounters from which more than 4000 traffic primitives were learned with the BNPL approach. After that, a dynamic time warping method integrated with k-means clustering is then developed to cluster all these extracted traffic primitives into groups. Experimental results identify 20 kinds of traffic primitives capable of representing the essential components of driving encounters in our database. Based on the results, we conclude that the proposed primitive-based analysis could prove useful for autonomous vehicle applications.

AB In this paper, we propose a speed-bump detection method for an autonomous vehicle by using a camera and light detection and ranging (lidar). A speed bump may have an impact with a vehicle if its speed does not decrease during driving. To prevent this, it is necessary to detect a speed bump and determine its position. In this study, we use a camera and lidar to detect and locate a speed bump. In addition, two detectors are used to extract and verify candidates for speed-bump. The detection method first extracts the regions of the speed-bump candidate using an image pattern. Then, using the image pattern and distance information, the speed bump is detected in the candidate area. The result includes the area of the speed bump, classification result, and speed-bump height information. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of detection and improves the classification accuracy of pedestrian crossings with similar patterns.

AB Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UW-ASNs) consist of stationary or mobile nodes such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), which may be classified as propeller-driven vehicles and gliders, that are equipped with a variety of sensors for performing collaborative monitoring tasks. The missions entrusted to the AUVs in this work are critical to human life and property, are bound by severe time and energy constraints, and involve a high degree of inter-vehicular communication. In this work, a task allocation framework for networked AUVs that participate as a team to accomplish critical missions is developed. The team formed as a result of this task allocation framework is the subset of all deployed AUVs that is best suited to accomplish the mission while adhering to the mission constraints. Research specific to this area has been limited, hence a task allocation framework for networked AUVs to accomplish critical missions is proposed.

DE Autonomous vehicle; self-driving; patent citation; cross-citation; main

AB Autonomous vehicles have been widely discussed recently due to the rapid advancement of related technologies and high growth potential in many markets around the world. To take a strategic position for coping with their fast development, business strategists have to find out the key players and how these players share technological information in the knowledge network. This research particularly explores the main technologies that have been developed and applied in this field by conducting a systematic and quantitative analysis to answer these questions. We analyse U.S. patents related to autonomous driving technology in a systematic manner through cross-citation analysis (CCA) and main path analysis (MPA). The former reveals knowledge flow among major players, while the latter uncovers the technology development trajectory and the associated players. The results of CCA indicate that several companies (e.g. Google and GM) in the U.S. utilise locational advantage to build an industrial chain and to facilitate knowledge exchange. MPA results reveal a development trajectory and the key players at different development phases. Our analysis infers four trends. First, more solutions in communication systems will be patented in the future as communication is crucial to realise vehicle-to-everything. Second, perception technologies are integrating with artificial intelligence to enhance vehicle autonomy. Third, players with roles as "technology developer", "technology integrator", and "technology implementer" in different development phases are together advancing autonomous driving technologies. Fourth, traditional vehicle makers are expected to strengthen their cooperation with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) companies for the purpose of obtaining communication and data technologies.

AB This article proposes a compact vectorized representation approach to realize reliable obstacle detection for autonomous ground vehicles. Bridging the gap between the advantage of occupancy grid map in general obstacle detection and its shortcomings in memory-consuming and computational cost, a novel obstacle representation by multiple convex polygons is first proposed. Specially, to overcome the computational challenge brought by many 3-D point cloud, based on ground plane extraction and nearest obstacle selection, 3-D obstacle points are transformed into 2-D obstacle points. In addition, the maintenance process of grid map with a fixed range is proposed to further improve efficiency. More importantly, the compact obstacle representation is realized via multiple convex polygons through double threshold-based boundary simplification and convex polygon segmentation. The compact vectorized representation is the main contribution, which achieves the goal of compactness and accuracy on the premise of ensuring effective and reliable obstacle detection. The proposed approach has been applied in a practical autonomous driving project because of its superior performance on general obstacles detection. In addition, the quantitative evaluation shows the superior performance on making use of fewer number of points (decreased by about 50%) to represent local static environments.

AB Taking into account the issues faced by self-driving vehicles in multilane expressway scenarios, a lane-change decision planning framework that considers two adjacent lanes is proposed. Based on this framework, the lateral stability of an autonomous vehicle under near-limit conditions during lane change is studied by the phase-plane method. Firstly, a state-machine-based driving logic is designed and a decision method is proposed to design the lane-change intention based on the surrounding traffic information and to consider the influence of the motion state of other vehicles in the adjacent lanes on the self-driving vehicle. In order to realize adaptive cruising under the full working conditions of the vehicle, a safety distance model is established for different driving speeds and switching strategies for fixed-speed cruising, following driving, and emergency braking are developed. Secondly, for the trajectory planning problem, a lane-change trajectory based on a quintuple polynomial optimization method is proposed. Then, the vehicle lateral stability boundary is investigated; the stability boundary and rollover boundary are incorporated into the designed path-tracking controller to improve the tracking accuracy while enhancing the rollover prevention capability. Finally, a simulation analysis is carried out through a joint simulation platform; the simulation results show that the proposed method can ensure the driving safety of autonomous vehicles in a multilane scenario.

AB This article proposes a radar image segmentation and tracking method by learning radar images for autonomous surface vehicles. To identify marine objects from radar images, we propose a deep neural network named the dual path squeeze and excitation network (DPSE-Net). By learning the radar images, the proposed DPSE-Net is designed to segment every pixel of the radar images into four classes: marine objects, land, noise, and background. The proposed DPSE-Net shows the best performance in radar image segmentation while operating in real-time, compared to state-of-the-art real-time image segmentation network models. In addition, we design a real-time moving object tracking algorithm for estimating the position and velocity of marine objects based on deep simple online real-time tracking with a deep association metric (DeepSORT), a widely used tracking algorithm. The existing DeepSORT algorithm uses the intersection over union (IoU) metric and a deep appearance descriptor for data association, but since they are not suitable for radar images, successive tracking is difficult. To solve this problem, a new data association metric suitable for radar images is proposed. The field tests in ocean environments confirm that the proposed method performs better in marine object segmentation and tracking.

AB Autonomous landing on the deck of a boat or an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is the minimum requirement for increasing the autonomy of water monitoring missions. This paper introduces an end-to-end control technique based on deep reinforcement learning for landing an unmanned aerial vehicle on a visual marker located on the deck of a USV. The solution proposed consists of a hierarchy of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) used as high-level navigation policies that address the two phases of the flight: the marker detection and the descending manoeuvre. Few technical improvements have been proposed to stabilize the learning process, such as the combination of vanilla and double DQNs, and a partitioned buffer replay. Simulated studies proved the robustness of the proposed algorithm against different perturbations acting on the marine vessel. The performances obtained are comparable with a state-of-the-art method based on template matching.

AB This paper considers the distributed coordinated tracking problem of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles with a time-varying reference trajectory. Each vehicle is subject to model uncertainty and time-varying ocean disturbances. A novel predictor-based neural dynamic surface control design approach is proposed to develop the node controllers, under which synchronization between vehicles can be reached on condition that the augmented graph induced by the vehicles and the reference trajectory contains a spanning tree. The prediction errors are used to update the neural adaptive laws, which enable fast identifying the vehicle dynamics without excessive knowledge of their dynamical models. Further, this result is extended to the output-feedback case where only position-yaw information can be measured. A local predictor, based on its own position-yaw information, is constructed, not only to recover the unmeasured velocity information, but also to identify the unknown dynamics for each vehicle. A linear matrix inequality-based analysis is performed for the stability of the predictor. Then, distributed output-feedback tracking controllers are developed to achieve synchronization between vehicles in the presence of unknown dynamics and unmeasured velocities. For both cases, the stability properties of the closed-loop network are established via Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB The proper functioning of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for thesafety and efficiency of future intelligent transport systems. Meanwhile, transitioning to fully autonomousdriving requires a long period of mixed autonomy traffic, including both CAVs andhuman-driven vehicles. Thus, collaborative decision-making technology for CAVs is essential togenerate appropriate driving behaviors to enhance the safety and efficiency of mixed autonomytraffic. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have become an efficient way insolving decision-making problems. However, with the development of computing technology, graphreinforcement learning (GRL) methods have gradually demonstrated the large potential to furtherimprove the decision-making performance of CAVs, especially in the area of accurately representingthe mutual effects of vehicles and modeling dynamic traffic environments. To facilitate the developmentof GRL-based methods for autonomous driving, this paper proposes a review of GRL-basedmethods for the decision-making technologies of CAVs. Firstly, a generic GRL framework is proposedin the beginning to gain an overall understanding of the decision-making technology. Then, theGRL-based decision-making technologies are reviewed from the perspective of the constructionmethods of mixed autonomy traffic, methods for graph representation of the driving environment,and related works about graph neural networks (GNN) and DRL in the field of decision-makingfor autonomous driving. Moreover, validation methods are summarized to provide an efficientway to verify the performance of decision-making methods. Finally, challenges and future researchdirections of GRL-based decision-making methods are summarized.

AB In an earlier paper (Tien 2015), the author defined the concept of a servgood, which can be thought of as a physical good or product enveloped by a services-oriented layer that makes the good smarter or more adaptable and customizable for a particular use. Adding another layer of physical sensors could then enhance its smartness and intelligence, especially if it were to be connected with each other or with other servgoods through the Internet of Things. Such sensed servgoods are becoming the products of the future. Indeed, autonomous vehicles can be considered the exemplar servgoods of the future; it is about decision informatics and embraces the advanced technologies of sensing (i.e., Big Data), processing (i.e., real-time analytics), reacting (i.e., real-time decision-making), and learning (i.e., deep learning). Since autonomous vehicles constitute a huge quality-of-life disruption, it is also critical to consider its policy impact on privacy and security, regulations and standards, and liability and insurance. Finally, just as the Soviet Union inaugurated the space age on October 4, 1957, with the launch of Sputnik, the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the U. S. has inaugurated an age of automata or autonomous vehicles that can be considered to be the U. S. Sputnik of servgoods, with the full support of the U. S. government, the U. S. auto industry, the U. S. electronic industry, and the U.S. higher educational enterprise.

AB This paper presents the ACFR five round abouts dataset, a collection of over 23,000 vehicle trajectories of real world naturalistic driving at unsignalized intersections. This data was taken using a lidar based perception and tracking system onboard a stationary vehicle near the intersections. The focus of this dataset is single lane round abouts, as these unstructured intersections have no signals dictating which vehicle has right-of-way, meaning that there is considerable negotiation between vehicles. The method for data capture is presented, as well as a study of the collected data including data preprocessing techniques and data analytics. The data preprocessing techniques are focused around preparing the data for machine learning training. The extensiveness of this dataset makes it essential to validate algorithms for state of the art ADAS and autonomous vehicles. The paper concludes with a focus study of some of the outliers in the data.

AB The study proposes an active collision avoidance system to allow safe lane-changing manoeuvres by self-steering vehicles in the presence of the uncertainties associated with nearby vehicles and the surrounding environment. This system integrates estimation of conflict probability, model predictive control and dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) techniques to ensure a collision-free operation. To accomplish this, the proposed system uses model predictive control to predict the future positions of vehicles and estimates the conflict probability so as to reduce the risk of collision. The system also exploits DSRC techniques to facilitate the gathering of information from nearby vehicles so that potential conflicts can be detected at an earlier stage. Autonomous vehicles can thus make adjustments based on the acquired data to avoid collisions in a real communication environment. The effectiveness of the method has been verified under experimental conditions. The influences of key parameters in the control method are examined.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are widely expected to improve travel opportunities for older people. However, despite an established body of knowledge regarding the factors that influence personal mobility as people age, there has been limited assessment of how AVs might interact with these factors. The potential for driverless cars to pose adverse impacts on the elderly has similarly received limited critical research. This paper reports upon a systematic literature review, compiling research on AVs against wider theory on the travel behaviours of older people. A conceptual framework of policy interactions is devised, and corresponding scenarios of potential mobility politics are presented. It is concluded that the implications of AVs for older people are likely to be varied and, importantly, will be influenced by policy responses.

First, the structure of NQTAUV is illustrated, a mathematical model based on the Rodrigues parameters is proposed, and the attitude-tracking error model is derived. To simplify the disturbance-observer design procedure, a disturbance observer with a single parameter was designed to estimate the disturbance torque acting on the vehicle. The controller was designed to track the target attitude, and the stability of the whole system is analyzed. Finally, the performance of the proposed method was validated by three experiments. The primary benefit of the proposed method is the simplicity of its tuning and implementation.

AB This article presents a design method for the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle with unknown current disturbances. To simplify the complexity of the controller and avoid the singular problem induced by initial state constraints, a novel nonlinear backstepping technique based on virtual control variables is employed to design the kinematics and dynamics controllers. The control law is developed by building virtual errors, which can solve the problem of differential explosion in the traditional backstepping. Specifically, an ocean current observer based on the kinematics model is proposed to estimate unknown current disturbances, where the estimation is integrated into the autonomous underwater vehicle kinematics and dynamics equations. The convergence of tracking errors and system stability are proven by using Lyapunov stable theory. Finally, the simulation studies were provided to illustrate the effectiveness and good performance of the above trajectory tracking strategy.

AB Vision-based motion control of an autonomous vehicle operating in real world requires fast image processing and robustness with respect to noisy sensor readings and with respect to varying illumination conditions. In order to improve vehicle navigation performance in out-door environments, this paper presents methods for recognizing landmarks based on fuzzy reasoning. Firstly, a fuzzy thresholding algorithm is proposed to segment roads and to extract white line marks on streets from images. Secondly, some special domain knowledge about edges on roads represented by fuzzy sets is integrated into the rule base of a fuzzy edge detector. Based on this, the fuzzy thresholding algorithm is adopted to recognize road edges. In addition, a method for path planning in sensor space is presented and a path following behavior based on a fuzzy rule base is defined to control vehicle motion. The proposed methods are applied to navigate the THMR-III autonomous vehicle in out-door environments. Some experimental driving maneuvers have been performed to prove their effectiveness and their robustness....

AB One of the primary, if not most critical, difficulties in the design and implementation of autonomous systems is the black-boxed nature of the decision-making structures and logical pathways. How human values are embodied and actualised in situ may ultimately prove to be harmful if not outright recalcitrant. For this reason, the values of stakeholders become of particular significance given the risks posed by opaque structures of intelligent agents. This paper explores how decision matrix algorithms, via the belief-desire-intention model for autonomous vehicles, can be designed to minimize the risks of opaque architectures. Primarily through an explicit orientation towards designing for the values of explainability and verifiability. In doing so, this research adopts the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach as a principled framework for the incorporation of such values within design. VSD is recognized as a potential starting point that offers a systematic way for engineering teams to formally incorporate existing technical solutions within ethical design, while simultaneously remaining pliable to emerging issues and needs. It is concluded that the VSD methodology offers at least a strong enough foundation from which designers can begin to anticipate design needs and formulate salient design flows that can be adapted to the changing ethical landscapes required for utilisation in autonomous vehicles.

AB The demonstration, showcase, and city studies of autonomous vehicles (AVs) provide valuable opportunities for the public to interact with AV. Understanding the relationship between experiencing and intention to use AV is crucial because first-hand experience shapes an individual's initial impressions on autonomous driving. This study investigated the users' intention to use AVs based on extended theory of planned behavior, which incorporated experience satisfaction and trust. The data were collected through a field experiment from 117 respondents who had experienced a SAE Level 4 autonomous minibus in China. The proposed relationships were examined using partial least squares structural equation modelling. A satisfied experience contributes to a higher degree of trust, attitude, subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Excluding SN, results suggest that attitude, PBC, experience satisfaction, and trust, are statistically proven to affect the intention to use AV. Moreover, an examination of individual difference reflects that the impact of experience satisfaction on PBC varies distinctively in male and female group, as well as in less educated and more educated group. Findings show the theoretical contributions and practical implications on the role of initial experience of AV acceptance.

AB Motion coordination of autonomous vehicles has applications from target surveillance to climate monitoring. Previous research has yielded stabilizing control laws for a self-propelled vehicle model with first-order rotational dynamics, but this model does not adequately describe the rotational dynamics of vehicles in the atmosphere or ocean. This paper describes the design of backstepping algorithms for the decentralized control of self-propelled vehicles with second-order rotational dynamics. We design backstepping controls for parallel and circular formations in the absence of a flowfield and in the presence of a steady, uniform flowfield. These controls extend prior results to a more realistic vehicle model. Aside from the addition of new sensing and communication requirements, the second-order control laws are demonstrated to have comparable performance to the first-order controllers.

AB This paper seeks to establish the accuracy of an autonomous vehicle working in a field of transplanted cauliflowers. The main sensing systems, odometry and image analysis, are briefly described as is the control system which is based on a fusion of the two data sources using a Kalman filter. Experiments to establish accuracy are described. These were carried out on four plots of cauliflowers with varying degrees of disruption to the visual scene. The RMS error of vehicle lateral position control was 20 mm, while the RMS error of estimated vehicle position was about 10 mm. Little effect of the disruption on position control was observed, It is concluded that these accuracies would be sufficient to control a vehicle and an associated crop treatment device but that improvements to the vehicle controller would make the control of the treatment device easier.

AB A line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law with an explicit model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The derived LOS law is based on quaternion angles thus avoids the problem of singularity inherited in Euler angles. The proposed guidance and control scheme is computationally inexpensive and generates a robust optimal control signal for AUV dynamics. In view of the practical implementation, the constraints on control planes and parametric uncertainties are taken into consideration while designing the proposed control law. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by both simulation and experimentation using a prototype AUV developed in the laboratory. Subsequently, multiple experiments were conducted to ascertain the applicability of the proposed algorithm in a practical scenario.

TI Stable Autonomous Spiral Stair Climbing of Tracked Vehicles Using Wall
   Reaction Force
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS

DE Motion control; autonomous vehicle navigation; dynamics
AB In this letter, an autonomous spiral stair climbing method for tracked vehicles using the reaction force from side walls has been proposed. Spiral stairs are one of the most difficult terrains for tracked vehicles because of their asymmetrical ground shape and small turning radius. Tracked vehicles are expected to be used in industrial plant inspection tasks, where robots should navigate on multiple floors by ascending the stairs. Spiral or curved stairs are installed as part of inspection passages for cylindrical facilities, such as boilers, chimneys, or large tanks. Previously, the authors have experimentally demonstrated that the wall-following motion is effective for stabilizing and accelerating spiral stair climbing. However, the complete automation of climbing motion or the analysis of why the same motion is generated even if a disturbance exists in the initial entry angle to the wall should be investigated. In this study, the authors developed an autonomous spiral stair climbing method using the wall reaction force and clarified the applicable limitations of this method using a geometrical model. Autonomous spiral stair climbing is realized by attaching passive wheels on its collision point and automating the motions of main tracks and sub-tracks. The geometrical model shows the expected trajectory of the robot on the spiral stairs, which suggests that the robot' s rotation radius converges to a specific value; this is experimentally confirmed by measuring the robot's motion. The wall-following motion of robots is equivalent to human inspectors grasping handrails while climbing stairs. Through collisions with surrounding objects, motion is stabilized and certainty is guaranteed.

AB Mission planning for autonomous marine vehicle operations normally considers journeys over long periods of time. Due to these long transit times, obstacles and hazards may be treated as independent. However, when docking, or operating in other similarly spatially constrained environments, this modelmay no longer be appropriate. In particular, the space between obstacles and the resultant constraints on vehicle motion may dominate the required planning model. This becomes important when considering the model of planning complex autonomous actions. Autonomous Surface vessels are increasing in capability to the point where they will be able to independently plan and execute complex tasks including many different spatially related subtasks. For an efficient selection of such tasks to be performed, the ability to explore and evaluate potential future states is required. To allow such exploration, the complex real-world environment must be reduced to a simplified model comprehensive enough to allow effective planning while still maintaining the simplicity required for effective search to be performed on future states. This paper discusses an alternate model for planning using a Delaunay triangulation for the creation of maritime planning domains in spatially constrained environments. Using data and tasks from the 2016 Maritime RobotX competition, this model is evaluated to assess the effectiveness and safety of the generated plans. The use of a Delaunay triangulation within this environment is shown to reliably generate mission plans that cover large and complex obstacle fields while selecting achievable paths and meeting task constraints.

AB This paper is concerned with the problem of trajectory tracking control of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles subject to parameter uncertainties and nonlinear external disturbances. A robust control scheme is presented by employing backstepping method, neural network and sliding mode control. In addition, the overall signals are guaranteed the uniformly ultimate boundness by the Lyapunov stability theory. These advantages are highlighted as follows: (i) The derivations of virtual variables are obtained by a second-order filter. A compensation loop is proposed to reduce the filtered errors between the filtered variables and virtual variables. (ii) The neural network is combined with low-frequency learning techniques to estimate and approximate unknown functions of system.(iii) An anti-windup design is employed to restrict the amplitude of control inputs. Finally, simulation results show the strong robustness and tracking effectiveness of the designed control scheme under the nonlinear external disturbances.

AB This paper examines the challenges associated with the efficient planning and operation of an E-grocery delivery system using Autonomous Delivery Robots (ADR) during unforeseen events. The primary objective is to minimize unfulfilled customer demands rather than focusing solely on cost reduction, considering the humanitarian aspect. To address this, a two-echelon vehicle routing problem is formulated, taking into account stochastic service times and demands. Two models, namely a deterministic model and a chance-constraint model, are employed to solve this problem. The results demonstrate that the chance-constraint model significantly reduces unmet demands compared to the deterministic model, particularly when the delivery deadline has a broad time window and the ADR/van speed ratio is moderate.

AB In order to realize three-dimensional stable control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), this study analyses nonlinear hydrodynamic characteristics of AUVs based on the mathematical Taylor series. The nonholonomic control system properties of AUVs are investigated using nonholonomic system theory under three-dimensional control input. The constraint of underactuated AUVs is proved not to be integrated by the local integrability theorem, and the controllability of underactuated AUVs is verified through small-time local controllability (STLC). In order to simplify the trigonometric terms in underactuated AUV motion functions, quaternion theory is applied to transform the function to develop a continuous time-varying controller. Results of a simulation experiment show that this control law is effective in achieving three-dimensional stabilization from arbitrary initial positions.

AB This paper introduces an innovative adaptive generalized super twisting algorithm (AGSTA) controller combined with a time-delay estimator (TDE) to address the trajectory-tracking issue in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) impacted by disturbances. AUVs utilized in underwater exploration often carry sensors, such as Doppler velocity logs, for position and speed determination. However, owing to instrument precision limitations and other factors, these sensors suffer from a slow sampling speed. Furthermore, manual tuning requirement, conventional GSTAs do not provide substantial benefits in real-world applications, adversely affecting AUV position control. To rectify this issue, we proposed a TDE founded on delayed sensor data to estimate the vehicle fluid dynamics, integrated with an AGSTA, to enhance the controller performance. A comprehensive stability analysis of the control system was carried out under these parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through simulation results.

AB New technological advances have made possible the recent development of automated and connected vehicles. However, there are still challenges to overcome. For example, maintaining constant values for speed and distance between vehicles when the connection has been interrupted. In this line of research, this paper presents the extension of the 3DCoAutosim simulation platform to integrate platooning by means of a dynamic-flexible model that we validate by creating use cases on traffic efficiency. We measured the effects of dynamic flexible and consistent platooning on battery energy consumption taking into account real-world trips data, collected in Upper Austria. For this purpose we used three electric vans with an autonomous leader, a first semi-autonomous follower with driver and a last autonomous follower. The results showed that the proposed model is able to demonstrate a decrease of the total battery energy consumption when driving in platoon mode.

AB Laser scanners are widely used as the primary sensor for autonomous driving. When the commercialization of autonomous driving is considered, a 2.5-D multi-layer laser scanner is one of the best sensor options. In this paper, a new method is presented to detect pedestrians and vehicles using a 2.5-D multi-layer laser scanner. The proposed method consists of three steps: 1) segmentation; 2) feature extraction; and 3) classification; this paper focuses on the last two steps. In feature extraction, new features for the multi-layer laser scanner are proposed to improve the classification performance. In classification, radial basis function additive kernel support vector machine is employed to reduce the computation time while maintaining the performance. The proposed method is implemented on a real vehicle, and its performance is tested in a real-world environment. The experiments indicate that the proposed method has good performance in many real-life situations.

The objective is to automate chemical spraying by means of autonomous navigation and machine vision. A camera is used as the sensor device, and a bar of spraying nozzles is provided to perform the spraying. The proposed solution consists of recovering maps of the environment from the image sequence, and exploring them to locate the path to be followed and the nozzles that have to be switched on. The motion parameters of the vehicle are used to place the images in the map, and are computed from a feature-tracking method. The plants and the weeds are identified through segmentation, and the features to be tracked are computed from the contours of the plants.

AB Shared mobility is a promising travel mode in the era of autonomous driving. Travelers may no longer own a vehicle, but use shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) services. This study investigates the effects and feasibility of SAV-based shared mobility, which includes ride-sharing and car sharing strategies, by using a data-driven modeling approach. Ride-sharing indicates that two trips with similar origin-destination information can be combined into a new one, whereas car sharing indicates that trips can be fulfilled by a single vehicle consecutively. On the basis of license plate recognition data of Langfang, China, this study extracts the urban-scale vehicle travel demand information. Models for ride-sharing and car-sharing are formulated to generate SAV assignment strategies for fulfilling travel demands. This study reveals the prospects and potential problems of SAV-supported shared mobility at different development stages by setting a variety of scenarios with different participation levels of ride-sharing and car-sharing. The minimum fleet size to fulfil the vehicle travel demand in the road network and the total vehicle stock in the urban area are compared under different scenarios, and the effects of shared mobility on vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and parking demand are evaluated. This study also reveals the impacts of SAVs in a practical scenario, which is constructed based on an online survey. Results show that ride-sharing and car-sharing with high participation will lead to considerable benefits, i.e., reductions in fleet size, vehicle stock, and parking demand. Under the shared mobility scenario with 100% ride-sharing and car-sharing participation levels, one SAV can potentially replace 3.80 private conventional vehicles in the road network. However, ride-sharing and car-sharing exhibit opposite effects on VKT. Car-sharing alone increases VKT whereas car-sharing and ride-sharing together have the potential to decrease VKT. This study provides insights for understanding the development of shared mobility and facilitating the efficient utilization of SAVs.

AB Platoon merging control of autonomous vehicles driving in a platoon formation can improve traffic efficiency. However, current platoon merging control approaches primarily rely on rules, making it challenging to achieve optimal control. In this study, we propose a platoon merging control approach based on a deep Q-network (DQN). First, we specify the state and action of the vehicle and establish a set of reward functions to ensure safe driving. Then, the DQN algorithm is used to train a neural network suitable for merging the controls of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to continuously approach the state-value function. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with a rule-based (RB) vehicle merging approach using a MATLAB simulation. In particular, CAVs are driven simultaneously using the two approaches in a random environment. The simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based vehicle merging approach requires less merging travel time and fewer vehicle lane change times than the RB approach. Additionally, merging can result in improved capacity in medium and high traffic densities compared with no-merging: the higher the CAV penetration rate, the larger the improvement. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach for different initial conditions. We suggest that the proposed method is a safe and robust method for CAV platoon merging, and that it can be applied to increase the capacity of freeways and roads.

AB This paper presents an autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle (AUUV) that can be used as a support tool for research tasks in underwater exploration, and as a platform to test different control, communication, or vision algorithms. The vehicle operates without an external power cable and with an original modular program where a web page is enabled as a graphical user interface for wireless communication with the vehicle when it is not submerged. The modular design of the program, based on open-source libraries, allows updating or modifying the configuration of each of its main modules: control, inertial unit, and vision. Experimental results are shown to validate the performance of the proposed vehicle, implementing a non-linear control that includes a PID for the trajectory tracking of its pose (position and orientation).

AB This paper presents a path planning and tracking framework for autonomous mining articulated vehicles (AVs). The relation space method is proposed for path planning. In this method, a self-organising, competitive neural network is adopted to identify the space around the vehicle. Then, the vehicle's optimal driving direction is determined by using the spatial geometric relationships of the identified space. A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is used to control the vehicle speed, whereas a model predictive control (MPC) is designed for steering control, where the path tracking error model is used for MPC development. In addition, the AV's dynamics model is built in Adams. The effect and sensitivity of the path-tracking controller are validated through the Matlab-Adams co-simulation. The test results show the satisfactory path-tracking performance.

AB Advances in vehicle-networking technologies have enabled vehicles to cooperate in mixed traffic. However, realizing the cooperative decision-making of multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) when influenced by the presence of connected manual vehicles (CMVs) is a challenging area in current research. In this study, we propose a coalition game-based (CG-based) model for multi-CAV cooperative decision-making in a connected mixed traffic environment. First, the model integrates the perceived risk field theory, quantifying the driving risk from the perspective of different CMVs; this risk is used to determine the uncertainty of the motion state of CMVs. Second, the model can identify the conflicts caused by multiple lane-changing vehicles and decouple the conflict problem into multiple two-vehicle lane-changing games, including a cooperative game between two CAVs and a non-cooperative game between a CAV and a CMV. To test the proposed model, four scenarios that blocked the passage of multiple CAVs were set up; in these scenarios, the average speed of the CG-based model was 21.05, 16.76, 23.17, and 12.55% higher than that of the LC2013 model. The simulation results showed that the CG-based model could improve the efficiency of multiple CAVs while ensuring safety in a mixed traffic flow.

AB A robust model predictive control (MPC) method with dual closed-loops is presented to handle trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with uncertain model parameters and random external perturbations. First, constraint conditions are set for the motion state and control input of the underwater vehicle based on its motion characteristics. The position controller takes the velocity increment as input, thus providing a smoothly varying desired velocity for the velocity controller. The velocity controller comprises nominal MPC and a nonlinear auxiliary control law to overcome the effect of random perturbations on AUV tracking control. Then, a finite-time extended state observer (FTESO) is designed to compensate for dynamic model uncertainty. Furthermore, Lyapunov stability theory is employed to analyse the stability of the controller and FTESO. Ultimately, through comparative simulation experiments, the proposed control framework's effectiveness and robustness are verified, proving it to be a feasible AUV trajectory tracking control method.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to drastically change the structure of future cities and regions. Researchers predict different outcomes to result from the emergence of CAV technology. While some see their potential as amounting to a complete overhaul of the transport system, others predict the technology will be slow to be adopted and may face competition from other mobility options such as drones. Therefore, the future can be viewed along a spectrum, ranging from no CAVs to a fully driverless transport system. This paper presents an overview of the past attempts on studying CAVs and their impacts to provide a comprehensive view about possible futures with CAVs. The paper presents detailed discussions on the adoption scenarios for CAV and their possible impact on city and transport systems. A bibliometric analysis is also provided in the paper to elaborate on the evolution of disciplines related to CAVs.

AB We present a registration strategy based on a planar primitive group for indoor environments between a large-scale point cloud and a small-scale point cloud, providing a localization solution that is fully independent of prior information about the initial positions of the two point cloud coordinate systems. The algorithm first divides the point cloud into planes by region growing and then refines the plane boundaries by local k-means clustering. The planes are grouped to obtain planar primitive groups that are used to infer potential matching regions for an effective coarse registration and then fine-tuning. The algorithm is applied for autonomous vehicle localization in underground garages. Evaluation on four datasets shows that the algorithm can provide decimeter-level localization accuracy in seconds.

AB In-situ visual observations of marine organisms is crucial to developing behavioural understandings and their relations to their surrounding ecosystem. Typically, these observations are collected via divers, tags, and remotely-operated or human-piloted vehicles. Recently, however, autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with cameras and embedded computers with GPU capabilities are being developed for a variety of applications, and in particular, can be used to supplement these existing data collection mechanisms where human operation or tags are more difficult. Existing approaches have focused on using fully-supervised tracking methods, but labelled data for many underwater species are severely lacking. Semi-supervised trackers may offer alternative tracking solutions because they require less data than fully-supervised counterparts. However, because there are not existing realistic underwater tracking datasets, the performance of semi-supervised tracking algorithms in the marine domain is not well understood. To better evaluate their performance and utility, in this paper we provide (1) a novel dataset specific to marine animals located at http://warp.whoi.edu/vmat/, (2) an evaluation of state-of-the-art semi-supervised algorithms in the context of underwater animal tracking, and (3) an evaluation of real-world performance through demonstrations using a semi-supervised algorithm on-board an autonomous underwater vehicle to track marine animals in the wild.

AUVs have, only recently, received more attention and underwater platforms continue to dominate the research. To ensure the success of an accurate AUV localisation mission, the problem of drift on the estimated trajectory must be overcome. In order to improve the positioning accuracy of the AUV localisation, a new filter referred to as the Adaptive Smooth Variable Structure Filter (ASVSF) based SLAM positioning algorithm is proposed. To verify the improvement of this filter, the combined SVSF and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are presented. Experimental results based on dataset for underwater SLAM algorithm show the accuracy and stability of the ASVSF AUV localisation position. Several experiments were tested under real-life conditions with an autonomous underwater vehicle based on different filters. The results of these filters have been compared based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and in terms of localisation and map building errors. It is shown that the adaptive SVSF-SLAM strategy obtains the best performance compared to other algorithms.

AB We analyse disturbance rejection for a platoon of vehicles with intelligent cruise control, both for the spatially discrete model and the continuum model with open and periodic boundary conditions. By explicitly calculating the eigenmodes for both the discrete and the continuum models, we derive the dynamic response of an individual discrete mode, as well as the response of a single vehicle to disturbances generated through either boundary vehicles or vehicles within the platoon. It is shown that if the biasing is small then the n-mode truncated continuum model and the spatially discrete model predict same qualitative responses to disturbances for the lower order modes. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, the two types of models predict quantitatively the same responses to disturbances for a range of feedback gains.

AB This work describes the development of a computational model created to autonomously navigate a fishlike underwater vehicle with a multivertebra spine and a flexible tail. First, a two-dimensional numerical simulation, developed previously, and based on an unsteady panel method, was coupled with the vehicle, spine, and tail dynamics. Numerous test cases spanning a wide range of swimming conditions were processed with the simulation, and these data were subsequently used to train an artificial neural network. The navigation procedure/neural network uses as input a set of vehicle geometric and state variables, and from that, it predicts the needed vehicle body deformations, i.e., necessary spine vertebrae rotations, so that the vehicle can navigate through a set of given waypoints. Validation results are presented that show the accuracy of the present flow-structure interaction solver, and several test cases of autonomous navigation are presented to show the capabilities of the current method.

AB Development of new approaches to adaptive traffic signal control has received significant attention; an example is the reinforcement learning (RL), where training and implementation of an RL agent can allow adaptive signal control in real time, considering the agent's past experiences. Furthermore, autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has shown promise to enhancing the traffic mobility at highways and intersections. In this paper, delayed action deep Q-learning is developed for a vehicle network with signalized intersections to control the signal phase. A model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed to allow AVs to adapt their speed. Several case studies that consider mixed autonomy are examined aiming at reducing network traffic and fuel consumption in the traffic network with multiple intersections. Simulation studies reveal that even with a few AVs in the network, the waiting time, fuel consumption, and the number of stop-and-go movements are significantly reduced, while the travel time is increased.

AB In order to realize the lane-changing maneuver of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), a lateral controller based on model predictive control is developed with the three degrees of freedom vehicle dynamic model. Then the controller is synthesized to track the reference trajectory fitted by the quintic Bezier curve. The controller is validated by MATLAB/CarSim under different road adhesion conditions and driving speeds. Results show that for different road adhesion conditions and driving speeds, the controller does not need to adjust the control parameters and can continuously correct the deviation from the expected trajectory. During the tracking process, the front wheel angle, front wheel angle increment, centroid side deflection angle, and front wheel side deflection angle are kept within the limited constraint range. The established control algorithm has good control robustness and tracking driving stability. The research can provide a theoretical basis and technical support for lane-changing safety and control of CAV.

AB This paper provides a model-parameter-free control strategy for the trajectory tracking problem of the autonomous underwater vehicle exposed to external disturbances and actuator failures. Two control architectures have been constructed such that the system states could be forced to the desired trajectories with acceptable performance. By combining sliding mode control (SMC) technology and adaptive algorithm, the first control architecture is developed for tracking missions under healthy actuators. Taking actuator failures scenario into account, system reliability is improved considerably by the utilization of a passive fault-tolerant technology in the second controller. Benefitting from properties of Euler-Lagrange systems, the nonlinear dynamics of the underwater vehicles could be handled properly such that the proposed controllers could be developed without model parameters. Finally, the validity of the proposed controllers is demonstrated by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. (C) 2021 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new approach for autonomous reversing of a tractor-semitrailer vehicle called minimum swept path control (MSPC). MSPC improves the performance of previous path following control (PFC) strategies, by minimizing the maximum excursion of the vehicle, while guaranteeing acceptable path following accuracy. A linear controller is devised, combining state feedback control with an optimized preview distance. A relationship between the maximum lateral offsets of the front axle of the tractor unit and the rear axle of the last trailer and the corresponding weights in the control cost function is established, and the controller is tuned to provide the best performance compromise. Several simulations of a tractor-semitrailer case are run, and the results show that the overall swept path width is reduced by more than 40% when compared with PFC methods.

ID ENERGY MANAGEMENT; FUEL CONSUMPTION
AB Autonomous mining transportation is an intelligent traffic control system that can provide better economics than traditional transportation systems. The velocity trajectory of a manned vehicle depends on the driver's driving style. Still, it can be optimized utilizing mathematical methods under autonomous driving conditions. This paper takes fuel and electric mining vehicles with a load capacity of 50 tons as the subject. It contributes a multi-objective optimization approach considering time, energy consumption, and battery lifetime. The dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is used to solve the optimal velocity trajectory with different optimization objectives under two types of mining condition simulation. The trajectories optimized by the single objective, energy consumption, usually adopt the pulse-and-gliding (PnG) approach frequently, which causes the battery capacity loss and increases the travel time. Hence, a multi-objective optimization approach is proposed. For electric vehicles, trajectories optimized by the multi-objective approach can decrease the battery capacity loss by 22.01 % and the time consumption by 41.28 %, leading to a 42.12 % increment in energy consumption. For fuel vehicles, it can decrease the time consumption by 32.54 %, leading to a 7.68 % increment in energy consumption. This velocity trajectory is smoother with less fluctuation. It can better meet the requirements of mining transportation and has a particular reference value for optimizing autonomous transportation costs in closed areas.

AB This paper assesses the adequacy of the BPR volume delay function for the strategic modelling of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Three testbed environments are simulated at 10% increments of CAV penetration rates (CPR) to observe network performance in mixed fleet environments. The microsimulation dataset is compared with the BPR travel time predictions to evaluate the need for recalibration. Where appropriate, the BPR modelling parameters are redefined as a function of the CPR. The predictive quality of the recalibrated model is then validated by comparing it against the BPR function on synthetic data. The numerical results indicate an overall improvement in travel time prediction using the recalibrated model, with a significant reduction in root mean square error from 15.16 to 8.86. The recalibrated model also outperformed the traditional BPR model in 67% of the 4620 cases used for validation, and better-predicted travel time by 5.43 times.

AB Compared to human-operated vehicles, autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer numerous potential benefits. However, public acceptance of AVs remains low. Using 4 studies, including 1 preregistered experiment (total N = 3,937), the present research examines the role of trust in AV adoption decisions. Using the Trust-Confidence-Cooperation model as a conceptual framework, we evaluate whether perceived integrity of technology-a previously underexplored dimension of trust that refers to perceptions of the moral agency of a given technology-influences AV policy support and adoption intent. We find that perceived technology integrity predicts adoption intent for AVs and that messages that increase perceived integrity of AV technology result in greater AV adoption intent and policy support. This knowledge can be used to guide communication efforts aimed at increasing public trust in AVs, and ultimately enhance integration of AVs into transport systems.

AB This paper aims to resolve a clear and unrealistic limitation found in recent works that have proposed solutions to the massive demand for the autonomous electric mobility-on-demand (AEMoD) services. Namely, this paper will focus on the matched charge-to-trip only service by enabling sub-class service; i.e., allowing vehicles to serve customer classes with trips needing less charge. The paper proposes a multi-class management system with a new queuing model for one city zone, and then derives the stability conditions of the system. Proportions of vehicles from each class that will immediately serve customers with sub-class service or full/partial charge are modeled, and the maximum expected response time of the system is then minimized by optimizing these vehicle service decisions. The advantages of the new model are then compared with previously proposed schemes and non-optimized models through simulations.

AB This paper presents a robust output-feedback guaranteed-cost control strategy for the path following control of autonomous vehicles. First, the model of vehicle dynamics and path following is established, which takes the uncertainties of cornering stiffness into account. Then, to deal with such uncertainties and improve the transient performance, a robust guaranteed-cost controller is introduced with the regional pole constraint ability. Considering that it is expensive and difficult to measure the side slip angle accurately, the proposed controller utilises an output-feedback scheme without side slip angle information. Moreover, the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm is selected to optimise the performance index of the guaranteed-cost controller such that the priorities among different objectives can be decided reasonably. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller and its advantages over previous studies in the presence of parameter uncertainties.

AB Development of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has permitted the automatization of many tasks originally achieved with manned vehicles in underwater environments. Teams of AUVs designed to work within a common mission are opening the possibilities for new and more complex applications. In underwater environments, communication, localization, and navigation of AUVs are considered challenges due to the impossibility of relying on radio communications and global positioning systems. For a long time, acoustic systems have been the main approach for solving these challenges. However, they present their own shortcomings, which are more relevant for AUV teams. As a result, researchers have explored different alternatives. To summarize and analyze these alternatives, a review of the literature is presented in this paper. Finally, a summary of collaborative AUV teams and missions is also included, with the aim of analyzing their applicability, advantages, and limitations.

AB This paper builds on prior research into the application of particle swarm optimisation to autonomous vehicle control in search roles. It examines the use of naturally inspired search strategies to enhance the performance of groups of sensor-based vehicles in applications where there is no knowledge a priori regarding target presence, location, distribution or behaviour (movement). This paper first briefly reviews existing ethological research into search strategies in the natural world, identifying three types of random walk, two multi-phase strategies and two species-specific strategies for further investigation. Experiments are then performed within a simulation environment to compare the performance of naturally inspired strategies with deterministic patterns and random movement, when searching for both static and dynamic targets. Results indicate that performance improvements can be realised, provided that critical relationships within the application domain broadly match those existing in the underlying natural metaphor.

AB Many applications of optimization techniques, such as classification and regression problems, require long simulations to evaluate the performance of their solutions. Problems where the fitness function can be divided into smaller pieces-problem partitioning-demand techniques that approximate the overall fitness from that obtained in a small region of the problem space. This means that less time is spent evaluating individual solutions, which makes such approaches computationally efficient.
   In this work, a method is proposed to deal with a dynamically calculated fitness function; it is called Genetic Algorithm with Base Fitness (GABF). This method is built over a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize a Fuzzy Rule-Based System (FRBS). The proposed method works by partitioning training data into smaller subsets. The main idea is to assign fitness values derived from part of the training set (or a short simulation) to individuals in the current generation. This fitness value is then inherited and combined with those obtained in subsequent generations.
   To test the proposal, a scenario in which two vehicles are approaching an intersection is implemented. One vehicle is presumed to be driven by a human and does not change its speed, whereas the other implements an autonomous speed regulator based on fuzzy logic. The regulator must maneuver the autonomous vehicle in a safe and efficient manner. The objective is to optimize both the membership functions and the rule base of the fuzzy system controlling the autonomous vehicle.

AB This paper presents a novel solution for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) to autonomously search for and land on an arbitrary landing site using real-time monocular vision. The autonomous MAV is provided with only one single reference image of the landing site with an unknown size before initiating this task. We extend a well-known monocular visual SLAM algorithm that enables autonomous navigation of the MAV in unknown environments, in order to search for such landing sites. Furthermore, a multi-scale ORB feature based method is implemented and integrated into the SLAM framework for landing site detection. We use a RANSAC-based method to locate the landing site within the map of the SLAM system, taking advantage of those map points associated with the detected landing site. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented vision system in autonomous flights, both indoor and in challenging outdoor environment.

AB The development of autonomous driving has brought with it requirements for intelligence, safety, and stability. One example of this is the need to construct effective forms of interactive cognition between pedestrians and vehicles in dynamic, complex, and uncertain environments. Pedestrian action detection is a form of interactive cognition that is fundamental to the success of autonomous driving technologies. Specifically, vehicles need to detect pedestrians, recognize their limb movements, and understand the meaning of their actions before making appropriate decisions in response. In this survey, we present a detailed description of the architecture for pedestrian action recognition in autonomous driving, and compare the existing mainstream pedestrian action recognition techniques. We also introduce several commonly used datasets used in pedestrian motion recognition. Finally, we present several suggestions for future research directions.

AB We propose an integrated comprehensive system of an Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV), dedicated to ships with various degrees of autonomy. The system performs a variety of tasks aimed at safe voyage execution. The use of basic and additional information sources is envisaged, including data from unmanned remotely controlled and autonomous aerial vehicles, to increase situational awareness. After defining the assumptions and devising the architecture of the system, we built its model. The key elements of the model, collision avoidance and automatic communication modules, are capable of developing and agreeing on manoeuvres between autonomous vessels in the negotiation process. The model was implemented as a real time system and verified in three stages: labo-ratory tests, quasi-real tests using physical models of ships and in real operational conditions on board ships at sea. The research results have confirmed the correctness of the assumptions, designed system architecture and developed algorithms.

AB The development of a 'mobility as a service' model for accessing urban transport via autonomous vehicles may be expected to have far-reaching implications for the economics of road transport. In particular, it would offer a new opportunity to price access to the roads in accordance with the principles of the free market. Once people are paying for mobility on the roads on a 'per trip' basis, it will be possible to offer different levels of access - and service - at different prices. According to hegemonic ideas in the transport planning and economics literature the introduction of such a 'market in mobility' would be an economically efficient way of allocating access to the scarce good of space on the roads. In this paper we draw attention to a number of ethical and political challenges to the appropriateness of the use of such a pricing mechanism in the context of urban mobility.

AB Major steps towards implementation of autonomous and connected transport are being taken nowadays. The trend of automation technology being used in vehicles by the most important vehicle manufacturing industries is expected to move closer to high or fully Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) through technological advancements in sectors of robotics and artificial intelligence. Vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities are planning to be available on market, in full scale, in the next years. In the longer term substantial benefits are mainly expected for accessibility to transport, safety, traffic flow, emissions, fuel use and comfort. All these potential societal benefits will not be achieved unless AVs are accepted and used by a critical mass of people. Addressing these challenges, this paper: (a) proposes a technology acceptance modelling process by extending the original Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to explain and predict consumers' intensions towards AVs, (b) based on the proposed TAM-extended framework, a 30 question survey was conducted in order to investigate the factors influencing consumers' in tensions to use and accept AVs. Results show that the constructs of perceived usefulness, perceived ease to use, perceived trust and social influence, are all useful predictors of behavioral intentions to have or use AVs, with perceived usefulness having the strongest impact. The insights derived from this study could significantly contribute to ongoing research related to technology acceptance of AVs and are expected to allow automobile industries to improve their design and technology.

AB In recent decades, marine robots have become increasingly important for a wide range of applications in bodies of water, including oceans, gulfs, and lakes. One type of unmanned surface vehicle that has gained attention is the autonomous sailboat, which utilizes wind as a source of propulsion, offering advantages in terms of energy consumption and continuous operation. While autonomous sailboats face limitations in motion and constraints compared to conventional unmanned surface vehicles that use motors, sailing maneuvering techniques can provide motion capability to reach a destination. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of autonomous sailboats, including their fundamental background, dynamic models, and guidance systems. Control strategies for heading and speed controls are investigated and categorized based on their purposes and computational criteria. Finally, the potential applications of these control strategies are evaluated and compared, highlighting their importance for future research.

AB This paper describes a stochastic predictive control algorithm for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with time-joint chance constraints. We first present the algorithm as a general tool to treat finite space POMDP problems with time-joint chance constraints together with its theoretical properties. We then discuss its application to autonomous vehicle control on highways. In particular, we model decision-making/behavior-planning for an autonomous vehicle accounting for safety in a dynamic and uncertain environment as a constrained POMDP problem and solve it using the proposed algorithm. After behavior is planned, we use nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) to execute the behavior commands generated from the planner. This two-layer control framework is shown to be effective by simulations.

AB Real-time obstacle detection by monocular vision is a challenging problem in autonomous navigation of vehicles and driver-assistance systems. In this paper, we introduce an approach of real-time obstacle detection which can effectively tell apart obstacles from shadows and road surface markings. We propose the followings: (1) a two consecutive frames (TCF) model to find the differences between obstacles and the ground plane by motion features; (2) a filter to increase probabilities of obstacle regions; (3) an updating process to reduce false positives and update the algorithm when the vehicle moves on. We perform experiments on two datasets and our autonomous vehicle. The results show that our method is effective in various conditions and meets the real-time requirement.

AB This paper describes an autonomous navigation system for a large underground mining vehicle. The control architecture is based on a robust reactive wall-following behaviour. To make it purposeful we provide driving hints derived from an approximate nodal-map. For most of the time, the vehicle is driven with weak localization (odometry). This need only be improved at intersections where decisions must be made - a technique we refer to as opportunistic localization. The paper briefly reviews absolute and relative navigation strategies, and describes an implementation of a reactive navigation system on a 30 tonne Load-Haul-Dump truck. This truck has achieved full-speed autonomous operation at an artificial test mine, and subsequently, at a operational underground mine. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

ID SIMULATION; DESIGN
AB Ride-hailed shared autonomous vehicles (SAV) have emerged recently as an economically feasible way of introducing autonomous driving technologies while serving the mobility needs of under-served communities. There has also been corresponding research work on optimization of the operation of these SAVs. However, the current state-of-the-art research in this area treats very simple networks, neglecting the effect of a realistic other traffic representation, and is not useful for planning deployments of SAV service. In contrast, this paper utilizes a recent autonomous shuttle deployment site in Columbus, Ohio, as a basis for mobility studies and the optimization of SAV fleet deployment. Furthermore, this paper creates an SAV dispatcher based on reinforcement learning (RL) to minimize passenger wait time and to maximize the number of passengers served. The created taxi-dispatcher is then simulated in a realistic scenario while avoiding generalization or over-fitting to the area. It is found that an RL-aided taxi dispatcher algorithm can greatly improve the performance of a deployment of SAVs by increasing the overall number of trips completed and passengers served while decreasing the wait time for passengers.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB With ongoing technological improvements and research in the field of autonomous vehicles, it is becoming evident that the technology has the potential to substantially affect the transportation sector. Although the potential benefits with respect to productivity increases, cost decreases, and safety are evident, the potential for these vehicles to negatively or positively affect the transportation infrastructure is unclear. In this study, the influence of truck loadings positioning on the long-term performance of transportation infrastructure was estimated by carrying out performance simulations of pavement structures. Scenarios considering both full and partial use by autonomous trucks were considered. In all cases, performance was estimated with respect to rutting, fatigue cracking, and overall pavement smoothness, and the results were compiled in terms of reduced pavement thickness. It was found that if controlled appropriately, autonomous trucks could be highly beneficial for the pavement infrastructure design, and they would be most effective when they represented more than 50% of the total truck traffic. It was also found that in the absence of appropriate control, specifically by repeatedly positioning trucks in the same location, the amount of damage could be highly detrimental, and noticeable influences may occur at autonomous truck volumes as low as 10%.

However, their performance is limited by inherent imaging constraints, a standard RGB camera may perform poorly in extreme conditions, including low illumination, high contrast, bad weather (e.g. fog, rain, snow, etc.), glare, etc. Further, when using monocular cameras, it is more challenging to determine spatial distances than when using active range sensors such as LiDARs or Radars. Over the past years, novel image sensors, namely, infrared cameras, range-gated cameras, polarization cameras, and event cameras, have demonstrated strong potential. Some of them could be game-changers for future autonomous vehicles, they are the result of progress in sensor technology and the development of the accompanying perception algorithms. This paper presents in a systematic manner their principles, comparative advantages, data processing algorithms, and related applications. The purpose is to provide practitioners with an in-depth overview of novel sensing technologies that can contribute to the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems have greatly increased in popularity in the last decade. In such a system, at each tier multiple roaming vehicles transport totes between the storage locations and the lifts. However, this may lead to vehicle interference. We study in which order and by which vehicle the storage and retrieval requests should be executed to minimize the makespan, without vehicle interference. The optimal storage locations for incoming totes are also determined. A blocking mitigation protocol is proposed to address vehicle interference. We propose a two-phase matheuristic, where in the first phase, the tier is divided into zones, with each zone assigned its own vehicle. The second phase focuses on reassigning requests between adjacent vehicles to obtain improved solutions. The models proposed in both phases are solved to optimality in polynomial time and pseudo-polynomial time, respectively. Computational experiments show that the matheuristic produces high-quality solutions within a few seconds, even for large-sized instances, making it suitable for real-time decisions. Compared to methods commonly used in practice, our matheuristic can reduce the makespan by up to 15%. Our results show that making integrated decisions that combine storage assignment and request scheduling, is more beneficial than sequential optimization in terms of throughput performance, space utilization and overall system cost. We also find that increasing the number of vehicles has a diminishing return effect on the makespan. Another finding is that the system with a large number of short storage aisles leads to higher throughput capacity than that with a small number of long storage aisles.

AB This paper focus on the trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in complex ocean environments. A novel Lyapunov-based Model Predictive Control (LMPC) framework is designed for AUV, which improves the performance of trajectory tracking through online optimization. By incorporating salient features of Lyapunov-based nonlinear backstepping control, the contraction constraint is constructed to ensure the closed-loop stability. Within this framework, the actual limitation of executor saturation could be clearly considered. Next, the recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability of the LMPC-based control are rigorously proved. Also, the guaranteed region of attraction (ROA) is clearly described. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the designed LMPC trajectory tracking method.

This paper investigates the receding horizon formation tracking control problem of a fleet of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), in which the follower AUVs are required to track the leader with prescribed formation pattern, and the control inputs of the follower AUVs are subject to practical constraints. An auxiliary stabilizable control law is first designed, based on which a novel optimization problem is proposed and a new receding horizon control (RHC) algorithm is designed to generate control inputs. The theoretical feasibility conditions of the RHC-based tracking algorithm and the stability conditions of the closed-loop systems are provided. Simulation studies are conducted, and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and theoretical results.

AB In this brief, we consider the formation control problem of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) moving in a leader-follower formation, in the presence of uncertainties and ocean disturbances. A robust adaptive formation controller is developed by employing neural network and dynamic surface control technique. The stability of the design is proven via Lyapunov analysis where semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. The advantages of the proposed formation controller are that: first, the proposed method only uses the measurements of line-of-sight range and angle by local sensors, no other information about the leader is required for control implementation; second, the developed neural formation controller is able to capture the vehicle dynamics without exact information of coriolis and centripetal force, hydrodynamic damping and disturbances from the environment. Comparative analysis with a model-based approach is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The bottom-following problem for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles(AUV) was addressed by a new type of nonlinear decoupling control law. The vertical bottom-following error and pitch angle error are stabilized by means of the stern plane, and the thruster is left to stabilize the longitudinal bottom-following error and forward speed. In order to better meet the need of engineering applications, working characteristics of the actuators were sufficiently considered to design the proposed controller. Different from the traditional method, the methodology used to solve the problem is generated by AUV model without a reference orientation, and it deals explicitly with vehicle dynamics and the geometric characteristics of the desired tracking bottom curve. The estimation of systemic uncertainties and disturbances and the pitch velocity PE (persistent excitation) conditions are not required. The stability analysis is given by Lyapunov theorem. Simulation results of a full nonlinear hydrodynamic AUV model are provided to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.

ID PATH-FOLLOWING CONTROL
AB This paper addresses the control problem of inspecting underwater pipeline on the seabed, with coordinated multiple autonomous underwater vehicles in a formation. Based on the leader-follower strategy, the dedicated nonlinear path following controller is rigorously built on Lyapunov-based design, driving a fleet of vehicles onto assigned parallel paths elevated and offset from the underwater pipeline, while keeping a triangle formation to capture complete 3D images for inspection. Due to the spatial-temporal decoupling characteristics of individual path following controller, the velocities of the followers can be adapted in the coordinated control level, only relying on the information of generalized along-path length from the leader, in order to build the desired formation. Thus, the communication variable broadcast from the leader is kept to a minimum, which is feasible under the severely constraints of acoustic communication bandwidth. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of coordinated formation controller proposed for underwater pipeline inspection.

AB We introduce an adaptive sampling method that has been developed to support the Backseat Driver control architecture of the Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) Explorer autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The design is based on an acoustic detection and in-situ analysis program that allows an AUV to perform automatic detection and autonomous tracking of an oil plume. The method contains acoustic image acquisition, autonomous triggering, and thresholding in the search stage. A new biomimetic search pattern, the bumblebee flight path, was designed to maximize the spatial coverage in the oil plume detection phase. The effectiveness of the developed algorithm was validated through simulations using a two-dimensional planar plume model and a 90-degree scanning sensor model. The results demonstrate that the bumblebee search design combined with a genetic solution for the Traveling Salesperson Problem outperformed a conventional lawnmower survey, reducing the AUV travel distance by up to 75.3%. Our plume detection strategy, using acoustic sensing, provided data of plume location, distribution, and density, over a sector in contrast with traditional chemical oil sensors that only provide readings at a point.

AB This paper proposes an efficient computational framework for longitudinal velocity control of a large number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and develops a traffic flow theory for AVs. Instead of hypothesizing explicitly how AVs drive, our goal is to design future AVs as rational, utility-optimizing agents that continuously select optimal velocity over a period of planning horizon. With a large number of interacting AVs, this design problem can become computationally intractable. This paper aims to tackle such a challenge by employing mean field approximation and deriving a mean field game (MFG) as the limiting differential game with an infinite number of agents. The proposed micro-macro model allows one to define individuals on a microscopic level as utility-optimizing agents while translating rich microscopic behaviors to macroscopic models. Different from existing studies on the application of MFG to traffic flow models, the present study offers a systematic framework to apply MFG to autonomous vehicle velocity control. The MFG-based AV controller is shown to mitigate traffic jam faster than the LWR-based controller. MFG also embodies classical traffic flow models with behavioral interpretation, thereby providing a new traffic flow theory for AVs.

ID VEHICLE; FRAMEWORK
AB Highway driving invariably combines high speeds with the need to interact closely with other drivers. Prediction methods enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to anticipate drivers' future trajectories and plan accordingly. Kinematic methods for prediction have traditionally ignored the presence of other drivers, or made predictions only for a limited set of scenarios. Data-driven approaches fill this gap by learning from large datasets to predict trajectories in general scenarios. While they achieve high accuracy, they also lose the interpretability and tools for model validation enjoyed by kinematic methods. This letter proposes a novel kinematic model to describe car-following and lane change behavior, and extends it to predict trajectories in general scenarios. Experiments on highway datasets under varied sensing conditions demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB The purpose of this study is to design a supervisory two-level controller for an autonomous underwater vehicle path following problem despite the underwater uncertain operation conditions and external measurement noises. For the controller description, the surge degree of freedom dynamic model is linearized using feedback linearization technique and then a fuzzy PID tracking control law is sketched. To illustrate the robust tracking performance of the controller, the proposed control law is compared with a conventional PID controller. The results show improvement in the tracking error in the presence of noise and dynamic model parameter perturbation. The main reason behind the ability of the supervisory controller in handling the uncertainties is the auto-adjustment ability of PID gains when faced with real-time situations.

AB In this paper, the three-dimensional (3D) path tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under the action of sea currents was researched. A novel reward function was proposed to improve learning ability and a disturbance observer was developed to observe the disturbance caused by currents. Based on existing models, the dynamic and kinematic models of the AUV were established. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, a deep reinforcement learning, was employed for designing the path tracking controller. Compared with the backstepping sliding mode controller, the controller proposed in this article showed excellent performance, at least in the particular study developed in this article. The improved reward function and the disturbance observer were also found to work well with improving path tracking performance.

DE Shared autonomous vehicle; Parking; Agent-based model
AB Although recent studies of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) have explored the economic costs and environmental impacts of this technology, little is known about how SAVs can change urban forms, especially by reducing the demand for parking. This study estimates the potential impact of SAV system on urban parking demand under different system operation scenarios with the help of an agent-based simulation model. The simulation results indicate that we may be able to eliminate up to 90% of parking demand for clients who adopt the system, at a low market penetration rate of 2%. The results also suggest that different SAV operation strategies and client's preferences may lead to different spatial distribution of urban parking demand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a smooth flight path planner for maneuvering in a 3D Euclidean space, which is based on two new space curves. The first one is called "Elementary Clothoid-based 3D Curve (ECb3D)", which is built by concatenating two symmetric Clothoid-based 3D Curves (Cb3D). The combination of these curves allows to reach an arbitrary orientation in 3D Euclidean space. This new curve allows to generate continuous curvature and torsion profiles that start and finish with a null value, which means that they can be concatenated with other curves, such as straight segments, without generating discontinuities on those variables. The second curve is called "Double Continuous Curvature 3D Curve (DCC3D)" which is built as a concatenation of three straight line segments and two ECb3D curves, allowing to reach an arbitrary configuration in position and orientation in the 3D Euclidean space without discontinuities in curvature and torsion. This trajectory is applied for autonomous path planning and navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as fixed-wing aircrafts. Finally, the results are validated on the FlightGear 2018 flight simulator with the UAV kadett 2400 platform.

This system utilizes the cooperation of multiple lasers and cameras to realize several necessary functions of autonomous navigation: road curb detection, lane detection and traffic sign recognition. Multiple single scan lasers are integrated to detect the road curb based on Z-variance method. Vision based lane detection is realized by two scans method combining with image model. Haar-like feature based method is applied for traffic sign detection and SURF matching method is used for sign classification. The results of experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and the whole system.

AB The DARPA PerceptOR program has implemented a rigorous evaluative test program which fosters the development of field relevant outdoor mobile robots. Autonomous ground vehicles were deployed on diverse test courses throughout the USA and quantitatively evaluated on such factors as autonomy level, waypoint acquisition, failure rate, speed, and communications bandwidth. Our efforts over the three year program have produced new approaches in planning, perception, localization, and control which have been driven by the quest for reliable operation in challenging environments. This paper focuses on some of the most unique aspects of the systems developed by the CMU PerceptOR team, the lessons learned during the effort, and the most immediate challenges that remain to be addressed.

SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS

AB Pilots use situational awareness (SA) to make appropriate aeronautical decisions. Autonomous vehicles will not have a human pilot (or operator) in the loop when off-nominal conditions present themselves, and will rely on sensors to build SA on their environment to make sound aeronautical decisions. As their sensors degrade, it is hypothesized that a point exists where the SA those decisions are based off will be inadequate for sound aeronautical decisions. It will be shown that this point can be identified through modeling and simulation of a simple sensor network to complete a task currently reserved for qualified pilots. This research highlights the process of determining an objective measure for the subjective end and relates it to a possible safety of flight certification for an autonomous system to perform tasks currently reserved for qualified pilots.

AB The twin hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle (THAUV) is a novel type of unmanned underwater platform that consists of a twin torpedo-shaped hull and is actuated by two buoyancy engines and two thrusters proposed in this paper. The THAUV was designed to have faster speed generated by the two buoyancy engines and two thrusters. The two buoyancy engines on each hull and the airfoil are mainly responsible for the diving and surfacing motion, and the thrusters drive the THAUV along the horizontal plane. The THAUV is capable of carrying more instrumentation and energy than a conventional hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle (HAUV) with a single buoyancy engine such that the THAUV can perform more exploration tasks and operate for a longer period in a one-time operation. Different from other unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) with two airfoils or wings, the THAUV has a single airfoil connecting the twin hull such that it does not require connecting bars and additional airfoils. For this reason, the structure of THAUV is more compact and simpler. In this paper, a new compact THAUV is designed and CFD simulation is used to obtain the hydrodynamic parameters of THAUV operation in water. The motion model of the THAUV is also established and the operating parameters of the THAUV are obtained by simulation.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB This paper proposes an algorithm for path-following and collision avoidance of an autonomous vehicle based on model predictive control (MPC) using time-varying and non-uniformly spaced horizon. The MPC based on non-uniformly spaced horizon approach uses the time intervals that are small for the near future, and time intervals that are large for the distant future, to extend the length of the whole prediction horizon with a fixed number of prediction steps. This MPC has the advantage of being able to detect obstacles in advance because it can see the distant future. However, the presence of longer time interval samples may lead to poor path-following performance, especially for paths with high curvature. The proposed algorithm performs proper adjustment of the prediction interval according to a given situation. For sections with large curvature, it uses the short prediction intervals to increase the path-following performance; further, to consider obstacles over a wider range, it uses the long prediction intervals. This technique allows simultaneous improvement of the path-following performance and the range of obstacle avoidance with fixed computational complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through an open-source simulator, CARLA and real-time experiments.

AB This work proposes a novel motion guided method for targetless self-calibration of a LiDAR and camera and use the re-projection of LiDAR points onto the image reference frame for real-time depth upsampling. The calibration parameters are estimated by optimizing an objective function that penalizes distances between 2D and re-projected 3D motion vectors obtained from time-synchronized image and point cloud sequences. For upsampling, a simple, yet effective and time efficient formulation that minimizes depth gradients subject to an equality constraint involving the LiDAR measurements is proposed. Validation is performed on recorded real data from urban environments and demonstrations that our two methods are effective and suitable to mobile robotics and autonomous vehicle applications imposing real-time requirements is shown.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; BRAKING
AB Traffic conflict analysis based on Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) helps to estimate the risk level of an ego-vehicle interacting with other road users. Nonetheless, risk assessment for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is still incipient, given that most of the AVs are currently prototypes and current SSMs do not directly apply to autonomous driving styles. Therefore, to assess and quantify the potential risk arising from AV interactions with other road users, this study introduces the TTCmo (Time-to-Collision with motion orientation), a metric that considers the yaw angle of conflicting objects. In fact, the yaw angle represents the orientation of the other road users and objects detected by the AV sensors, enabling a better identification of potential risk events from changes in the motion orientation and position through the geometric analysis of the boundaries for each detected object. Using the 3D object detection data annotations available from the publicly available AV datasets nuScenes and Lyft5 and the TTCmo metric, we find that at least 8% of the interactions with objects detected around the AV present some risk level. This is meaningful, since it is possible to reduce the proportion of data analyzed by up to 60% when replacing regular TTC by our improved TTC computation.

AB This paper presents a coupled, neural network-aided longitudinal cruise and lateral path-tracking controller for an autonomous vehicle with model uncertainties and experiencing unknown external disturbances. Using a feedback error learning mechanism, an inverse vehicle dynamics learning scheme utilizing an adaptive Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, referred to as the Extended Minimal Resource Allocating Network (EMRAN) is employed. EMRAN uses an extended Kalman filter for online learning and weight updates, and also incorporates a growing/pruning strategy for maintaining a compact network for easier real-time implementation. The online learning algorithm handles the parametric uncertainties and eliminates the effect of unknown disturbances on the road. Combined with a self-regulating learning scheme for improving generalization performance, the proposed EMRAN-aided control architecture aids a basic PID cruise and Stanley path-tracking controllers in a coupled form. Its performance and robustness to various disturbances and uncertainties are compared with the conventional PID and Stanley controllers, along with a comparison with a fuzzy-based PID controller and an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme. Simulation results are presented for both slow and high speed scenarios. The root mean square (RMS) and maximum tracking errors clearly indicate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in achieving better tracking performance in autonomous vehicles under unknown environments.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly being tasked to connect to payload objects or docking stations for the purposes of package transport or recharging. However, autonomous docking creates challenges in that the air vehicle must precisely position itself with respect to the dock, oftentimes in the presence of uncertain winds and measurement errors. This paper describes an autonomous docking mechanism comprising a static ring and actuated legs, coupled with an infrared tracking device for closed-loop docking maneuvers. The dock's unique mechanical design enables precise passive positioning such that the air vehicle slides into a precise location and orientation in the dock from a wide range of entry conditions. This leads to successful docking in the presence of winds and sensor measurement errors. A closed-loop infrared tracking system is also described in which the vehicle tracks an infrared beacon located on the dock during the descent to landing. A detailed analysis is presented describing the interaction dynamics between the aircraft and the dock, and system parameters are optimized through the use of trade studies and Monte Carlo analysis with a three degree-of-freedom simulation model. Experimental results are presented demonstrating successful docking maneuvers of an autonomous air vehicle in both indoor and outdoor environments. These repeatable docking experiments verify the robustness and practical utility of the dock design for a variety of emerging applications.

   Government Finances
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID DEMAND; POLICY
AB There is some understanding that autonomous vehicles will disrupt public sector policies and the existing transportation industry, but this disruption is often loosely defined and tends to ignore how it would affect governments financially. The primary objective of this paper is to quantify the short-term impact of introducing autonomous vehicles on government finances. The analysis focuses on eight Canadian governments, encompassing four government tiers. Public discourse and academic literature are used to generate nine predicted changes (forecast variables) in future adoption scenarios. Using the predicted rate of autonomous vehicle adoption, the remaining variables are converted into financial changes by combining them with government financial records, infrastructure inventory datasets, and project cost estimates. The results suggest that, while revenue impacts are fairly minimal, and mostly impact Canadian provinces, the cost of implementing the expected vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication upgrades could be expensive for governments with smaller populations, especially municipalities. The revenue analysis indicates the biggest shift is likely to be a loss in gas tax, which affects federal and provincial revenues, yet this share is relatively small compared with the size of these governments' budgets. The expense analysis suggests that, although provinces have extensive road networks, the cost of upgrading all of their highways may not be unreasonable compared with their yearly revenue intake. On the other hand, municipalities would require substantial new funds to be able to make the same upgrades.

AB The accelerating emergence of vehicle automation and the anticipation of the advent of shared mobility through fully autonomous vehicles indicate the beginning of a new era of mobility which has the potential to reshape the future of transport in urban areas. In light of such developments, it is important that communities prepare to adapt to the changes they might entail. Therefore, in this paper, traffic flow theory, simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment, and a computer experiment using PTV Visum software were employed to study the impact of different market penetration rates of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) on a city-size traffic system. The city of Budapest during morning peak period was chosen as a case study, and a simulation model was created by incorporating SAV elements and their interrelationships into the existing traffic model of the case study city; three alternative future penetration rates were examined in relation to five key performance indicators (KPIs). The simulation results indicated that the implementation of the SAV system has a positive effect on traffic performance. Based on the relationships between the modeled SAV demand shares and the network's KPIs in the designed scenarios, the overall network performance showed improvement along with an increase in the SAV demand share.

AB Path tracking is one of the most crucial issues of autonomous vehicles, but uncertain factors including road roughness and wind gusts could cause lateral deviation and even divergence of the control system. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical anti-disturbance tracking architecture based on the steer-by-wire (SBW) system to improve tracking accuracy and dynamic stability for autonomous vehicles. The proposed architecture is robust strongly against different types of disturbances in the path tracking process by means of hierarchical decoupling. Firstly, in the upper-layer path tracking module, a robust model predictive control (MPC) method with a feedback correction term calculates the expected front-wheel steering angle. Secondly, in the lower-layer SBW module, a nonlinear high gain rack force observer is proposed to compensate for the generalized rack force disturbance. Then, an improved non-singular fast terminal sliding mode auxiliary control law based on the super-twisting algorithm is presented to attenuate the norm-bounded rack disturbance effectively. Simulation and experiment results show that the proposed control architecture can improve the path tracking accuracy and has strong interference resistance and robustness against both modeled and unmodeled disturbances.

AB Undersea terrain and resource exploration missions using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) require a great deal of time. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the state of the AUV in real time during the mission. In this paper, we propose an online health-monitoring method for AUVs using fault-tree analysis. The entire system is divided into four subsystems. Fault trees of each subsystem are designed based on the information of performance and reliability. Using the given subsystem fault trees, the health status of the entire system is evaluated by considering the performance, reliability, fault status, and weight factors of the parts. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations with various scenarios.

Considering the uncertainty the nonlinear longitudinal model, a sliding mode controller is designed. Meanwhile the neural networks (NNs) are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear function in the model. To improve the NNs learning rapidity, the prediction error which reflect the learning performance is constructed, further the updating law is designed utilizing the composite learning technique. The system stability is guaranteed through the Lyapunov approach. The simulation results verify that the designed method could force the AUV to track the target until rendezvous, and the model uncertainty is addressed better via the composite learning algorithm.

DE deep mediatization; autonomous vehicles; sociotechnical imaginaries;
   American automobility; digital technology
AB The fully autonomous vehicle (AV) promises to be both a prototypic example of deep mediatization in the built environment and the apotheosis of the mediatized automobile. Autonomy has been an elusive goal, however. Its achievement will depend on a persuasive sociotechnical imaginary (STI), along with breakthroughs in digital technology. The latter involve advanced artificial intelligence, of course, but also the transformation of the nature of media, a dynamic that goes well beyond the mere proliferation of in-car media. After exploring "media" and automotive deep mediatization, this article dwells on neglected examples of existing mobile autonomy. It then turns to STIs in general, which are visionary articulations of pioneering communities, and the American AV STI in particular. This is constructed through a close reading of recent semipopular publications that mostly promote the desirability of vehicular autonomy. The article concludes critically, with analysis of the unpersuasiveness of the current American AV STI, the vehicle in AV, and the transformation of media.

AB Adaptive control theory has ushered in a fruitful era for the research and development of intelligent ground vehicle transportation systems. Notably, owing to its intelligence of handling parametric uncertainties via online learning and adaptation, the adaptive control methodology has attracted a great deal of attention in tackling autonomous/automated vehicle control problems. In this paper, we aim to improve the existing adaptive-control-based path-following controllers from two aspects. First, a non-quadratic- Lyapunov-function-based model reference adaptive controller is synthesized to achieve enhanced L1+alpha tracking performance. Second, a C-infinity-differentiable smooth parameter projection scheme is employed for preventing the disturbance-induced control parameter drift. The stability of the redesigned path-tracking adaptive controller is analyzed. Furthermore, validations and comparative studies are conducted via hardware-in-the- loop experiments.

AB Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (AVP) is conceived as a promising solution to enhance the traffic capacity and reduce the energy consumption in the intelligent transportation system. Nevertheless, AVP without security guarantees are prone to various attacks, which probably lead to life-threatening accidents. Motivated by solving this issue, an outsourced attribute-based access control mechanism with direct revocation for AVP (RFAP) is introduced in this paper. Among them, attribute-based encryption is utilized to implement fine-grained access control during the encryption process. Furthermore, RFAP can not only realize the immediate revocation of platoon member who is about to leave the platoon without affecting others, but also achieve secure outsourced decryption with the help of edge computing units for minimizing the computational overhead of decryption on the vehicle side. Security analysis and simulation results indicate that our REAP mechanism is practical in aspects of security and efficiency.

ID 3-DIMENSIONAL OBJECT RECONSTRUCTION
AB Exploration of a complex underwater environment without an a priori map is beyond the state of the art for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite several efforts regarding simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and view planning, there is no exploration framework, tailored to underwater vehicles, that faces exploration combining mapping, active localization, and view planning in a unified way. We propose an exploration framework, based on an active SLAM strategy, that combines three main elements: a view planner, an iterative closest point algorithm (ICP)-based pose-graph SLAM algorithm, and an action selection mechanism that makes use of the joint map and state entropy reduction. To demonstrate the benefits of the active SLAM strategy, several tests were conducted with the Girona 500 AUV, both in simulation and in the real world. The article shows how the proposed framework makes it possible to plan exploratory trajectories that keep the vehicle's uncertainty bounded; thus, creating more consistent maps.

AB Fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to considerably change urban mobility in the future. This study simulates potential AV operating scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada, and assesses transportation system performance on a regional level. For each scenario, the base capacities of certain types of road links are modified to simulate the theoretical increase in throughput enabled by AV driving behavior. Another scenario examines driverless parking operations in downtown Toronto. Simulation results indicate that the increased attractiveness of freeways relative to other routes leads to slightly increased average travel distance as vehicles divert to access higher capacity road links. Average travel time is found to decrease by up to one-fifth at the 90% AV market penetration level. Concurrently, localized increases in congestion suggest that proactive transportation planning will be needed to mitigate negative consequences of AV adoption, especially in relation to induced demand for personal automobile travel.

AB This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for the stabilization of high-speed autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) considering the effect of road topography. Accounting for the road curvature and bank angle, a single-track dynamic model with roll dynamics is derived. Variable time steps are utilized for vehicle model discretization, enabling collision avoidance in the long-term without compromising the prediction accuracy in the near-term. Accordingly, safe driving constraints including the sideslip envelope, zero-moment-point and lateral safety corridor are developed to handle stability and obstacle avoidance. Taking these constraints into account, an MPC problem is formulated and solved at each step to determine the optimal steering control commands. Moreover, feedback corrections are integrated into the MPC to compensate the unmodeled dynamics and parameter uncertainties. Comparative simulations validate the capability and real-time ability of the proposed control scheme.

AB With the emergence of in-vehicle applications, providing the required computational capabilities is becoming a crucial problem. This paperproposes a framework named autonomous vehicular edge (AVE) for edge computing on the road, with the aim of increasing the computational capabilities of vehicles in a decentralized manner. By managing the idle computational resources on vehicles and using them efficiently, the proposed AVE framework can provide computation services in dynamic vehicular environments without requiring particular infrastructures to be deployed. Specifically, this paper introduces a workflow to support the autonomous organization of vehicular edges. Efficient job caching is proposed to better schedule jobs based on the information collected on neighboring vehicles, including GPS information. A scheduling algorithm based on ant colony optimization is designed to solve this job assignment problem. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of this approach over competing schemes in typical urban and highway scenarios.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive literature review with focus on the difficulties electric vehicles (EVs) face to charge the battery while on a trip, and proposes a solution without the need of an expensive change in infrastructure. The proposed method charges EVs while en route from another vehicle, which will be referred to as vehicle-to-vehicle recharging (VVR). The aim of this system is to bring an innovative way for EVs to charge their battery without getting off route on a highway. The electric vehicle can request such a service from a designated charger vehicle on demand and receive electric power wirelessly while en route. The vehicles that provide energy (charger vehicles) through wireless power transfer (WPT) only need to be semi-autonomous in order to engage/disengage during a trip. The state-of-the-art is divided into three subsections relevant to the proposed system and where most of the innovations to reduce the burden of charging EVs can be found: (1) infrastructure changes, (2) device level innovations, and (3) autonomous vehicles. The infrastructure changes highlight some of the proposed systems that aim to help EVs become a convenient solution to the public. Device level innovations covers some of the literature on technology that addresses EVs in terms of WPT. And finally, the autonomous vehicle subsection covers the importance of such technology in terms of safety and reliability, that could be implemented on the VVR system. Furthermore, modeling, analysis, and simulation is presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed system.

AB As autonomous-vehicle technologies advance, conventional taxi and car-sharing services are being combined into a shared autonomous vehicle service, and through this, it is expected that the transition to a new paradigm of shared mobility will begin. However, before the full development of technology, it is necessary to accurately identify the needs of the service's users and prepare customer-oriented design guidelines accordingly. This study is concerned with the following problems: (1) How should an autonomous taxi service be designed and field-tested if the self-driving technology is imperfect? (2) How can imperfect self-driving technology be supplemented by using service flexibility? This study implements an autonomous taxi service prototype through a Wizard of Oz method. Moreover, by conducting field tests with scenarios involving an actual taxi, this study examines customer pain points, and provides a user-experience-based design solutions for resolving them.

AB With rapid advancements in science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has found widespread applications in various fields. One notable area is autonomous driving technology, which is revolutionizing humanvehicle interactions and traffic regulations. In many countries, particularly China, autonomous driving technology is currently undergoing field tests as it reaches a mature stage of development. However, alongside technical progress, this technology presents several challenges to existing legal frameworks. Introducing autonomous vehicles on public roads necessitates adjustments to the current laws and regulations governing road traffic safety. This calls for comprehensive revisions, spanning from national legislation to local enforcement, and from independent regulations to gradual changes in laws. The existing administrative regulations need to be transformed into a comprehensive legislative system that can effectively address the future challenges posed by autonomous driving technology in China.

AB The traditional automotive homologation processes aim to ensure the safety of vehicles on public roads. Autonomous Vehicles (AV) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) are difficult to account for in these conventional processes. This research aims to map and attempt to close the gaps in the areas of testing and approval of such automated and connected vehicles. During our research into the homologation process of traditional vehicles; functional safety issues, challenges of AI in safety critical systems, along with questions of cyber security were investigated. Our process focuses on the integration of the already existing functions and prototypes into new products safely. As a key result, we managed to identify the main gaps between Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and automotive technology: the rigidity of the automotive homologation process, functional safety, AI in safety critical areas and we propose a solution.

AB The Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is an optimal control method with generalization capacity for complex nonlinear coupled systems. However, the DRL agent maintains control command saturation and response overshoot to achieve the fastest response. In this study, a reference model-based DRL control strategy termed Model-Reference Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic (MR-TD3) was proposed for controlling the pitch attitude and depth of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system. First, a reference model based on an actual AUV system was introduced to an actor-critic structure, where the input of the model was the reference target, the outputs were the smoothed reference targets, and the reference model parameters can adjust the response time and the smoothness. The input commands were limited to the saturation range. Then, the model state, the real state and the reference target were mapped to the control command through the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic (TD3) agent for training. Finally, the trained neural network was applied to the AUV system environment for pitch and depth experiments. The results demonstrated that the controller can eliminate the response overshoot and control command saturation while improving the robustness, and the method also can extend to other control platforms such as autonomous guided vehicle or unmanned aerial vehicle.

AB Positioning and navigation are critical functions of automated driving functions, which help autonomous vehicles determine their absolute and relative positions in the environment that they operate. Integrity Monitoring (IM) systems, which are intended to assess the reliability and trustworthiness of the information provided by the navigation systems, are crucial for ensuring the safety of automated driving functions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing IM frameworks for safety-critical navigation applications and expands on the state-of-the-art of the most recent development of such systems for connected automated vehicles. We mainly focus on IM methods for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). However, we also cover IM for map assisted and wireless signal augmented navigation systems, which are promising for high-performance navigation applications, such as automated driving functions.

AB Autonomous transport vehicles (ATVs) are one of the most substantial components of smart factories of Industry 4.0. They are primarily considered to transfer the goods or perform some certain navigation tasks in the factory with self driving. The recent developments on computer vision studies allow the vehicles to visually perceive the environment and the objects in the environment. There are numerous applications especially for smart traffic networks in outdoor environments but there is lack of application and databases for autonomous transport vehicles in indoor industrial environments. There exist some essential safety and direction signs in smart factories and these signs have an important place in safety issues. Therefore, the detection of these signs by ATVs is crucial. In this study, a visual dataset which includes important indoor safety signs to simulate a factory environment is created. The dataset has been used to train different fast-responding popular deep learning object detection methods: faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, SSD, and RetinaNet. These methods can be executed in real time to enhance the visual understanding of the ATV, which, in turn, helps the agent to navigate in a safe and reliable state in smart factories. The trained network models were compared in terms of accuracy on our created dataset, and YOLOv4 achieved the best performance among all the tested methods.

AB Power flow method (PFM) is firstly applied to the structural analysis of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). By finite element analysis, the numerical model of AUV is established. The propulsive force of the propeller is calculated and the dynamic responses of AUV are discussed. The characteristics of power flow distribution in AUV are studied, and the optimization of AUV shape by PFM is developed. The results show that the performances of AUV's anti-vibration are improved. The present work may lay the foundation for the propagation characteristics of structural vibration power flow under the multi-source load excitations, and also provide a novel optimization approach for AUV shape.

AB In this work a smoothly interpolating controller for autonomous vehicle steering is proposed. The paper concentrates on dealing with the parameter uncertainty which is introduced by variable speed. A further primary goal is the development of a non-linear controller in which the speed of response is dependent on the distance from the lane centre. A smoothly switching (interpolating) controller is employed where switching depends on the measured speed, and also on the deviation from course setpoint. In this way parameter variations caused by varying speed can be taken into account, and the trade-off between comfort and safety is also explicitly addressed; a higher gain is associated with larger tracking errors to ensure fast recovery from dangerous deviations (safety), while low gain is used when the tracking error is 'small' (comfort).

AB With the evolution of self-driving cars, autonomous racing series like Roborace and the Indy Autonomous Challenge are rapidly attracting growing attention. Researchers participating in these competitions hope to subsequently transfer their developed functionality to passenger vehicles, in order to improve self-driving technology for reasons of safety, and due to environmental and social benefits. The race track has the advantage of being a safe environment where challenging situations for the algorithms are permanently created. To achieve minimum lap times on the race track, it is important to gather and process information about external influences including, e.g., the position of other cars and the friction potential between the road and the tires. Furthermore, the predicted behavior of the ego-car's propulsion system is crucial for leveraging the available energy as efficiently as possible. In this paper, we therefore present an optimization-based velocity planner, mathematically formulated as a multi-parametric Sequential Quadratic Problem (mpSQP). This planner can handle a spatially and temporally varying friction coefficient, and transfer a race Energy Strategy (ES) to the road. It further handles the velocity-profile-generation task for performance and emergency trajectories in real time on the vehicle's Electronic Control Unit (ECU).

The system consists of four modules: 1) global routing; 2) behavior planner; 3) local trajectory generation; and 4) trajectory tracking. The algorithm and software of each module are detailed, including a behavior planner with unified models to handle typical scenarios in both highway and urban driving, a deterministic sampling algorithm for robust responsive trajectory generation, and a dynamics-and-delay-aware preview algorithm to achieve accurate trajectory tracking. The developed system is implemented and tested at the Mcity test facility with a full-size automated car and a dozen of challenging traffic scenarios.

AB Fronts between Arctic- and Atlantic-origin waters are characterized by strong lateral gradients in temperature and salinity. Ocean processes associated with fronts are complex with considerable space and time variability. Therefore, resolving the processes in frontal zones by observation is challenging but important for understanding the associated physical-biological interactions and their impact on the marine ecosystem. The use of autonomous robotic vehicles and in situ data-driven sampling can help improve and augment the traditional sampling practices, such as ships and profiling instruments. Here, we present the development and results of using an autonomous agent for detection and sampling of an Arctic front, integrated on board an autonomous underwater vehicle. The agent is based on a subsumption architecture implemented as behaviors in a finite-state machine. Once a front is detected, the front tracking behavior uses observations to continuously adapt the path of the vehicle to perform transects across the front interface. Following successful sea trials in the Trondheimsfjord, the front-tracking agent was deployed to perform a full-scale mission near 82 degrees N north of Svalbard, close to the sea ice edge. The agent was able to detect and track an Arctic frontal feature, performing a total of six crossings while collecting vertical profiles in the upper 90 m of the water column. Measurements yield a detailed volumetric description of the frontal feature with high resolution along the frontal zone, augmenting ship-based sampling that was run in parallel.

ID CAMERA; CALIBRATION; LIDAR; ROAD
AB With the significant advancement of sensor and communication technology and the reliable application of obstacle detection techniques and algorithms, automated driving is becoming a pivotal technology that can revolutionize the future of transportation and mobility. Sensors are fundamental to the perception of vehicle surroundings in an automated driving system, and the use and performance of multiple integrated sensors can directly determine the safety and feasibility of automated driving vehicles. Sensor calibration is the foundation block of any autonomous system and its constituent sensors and must be performed correctly before sensor fusion and obstacle detection processes may be implemented. This paper evaluates the capabilities and the technical performance of sensors which are commonly employed in autonomous vehicles, primarily focusing on a large selection of vision cameras, LiDAR sensors, and radar sensors and the various conditions in which such sensors may operate in practice. We present an overview of the three primary categories of sensor calibration and review existing open-source calibration packages for multi-sensor calibration and their compatibility with numerous commercial sensors. We also summarize the three main approaches to sensor fusion and review current state-of-the-art multi-sensor fusion techniques and algorithms for object detection in autonomous driving applications. The current paper, therefore, provides an end-to-end review of the hardware and software methods required for sensor fusion object detection. We conclude by highlighting some of the challenges in the sensor fusion field and propose possible future research directions for automated driving systems.

AB Phytoplankton communities residing in the open ocean, the largest habitat on Earth, play a key role in global primary production. Through their influence on nutrient supply to the euphotic zone, open-ocean eddies impact the magnitude of primary production and its spatial and temporal distributions. It is important to gain a deeper understanding of the microbial ecology of marine ecosystems under the influence of eddy physics with the aid of advanced technologies. In March and April 2018, we deployed autonomous underwater and surface vehicles in a cyclonic eddy in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre to investigate the variability of the microbial community in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. One long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV) carrying a third-generation Environmental Sample Processor (3G-ESP) autonomously tracked and sampled the DCM layer for four days without surfacing. The sampling LRAUV's vertical position in the DCM layer was maintained by locking onto the isotherm corresponding to the chlorophyll peak. The vehicle ran on tight circles while drifting with the eddy current. This mode of operation enabled a quasi-Lagrangian time series focused on sampling the temporal variation of the DCM population. A companion LRAUV surveyed a cylindrical volume around the sampling LRAUV to monitor spatial and temporal variation in contextual water column properties. The simultaneous sampling and mapping enabled observation of DCM microbial community in its natural frame of reference.

TI Autonomous cars: The tension between occupant experience and

AB Systems that enable high levels of vehicle-automation are now beginning to enter the commercial marketplace. Road vehicles capable of operating independently of real-time human control under an increasing set of circumstances will likely become more widely available in the near future. Such vehicles are expected to bring a variety of benefits. Two such anticipated advantages (relative to human-driver vehicle control) are said to be increased road network capacity and the freeing up of the driver-occupant's time to engage in their choice of leisurely or economically-productive (non-driving) tasks.
   In this study we investigate the implications for intersection capacity and level-of-service of providing occupants of automated (without real-time human control), autonomously-operating (without vehicle-to-X communication) cars with ride quality that is equivalent (in terms of maximum rates of longitudinal and lateral acceleration) to two types of rail systems: [urban] light rail transit and [inter-urban] high-speed rail. The literature suggests that car passengers start experiencing discomfort at lower rates of acceleration than car drivers; it is therefore plausible that occupants of an autonomously-operating vehicle may wish to instruct their vehicle to maneuver in a way that provides them greater ride comfort than if the vehicle-control algorithm simply mimicked human-driving-operation.
   On the basis of traffic microsimulation analysis, we found that restricting the dynamics of autonomous cars to the acceleration/deceleration characteristics of both rail systems leads to reductions in a signalized intersection's vehicle-processing capacity and increases in delay. The impacts were found to be larger when constraining the autonomous cars' dynamics to the more-restrictive acceleration/deceleration profile of high-speed rail. The scenarios we analyzed must be viewed as boundary conditions, because autonomous cars' dynamics were by definition never allowed to exceed the acceleration/deceleration constraints of the rail systems. Appropriate evidence regarding motorists' preferences does not exist at present; establishing these preferences is an important item for the future research agenda.
   This paper concludes with a brief discussion of research needs to advance this line of inquiry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A novel coupling strategy for automated vehicle's longitudinal dynamic

ID TRACTION CONTROL; TORQUE
AB The autonomous vehicle has been developed widely, and attracted much attention of global automotive industry. Wherein, longitudinal dynamics control is one of the most crucial issues of autonomous vehicles. The throttle-by-wire (TBW) control could implement the acceleration command through adjusting the throttle opening, thus control the driving torque of the fuel autonomous vehicle. However, an automated vehicle controlled by traditional TBW in low-friction road conditions could reach large slip ratio region, which could adversely cause the loss of vehicle longitudinal dynamic stability. To tackle the mentioned issues, this paper proposes an adaptive sliding-mode control (SMC) algorithm to optimize tire slip speed of the automated vehicle. When the intervention conditions of active acceleration are satisfied, the TBW can take over the throttle opening control instead of the driver. Firstly, the SMC can calculate an intervention of the effective torque input based on tire torque balance dynamics. Moreover, a traction control system (TCS) and TBW coupling strategy based on the logic threshold method is put forward to response the optimum slip speed curve. Thus, during the vehicle starting process, a three-layer control strategy consisting of TBW, torque control, and pressure control of TCS is involved. Finally, real-car snow and ice road tests are carried out, and experimental results demonstrate great performance of the proposed strategy in complicated low-friction road.

AB In this work, we address the modeling and control problems in the domain of underwater vehicles. We focus on a prototype of an autonomous underwater vehicle. Although the work presented here is applied to a particular vehicle with four controllable degrees of freedom, the method may be easily extended to several submerged bodies. In the engineering area, modeling of systems is done frequently, as it yields a mathematical translation of their behavior. Since models can become, an important tool to solve problems related to its motion or even to the design of controllers, we obtain a model with six degrees of freedom for such a vehicle.
   Robust control of underwater vehicles is an area in which many efforts were applied over the last two decades. However, due to nonlinear dynamics, it may be hard to design robust controllers that yield the expected behavior, and there is no general procedure to develop them. Here, we propose an approach that combines nonlinear controllers based on the deduced model and on the Lyapunov theory to control the velocities of the vehicle with linear controllers that control the vehicle's position. We derive control laws to perform several maneuvers, both in the vertical and the horizontal planes, in a decoupled way, which is made possible through the configuration of thrusters. Finally, we present realistic simulations and experimental results that validate the proposed approach in the definition of the control laws.

AB On-the-fly automatic target recognition (ATR) is a challenge for small autonomous vehicles performing remote sensing. Advances in deep learning have made object detection practicable on data from a variety of sensor types, and neural network-based object detector models trained on big data sets of natural images are commonly adapted to the remote sensor (RS) domain via transfer learning. However, constraints of small vehicle hardware, such as computational performance and battery power, limit capacity for running deep learning models onboard. Standard pretrained object detection models, such as YOLO and R-CNN, contain large convolutional neural networks requiring tens to hundreds of billions of floating-point operations to distinguish between many natural image object classes. Such large models may be overly complex for ATR tasks in RS data. This letter describes an efficient deep learning model, MiNet, developed to detect mine-like objects in sonar data. It was built in Keras and TensorFlow and trained entirely on real and synthetically generated sonar data using an incremental training procedure. MiNet was successfully deployed onboard small OceanServer Iver3 autonomous underwater vehicles during the REBOOT sea trial and predicted the latitude, longitude, and class of objects detected in sonar images within minutes of the completion of each mission leg.

AB Vision-based sensors are widely used in lateral control of autonomous vehicles, but the large computational cost of the visual algorithms often induces uneven time delays. In this paper, a hierarchical vision-based lateral control scheme is proposed, where the upper controller is designed by robust H-infinity-based linear quadratic regulator (LQR) algorithm to compensate sensor-induced delays, and the lower controller is based on logic threshold method, in order to achieve strong convergence of the steering angle. Firstly, the vehicle lateral model is built, and the nonlinear uncertainties induced by time delays are linearized with Taylor expansion. Secondly, the state space of the system is augmented to describe such uncertainties with polytopic inclusions, which is controlled by an H-infinity-based LQR controller with a low cost of online computation. Then, a lower controller is designed for the control of the steering motor. According to the results of the vehicle experiment as well as the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiment, the proposed control scheme shows good performance in vehicle's lateral control task, and exhibits better robustness compared with a conventional LQR controller. The proposed control scheme provides a feasible solution for the lateral control of autonomous driving.

AB This article proposes an efficient quantum train engine (EQuaTE), a novel development tool for quantum neural network (QNN) autonomous driving software, which plots gradient variances to confirm whether the QNN falls into local minima situations (called barren plateaus). Based on this runtime visualization, the stability and feasibility of QNN-based software can be tested during runtime operations of autonomous driving functionalities. This software testing of a QNN via dynamic analysis is essentially required due to undetermined probabilistic qubit states during runtime operations. Furthermore, an EQuaTE is capable of visual feedback because the barren plateaus can be identified at local autonomous driving platforms, and the corresponding information will be visualized at remotely connected cloud. Based on this visualized information at the cloud, the QNN, which is also stored at cloud, should be automatically reorganized and retrained for eliminating barren plateaus. Then, the trained parameters can be downloaded into the QNN of autonomous driving platforms.

AB This paper proposes a novel practical path planning framework for autonomous parking in cluttered environments with narrow passages. The proposed global path planning method is based on an improved Fast Marching algorithm to generate a path while considering the moving forward and backward maneuver. In addition, the Support Vector Machine is utilized to provide the maximum clearance from obstacles considering the vehicle dynamics to provide a safe and feasible path. The algorithm considers the most critical points in the map and the complexity of the algorithm is not affected by the shape of the obstacles. We also propose an autonomous parking scheme for different parking situation. The method is implemented on autonomous vehicle platform and validated in the real environment with narrow passages.

AB Steering control for autonomous vehicles at high speeds is challenging due to the highly nonlinear vehicle dynamics. The traditional model-based controllers usually degrade significantly in this case. With the development of artificial intelligence, learning-based control methods are emerging as promising alternatives. These methods require a tremendous amount of training data to achieve acceptable performances. However, the data collection process is costly or inefficient. To solve this problem, we propose a parallel learning-based steering control method. Specifically, we first build a neural network (NN) based trajectory generative model (GeneratingNN) based on limited steering-trajectory raw data. The GeneratingNN can efficiently generate sufficient steering-trajectory data by enumerating the allowable steering actions sequences. Then, based on the raw data and generated data, we train another NN (RecallingNN) to learn the inverse mapping relationship between steering actions and trajectories. Hence, the RecallingNN can efficiently recall appropriate steering actions once given the previewed trajectory points. In addition, to further enhance the control accuracy and robustness, we use a simple feedback controller to handle the unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. Testing results validate that the proposed method can achieve better tracking accuracy, stability and computational efficiency.

AB This paper addresses the trajectory tracking control of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles subject to immeasurable velocities and parameter uncertainties. An adaptive control scheme is proposed based on backstepping method, neural network and low-frequency techniques. In addition, the overall signals of closed-loop system are ensured uniformly ultimate boundness based on Lyapunov stability theory. The advantages are highlighted as follows: (i) To avoid explosion of complexity of conventional backstepping method, the derivations of virtual control signals are obtained through second-order tracking differentiator. (ii) The proposed controller does not require any previous knowledge about hydrodynamic damping and external disturbances, which is easily applied into practice. (iii) To solve the problem of immeasurable velocities, the controller does not acquire velocity signals by employing high-gain observer. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify strong robustness and tracking effectiveness of proposed control scheme

AB This paper presents a robust fuzzy control approach for the lateral path-following of autonomous road vehicles (ARVs). The dynamics of the ARV is estimated online thorough a new non-singleton fuzzy system based on the non-stationary fuzzy sets. The asymptotic stability of the proposed method is ensured, and the adaptation laws for the proposed fuzzy system are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. The robustness of the proposed control method is verified for a vehicle system performing a double-lane-change maneuver at different forward speeds subjected to structured and unmodeled uncertainties and different disturbances. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is further investigated under different measurement noise levels. Based on the obtained results, it is concluded that the proposed control strategy can be effectively applied to the path-following task of ARVs under a wide range of operating conditions and external disturbances.

AB In this article we summarise some previously described proposals for ethical governance of autonomous vehicles ('smart cars'), critique them, and offer an alternative solution. Rather than programming cars to react to crash situations in the same way as humans, having humans program pre-set responses for a wide range of different potential scenarios, or applying particular ethical theories, we suggest that decisions should be made jointly between humans and cars. Given that humans lack the requisite processing capacity, and computers lack the necessary ethical capacity, the medical paradigm of advance care planning can be retooled for this new context. Advance car-crash planning provides a way to combine humans' ethical preferences with the advanced data processing capacities of computers to enable shared decision making in collision situations.

AB Understanding pedestrian proxemic utility and trust will help autonomous vehicles to plan and control interactions with pedestrians more safely and efficiently. When pedestrians cross the road in front of human-driven vehicles, the two agents use knowledge of each other's preferences to negotiate and to determine who will yield to the other. Autonomous vehicles will require similar understandings, but previous work has shown a need for them to be provided in the form of continuous proxemic utility functions, which are not available from previous proxemics studies based on Hall's discrete zones. To fill this gap, a new Bayesian method to infer continuous pedestrian proxemic utility functions is proposed, and related to a new definition of 'physical trust requirement' (PTR) for road-crossing scenarios. The method is validated on simulation data then its parameters are inferred empirically from two public datasets. Results show that pedestrian proxemic utility is best described by a hyperbolic function, and that trust by the pedestrian is required in a discrete 'trust zone' which emerges naturally from simple physics. The PTR concept is then shown to be capable of generating and explaining the empirically observed zone sizes of Hall's discrete theory of proxemics.

AB The technical maturity of autonomous driving enables the discussion of beneficial use cases to leverage its full potential. In this paper, we target one such use case: Platooning is the efficient convoying of vehicles by making use of self-driving capabilities and inter-vehicle communication. Many advantages arise from grouping vehicles in platoons with a small inter-vehicle distance, such as energy savings, congestion reduction, and safety improvements. However, due to the diversity of involved stakeholders, numerous objectives have to be balanced to leverage the full potential of platooning. Furthermore, these objectives also depend on various factors that influence their optimization. The vast majority of existent literature only targets a subset of related objectives and underlying factors. This paper provides an overview which categorizes objectives and influencing factors. Additionally, metrics for the evaluation of objective attainment are proposed.

AB This paper investigates the fixed-time trajectory tracking control problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to external disturbances. The backstepping control technique and fixed -time control method are integrated to guarantee that the trajectory of the AUV converges to the reference trajectory within a fixed-time. A continuous fixed-time disturbance observer is developed to estimate the unknown external disturbances. A nonlinear first-order filter is applied to avoid the adverse effect of "explosion of complexity"inherent in the conventional backstepping. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that under the fixed-time backstepping controller, the tracking errors of the AUV will converge towards a residual set in fixed time. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control method.

AB Long-tail effect, characterized by highly frequent occurrence of normal scenarios and the scarce appearance of extreme "long-tail" scenarios, ubiquitously exists in the vision-related problems in the real-world applications. Though many computer vision methods to date have already achieved feasible performance for most of the normal scenarios, it is still challenging for existing vision systems to accurately perceive the long-tail scenarios. This deficiency largely hinders the practical application of computer vision systems, since long-tail problems may incur fatal consequences, such as traffic accidents, taking the vision systems of autonomous vehicles as an example. In this paper, we firstly propose a theoretical framework named Long-tail Regularization (LoTR), for analyzing and tackling the long-tail problems in the vision perception of autonomous driving. LoTR is able to regularize the scarcely occurred long-tail scenarios to be frequently encountered. Then we present a Parallel Vision Actualization System (PVAS), which consists of closed-loop optimization and virtual-real interaction, to search for challenging long-tail scenarios and produce large-scale long-tail driving scenarios for autonomous vehicles. In addition, we introduce how to perform PVAS in Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge of China (IVFC), the most durable autonomous driving competition around the world. Results over the past decade demonstrate that PVAS can effectively guide the collection of long-tail data to diminish the cost in the real world, and thus promote the capability of vision systems to adapt to complex environments, alleviating the impact of long-tail effect.

AB A new formation framework of large-scale intelligent autonomous vehicles is developed, which can realize complex formations while reducing data exchange. Using the proposed hierarchy formation method and the automatic dividing algorithm, vehicles are automatically divided into leaders and followers by exchanging information via wireless network at initial time. Then, leaders form formation geometric shape by global formation information and followers track their own virtual leaders to form line formation by local information. The formation control laws of leaders and followers are designed based on consensus algorithms. Moreover, collision-avoiding problems are considered and solved using artificial potential functions. Finally, a simulation example that consists of 25 vehicles shows the effectiveness of theory.

TI Factors That Influence Older Canadians' Preferences for using Autonomous

AB Accessible and safe mobility is critical for those aged 65 years and older to maintain their health, quality of life, and well-being. Being able to move beyond one's home and participate in activities in older adulthood requires consideration of both transportation needs and preferences. This paper aims to address a gap in evidence with respect to understanding factors that can affect older adults' perceptions and willingness to use autonomous vehicles. In addition, it examines how these factors compare with those of younger adults to better understand the potential implications of this technology on mobility and quality of life. Using responses of those aged 65+ to a national survey of Canadians, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to identify and quantify factors significantly associated with older adults' willingness to use autonomous vehicles. The SEM results suggest that factors such as using other modes of transit (e.g., sharing rides as passenger, bicycle, public transit, commuter rail, ride and car sharing) as well as distance traveled by automobile, income, gender (being male), and living in urban areas, were all positively associated with older adults' perceptions of using autonomous driving features. The findings also suggest that older Canadians are more concerned about autonomous vehicles than younger Canadians. This study provides valuable insights into factors that can affect the preferences of Canadians when it comes to autonomous technology in their automobiles. Such results can inform the way in which transportation systems are designed to ensure the needs of users are considered across both age and ability.

AB An autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) in rough terrain typically experiences uncertain environment. Because the uncertainty makes overall performance of autonomous navigation degrade, the AGV requires a suitable path to maintain or improve the performance against the uncertainty. In order to handle this problem, this study proposes a model predictive path planning algorithm by employing a passivity-based model predictive control (MPC) optimization setup. The model predictive path planning method is formulated as a finite optimization problem with an objective function and several constraints. In the cost function, environment perception result about the AGV's own neighborhood is included and the only traversable region has low cost value. To reflect dynamic characteristics of the AGV, the proposed method utilizes dynamic and kinematic models of the AGV as equality constraints and limited range of states and control input as inequality constraints. In addition, the stability of the path planning method is improved by a passivity constraint. The solution of the optimization problem is obtained using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Finally, field tests are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and satisfactory results of the autonomous navigation were obtained.

AB This article presents a non-optimization-based framework for path planning and tracking for evasive maneuvers in autonomous cars. The framework exploits a two-layer approach where a path planner generates a reference trajectory that is then tracked by a path-tracking controller. A nested curvature preview controller (CPC) implements path tracking. In this article, we show how to describe the closed-loop performance of the controller. The quantification of the closed-loop performance in the frequency domain guides the generation of the evasive path. In this way, the algorithm generates a path that avoids the obstacle (if possible) accounting for both static and dynamic constraints. The proposed framework, thus, provides a non-optimization-based way to integrate the characteristics of the path tracker in the path-planner algorithm, thus avoiding the need to define cost functions and use the third-party optimizers. This article validates the proposed evasive maneuver strategy in simulation and on an instrumented vehicle. First, we test the trajectory tracker, showing that it tracks aggressive trajectories (with a lateral acceleration close to 1 g) with an error smaller than 30 cm. Subsequently, we integrate the curvature preview with the path generator and show the joint generation-tracking performance in two different scenarios.

AB In this manuscript, an efficient hybrid trajectory tracking control scheme has been proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of structured and unstructured uncertainties. To cope with these uncertainties, the model-dependent control scheme is successfully combined with the model-free control scheme. Due to the effects of the uncertainties, the full knowledge of the dynamic model of the vehicle cannot be accurately obtained in real applications. Therefore whatever the partial information is available about the dynamics of the system has been utilized in the controller design. A radial basis function neural network is utilized for the approximation of the unknown dynamics without requiring offline learning. To compensate for the unknown effects like the external disturbances and the reconstruction error of the neural network, an adaptive compensator is also added to the part of the controller. For the stability analysis, the online learning of the parameters and the neural network weights are used in the Lyapunov approach. Based on the Lyapunov stability criteria and Barbalat lemma, the tracking errors converge to zero asymptotically. Finally, comparative numerical simulations are performed over a four-degree of freedom autonomous underwater vehicle and efficiency and applicability of the proposed control framework is validated in a comparative manner with the existing controllers.

   This paper contains a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the- art machine vision algorithms used to build a pipeline towards assisted driving and fully autonomous vehicle development. Key and novel concepts such as distributed systems and parallelization are explored to enhance said systems' functionality.
   Autonomous vehicles are increasingly becoming a necessary trend towards building the smart cities of the future. Numerous proposals have been presented in recent years to tackle particular aspects of the working pipeline towards creating a functional end-to-end system, such as object detection, tracking, path planning, sentiment or intent detection, amongst others. Nevertheless, few efforts have been made to systematically compile all of these systems into a single proposal that also considers the real challenges these systems will have on the road, such as real-time computation, hardware capabilities, etc. This paper reviews the latest techniques towards creating our own end-to-end autonomous vehicle system, considering the state-of-the-art methods on object detection, and the possible incorporation of distributed systems and parallelization to deploy these methods. Our findings show that while techniques such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and long short-term memory can effectively handle the initial detection and path planning tasks, more efforts are required to implement cloud computing to reduce the computational time that these methods demand. Additionally, we have mapped different strategies to handle the parallelization task, both within and between the networks.

AB The United States Navy plans on fielding autonomous surface vessels in the near future. This paper presents a preliminary approach for certifying an autonomous surface vessel to complete a transoceanic voyage. In particular, this paper will decompose the rules currently outlined by the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea for avoiding a collision when two vessels are in sight of one another in international waters. These requirements are the basis for a specification that we examined to ensure it meets the requirements of the convention. We developed a protocol based on the analyzed specification that will ensure what the vehicle will function appropriately while operating autonomously. We then test this protocol using real-world scenarios currently used to certify human operators. Finally, we showed that if the protocol had been in place during a fatal mishap within the naval surface warfare community the collision would have been avoided. This paper describes how this protocol can be used as evidence for certifying an autonomous controller to complete a task reserved for a fully qualified ship's Commanding Officer in the United States Navy.

AB A major challenge concerning a mixed traffic flow system, composed of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), is how to improve overall efficiency and safety by assigning appropriate control strategies to CAVs. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to address this challenge. It enables the joint training of multiple CAVs by fusing CAV sensing information and does not need compliance of HDVs. However, the fusion of CAV sensing information is non-trivial. Traditional DRL models usually fail to take advantage of connectivity among CAVs and time series characteristics of vehicle sensing information, leading to insufficient awareness of the traffic environment. Aimed at tackling these issues, this study proposes a DRL framework named spatiotemporal deep Q network (STDQN), by integrating a double deep Q network (DDQN) and a spatiotemporal information extraction module. A long-short term memory neural network with an attention mechanism (AttenLSTMNN) is leveraged to extract temporal dependencies from vehicle perceptive information. In addition, a graph convolution network (GCN) is employed to model the spatial correlations among vehicles in a local range, as well as the connectivity of multiple CAVs in a global range. Simulation experiments are conducted in an onramp merging scenario, which is one of the most important and commonly seen scenarios in highway or city expressway systems. Experimental results prove that as compared to baseline DRL and rule-based methods, the proposed STDQN can improve the overall traffic efficiency, safety, and driving comfort. The proposed framework is promised to be deployed into real CAVs, to realize cooperative, safe, and efficient autonomous driving.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Food security is one of the societal challenge topics. As one-third of all food consumed by humans relies on animal pollination currently, this research provides an emerging solution to food supply reduction caused by population shrinking of natural pollinators, so as to reduce its impact on ecological relationships, ecosystem conservation and stability, genetic variation in the crop plant community, floral diversity, specialisation and evolution. This paper develops a conceptual technical roadmap of autonomous pollination for future farming using robotic micro air vehicle pollinators (MPrs). The research provides new insights into autonomous design and manufacture and into possible ways to increase the production efficiency which shortens the time from lab to market. The autonomous MPrs are realized using artificial intelligence and human expertise in the loop for smart agricultural industry. Further, this work identifies scientific and technological advances that are expected to translate, within proposed regulatory frameworks, into the pervasive use of MPrs for agricultural applications and beyond.

AB The Kiva warehouse-management system creates a new paradigm for pick-pack-and-ship warehouses that significantly improves worker productivity. The Kiva system uses movable storage shelves that can be lifted by small, autonomous robots. By bringing the product to the worker, productivity is increased by a factor of two or more, while simultaneously improving accountability and flexibility. A Kiva installation for a large distribution center may require 500 or more vehicles. As such, the Kiva system represents the first commercially available, large-scale autonomous robot system. The first permanent installation of a Kiva system was deployed in the summer of 2006.

AB Background: Motion sickness is common within most forms of transport; it affects most of the population who experience varied symptoms at some stage in their lives. Thus far, there has been no specific method to quantify the predicted levels of motion sickness for a given vehicle design, task and route. Objective: To develop a motion sickness virtual prediction tool that includes the following inputs: human motion, vision, vehicle motion, occupant task and vehicle design. Method: A time domain analysis using a multi-body systems approach has been developed to provide the raw data for post-processing of vehicle motion, occupant motion and vision, based on a virtual route designed to provoke motion sickness, while the digital occupant undertakes a specific non-driving related task. Results: Predicted motion sickness levels are shared for a simple positional sweep of a vehicle cabin due to a prescribed motion and task. Two additional examples are shared within this study; first, it was found that the model can predict the difference found between sitting forwards and backwards in an autonomous vehicle. Second, analysis of a respected and independent study into auxiliary display height shows that the model can predict both relative and absolute levels between the two display heights congruent to the original physical experiment. Conclusion: It has been shown that the tool has been successful in predicting motion sickness in autonomous vehicles and is therefore of great use in guiding new future mobility solutions in the ability to tune vehicle dynamics and control alongside vision and design attributes.

AB Recently, connected vehicles (CV) are becoming a promising research area leading to the concept of CV as a Service (CVaaS). With the increase of connected vehicles and an exponential growth in the field of online cab booking services, new requirements such as secure, seamless and robust information exchange among vehicles of vehicular networks are emerging. In this context, the original concept of vehicular networks is being transformed into a new concept known as connected and autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicular use yields a better experience and helps in reducing congestion by allowing current information to be obtained by the vehicles instantly. However, malicious users in the internet of vehicles may mislead the whole communication where intruders may compromise smart devices with the purpose of executing a malicious ploy. In order to prevent these issues, a blockchain technique is considered the best technique that provides secrecy and protection to the control system in real time conditions. In this paper, the issue of security in smart sensors of connected vehicles that can be compromised by expert intruders is addressed by proposing a blockchain framework. This study has further identified and validated the proposed mechanism based on various security criteria, such as fake requests of the user, compromise of smart devices, probabilistic authentication scenarios and alteration in stored user's ratings. The results have been analyzed against some existing approach and validated with improved simulated results that offer 79% success rate over the above-mentioned issues.

AB A major uncertainty in the diffusion of autonomous vehicles is the split between ownership and automated mobility services. We calculate total cost of ownership and use (TCOU) to compare four alternatives: private manually driven vehicles, private automated vehicles, automated on demand exclusive use mobility services (ridesourcing) and automated on-demand pooled mobility services (ridesplitting), for both conventional and electric propulsions. We also included potential usefulness of travel time in the driverless vehicles in the TCOU calculations, thus including some of the non-financial factors in travel decision making. While nearly all current studies are limited to comparing average representative trips or mileage of existing vehicles, we calculate TCOUs for every vehicle in the UK National Travel Survey dataset, considering heterogeneity in mileage patterns, trip purposes, time spent driving, value of time, vehicle age, depreciation and other factors between different vehicles. The results suggest that a near-total transition to automated ride services is highly unlikely, since ownership of (automated or manually driven) vehicles continues to be the least-cost option in most cases. Even in the most pro-mobility service test case, ownership remains more cost-effective for one third of the current vehicle fleet. Regression analysis shows that higher income of the main driver, business use of the vehicle, rural location of the household or being the main household vehicle leads to a higher likelihood that automated vehicle ownership will be lower cost compared to automated mobility services. Within automated on-demand ride services, exclusive use services are cost effective for more cases compared to pooled, shared-use type options, with uncertain consequences for future travel demand.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL
AB Intelligent vehicle-following control presents a great challenge in autonomous driving. In vehicle-intensive roads of city environments, frequent starting and stopping of vehicles is one of the important cause of front-end collision accidents. Therefore, this paper proposes a subsection proximal policy optimization method (Subsection-PPO), which divides the vehicle-following process into the start-stop and steady stages and provides control at different stages with two different actor networks. It improves security in the vehicle-following control using the proximal policy optimization algorithm. To improve the training efficiency and reduce the variance of advantage function, the weighted importance sampling method is employed instead of the importance sampling method to estimate the data distribution. Finally, based on the TORCS simulation engine, the advantages and robustness of the method in vehicle-following control is verified. The results show that compared with other deep learning learning, the Subsection-PPO algorithm has better algorithm efficiency and higher safety than PPO and DDPG in vehicle-following control.

AB With the advancements in 5G network and mobile edge computing technology, autonomous vehicle technology has gained new development opportunities. Multitarget tracking becomes the research hotspots in autonomous vehicles. Since many factors such as motion blur, partial occlusion, and illumination changes affect the performance of target tracking, the problem of target tracking is still an open topic. In this article, inspired by the strong discriminative ability of dictionary learning, the discriminative dictionary learning with embedded auto-encoder (DDLEA) algorithm is developed for the multitarget tracking system. The DDLEA algorithm integrates the auto-encoder into the dictionary learning framework and learns sparse representations while preserving the local structure and discriminative information of data. The learned dictionary model has the strong recognition ability. Further, a multitarget tracking system is developed based on the proposed DDLEA algorithm and the hierarchical data association scheme. Based on the target confidence in the STKSVD model, the hierarchical data association method first uses the Hungarian algorithm to complete the preliminary matching of high confidence targets, and then further tracks the low confidence targets to improve the tracking ability. Experiments are carried out the public MOT 2015 dataset. Compared with several popular multitarget tracking algorithms, the tracking performance of our system is satisfactory.

AB Since the development of the first autonomous underwater vehicles, the demanded tasks for subsea operations have become more and more challenging as, for instance, intervention, maintenance and repair of seabed installations, in addition to surveys. As a result, the development of autonomous underwater reconfigurable vehicles (AURVs) with the capability of interacting with the surrounding environment and autonomously changing the configuration, according to the task at hand, can represent a real breakthrough in underwater system technologies. Driven by these considerations, an innovative AURV has been designed by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Florence (named as UNIFI DIEF AURV), capable of efficiently reconfiguring its shape according to the task at hand. In particular, the UNIFI DIEF AURV has been provided with two extreme configurations: a slender ("survey") configuration for long navigation tasks, and a stocky ("hovering") configuration designed for challenging goals as intervention operations. In order to observe the several dynamic features for the two different configurations, a novel formulation for the dynamic maneuverability analysis (DMA) of an AURV, adapting Yoshikawa's well-known manipulability theory for robotic arms, is proposed in this work. More specifically, we introduce a novel analysis which relates the vehicle body-fixed accelerations with the rotational speed of each thruster, taking into account also the AURV dynamic model for each configuration and the propulsion system.

AB Multi-object tracking is a crucial problem for autonomous vehicle. Most state-of-the-art approaches adopt the tracking-by-detection strategy, which is a two-step procedure consisting of the detection module and the tracking module. In this paper, we improve both steps. We improve the detection module by incorporating the temporal information, which is beneficial for detecting small objects. For the tracking module, we propose a novel compressed deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature based Correlation Filter tracker. By carefully integrating these two modules, the proposed multi-object tracking approach has the ability of re-identification (ReID) once the tracked object gets lost. Extensive experiments were performed on the KITTI and MOT2015 tracking benchmarks. Results indicate that our approach outperforms most state-of-the-art tracking approaches.

AB This paper presents an autonomous driving test held in Parma on urban roads and freeways open to regular traffic. During this test, the vehicle not only performed simple maneuvers, but it had to cope with complex driving scenarios as well, including roundabouts, junctions, pedestrian crossings, freeway junctions, and traffic lights. The test demonstrated the ability of the current technology to manage real situations and not only the well-structured and predictable ones. A comparison of milestones, challenges, and key results in autonomous driving is presented to highlight the novelty and the specific purpose of the test. The whole system is described: the vehicle; the software architecture; details about high-, medium-, and low-level control; and details about perception algorithms. A conclusion highlights the achieved results and draws possible directions for future development.

AB The development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) improves the cooperation efficiency of the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon. However, the failure of the network communication occurs occasionally in the realistic environment, where the ideal fixed information flow topology (FIFT) cannot be adapted. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic information flow topology (DIFT) utilizing a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm for CAV platoons. When the communication link is broken, the platoon control system will switch to the corresponding collaborative control mode instead of the degeneration to adaptive cruise control (ACC). First, the duty-vehicle dynamic model is constructed. In addition, the constraints with vehicle physical limitations and rear-end collision are considered. The acceleration information of the pedal actuator from the leading vehicle and the states of the predecessor including position, velocity and acceleration are transmitted to the following vehicle with a switch Indicator under DIFT. The cost function with the consideration of DIFT and fuel consumption is formulated for the optimization problem. Comparing with the FIFT, the proposed method is evaluated in the co-simulation of Matlab-TruckSim. The results demonstrate that the proposed DIFT strategy shows the satisfactory performance of the platoon under the communication issues by measuring inter-vehicle space, position and velocity tracking, and acceleration change with high tracking accuracy of position within 1.2 m and velocity within 0.04 m/s.

AB This paper proposes G-VIDO, a vehicle dynamics, and intermittent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-aided visual-inertial state estimator, to address the state estimation problem of autonomous vehicle localization (i.e., position and orientation estimation in the global coordinate system) under various GNSS states. A dynamics pre-integration theory is proposed on the basis of a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle dynamics model, and dynamics constraints are built in the optimization back-end, considering the unobservable problem of the monocular visual-inertial system under degenerate motions. The proposed highly nonlinear system can be robustly initialized by loosely aligning the monocular structure from motion (SfM) results, pre-integrated IMU measurements, and vehicle motion information. GNSS is used for reference frame transformation and constraint construction in the sliding window. The cumulative error can be corrected with the aid of GNSS, and the vehicle's position in the global coordinate system can be determined. A GNSS anomaly detection algorithm is proposed to improve the system robustness under intermittent GNSS. Experiments have shown that G-VIDO can provide real-time, robust, and seamless localization in multiple GNSS states, with an RMSE of less than 30 cm (with GNSS). Moreover, we proved that the initialization and local odometry modules in G-VIDO outperform several state-of-the-art VIO systems and our preliminary work VINS-Vehicle.

AB Do citizens, media and policymakers share the same view on autonomous cars? In the present paper, we analyse data from media articles, a Eurobarometer survey, and policy documents, to understand the perspective of different stakeholders when it comes to autonomous cars. We find significant differences between the groups, with a predominance of negative sentiments in news articles and a majority of citizens being wary of autonomous cars, while the political narrative mostly carries a positive tone. The findings highlight a dichotomous perspective about this potentially disruptive technology. This may represent a problem as the benefits of adopting autonomous cars will only come to surface if all actors are engaged and see the advantages they can bring to people's daily lives. We conclude by encouraging policymakers to promote initiatives to engage citizens in the transformation of road transport and other stakeholders to be advertised the positive implications of autonomous vehicles.

AB Route planning for autonomous driving is a global road planning method based on a given starting point and target point combined with current traffic flow information. The optimal global route can reduce traffic jams and improve the safety and economy of autonomous vehicles. The current optimization method of route planning for autonomous driving only considers a single objective or a chain of single objectives, which cannot meet the requirements of drivers. In this paper, we devise a general framework for the route planning method based on multi-objective optimization. Different from planning optimization based on not only traffic information, the framework considers travel time, distance, cost and personal preference, but focuses more on vehicle status and driver requirements. We use an improved depth-first search algorithm to find the optimal route. The evaluations of our method on real-world traffic data indicate the feasibility and applicability of the framework. Our study contributes to a better understanding of route planning and reveals that exploitation of personal preference can more flexibly configure the corresponding route according to the driver's requirements.

AB Accurate and efficient environmental awareness is a fundamental capability of autonomous driving technology and the real-time data collected by sensors offer autonomous vehicles an intuitive impression of their environment. Unfortunately, the ambient noise caused by varying weather conditions immediately affects the ability of autonomous vehicles to accurately understand their environment and its expected impact. In recent years, researchers have improved the environmental perception capabilities of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), object detection and tracking, semantic segmentation and panoptic segmentation, but relatively few studies have focused on enhancing environmental perception capabilities in adverse weather conditions, such as rain, snow and fog. To enhance the environmental perception of autonomous vehicles in adverse weather, we developed a dynamic filtering method called Dynamic Distance-Intensity Outlier Removal (DDIOR), which integrates the distance and intensity of points based on the systematic and accurate analysis of LiDAR point cloud data characteristics in snowy weather. Experiments on the publicly available WADS dataset (Winter Adverse Driving dataSet) showed that our method can efficiently remove snow noise while fully preserving the detailed features of the environment.

AB Autonomous driving poses unique challenges for vehicle environment perception due to the complex driving environment where the autonomous vehicle interacts with surrounding traffic participants. Due to the limited capability of any sensor perception system, it is highly desirable that an autonomous driving vehicle could use not only information from onboard sensors (say, radar/camera/lidar) but also from remote (network) information via inter-vehicle communication systems. The collaborative information from cooperative/noncooperative remote vehicles (along with the onboard sensor data) could substantially improve the vehicle decision making process and push autonomous driving to be safer and more reliable. Inter-vehicle communication technologies are at the stage of development for market introduction, after years of research and standardization. In this paper, we setup a dedicated short range communication (DSRC) system to provide a low-latency inter-vehicle wireless communication channel. The task is to build a record linkage between the onboard sensor data and the corresponding DSRC-transmitted remote vehicle information when both sets belong to the same object, for the purpose of enhancing host vehicle environment perceiving capability and reliability. This is a typical data association problem. The challenges mainly lie in the inherent uncertain nature of the observation data and the practical issues that information often suffers from delays and drops. We propose a trackbased association approach using an interacting multiple model estimator with a sequential multiple hypothesis test (denoted as IMM-SMHT) as an ubiquitous solution to handle different situations in complicated driving scenarios. To fully exploit the potential of such a system, only position information (from the DSRC channel and onboard radar system) is used for the object matching purpose-we try to use the least amount of information to achieve a high association accuracy; additional information can be used but not currently considered. We aim to provide a real world solution, and therefore, a prototype vehicle system is built with practical consideration on market availability, cost, and sensor limitations. We design meaningful use cases for creating functionality modules from a systematic point of view. The intervehicle information fusion system based on the track fusion approach using the IMM-SMHT is tested in real traffic on the U.S. roads and shows promising object matching performance of significant practical feasibility.

ID RESOLUTION
AB The number of aerial- and ground-based unmanned vehicles and operations is expected to significantly expand in the near future. While aviation traditionally has an excellent safety record in managing conflicts, the current approaches will not be able to provide safe and efficient operations in the future. This paper presents the development of a novel framework integrating autonomous aerial and ground vehicles to facilitate short- and mid-term tactical conflict management. The methodology presents the development of a modular web service framework to develop new conflict management algorithms. This new framework is aimed at managing urban and peri-urban traffic of unmanned ground vehicles and assisting the introduction of urban air mobility into the same framework. A set of high-level system requirements is defined. The incremental development of two versions of the system prototype is presented. The discussions highlight the lessons learnt while implementing and testing the conflict management system and the introduced version of the stop-and-go resolution algorithm and defines the identified future development directions. Operation of the system was successfully demonstrated using real hardware. The developed framework implements short- and mid-term conflict management methodologies in a safe, resource efficient and scalable manner and can be used for the further development and the evaluation of various methods integrating aerial- and ground-based autonomous vehicles.

ID VISION
AB Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) currently promise cooperation between vehicles, providing abundant and real-time information through wireless communication technologies. In this paper, a two-level fusion of classifiers (TLFC) approach is proposed by using deep learning classifiers to perform accurate road detection (RD). The proposed TLFC-RD approach improves the classification by considering four key strategies such as cross fold operation at input and pre-processing using superpixel generation, adequate features, multi-classifier feature fusion and a deep learning classifier. Specifically, the road is classified as drivable and non-drivable areas by designing the TLFC using the deep learning classifiers, and the detected information using the TLFC-RD is exchanged between the autonomous vehicles for the ease of driving on the road. The TLFC-RD is analyzed in terms of its accuracy, sensitivity or recall, specificity, precision, F1-measure and max F measure. The TLFC- RD method is also evaluated compared to three existing methods: U-Net with the Domain Adaptation Model (DAM), Two-Scale Fully Convolutional Network (TFCN) and a cooperative machine learning approach (i.e., TAAUWN). Experimental results show that the accuracy of the TLFC-RD method for the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) dataset is 99.12% higher than its competitors.

AB In the near future, autonomous vehicles with full self-driving features will populate our public roads. However, fully autonomous cars will require robust perception systems to safely navigate the environment, which includes cameras, RADAR devices, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors. LiDAR is currently a key sensor for the future of autonomous driving since it can read the vehicle's vicinity and provide a real-time 3D visualization of the surroundings through a point cloud representation. These features can assist the autonomous vehicle in several tasks, such as object identification and obstacle avoidance, accurate speed and distance measurements, road navigation, and more. However, it is crucial to detect the ground plane and road limits to safely navigate the environment, which requires extracting information from the point cloud to accurately detect common road boundaries. This article presents a survey of existing methods used to detect and extract ground points from LiDAR point clouds. It summarizes the already extensive literature and proposes a comprehensive taxonomy to help understand the current ground segmentation methods that can be used in automotive LiDAR sensors.

AB Vehicle-trajectory prediction is essential for intelligent traffic systems (ITS), as it can help autonomous vehicles to plan a safe and efficient path. However, it is still a challenging task because existing studies have mainly focused on the spatial interactions of adjacent vehicles regardless of the temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal attentive LSTM encoder-decoder model (STAM-LSTM) to predict vehicle trajectories. Specifically, the spatial attention mechanism is used to capture the spatial relationships among neighboring vehicles and then obtain the global spatial feature. Meanwhile, the temporal attention mechanism is designed to distinguish the effects of different historical time steps on future trajectory prediction. In addition, the motion feature of vehicles is extracted to reveal the influence of dynamic information on vehicle-trajectory prediction, and is combined with the local and global spatial features to represent the integrated features of the target vehicle at each historical moment. The experiments were conducted on public highway trajectory datasets-US-101 and I-80 in NGSIM-and the results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance.

AB Autonomous vehicles can achieve accurate localization and real-time road information perception using sensors such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and inertial measurement units (IMUs). With road information, vehicles can navigate autonomously to a given position without traffic accidents. However, most of the research on autonomous vehicles has paid little attention to road profile information, which is a significant reference for vehicles driving on uneven terrain. Most vehicles experience violent vibrations when driving on uneven terrain, which reduce the accuracy and stability of data obtained by LiDAR and IMUs. Vehicles with an active suspension system, on the other hand, can maintain stability on uneven roads, which further guarantees sensor accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method for road profile estimation using LiDAR and vehicles with an active suspension system. In the former, 3D laser scanners, IMU, and GPS were used to obtain accurate pose information and real-time cloud data points, which were added to an elevation map. In the latter, the elevation map was further processed by a Kalman filter algorithm to fuse multiple cloud data points at the same cell of the map. The model predictive control (MPC) method is proposed to control the active suspension system to maintain vehicle stability, thus further reducing drifts of LiDAR and IMU data. The proposed method was carried out in outdoor environments, and the experiment results demonstrated its accuracy and effectiveness.

AB Surrounding vehicle detection is one of the most important modules for a vision-based driver assistance system (VB-DAS) or an autonomous vehicle. In this paper, we put forward a wireless panoramic camera system for real-time and seamless imaging of the 360-degree driving scene. Using an embedded FPGA design, the proposed panoramic camera system can perform fast image stitching and produce panoramic videos in real-time, which greatly relives the computation and storage burden of a traditional multi-camera-based panoramic system. For surrounding vehicle detection, we present a novel deep convolutional neural network - EZ-Net, which perceives the potential vehicles by using 13 convolutional layers and locates the vehicles by a local non-maximum suppression process. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed EZ-Net performs vehicle detection on the panoramic video at a speed of 140 fps while holding a competing accuracy with the state-of-the-art detectors.

TI Dynamic ride-sharing and fleet sizing for a system of shared autonomous
   vehicles in Austin, Texas
SO TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Connected and autonomous vehicles; Shared autonomous vehicles; MATSim
   simulation; Dynamic ride-sharing
AB Shared autonomous (fully-automated) vehicles (SAVs) represent an emerging transportation mode for driverless and on-demand transport. Early actors include Google and Europe's CityMobil2, who seek pilot deployments in low-speed settings. This work investigates SAVs' potential for U.S. urban areas via multiple applications across the Austin, Texas, network. This work describes advances to existing agent- and network-based SAV simulations by enabling dynamic ride-sharing (DRS, which pools multiple travelers with similar origins, destinations and departure times in the same vehicle), optimizing fleet sizing, and anticipating profitability for operators in settings with no speed limitations on the vehicles and at adoption levels below 10 % of all personal trip-making in the region. Results suggest that DRS reduces average service times (wait times plus in-vehicle travel times) and travel costs for SAV users, even after accounting for extra passenger pick-ups, drop-offs and non-direct routings. While the base-case scenario (serving 56,324 person-trips per day, on average) suggest that a fleet of SAVs allowing for DRS may result in vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) that exceed person-trip miles demanded (due to anticipatory relocations of empty vehicles, between trip calls), it is possible to reduce overall VMT as trip-making intensity (SAV membership) rises and/or DRS users become more flexible in their trip timing and routing. Indeed, DRS appears critical to avoiding new congestion problems, since VMT may increase by over 8 % without any ride-sharing. Finally, these simulation results suggest that a private fleet operator paying $70,000 per new SAV could earn a 19 % annual (long-term) return on investment while offering SAV services at $1.00 per mile for a non-shared trip (which is less than a third of Austin's average taxi cab fare).

AB The decision-making control of autonomous driving in complex urban road environments is a difficult problem in the research of autonomous driving. In order to solve the problem of high dimensional state space and sparse reward in autonomous driving decision control in this environment, this paper proposed a Coordinated Convolution Multi-Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (CCMR-PPO). This method reduces the dimension of the bird's-eye view data through the coordinated convolution network and then fuses the processed data with the vehicle state data as the input of the algorithm to optimize the state space. The control commands acc (acc represents throttle and brake) and steer of the vehicle are used as the output of the algorithm.. Comprehensively considering the lateral error, safety distance, speed, and other factors of the vehicle, a multi-objective reward mechanism was designed to alleviate the sparse reward. Experiments on the CARLA simulation platform show that the proposed method can effectively increase the performance: compared with the PPO algorithm, the line crossed times are reduced by 24 %, and the number of tasks completed is increased by 54 %.

AB This paper proposes a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain Computer Interface (BC!) system to achieve the easy-to-use and stable control of a low speed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for indoor target searching. The BCI system for UAV control consists of two main subsystems responsible for decision and semi-autonomous navigation. The decision subsystem is established based on the analysis of motor imagery (MI) EEG. The improved cross-correlation method (CC) is used to accomplish the MI feature extraction and the logistic regression method (LR) is employed to complete the MI feature classification and decision. The average classification accuracy rate of the BCI system reaches to 94.36%. The semi-autonomous navigation subsystem is utilized to avoid obstacles automatically for UAV and provide feasible directions for decision subsystem. The actual indoor target searching experiment is carried out to verify the performance of this BCI system. The experiment validates the feasibility and effectiveness of this BCI system for low speed UAV control by using MI and semi-autonomous navigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To promote the ridership of connected and autonomous buses (CABs), this paper proposes to build CAB lanes in urban transportation networks. Three travel modes are considered: CAB, connected and autonomous passenger vehicle (CAV) and human-driven passenger vehicle (HV). To better utilise the capacities of CAB lanes, CAVs are granted limited access while maintaining good levels of services on these lanes. Analyses show that deploying CAB lanes may substantially increase the ridership of CABs and increase total social benefit, and allowing limited CAV access can further improve the overall system performance. The CAB lane allocation problem is formulated into a mixed-integer nonlinear programme. Numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the approach.

AB Along with the advent of compact stereo cameras, stereovision information has become an essential part of many perception units of robots and autonomous vehicles. The ease of capturing stereo data clouds is in contrast with the difficulty of processing them reliably in real-time operations. This research developed a methodology to deal with stereo point clouds by extracting useful information for an autonomous vehicle to travel between two points avoiding the obstacles interfering with its trajectory. The novel concept of 3D density and its embodiment through density grid was introduced and verified. Experimental results demonstrated that the application of 3D density and density maps is a suitable technique to cope with complex stereo data, providing useful information to aid in the path-planning routine of a mobile platform.

AB In order to facilitate the application of steer-by-wire system in L3 and higher-level autonomous driving vehicle and overcome the shortcomings of the dual motor steer-by-wire system, such as difficult synchronization control, high mechanical accuracy requirements, and high cost, this paper proposes a steer-by-wire execution control scheme based on dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). Firstly, the models of the dual three-phase PMSM, the steer-by-wire system and 2DOF vehicle are established. Then, an angle tracking strategy based on load torque observer and modified sliding mode control, and a redundancy reconstruction rule for the dual three-phase PMSM faults are designed. Finally, verification was conducted through simulation and hardware in loop (HIL)test bench. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed angle tracking control strategy has excellent dynamic performance and can effectively reduce high-frequency chattering, while the proposed fault-tolerant control strategy can effectively reduce the fluctuations of motor speed and torque under faults. Therefore, the control strategies proposed in this paper not only can meet the high-performance requirements of lateral control of autonomous vehicles, but also can meet the high-safety requirements of steer-by-wire system in high-level autonomous vehicles.

AB Good responsiveness of autonomous vehicle computing systems is crucial to safety and performance of the vehicles. For example, an autonomous vehicle (AV) may cause an accident if the end-to-end latency from sensing a pedestrian to emergency stop is too high. However, the AV software stacks are too complex to probabilistically analye the end-to-end latency on a multi-core system. They consist of a graph of tasks with different periods, and have a large variability in the task execution times, which may lead to the maximum core utilization $U<^>{\max }$Umax greater than 1.0 on some cores. This paper proposes a novel stochastic analysis of the end-to-end latency over the AV stacks that allows $U<^>{\max }$Umax to exceed 1.0 on each core. The proposed analysis models the entire stack as a graph of task graphs under a multi-core partitioned scheduling and provides a probabilistic guarantee that the analyzed latency distribution upper-bounds the one observed from a real system under the assumption of independent task execution times. Using the Autoware stack with inter-task dependent execution times, it is shown that our analysis, combined with a task grouping to mitigate the inter-task correlations, can give a latency distribution for each task path that almost upper-bounds the observed one.

AB In this survey, we look at the overall idea of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) and autonomous control, as well as RPAS infrastructure, levels of autonomy, and current benefits and difficulties in the field when utilizing Artificial Intelligence. While current remotely piloted aircraft systems have a manual pilot operator to provide double-layer security and safety, studies show that having RPAS with a fully autonomous vehicle at its centre could significantly improve decision-making and overall mission precision, accuracy, safety, and efficiency.

AB There is a great demand for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to investigate artificial underwater structures such as piles and caissons in harbours, and risers and jackets of deep-sea oilfields. This paper proposes an autonomous investigation method of underwater structures using AUVs that is implemented by initially detecting the target objects, localizing them, then approaching them by taking video images while closely tracing their shape. A laser ranging system and a navigation method based on the relative position with respect to the target objects are introduced to realize this behaviour. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the popularization of transportation network companies (TNCs) (e.g., Uber, Lyft) and the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), even major car manufacturers are increasingly considering themselves as autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) providers rather than individual vehicle sellers. However, matching the convenience of owning a vehicle requires providing consistent service quality, taking into account individual expectations. Typically, different classes of users have different service quality (SQ) expectations in terms of responsiveness, reliability, and privacy. Nonetheless, AMoD systems presented in the literature do not enable active control of service quality in the short term, especially in light of unusual demand patterns, sometimes allowing extensive delays and user rejections. This study proposes a method to control the daily operations of an AMoD system that uses the SQ expectations of heterogeneous user classes to dynamically distribute service quality among riders. Additionally, we consider an elastic vehicle supply, that is, privately-owned freelance AVs (FAVs) can be hired on short notice to help providers meeting user service-level expectations. We formalize the problem as the dial-a-ride problem with service quality contracts (DARP-SQC) and propose a multi-objective matheuristic to address real-world requests from Manhattan, New York City. Applying the proposed service level constraints, we improve user satisfaction (in terms of reached service-level expectations) by 53% on average compared to conventional ridesharing systems, even without hiring additional vehicles. By deploying service-quality-oriented on-demand hiring, our hierarchical optimization approach allows providers to adequately cater to each segment of the customer base without necessarily owning large fleets.

AB Structured and unstructured uncertainties coupled with external disturbances usually pose considerable challenges in realizing heavy vehicle automatic lane guidance control. This paper presents a novel solution paradigm for the lateral control of autonomous heavy vehicle. The proposed control framework consists of an adaptive state estimator and a finite-time optimized H-infinity. state feedback regulator. Firstly, based on the dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF) technique, which can estimate model time-varying parameters and unknown states at the same time, the adaptive state estimation algorithm is proposed and investigated to improve state estimation adaptivity against uncertain time-varying general front/rear axle cornering stiffnesses. Then, using zero-sum dynamic game theory as the general framework, we analyze the minimax controller design problem and introduce the finite-time optimized robust regulator design method. The autonomous heavy vehicle automatic lane guidance controller is designed in the framework of robust optimal state feedback control to make it robust against external disturbance. Finally, results of various driving scenarios from both simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) implementation show that the proposed finite-time optimized robust and adaptive state estimation control paradigm can robustly obtain satisfactory automated lateral control performance for heavy vehicle when the control system is characterized by both time-varying model parameters and uncertain external energy-bounded disturbance. A comparative study is also conducted to investigate cases to show its effectiveness when the adaptive state estimation is used and when it is not. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we explored the impact of anticipation and asymmetric driving behavior on vehicle's position, velocity, acceleration, energy consumption, and exhaust emissions of CO, HC, and NOx in mixed traffic flow. We present an asymmetric-anticipation car-following model (AAFVD) considering the motion information from two direct preceding vehicles (i.e., human-driving (HD) and autonomous and connected (AC) vehicles platoon) via wireless data transmission. The linear stability approach was used to evaluate the properties of the AAFVD model. Our simulations revealed that the drivers' anticipation factor using the motion information from two direct preceding vehicles in connected vehicles environment can effectively improve traffic flow stability. The vehicle's departure and arrival process while passing through a signal lane with a traffic light considering the anticipation and asymmetric driving behavior, and the motion information from two direct preceding vehicles was explored. Our numerical results demonstrated that the AAFVD model can decrease the velocity fluctuations, energy consumption, and exhaust emissions of vehicles in mixed traffic flow system.

ID EMISSIONS; GAS
AB Electrification and automation are attracting interest from the public-transportation sector for their potential to improve energy efficiency, cost efficiency, and environmental performance. Singapore is planning to integrate autonomous buses/minibuses into its transportation system by 2030. However, before the island-wide deployment of autonomous vehicles, there is a need to evaluate their effects on sustainability. A study was therefore conducted in Singapore to evaluate the costs and environmental impacts of autonomous electric minibuses, and the results are revealed and discussed here. This paper presents a case study to demonstrate the impacts of replacing human-driven diesel buses with electrified and automated minibuses on life-cycle costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for seven routes. The vehicles evaluated were a 12-m human-driven diesel bus, a 6-m electrified human-driven minibus, and a 6-m electrified autonomous minibus. First, the impacts of the vehicle concepts on the scheduling were analysed to obtain the operational strategy and passenger occupancy along the route. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) and a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis were then conducted to compare the fleet-level costs and GHG emissions. The results showed a 43% reduction in total life-cycle cost for the autonomous electric minibus, compared with the 12-m diesel bus. The life-cycle GHG emissions of the 6-m autonomous electric minibus were also reduced by 47% compared with the 12-m diesel bus, despite the fact that a larger number of the former vehicle were required in the fleet.

AB This paper investigates the formation control of connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoons moving in multi lanes using distance-based formation control techniques based on rigid graphs and V2V communication. A hierarchical architecture is proposed to decompose the cooperative control into velocity planning and vehicle dynamic control. A new velocity planning method is first developed via a distributed distance-based formation controller so that each vehicle can keep platoon and change lane. Then, for the vehicle dynamics with nonlinearities and bounded disturbances, an adaptive controller is designed for regulating driving/braking torque to achieve the longitudinal velocity output of the velocity planner. The steering controller is designed to adjust the yaw angle of each vehicle to track and change lanes. Furthermore, stability analysis is conducted based on the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the applications of the proposed control designs to various of automated highway system (AHS) scenarios including lane-change, curve lane and platoon overtaking, are simulated and numerically analysed to validate the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB We present a formation-control algorithm for autonomous fixed-wing air vehicles. The desired inter-vehicle positions are time-varying, and we assume that at least one vehicle has access to a measurement its position relative to the leader, which can be a physical or virtual member of the formation. Each vehicle is modeled with extended unicycle dynamics that include orientation kinematics on SO(3), speed dynamics, and strict constraints on speed (i.e., ground speed). The analytic result shows that the vehicles converge exponentially to the desired relative positions with each other and the leader. We also show that each vehicle's speed satisfies the speed constraints. The formation algorithm is demonstrated in software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations and experiments with fixed-wing air vehicles. To implement the formation-control algorithm, each vehicle has middle-loop controllers to determine roll, pitch, and throttle commands from the outer-loop formation control. We present SITL simulations with 4 fixed-wing air vehicles that demonstrate formation control with different communication structures. Finally, we present formation-control experiments with up to 3 fixed-wing air vehicles.

ID HOUGH TRANSFORM
AB This paper presents a method for guiding an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during sea bottom inspection missions. The vehicle is equipped with several sensors (optical, sonar, acoustic) and is able to detect and follow a pipeline placed on the sea bottom. Neural networks and geometric reasoning methods are integrated to perform a real-time identification of pipeline borders in a complex underwater environment. Different scenarios characterized by both obstacles and/or artifacts (due to reflections of artificial light sources used by the vehicle to illuminate the scene) have been considered. Results focus on pipeline detection accuracy and on AUV missions in the absence or presence of down stream and/or obstacles. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Currently, many governments, global automakers, and IT companies have been showing increasing interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs). Therefore, the research, development, and testing of AVs are underway worldwide and the development of scenarios for AV safety evaluation is emerging as an urgent issue in various nations and institutions. However, in Korea, research on an appropriate legal system for AVs is necessary because the existing one is insufficient for the development of a scenario for evaluating autonomous driving safety. In this study, the present legal system related to autonomous driving in Korea was selected to establish a five-layer format-based autonomous driving scenario for the PEGASUS project. The possibility of the expansion and improvement of the methodology was proposed by conducting a legal system analysis. Finally, an analysis of the related legal provisions for each layer was conducted to highlight the necessity of a legal system that is suitable for the era of autonomous driving in the future.

AB The driver's perception level and takeover performance are two major factors that result in accidents in autonomous vehicles. This study's goal is to analyze the change in drivers' perception level and its influence on takeover performance during autonomous driving. A takeover behavior test platform is implemented based on a high-fidelity driving simulator. The fog zone is selected as the takeover scenario. Thus, a 2 (takeover request time: 5 s, 10 s) by 2 (non-driving-related task: work task, entertainment task) takeover experiment was conducted. A generalized linear mixed model is developed to explore the influence of the perception level on takeover performance. The study finds out that, after the takeover request is triggered, the driver's gaze duration is shortened and the pupil area is enlarged, which is helpful for the driver to extract and understand the road information faster. Male drivers have greater perception levels than female drivers, and they prioritize leisure tasks more than professional ones. The drivers' perception level decreases when age increases. The shorter the gaze duration is, and the larger the pupil area is, the shorter the takeover response time will be. In addition, drivers' perception level has a positive effect on takeover performance. Finally, this study provides a reference for revealing the changing rules of drivers' perception level in autonomous driving, and the study can provide support for the diagnosis of takeover risks of autonomous vehicles from the perspective of human factors.

AB For the lateral control of an autonomous vehicle, this paper proposes a linear-matrix-inequality (LMI)-based H-infinity control algorithm that utilizes the feedback of the lateral offset and target yaw angle at the preview point, which is effective for the fusion of look-ahead and look-down sensors. To verify the performance of this controller, lane change and circular lane tracking simulations are carried out in multi body dynamics. Against the uniformly random noises in position and yaw angle and the constant modeling uncertainties in mass and cornering stiffness, the robustness of the proposed algorithm is compared with the cubic curve method and the heading angle method at the look-ahead target lane.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB When blind and deaf people are passengers in fully autonomous vehicles, an intuitive and accurate visualization screen should be provided for the deaf, and an audification system with speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) functions should be provided for the blind. However, these systems cannot know the fault self-diagnosis information and the instrument cluster information that indicates the current state of the vehicle when driving. This paper proposes an audification and visualization system (AVS) of an autonomous vehicle for blind and deaf people based on deep learning to solve this problem. The AVS consists of three modules. The data collection and management module (DCMM) stores and manages the data collected from the vehicle. The audification conversion module (ACM) has a speech-to-text submodule (STS) that recognizes a user's speech and converts it to text data, and a text-to-wave submodule (TWS) that converts text data to voice. The data visualization module (DVM) visualizes the collected sensor data, fault self-diagnosis data, etc., and places the visualized data according to the size of the vehicle's display. The experiment shows that the time taken to adjust visualization graphic components in on-board diagnostics (OBD) was approximately 2.5 times faster than the time taken in a cloud server. In addition, the overall computational time of the AVS system was approximately 2 ms faster than the existing instrument cluster. Therefore, because the AVS proposed in this paper can enable blind and deaf people to select only what they want to hear and see, it reduces the overload of transmission and greatly increases the safety of the vehicle. If the AVS is introduced in a real vehicle, it can prevent accidents for disabled and other passengers in advance.

AB Autonomous exploration is grounded on target decision and trajectory planning, which is widely deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles. However, existing methods generally only focus on the exploration effect of target decision but neglect the environment information gained with trajectory planning during flight, resulting in redundant exploration trajectories and low exploration efficiency. This article proposes an upgraded method of trajectory planning for autonomous exploration work. We design a fresh cost term considering the frontier information in the part of trajectory optimization. Besides, yaw angles are planned independently to catch more environment information during flight. We present extensive simulations and real-world tests. The results show that our proposed method reduces the exploration cost time by 10-15% compared with the previous one.

AB This article proposes an automatic longitudinal deceleration based method for multi-wheel vehicle rollover safety in autonomous mode. The information of lateral acceleration and vehicle roll angle is used to generate the longitudinal acceleration at which the vehicle will remain stable to rollover. The lateral and roll dynamics are coupled with longitudinal dynamics using a potential field function for lateral acceleration. This virtual potential field is developed on g-g diagram which represents vehicle portrait of lateral and longitudinal acceleration on abscissa and ordinate respectively. The motion of vehicle is represented by a point moving on this phase portrait of g-g diagram. TruckSim model of multi-wheel military vehicle with in-wheel motors is used with this algorithm which shows that the vehicle is less susceptible to rollover. The safe longitudinal acceleration is achieved by torque control of in-wheel motors fitted in each wheel. Using this method, the vehicle followed the desired trajectory as higher speeds which are safe. This is particularly useful for vehicle autonomous driving with rollover stability.

AB The control system design for the reusable launch vehicles (RLVs), especially in the autonomous horizontal takeoff phase, is a highly challenging task. Significant issues arise due to the high nonlinearity, large uncertainties of aerodynamic coefficients as well as strong coupling among axes of the airframe. This paper studies autonomous takeoff control problem of the RLVs by the means of trajectory linearization control (TLC) and model predictive control (MPC) theory. The six degree of freedom dynamic model is firstly established, and the flight strategy of takeoff and climb stage is provided through the characteristic analysis of RLVs. Furthermore, the guidance law for the climbing phase is proposed via the TLC method against the high nonlinearity, and a speed based gain-schedule strategy is given under the consideration of both aerodynamic force and friction force. In order to eliminate the ground effect interference, an improved model predictive control approach is presented by introducing the online parameter estimation of the ground effect interaction coefficient, and a coupled model predictive controller is designed by introducing the feedback of sideslip angle into the roll control channel to eliminate the coupling effect. Finally, the performance of the design method for autonomous takeoff control of RLVs is demonstrated through the comparison simulation analysis.

ID PITCH CONTROL; SYSTEMS; DESIGN
AB Model uncertainty and saturation in actuators are among some of the practical challenges in the controller design of autonomous vehicles. Incorporating adaptive control with anti-windup (AW) compensators can provide a convenient combination to counteract the challenge. In this manuscript, an adaptive control with a dynamic anti-windup compensator is proposed for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Due to industrial and academic interests, the proposed method is embedded with a Proportional-Derivative-Integral (PID) controller. A modern AW technique is employed to cope with the saturation problem. Typical performance of the adaptive control system is achieved in the absence of actuator saturation. The performance is shown to degrade when the saturation has occurred. However the quality of the adaptive controller is improved when it is combined with an anti-windup compensator. Primarily six degrees of freedom (DOF) nonlinear motion equations of the vehicle are derived. Then, the proposed scheme is applied to this nonlinear model. Performance of the modified system is compared by the baseline controller. The effectiveness of the presented method in the presence of the actuator saturation, considering uncertainties, noise and disturbance is assessed and verified through simulation scenarios.

AB This paper presents the design, implementation and real world evaluation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The mission of the vehicle is to carry out an ocean survey in dynamic, partially unknown and unsafe environment, and subject to constraints on the operations. It is a multi-area and multi-sensor-type survey mission which is appropriate for a large range ocean survey to obtain different parameters in different objective areas. The main work in this project is the novel design and development of a hierarchical on-board architecture of the AUV. The architecture is specified by increasingly detailed Petri nets (PN) under the agent-based distributed autonomous control structure. A number of agents have been used in the architecture for mission management and control. Communications and cooperation between agents are realised. The management and control of the mission is modelled by discrete events driven PN formalism. The highest level PN and lower sub-PNs with designed events are described in detail. The designed vehicle has been tested in real world experiments, a lake trial, to evaluate its performance. The feasibility and effectiveness of the architecture is proven in the lake trials in nominal and degraded situations. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Radio frequency identification (RFID) is investigated as a technology that may be useful for smart cars and autonomous vehicles to read information about local road conditions and geographic location. Passive UHF RFID tags can transmit this data wirelessly to an RFID reader mounted on the vehicle. Coupling between a tag that is on or embedded in pavement, and the reader antenna mounted on the vehicles, is investigated by simulating the tag antenna, reader antenna and local environment in FEKO (TM). Preliminary simulation results show that it is feasible to implement such a system such that a vehicle traveling up to 200 km/hr. can read the tags as it passes over them.

AB Protection of vulnerable road users has been an increasingly important requirement for today's autonomous vehicles. Analysis of drivers' response to potential collision with pedestrians can provide guidance for vehicle evasive manoeuvre and data support for traffic collision modelling. Field traffic data were collected by video recording and image processing at urban midblock crosswalks in Beijing, China and Munich, Germany. The drivers' response to vehicle-pedestrian conflict is discussed by deceleration and acceleration phases considering the lane-based kinematics of vehicles. Some basic characteristics describing the driver behaviour in an evasive process are statistically analysed, including the yielding decision, space history of deceleration, deceleration rate choice, and accelerating behaviour. Results show significant differences in drivers' yielding decisions. In addition, the onset of braking and the trend of the space history of average deceleration rate during the drivers' approaching process have been quantitatively proposed. The contributing factors to driver's yielding behaviour are analysed by the Binary Logit Model. The behavioural differences address the needs to make intercultural adaptation when introducing new autonomous vehicle technologies to developing countries. This study provides a basis for establishing evasive decision corrections for drivers or driverless vehicles.

AB The task of synchronisation of autonomous agents can be solved by a networked controller that steers the agents towards a common trajectory. This paper proves a condition for the synchronism that makes it possible to decompose the design task into two steps. First, the stability region of the agents are to be determined, for which in the second step a networked controller should be found. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition for the agents to possess the synchronisability property. The results are illustrated by its application to a string of vehicles.

AB To achieve technical perfection of the Advanced driver assistant system (ADAS), accurate analysis of the vehicle's position is essential. For this, conventionally, sensor fusion has been carried out using a general GPS and general Inertial measurement unit (IMU), but the position accuracy decreases because of inertial sensor accumulation. Furthermore, because a vehicle tire model is analyzed by linearization and using a bicycle model, the position error increases. To solve this, in this study, a fusion algorithm was proposed by using an extended Kalman filter based on the non-linear tire model for the vehicle state information and by using the general GPS position information provided by the electric stability program of the vehicle. The fusion algorithm proposed in this study allowed us to suggest a position error correction method corresponding to a high precision Differential global positioning system (DGPS) within 1 m.

AB Platooning of autonomous vehicles has the potential to significantly benefit road traffic. This paper presents a new robust acceleration tracking control of vehicle longitudinal dynamics toward platoon-level automation. Based on a multiple-model switching structure, this design divides the large uncertainties of vehicle dynamics into small uncertainties and, accordingly, develops multiple robust controllers for the multiple-model set. The switching control system automatically selects the most appropriate candidate controller into the loop, according to the errors between current vehicle dynamics and multiple models. This technique offers more consistent and approximately linear node dynamics for upper level platoon control, even under relatively large vehicle uncertainties. Simulation comparison with a sliding model controller and a fixed H-infinity controller is conducted for a passenger car to demonstrate the enhanced robustness of the switching control method. The experimental test for the same car is performed for further validation.

AB Automated vehicles are undergoing very rapid development and have potential to revolutionize the existing transportation system. This paper investigates the impacts of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and shared automated vehicles (SAVs) using a conventional travel-demand model for the Austin, Texas, region. A series of eight test scenarios run in the year 2020 setting suggests that the introduction of CAVs and SAVs will add 20% or greater demand for new vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) to the six-county region's roadway network. Relatively low values of travel time for passengers of automated vehicles and competitive pricing assumptions of SAV use result in greater demand for longer distance travel and reduced transit system use. Empty-vehicle travel for self-parking vehicles and SAVs will add to the network's VKT, presumably increasing roadway congestion further, unless rides can be shared, traffic flows smoothed, and intervehicle headways tightened. The scenario simulations are sensitive to parking cost and vehicle operating cost assumptions. Policymakers, transportation planners, system operators, and designers may do well to simulate additional scenarios. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB The topic of emerging mobility services has quickly received attention from scholars and media in recent years. Mobility services employing autonomous buses in transport systems is one such example. Mobility services using emerging technologies are expected to create social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, the potential benefits of emerging mobility services using autonomous technology will not be realized unless self-driving vehicles are accepted and used by many passengers. The recent worldwide pandemic caused us to recognize the benefits of autonomous technologies. This pretest-and-posttest designed research examines the predictors of willingness to ride autonomous buses in a closed environment. The results of this study indicate that a combination of factors, such as societal benefits, attitude and technology adoption, directly and indirectly influence an individual's acceptance of autonomous buses. This study finds that passengers' willingness to use emerging mobility services after a sample riding experience is higher than before having a sample riding experience.

AB Over the course of the last decade great advances have been made in autonomously driving cars. The technology has advanced to the point that driverless car technology is currently being tested on publicly accessed roadways. The introduction of these technologies onto publicly accessed roadways not only raises questions of safety, but also security. Autonomously driving cars are inherently cyber-physical systems and as such will have novel security vulnerabilities that couple both the cyber aspects of the vehicle including the on-board computing and any network data it makes use of, with the physical nature of the vehicle including its sensors, actuators, and the vehicle chassis. Widespread implementation of driverless car technology will require that both the cyber, as well as physical security concerns surrounding these vehicles are addressed. In this work, we specifically developed a control policy to autonomously execute the Precision Immobilization Technique, a.k.a. the PIT maneuver. The PIT maneuver was originally developed by law enforcement to end high-speed vehicular pursuits in a quasi-safe manner. However, there is still a risk of damage/roll-over to both the vehicle executing the PIT maneuver as well as to the vehicle subject to the PIT maneuver. In law enforcement applications, it would be preferable to execute the PIT maneuver using an autonomous vehicle, thus removing the danger to law-enforcement officers. Furthermore, it is entirely possible that unscrupulous individuals could inject code into an autonomously-driving car to use the PIT maneuver to immobilize other vehicles while maintaining anonymity. For these reasons it is useful to know how the PIT maneuver can be implemented on an autonomous car. In this work a simple control policy based on velocity pursuit was developed to autonomously execute the PIT maneuver using only a vision and range measurements that are both commonly collected by contemporary driverless cars. The ability of this control policy to execute the PIT maneuver was demonstrated both in simulation and experimentally. The results of this work can help inform the design of autonomous car with regards to ensuring their cyber-physical security. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The safety of the planned paths of autonomous cars with respect to the movement of other traffic participants is considered. Therefore, the stochastic occupancy of the road by other vehicles is predicted. The prediction considers uncertainties originating from the measurements and the possible behaviors of other traffic participants. In addition, the interaction of traffic participants, as well as the limitation of driving maneuvers due to the road geometry, is considered. The result of the presented approach is the probability of a crash for a specific trajectory of the autonomous car. The presented approach is efficient as most of the intensive computations are performed offline, which results in a lean online algorithm for real-time application.

AB In recent years, Sound Event Classification (SEC) is a remarkable field of computer audition research. The abilities to automatically capture and classify sound events are meaningful for expanding the auditory ability of autonomous vehicle in a complex driving environment. The Autonomous vehicles will encounter some special road conditions during driving, such as large truck occlusion, tunnels, and buildings that hinder radar detection. Therefore, the perception capabilities of on-board lidar, vision, and other sensors are impacted, resulting in a great threat to the safe driving of the car. At this time, auditory environment perception can provide auditory dimension information for the vehicle. However, with the increase of noise level, the SEC task of autonomous vehicle becomes seriously difficult. Traditional machine learning methods show weak robustness in the highly noisy environment. In this work, an autonomous vehicle Sound Event Classification (AVSEC) framework based on Spectrogram Image Features (SIFs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithm is proposed to solve the SEC question. Further on, the ambulance, bus, civil defense siren, fire truck, screaming, etc. are taken as the research traffic sounds. Traffic Sound Datasets (TSD) are collected, augmented and customized. Then, directly connected channel (DCC) between convolutional blocks and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) are designed to optimize the neural network. Testing results show that the AVSEC system achieves an accuracy of 97.18%. Furthermore, the results of AVSEC and other machine learning methods are compared, which shows that the combination of SIFs and AVSEC-net provides better noise robustness and classification accuracy in AVSEC task. The sound classification algorithm designed in this paper, as an advanced auxiliary driving system for sound detection, can identify the sound types in the current traffic environment of the Autonomous vehicles, that is, the traffic scene category. The vehicle computer can remind the driver to pay attention to driving safety through the above sound types, so as to improve the safety of the driver and the vehicle.

AB Increasing electric vehicle penetration leads to undesirable peaks in power if no proper coordination in charging is implemented. We tested the feasibility of electric vehicles acting as flexible demands responding to power signals to minimize the system peaks. The proposed hierarchical autonomous demand side management algorithm is formulated as an optimal power tracking problem. The distribution grid operator determines a power signal for filling the valleys in the non-electric vehicle load profile using the electric vehicle demand flexibility and sends it to all electric vehicle controllers. After receiving the control signal, each electric vehicle controller re-scales it to the expected individual electric vehicle energy demand and determines the optimal charging schedule to track the re-scaled signal. No information concerning the electric vehicles are reported back to the utility, hence the approach can be implemented using unidirectional communication with reduced infrastructural requirements. The achieved results show that the optimal power tracking approach has the potential to eliminate additional peak demands induced by electric vehicle charging and performs comparably to its central implementation. The reduced complexity and computational overhead permits also convenient deployment in practice.

AB This paper deals with the identification of linear discrete-time multivariable models of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The observer Kalman filter identification (OKID) method is applied with the main objective of evaluating its effectiveness to the experimental identification of the dynamic behaviour of an AUV. After presenting the mathematical background of the OKID algorithm, the proposed method is first validated on the basis of simulated data of both the linearized and nonlinear yaw dynamics of an AUV. Subsequently, the identification algorithm is applied to a set of experimental data. Results suggest that the method can be an efficient tool for the experimental identification of AUV dynamics.

AB With the rapid development of technologies, the ecological control strategies of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies are gaining more and more attention. In this paper, a rule-based ecological cruise control, called the ecological smart driver model (EcoSDM), is proposed to improve the fuel efficiency of an individual vehicle and the traffic flow. By adjusting the spacing between the leading and the following vehicles, EcoSDM provides smoother deceleration and acceleration than the enhanced intelligent driver model (Enhanced-IDM) and the smart driver model (SDM). The linear stability of EcoSDM is analyzed both theoretically and numerically. The numerical results validate the results of theoretical analysis. Moreover, the simulations results show that EcoSDM outperforms the Enhanced-IDM and SDM in terms of stabilization effect on homogeneous traffic flow. In addition, the calibrated VT-Micro model is used to estimate the fuel consumption of CAVs and manually driven vehicles. The result shows that CAVs have better fuel economy than the human-driven vehicles, which is consistent with existing studies. The EcoSDM outperforms Enhanced-IDM and SDM in terms of fuel consumption. For the EcoSDM-equipped CAVs, the fuel saving benefit is greatest when a CAV is at the front of the platoon.

AB This paper studies longitudinal vehicle following problem, where two control strategies i.e. LQR optimal synthesis and a novel quasi-linear controller are adopted for a linearized vehicle model. In case of LQR, the results are enhanced by inclusion of a minimum order state observer and a feed-forward controller. Since the dynamics of the feedback linearized system correspond to a certain class of linear systems, i.e. a system having more than one pole in excess to zeros, a simpler order quasi-linear feedback controller is applied. The designed controller guarantees asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectories Linder the constraints of physical limitations inherent in the system. A comparative Simulation study of the two approaches reveals the system's performance under various conditions.

AB Today's modern vehicles contain anywhere from sixty to one-hundred sensors and exhibit the characteristics of Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPS). There is a high degree of coupling, cohesiveness, and interactions among vehicle's CPS components (e.g., sensors, devices, systems, systems-of-systems) across sensing, communication, and control layers. Cyber-attacks in the sensing or communication layers can compromise the security of the control layer. This paper provides a detailed review of potential cyber threats related to the sensing layer. Notably, the focus is mainly towards two categories of sensors: vehicle dynamics sensors (e.g., Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS), magnetic encoders, and inertial sensors) and environment sensors (e.g., Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), ultrasonic, camera, Radio Detection and Ranging (Radar) systems, and Global Positioning System (GPS) units). The paper also offers perspectives through existing countermeasures from literature and stresses the need for data-driven cybersecurity solutions.

AB Cruise control is a technology for automatically maintaining a steady speed of vehicle as set by the driver via controlling throttle valve and brake of vehicle. In this paper we investigate cruise controller design method with consideration for distance to vehicle ahead. We employ linear time varying (LTV) model to describe longitudinal vehicle dynamic motion. With this LTV system we approximately model the nonlinear dynamics of vehicle speed by frequent update of the system parameters. In addition we reformulate the LTV system by transforming distance to leading vehicle into variation of system parameters of the model. Note that in conventional control problem formulation this distance is considered as disturbance which should be rejected. Consequently a controller can be designed by pole placement at each instance of parameter update, based on the linear model with the present system parameters. The validity of this design method is examined by simulation study.

AB This paper investigates a ride-sharing vehicle dispatching and routing problem in ride-sharing autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. We present a new method that can optimize both operation cost and passenger quality of service in a global and farsighted view by leveraging the historical data. It comprises two parts, one for vehicle routing decision making and the other for request-vehicle assignment. In particular, the vehicle routing decision making procedure is formulated as a Markov decision process considering idle vehicle rebalancing, with properly designed states, actions, and rewards. By sampling the future requests according to the historical probability distribution, the look-ahead decision making is realized via a deep reinforcement learning framework, which is composed of a Convolutional Neural Network and a double deep Q-learning module. Then a request-vehicle assignment scheme is presented based on the learning value attained from vehicle routing. Satisfactory performances (e.g, service rate, average waiting time and travel distance) of the method are demonstrated by experimental results under various fleet sizes and different vehicle capacities.

DE B-spline curves; autonomous vehicles; haul road; path planning
AB In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for generating collision-free two-lane paths for unmanned vehicles used at mining sites by using quartic (degree 4) B-spline curves. Given the boundary geometry of the haul road area and the positions and orientations of the two-dimensional vehicle at the start and goal points, the algorithm automatically generates a collision-free twolane path that satisfies the minimum turning radius constraint. Moreover, the resulting path shares the same third derivative at knots (joints), i.e., C-3 continuity, which guarantees a continuous rate of change of the curvature along the entire path. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle; Jacket structures; Navigation;
   Path-planning; Guidance
AB This paper proposes a path-planning and guidance strategy for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to perform detailed inspections of jacket structures such as the support legs of offshore platforms. Inspections of such structures are important for maintenance, security, and environmental assessment. These tasks can be carried out at a less cost by using AUVs than through conventional methods. The path-planning method generates a set of waypoints to facilitate the complete coverage of the surface of the target from a constant distance based on the given information about the configurations of both the target and the vehicle. The guidance method actually controls the vehicle such that it follows the waypoints, under the assumption that the position and attitude of the vehicle are being estimated in real time with adequate accuracy. By combining these methods with the localization method we had previously proposed (Maki et al., J Mar Sci Technol [1]) an AUV can perform a fully autonomous observation of jacket structures with prior knowledge of only their configuration. The performance of the method was verified though tank experiments using the AUV Tri-Dog 1. A simple model of a jacket was installed in a test tank, and the vehicle succeeded in inspecting the target.

ID SYSTEMS
AB The fault detection and isolation are very important for the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. At present, scholars have conducted extensive research on model-based fault detection and isolation algorithms in vehicle systems, but few of them have been applied for path tracking control. This paper determines the conditions for model establishment of a single-track 3-DOF vehicle dynamics model and then performs Taylor expansion for modeling linearization. On the basis of that, a novel fault-tolerant model predictive control algorithm (FTMPC) is proposed for robust path tracking control of autonomous vehicle. First, the linear time-varying model predictive control algorithm for lateral motion control of vehicle is designed by constructing the objective function and considering the front wheel declination and dynamic constraint of tire cornering. Then, the motion state information obtained by multi-sensory perception systems of vision, GPS, and LIDAR is fused by using an improved weighted fusion algorithm based on the output error variance. A novel fault signal detection algorithm based on Kalman filtering and Chi-square detector is also designed in our work. The output of the fault signal detector is a fault detection matrix. Finally, the fault signals are isolated by multiplication of signal matrix, fault detection matrix, and weight matrix in the process of data fusion. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with simulation experiment of lane changing path tracking control. The comparative analysis of simulation results shows that the proposed method can achieve the expected fault-tolerant performance and much better path tracking control performance in case of sensor failure.

ID DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT
AB Collision avoidance in 3D environments is important to the problem of planning safe trajectories for an autonomous vehicle. Existing literature on collision avoidance assumed that obstacle shapes are known a priori and modeled obstacles as spheres or bounding boxes. However, in 3D environments, an obstacle shape is unknown to the autonomous vehicle, and the vehicle detects an obstacle boundary using 3D sensors, such as 3D sonar. In this paper, we introduce control laws for collision avoidance, considering scenarios where a vehicle detects arbitrarily shaped and non-convex obstacles using sensors. Moreover, our control laws are designed considering motion constraints, such as the maximum turn rate and the maximum speed rate of the vehicle. The effectiveness of our control laws is verified using MATLAB simulations.

AB Despite the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles (AVs) of reducing human driver errors and enhancing traffic safety, a comprehensive evaluation of recent AV collision data reveals a concerning trend of rear-end collisions caused by following vehicles. This study aimed to address this issue by developing a methodology that identifies the relationship between driving patterns and the risk of collision between leading and following vehicles using spectral analysis. Specifically, we propose a process for computing three indices: reaction time, stimulus compliance index, and collision-risk aversion index. These indices consistently produced reliable results under various traffic conditions. Our findings align with existing research on the driving patterns of following vehicles. Given the consistency and robustness of these indices, they can be effectively utilized in advanced driver assistance systems or incorporated into AVs to assess the likelihood of collision risk posed by following vehicles and develop safer driving strategies accordingly.

AB In this work, we propose an algorithm for generating multiple simultaneous trajectories focusing on covering a given area for surveillance applications based on multiple Kohonen self-organizing maps. The proposed algorithm generates trajectories of optimal two-dimensional space filling, avoiding self and inter-trajectory crossings, allowing rapid update of the remaining trajectories if one or more vehicles fail. This strategy allows several levels of control in the properties of the trajectories, such as fixing or letting loose any of its points, changing the shape of regions after or during convergence, so providing a promising alternative for the generation of non-overlapping trajectories for multiple vehicles aimed at surveillance missions, for example, in the case of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

AB In this paper, we propose a 6G-envisioned blockchain (BC)-based scheme for cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) ecosystems (termed as 6Blocks), which optimizes the edge-resource provisioning of 5G C-V2X nodes via network function virtualization (NFV)-enabled infrastructure. 6Blocks operates in three phases. In the first phase, a secure data aggregation through 6G sensors is performed at the data plane. Then, in the second phase, the aggregated data is sent to the 6G-enabled NFV control plane to leverage resource allocation to connected autonomous smart vehicles (CASVs) through edge nodes via service container operations. In the third phase, management plane operations are designed that includes registration and auction smart contracts (SC) for connected autonomous vehicle owner (CAVO) and CASVs over the BC with public/private pairs fetched from interplanetary file systems (IPFS). The proposed scheme is compared against existing NFV schemes like distant, edge, and SDN-based edge control. At 20 CASVs, 6Blocks achieves an edge-service latency of 0.05 ms against 0.76 ms, 0.27, and 0.15 ms for cloud, edge, and SDN-edge schemes, respectively, with high connection density of 10(7) nodes, at maximum utilized IPFS bandwidth of 0.2 Mbps. Then, we validate the trust of our model through the automated validation of the internet security protocol and applications (AVISPA) tool and modeled the vehicle and sensor nodes. The obtained results show the efficacy of the proposed scheme against existing state-of-the-art approaches with respect to parameters such as network, security, transaction costs, and auction.

AB Classification and analysis of driving behaviors offer in-depth knowledge to make an efficient decision for autonomous vehicles. This paper aims to cluster a wide range of driving encounter scenarios based only on multi-vehicle GPS trajectories. Towards this end, we propose a generic unsupervised learning framework comprising of two layers: feature representation layer and clustering layer. In the feature representation layer, we combine the deep autoencoders with a distance-basedmeasure tomapthe sequential observations of driving encounters into a computationally tractable space, which quantifies the spatiotemporal interaction characteristics of two vehicles. The clustering algorithm is then applied to the extracted representations to cluster homogeneous driving encounters into groups. Our proposed generic framework is then evaluated using 2,568 naturalistic driving encounters. Experimental results show that our proposed generic framework incorporated with unsupervised learning can cluster multi-trajectory data into distinct groups. These clustering results could benefit the decision-making and design of autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper addresses an automation method of underwater tasks using AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles). An AUV has a small agent vehicle to connect to an underwater docking station which is connected with operators. If the agent docks, the operator can fully monitor and control the AUV as an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicles). Under human supervision, it can carry out complicated tasks such as underwater manipulations. If the agent undocks and is recovered, the AUV navigates as an untethered vehicle. In order to evaluate the proposed docking system, an experimental agent and a docking device were developed. For efficient and reliable docking, a visual landmark and a smart cable-based docking method were developed. A preliminary docking test was carried out at an indoor tank to evaluate the proposed docking system.

AB Previous empirical behavior analysis on Autonomous Vehicles (AV) mainly focused on vehicles with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system due to the lack of high-level AV dataset. Recently released SAE Level-4 AV datasets such as the Waymo Open Dataset provide great opportunities to evaluate their behavioral impact on traffic flow. In this study, we aim to characterize the empirical Car Following (CF) behaviors of the Waymo autonomous vehicle and compare its feature with human-driven Vehicles (HV), and capture such behavioral differences using the IDM CF model. Our main findings include: (a) AV is much safer than HV, based on our analysis using surrogate safety measures, as time headways and jam spacings of the AV are significantly larger than HV; (b) the response time of AV is also significantly larger than that of HV in response to various types of stimuli; (c) despite the short length of trajectories in the Waymo Open Dataset, we have confirmed that these trajectories are suitable for calibrating some of the IDM parameters; and the calibration results of IDM are consistent with our empirical analysis. Moreover, the modelling results, reveal that the proportion of string unstable behavior of AV is less than that of HV; and (d) for HV, there is generally no significant difference between following AV and following HV except a smaller jam spacing when following AV. Overall, we conclude that currently AV behaves in a conservative way to ensure its safety at the cost of traffic efficiency.

AB Parking control problems remain to be fully solved for autonomous vehicles. Existing approaches usually first design a reference parking trajectory that does not exactly match vehicle dynamic constraints and then apply certain online negative feedback control to make the vehicle roughly track this reference trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory planning method that directly links the actual parking trajectories and the steering actions to find the best parking trajectory. Tests show that this new approach has high reliability and less computation cost. Moreover, we also discuss how to counter with trajectory planning errors that are caused by model uncertainty in this paper. We show that an appropriate combination of feedforward trajectory planning and online feedback control can solve such problems.

We not only comprehensively summarize the trajectory planning, space exploration, optimization, and other challenges encountered but also present the possible directions for future work. Because a detailed study like this is uncommon in the literature, an attempt has been made to fill the gap for readers interested in path planning. This paper also includes optimization strategies that can be used to implement terrestrial, underwater, and airborne applications. This study addresses numerical, bio-inspired, and hybrid methodologies for each dimension described. Throughout this study, we endeavored to establish a centralized platform in which a wealth of research on autonomous vehicles (on the land and their trajectory optimizations), airborne vehicles, and underwater vehicles, is published.

AB Human-driven and autonomously driven cars of today act often reactively to the decisions of the cars they follow, which could lead to uncomfortable, inefficient, and sometimes unsafe situations in stop and go traffic. This paper proposes methods for probabilistic anticipation of the motion of the preceding vehicle and for the control of motion of the ego vehicle. We construct: 1) a Markov chain predictor based on the observed behavior of preceding vehicle and 2) a maximum likelihood motion predictor based on historical traffic speed at different locations and times. Heuristics are proposed for combining the two predictions to determine a probability distribution on the position of the preceding vehicle over a future planning horizon. A chance-constrained model predictive control framework is employed to optimize the motion of the ego vehicle, given the probabilistic prediction of motion of preceding vehicle.

AB The underwater environment severely constrains robotic navigation and communications, making the use of traditional multi-robot control and coordination schemes very difficult. These challenges are exacerbated on a new generation of low-cost autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that lack a Doppler velocity log, acoustic modem, or high-end inertial sensors typically used for underwater robotic navigation and communications. This letter demonstrates multi-robot operations for low-cost AUVs via a novel and user-friendly operating paradigm that allows intuitive command and control of an AUV group. Each vehicle is equipped with a low-power and inexpensive acoustic system for navigation and receipt of operator commands. This system consists of a passive array of hydrophones and a timed acquisition and data processing stack that allows each AUV to self-localize relative to a time-synchronized acoustic beacon. Switching between different operational "modes" on the beacon causes it to broadcast different acoustic signals which, when received by the AUVs, result in the vehicles switching between different autonomous behaviors. These behaviors are defined in a beacon-centric coordinate system using pre-defined parameters unique to each vehicle; as a result, the movement of the beacon itself allows the operator to control the group-wide movement of all vehicles concurrently. This letter presents field experiments with three SandShark AUVs in which operational mode and beacon movement were controlled by an operator. However, by installing the beacon on an autonomous vehicle, this paradigm would provide a method for remote command and control of an arbitrarily large number of miniature, low-cost AUVs, without the need for sophisticated navigational sensors or acoustic modems.

AB This paper addresses the design of time-varying model predictive control of an autonomous vehicle in the presence of input rate constraints such that closed-loop stability is guaranteed. Stability is proved via Lyapunov techniques by adding a terminal state constraint and a terminal cost to the controller formulation. The terminal set is the maximum positive invariant set of a multi-plant description of the vehicle linear time-varying model. The terminal cost is an upper-bound on the infinite cost-to-go incurred by applying a linear-quadratic regulator control law. The proposed control design is experimentally tested and successfully stabilizes an autonomous Scania construction truck in an obstacle avoidance scenario.

AB Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS) are currently evolving in the form of a cooperative ITS or connected vehicles. Both forms use the data communications between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I/I2V) and other on-road entities, and are accelerating the adoption of self-driving cars. The development of cyber-physical systems containing advanced sensors, sub-systems, and smart driving assistance applications over the past decade is equipping unmanned aerial and road vehicles with autonomous decision-making capabilities. The level of autonomy depends upon the make-up and degree of sensor sophistication and the vehicle's operational applications. As a result, self-driving cars are being compromised perceived as a serious threat. Therefore, analyzing the threats and attacks on self-driving cars and ITSs, and their corresponding countermeasures to reduce those threats and attacks are needed. For this reason, some survey papers compiling potential attacks on VANETs, ITSs and self-driving cars, and their detection mechanisms are available in the current literature. However, up to our knowledge, they have not covered the real attacks already happened in self-driving cars. To bridge this research gap, in this paper, we analyze the attacks that already targeted self-driving cars and extensively present potential cyber-attacks and their impacts on those cars along with their vulnerabilities. For recently reported attacks, we describe the possible mitigation strategies taken by the manufacturers and governments. This survey includes recent works on how a self-driving car can ensure resilient operation even under ongoing cyber-attack. We also provide further research directions to improve the security issues associated with self-driving cars.

AB For advanced active safety systems and autonomous vehicles, it is essential to predict target vehicle behaviors. Radar is a reliable vehicular sensor, but it has a degree of measurement uncertainty because of its operational mechanism and wandering reflection point. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a radar accuracy model for object vehicle tracking to reduce the tracking error of the radar system. First, we divide the area uniformly and identify the surrounding vehicles using information, including relative position and relative velocity.We then analyze the error characteristics of each uniformly divided area. Next, we develop an occupancy zone-based Kalman filter for each area based on the error characteristics. We solve the problem that one cannot assign an exact zone for the object vehicle due to radar error by using interacting multiple model (IMM) filter. The performance of the proposed method is validated via experiments using radar and ground truth data.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB In complex driving scenarios, automated vehicles should behave reasonably and respond adaptively with high computational efficiency. In this paper, a computational efficient motion planning method is proposed, which considers traffic interaction and accelerates calculation. Firstly, the behavior is decided by connecting the points on the unequally divided road segments and lane centerlines, which simplifies the decision-making process in both space and time span. Secondly, as the dynamic vehicle model with changeable longitudinal velocity is considered in the trajectory generation module, the C/GMRES algorithm is used to accelerate the calculation of trajectory generation and realize on-line solving in nonlinear model predictive control. Meanwhile, the motion of other traffic participants is more accurately predicted based on the driver's intention and kinematics vehicle model, which enables the host vehicle to obtain a more reasonable behavior and trajectory. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Future networks require real-time control capability to support delay-sensitive application such as connected autonomous vehicles. In recent years, fog computing becomes an emerging technology to deal with the insufficiency in traditional cloud computing. In this paper, a fog-based distributed network control design is proposed toward connected and automated vehicle application. The proposed architecture combines VANETs with the new fog paradigm to enhance the connectivity and collaboration among distributed vehicles. A case study of connected cruise control (CCC) is introduced to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture and control design. Finally, we discuss some future research directions and open issues to be addressed.

AB We present a cascades-based controller for the problem of formation-tracking control in a group of autonomous vehicles. We consider general models composed of a velocity kinematics equation and a generic force-balance equation. For each vehicle, a local controller ensures tracking of a reference generated by a leader vehicle. One or many vehicles may have access to the reference trajectories; each robot has one leader only, but may have several followers (spanning-tree topology). We establish uniform global asymptotic stability in a closed loop for a wide class of controllers. Our analysis relies on the construction of an original strict Lyapunov function for the position tracking error dynamics and an inductive argument based on the cascades-systems theory.

AB Advanced Vehicle Technologies (AVTs) have been purported to improve the behind-the-wheel experience of older adults (65+ years) by making driving safer, easier, and more enjoyable. The autonomous vehicle, in particular, is viewed as a promising innovation for those in older age groups. However, little is known about how older adults perceive AVTs as well as their attitudes, concerns, and willingness to use different levels of vehicular automation. Using the results of an online survey of 1000 Canadians aged 65 and older (who live in the Greater Golden Horseshoe Region, Southern Ontario, Canada), this paper aims to identify and quantify key factors that can affect older adults' willingness to use vehicles with different levels of automation (e.g., semi vs. fully autonomous vehicles; SAV/FAV). Underlying this objective is a need to examine older adults' preferences and concerns for using emerging automotive technologies. Using factor analysis and structural equation modeling, several factors were also identified that can influence older adults' openness to use SAV/FAV including the perception that the AVTs would actually assist with performing driving-related tasks, participant concerns about using SAV/FAV (mainly concerns about inadequate testing on SAV/FAV and being legally responsible if SAV/FAV technology failure causes an accident), using automobile as a passenger, gender, level of education, and the need for assistance with driving. Moreover, almost two thirds of participants reported having concerns about liability if an AVT failed resulting in a crash. Findings of this study provide decision makers and car manufacturing companies with valuable insights regarding older adults' willingness and needs to use SAV/FAV.

AB Structured and unstructured uncertainties together with external disturbances may pose considerable challenges in realizing desired path-tacking and lane keeping of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel robust adaptive indirect control method based on an exponential-like-sliding-mode fuzzy type-2 neural network approach for enhanced path-tracking performance of road autonomous vehicles subject to parametric uncertainties related to vehicle nominal cornering stiffness, road-tire adhesion coefficient, inertial parameters, and forward speed. A hierarchical controller is designed and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured along with deriving the adaptation laws by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem. The conventional reaching law related to the sliding mode degrades from the system stability and introduces an inherent chattering of the controller input. The convergence law for the sliding surface is adjusted based on a variable exponential sliding manifold to eliminate possible chattering in the buffeting switch zone near the origin. The proposed exponential-like sliding surface guarantees the swift and smooth global asymptotic convergence of the tracking error toward zero. Furthermore, an adaptive look-ahead path-tracking error term is introduced as an auxiliary error criterion to improve the vehicle path-tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified through Matlab/Simulink-CarSim co-simulations and comparisons with selected reported control methods for two different road maneuvers. The results suggested substantially improved tracking performance by the proposed controller with robustness to withstand against the perturbed parameters and external disturbances.

AB This paper investigates the path tracking control problem of autonomous vehicles subject to modelling uncertainties and external disturbances. The problem is approached by employing a 2-degree of freedom vehicle model, which is reformulated into a newly defined parametric form with the system uncertainties being lumped into an unknown parametric vector. On top of the parametric system representation, a novel robust adaptive learning control (RALC) approach is then developed, which estimates the system uncertainties through iterative learning while treating the external disturbances by adopting a robust term. It is shown that the proposed approach is able to improve the lateral tracking performance gradually through learning from previous control experiences, despite only partial knowledge of the vehicle dynamics being available. It is noteworthy that a novel technique targeting at the non-square input distribution matrix is employed so as to deal with the under-actuation property of the vehicle dynamics, which extends the adaptive learning control theory from square systems to non-square systems. Moreover, the convergence properties of the RALC algorithm are analysed under the framework of Lyapunov-like theory by virtue of the composite energy function and the lambda-norm. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by representative simulation examples and comparisons with existing methods.

AB The implementation of autonomous delivery solutions in last-mile logistics operations is considered promising. Autonomous delivery solutions can help in tackling urban challenges related to last-mile logistics operations. Urbanization creates higher mobility and transportation demand, which contributes to increased congestion levels, traffic, air pollution, and accident rates. Moreover, mega-trends, such as e-commerce, demand that logistics companies react to increased customer expectations in terms of delivery time and service. Concerning service, electrified autonomous delivery solutions have the potential to operate 24/7 and can help to overcome driver shortages. This paper conducts a systematic literature review. Based on the literature set, a snowballing procedure was applied. Complementary gray literature was included. This work discusses different autonomous delivery solutions such as Autonomous Delivery Robots (ADRs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), two- or multi-tiered systems, and the concept of passenger and freight integration. The work presents advantages and disadvantages, enabling the comparison of solutions. Furthermore, a research agenda is provided, from which practical-managerial and theoretical implications can be derived. The research agenda can help researchers, manufacturers, businesses, and governmental institutions to prepare for the arrival and subsequent implementation of autonomous delivery services. Various implications related to energy demand, legislation, implementation strategy, training, and risk and safety are presented. The outcome of this work calls for collaboration among various stakeholders, encourages mutual learning, and hints at the importance of national and international development projects.

AB Controlling the water quality of water supplies has always been a critical challenge, and water resource monitoring has become a need in recent years. Manual monitoring is not recommended in the case of large water surfaces for a variety of reasons, including expense and time consumption. In the last few years, researchers have proposed the use of autonomous vehicles for monitoring tasks. Fleets or swarms of vehicles can be deployed to conduct water resource explorations by using path planning techniques to guide the movements of each vehicle. The main idea of this work is the development of a monitoring system for Ypacarai Lake, where a fleet of autonomous surface vehicles will be guided by an improved particle swarm optimization based on the Gaussian process as a surrogate model. The purpose of using the surrogate model is to model water quality parameter behavior and to guide the movements of the vehicles toward areas where samples have not yet been collected; these areas are considered areas with high uncertainty or unexplored areas and areas with high contamination levels of the lake. The results show that the proposed approach, namely the enhanced GP-based PSO, balances appropriately the exploration and exploitation of the surface of Ypacarai Lake. In addition, the proposed approach has been compared with other techniques like the original particle swarm optimization and the particle swarm optimization with Gaussian process uncertainty component in a simulated Ypacarai Lake environment. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed enhanced GP-based PSO in terms of mean square error with respect to the other techniques.

AB Multimedia has played an indispensable role in the success of various real-world applications, from smart healthcare to intelligent surveillance systems. In this new era of technology, one of these essential and useful applications is autonomous driving or self-driving cars. The idea of driverless vehicles was introduced many years ago when autopilot systems were designed for airplanes. However, over the past few years, there have been incredible advances in autonomous driving, thanks to new technologies in multimedia and artificial intelligence. In particular, multimedia research using a broad range of techniques such as machine learning, computer vision, audio processing, simulation systems, robotics, and big data has significantly enhanced and expedited the autonomous driving technology over time. In addition to the main applications of self-driving cars such as autonomous delivery vehicles, taxis, and freight trucks, the autonomous driving technology can provide many opportunities in military, constructions, healthcare, and emergency management. Despite the effectiveness and efficiency that self-driving cars bring to the future of transportation, many challenges remain that need to be solved before fully-autonomous driving becomes a reality.

AB Automobile manufacturers, alongside technology providers, researchers, and public agencies, are conducting extensive testing to design autonomous vehicles (AVs) algorithms that will provide a complete understanding of road users, specifically pedestrians. Pedestrian behavior and actions determination are highly unpredictable depending on behavioral beliefs, context, and socio-demographic variables. Context includes everything that potentially affects one's behavior; in AVs-pedestrian interaction, context may consist of weather conditions, road structure, social factors norms, and traffic volume. These influencing elements, therefore, need to be focused on during the development of pedestrian interaction algorithms. For this purpose, the pedestrian behavior questionnaire for FAVs (PBQF) is designed based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A total of almost 1000 voluntary participants completed this multilingual survey. As socio-demographic values and physiological perception varies with local norms, regions, and ethnicity, participants from 27 countries were therefore chosen to account for this variation. One of the key findings of this study is the influence of pedestrian attributes and the context on pedestrian behavior. Pedestrian action cannot be understood without visual observation of the pedestrian themselves and their context. The findings showed that pedestrians build communication with vehicles based on their driving styles. The vehicle's driving style leads pedestrians to think that the vehicle is human-driven or autonomous. The results also revealed that pedestrians use several cues to show their intention. The general perception of AVs was also analyzed, and the communication between AVs and pedestrians with different displaying options was investigated.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will soon become the primary means of transportation for millions of people. However, the introduction of these vehicles may lead to increased traffic and changes in people's travel patterns. To address this issue, one solution is to promote the use of AVs in a shared and public manner. However, the success of this approach depends on public acceptance of public AVs. If the promoters of public AVs are unaware of how people perceive this technology, it is possible that these vehicles will face failure in the market. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the factors that influence the willingness to use public AVs. To achieve this, an autonomous public van acceptance model (APVAM) was developed by adapting the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) through structural equations modeling. In this study, 824 citizens of Tehran participated in a field study and completed an online questionnaire. The research results indicated that the variable of effort expectancy indirectly affects the use of autonomous public vans (APVs), while the variables of performance expectancy, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, and perceived PUnTrust directly affect their use. The research also found that various factors such as gender, level of education, individualism/collectivism, travel purpose, the dominant travel mode, marital status, occupation, age, household wealth, number of vehicles owned, and the price of the current vehicle of the household have a moderating effect on the APVAM. Furthermore, it was revealed that individuals who primarily use personal or public transport for their daily trips are more influenced by the perceived enjoyment of APVs in increasing their willingness to use these vehicles, compared to those whose predominant mode of travel is walking or cycling.

AB This article presents a cooperative manoeuvre among three dual mode cars - vehicles equipped with sensors and actuators, and that can be driven either manually or autonomously. One vehicle is driven autonomously and the other two are driven manually. The main objective is to test two decision algorithms for priority conflict resolution at intersections so that a vehicle autonomously driven can take their own decision about crossing an intersection mingling with manually driven cars without the need for infrastructure modifications. To do this, the system needs the position, speeds, and turning intentions of the rest of the cars involved in the manoeuvre. This information is acquired via communications, but other methods are also viable, such as artificial vision. The idea of the experiments was to adjust the speed of the manually driven vehicles to force a situation where all three vehicles arrive at an intersection at the same time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB One of the most fundamental problems in the development of an intelligent highway system or an autonomous mobile robot system for factory use is to find the necessary input control variables for smooth and safe movement of the vehicle, or robot, between any two configurations. In this paper it is demonstrated that this problem can be converted into one of finding a fitting function which satisfies the boundary conditions. Three curves, a quintic polynomial, a cubic polynomial and a triangular function are developed to perform the parallel transfer manoeuvre which forms the basis of several important manoeuvres such as reverse parking, moving off, negotiating a stationary obstacle, overtaking a moving vehicle, and changing lane. A detailed discussion of the effect of the vehicle's steering angle limit on the feasibility of these manoeuvres is presented. Simulation results using three typical vehicles, a long commercial vehicle, an ordinary car, and a small laboratory robot, travelling along three curves are also presented and discussed. Based on the comparative study, some suggestions for further work are made. Compared with other methods, this approach is simple and provides excellent simulation of human driver techniques. The paper concludes with a focused discussion about the intergration of these techniques with satellite based GPS systems for automated vehicle guidance on highways.

TI Torque-Vectoring-Based Backup Steering Strategy for Steer-by-Wire
   Autonomous Vehicles With Vehicle Stability Control
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; optimal control; stability; steering systems;
   vehicle safety
AB Steer-by-wire (SBW) systems provide significant benefits to classical vehicles, and are indispensable for fully autonomous vehicles (AVs). A backup (emergency) strategy is needed to steer an AV equipped with SBW to safety if its steering actuator fails completely. Differential drive assisted steering (DDAS), which uses torque vectoring(TV) to steer a vehicle in the absence of a steering actuator, has been proposed as a backup strategy for SBW systems. However, vehicle stability control (VSC) - a required feature in most modern vehicles-also relies on TV to assist vehicles in maintaining stability. In this paper, it is shown through stability analyses on a linearized vehicle model that VSC enhances the stability of an AV equipped with a fully functional SBW system. Conversely, when combined with DDAS as a backup steering strategy for a failed SBW system, VSC typically deteriorates stability. Thus, the benefits of VSC in ensuring stability cannot be taken for granted for AVs, e.g., by designing it as a decoupled controller added on to DDAS. Instead, VSC and DDAS must be designed in an integrated manner to guarantee stability. To support this finding, simulations are conducted where a nonlinear AV model with either SBW or DDAS - both combined with VSC and implemented via model predictive control-are used to carry out an ISO - standard double lane change test at 80 km/h. Using the SBW system, the AV passes the test, both with VSC decoupled from and integrated with the SBW system. However, in the case of SBW failure, the AV with VSC decoupled from DDAS fails the test, while that with VSC integrated with DDAS completes the test successfully.

AB Path following and lateral stability are crucial issues for autonomous vehicles. Moreover, these problems increase in complexity when handling articulated heavy-duty vehicles due to their poor manoeuvrability, large sizes and mass variation. In addition, uncertainties on mass may have the potential to significantly decrease the performance of the system, even to the point of destabilising it. These parametric variations must be taken into account during the design of the controller. However, robust control techniques usually require offline adjustment of auxiliary tuning parameters, which is not practical, leading to sub-optimal operation. Hence, this paper presents an approach to path-following and lateral control for autonomous articulated heavy-duty vehicles subject to parametric uncertainties by using a robust recursive regulator. The main advantage of the proposed controller is that it does not depend on the offline adjustment of tuning parameters. Parametric uncertainties were assumed to be on the payload, and an H-infinity controller was used for performance comparison. The performance of both controllers is evaluated in a double lane-change manoeuvre. Simulation results showed that the proposed method had better performance in terms of robustness, lateral stability, driving smoothness and safety, which demonstrates that it is a very promising control technique for practical applications.

ID INTEGRATED NAVIGATION
AB Nowadays, many precision farming applications rely on the use of GNSS-RTK. However, when it comes to autonomous agricultural vehicles, GNSS cannot be used as a stand-alone system for positioning. To ensure high availability and robustness of the positioning solution, GNSS-RTK must be fused with additional sensors. This paper presents a novel sensor fusion algorithm tailored to tracked agricultural vehicles. GNSS-RTK, an IMU and wheel speed sensors are fused in an error-state Kalman filter to estimate position and attitude of the vehicle. An odometry model for tracked vehicles is introduced which is used to propagate the filter state. By using both IMU and wheel speed sensors, specific motion characteristics of tracked vehicles such as slippage can be included in the dynamic model. The presented sensor fusion algorithm is tested at a composting site using a tracked compost turner. The sensor measurements are recorded using the Robot Operating System (ROS). To analyze the achievable accuracies for position and attitude of the vehicle, a precise reference trajectory is measured using two robotic total stations. The resulting trajectory of the error-state filter is then compared to the reference trajectory. To analyze how well the proposed error-state filter is suited to bridge GNSS outages, GNSS outages of 30 s are simulated in post-processing. During these outages, the vehicle's state is propagated using the wheel speed sensors, IMU, and the dynamic model for tracked vehicles. The results show that after 30 s of GNSS outage, the estimated horizontal position of the vehicle still has a sub-decimetre accuracy.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the capability to acquire real-time information from each other while human-driven vehicles (HVs) are standalone in the vehicle roadway navigation system. The information asymmetry poses significant challenges in managing and controlling vehicles in mixed traffic. To address such challenges, this study first customises the intelligent driver model to describe the car-following behaviour of CAVs. Furthermore, to raise the traffic efficiency of the mixed traffic flow, a new lane-changing decision support algorithm is proposed, which incorporates the interaction between CAVs and HVs by controlling the speed and locating the lane of CAVs. In addition to the common indexes of outflow and travel time to be used to measure the travel efficiency, new parameters such as platoon intensity and single rate are defined to evaluate the CAV platooning capability. Through simulation tests, the proposed controlling framework is implemented for a two-lane (per direction) freeway segment under different CAV penetration rates and input volumes. The simulation results indicate that, at all the CAV penetration levels, the proposed controlling algorithm provides significant performance improvements to the whole mixed traffic flow in terms of outflow, travel time, and the number of CAV platoons.

AB The cell transmission model (CTM) is important for solving macroscopic traffic problems. Although some studies have been conducted for multiclass CTM, a simplified CTM for traffic flow mixed with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is still needed. This paper extends the homogenous CTM to form a mixed CTM under different CAV market penetration rates. To deal with this, the mixed triangular fundamental diagram is derived with different proportions of various vehicle types. The maximum capacity and backward wave speed of the mixed traffic flow are described by vehicle class proportions. Based on the mixed triangular fundamental diagram, the mixed CTM is proposed for different CAV penetration rates. An example application to validate the usefulness of the proposed mixed CTM is carried out. The mixed traffic flow in the application consists of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), adaptive cruise control (ACC), and human vehicles with random vehicle orders. It is defined that CAVs travel under ACC when following a human vehicle without vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Otherwise, the CACC function applies. The expected proportions of the CACC, ACC, and human vehicles in the random mixed traffic flow are described by the CAV penetration rate. Mixed CTM numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the impacts of traffic accidents under different CAV penetration rates. Moreover, car-following simulations are performed to show consistency between macroscopic CTM numerical experiments and microscopic car-following simulations. The example application reveals that the proposed mixed CTM is simple and practical as applied to solve the traffic problem under different CAV penetration rates.

AB Path planning and path following are key technologies for autonomous vehicles. Strong nonlinearity, coupling characteristics, parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and complicated driving scenarios put forward great challenges in estimation, control, and optimization of autonomous vehicles. Multi-dimension information utilization offers an effective solution to cope with the foregoing challenges. The presented research proposes a path planning and tracking framework for optimal design and regulation of control variables for collision avoidance and active guidance system, aiming to improve tracking performance and system robustness. For path planning approach, a virtual harmful potential field in 3 dimension (3D) is built to provide a collision-free trajectory as a reference path for path following, depending on vehicle kinematic model and boundary conditions of roads. A linear parameter-varying, polytopic vehicle lateral model is developed to address the issues of time-variable longitudinal speeds and preview distance on vehicle lateral stability management. Further, a strong robust gain-scheduling path following control approach based on linear matrix inequality methodology is proposed to tackle problems relating to characteristics of temporal variations, parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Comparisons study under the TruckMaker/Xpack4-RapidECU joint HIL platform demonstrate that both tracking precision and high robustness to parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are superior than model predictive control method. The presented path following method provides an important insight into exploiting the robust control method's favorable merits while guaranteeing its computing efficiency.

AB Self-driving vehicles are posing new challenges as the automation level defined in the SAE International standards for autonomous driving is increased. A pivotal task in autonomous driving is building a perception of the surrounding environment using optical sensors, which is a long-standing challenge and prompts us to explore the utilization of various sensors. Radar is an older and cheaper type of sensor than alternatives such as lidar for long-range distance coverage, and it is also competitively reliable and robust in adverse weather conditions. However, sparse data and noise are inherent challenges of radar. This study explores the dynamic Gaussian process for occupancy mapping and predicting a drivable path for a self-driving vehicle within the field of view (FOV) of a radar sensor. Gaussian occupancy mapping does not need abundant data for training and is a promising alternative to data-reliant deep learning techniques. The proposed technique optimizes parameters (variational and kernel-based) of the Gaussian process to determine the allowed region within the FOV limits by means of stochastic selection of functional points (pseudoinput) and tuning of threshold values. We have tested the proposed technique in experiments performed under different environmental conditions, such as various road and traffic conditions and diverse weather and illumination conditions. The results verify the efficacy of the proposed technique in diverse weather conditions for finding a drivable path for a self-driving vehicle, with the additional benefits of requiring only a low-cost apparatus and providing coverage of a long distance range.

AB Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are going to share the road environment with human drivers until their full market deployment achievement. In this context, this paper tackles and solves the problem of decentralized crossing at unsignalized intersections for mixed traffic flows, composed of both connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs) and CAVs. To this aim, a novel cooperative fully-distributed control protocol for CAVs is proposed, augmenting the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) action based on proximity sensors measurements, with an additional networked protocol exploiting Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) information for the cooperative evaluation of the Time-to-Intersection of all incoming vehicles within the communication range. This further collaborative action automatically adapts the CAVs motion at intersection avoiding both collisions with other vehicles and intersection deadlocks, while improving the intersection throughput. Safety and mobility performances are evaluated via the purposely designed Virtual Testing platform - Mixed Traffic Simulator (MiTraS)- combining the Matlab/Simulink environment with the SUMO traffic simulator. The analysis is carried out for an exemplary two-lane four-way unsignalized intersection considering both different traffic demands and different CAVs penetration rates. The unavoidable presence of variable delays in information delivery due to the wireless communication network has been also explicitly accounted for in both control design and validation. The extensive simulation analysis confirms how the inclusion of CAVs, equipped with the proposed control algorithm, within the mixed traffic flow strongly improves both the safety and mobility performances of the intersection. Lastly, we disclose how the benefits of the proposed controller increase with CAV penetration.

AB Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is an innovative concept for directing vehicles through the intersections. AIM assumes that the vehicles negotiate the right-of-way. This assumption makes the problem of the intersection management significantly different from the usually studied ones such as the optimization of the cycle time, splits, and offsets. The main difficulty is to define a strategy that improves the traffic efficiency. Indeed, due to the fact that each vehicle is considered individually, AIM faces a combinatorial optimization problem that needs quick and efficient solutions for a real time application. This paper proposes a strategy that evacuates vehicles as soon as possible for each sequence of vehicle arrivals. The dynamic programming (DP) that gives the optimal solution is shown to be greedy. A combinatorial explosion is observed if the number of lanes rises. After evaluating the time complexity of the DP, the paper proposes an ant colony system (ACS) to solve the control problem for large number of vehicles and lanes. The complete investigation shows that the proposed ACS algorithm is robust and efficient. Experimental results obtained by the simulation of different traffic scenarios show that the AIM based on ACS outperforms the traditional traffic lights and other recent traffic control strategies.

AB One challenging aspect of the connected and automated vehicle (CAV) operation in mixed traffic is the development of a situation-awareness module for CAVs. While operating on public roads, CAVs need to assess their surroundings, especially the intentions of non-CAVs. Generally, CAVs demonstrate a defensive driving behavior, and CAVs expect other nonautonomous entities on the road will follow the traffic rules or common driving behavior. However, the presence of aggressive human drivers in the surrounding environment, who may not follow traffic rules and behave abruptly, can lead to serious safety consequences. In this article, we have addressed the CAV and non-CAV interaction by evaluating a situation-awareness module for left-turning CAV operations in an urban area. Existing literature does not consider the intent of the following vehicle for a CAV's left-turning movement, and existing CAV controllers do not assess the following non-CAV's intents. Based on our simulation study, the situation-aware CAV controller module reduces up to 47% of the abrupt braking of the following non-CAVs for scenarios with different opposing through movement compared to the base scenario with the autonomous vehicle, without considering the following vehicle's intent. The analysis shows that the average travel time reductions for the opposite through traffic volumes of 600, 800, and 1000 vehicle/hour/lane are about 58%, 52%, and 62%, respectively, considering both scenarios for the aggressive human driver following the CAV if the following vehicle's intent is considered by a CAV in making a left-turn at an intersection.

AB This article describes an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) system designed to transport ISO standard cargo containers in port environments. The AGV consists of a large 17.5-ton chassis, which is driven and steered through a diesel-hydraulic power set The vehicle drives on pneumatic wheels over unprepared road surfaces as speeds up to 6 m/s. The navigation system is based on the use of millimeter-wave radar sensors detecting beacons placed at known locations in the environment. The navigation system reliably achieves accuracies of better than 3 cm. The planning and control systems allow the AGV to operate in the quay and yard area, to dock with gantry cranes, and to achieve a duty cycle comparable to that of a conventional manned vehicle. This article concentrates on describing three principal contributions of this work: the design of the overall vehicle and on-board systems architecture, the development of a navigation system appropriate for large, outdoor high-speed vehicles; and the experimental program leading to validation of the vehicle system.

AB With the development of commercialized autonomous vehicles (AVs), the interaction between AVs and human-driven vehicles has become increasingly important. Nevertheless, on the one hand, complex driver behaviors like distraction are hard to detect by AVs, which may lead to traffic accidents because of the late alert to the following vehicles. On the other hand, advanced techniques such as the real-time image or video processing and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications make it possible to let AVs receive monitoring signals from nearby vehicles, predict the latent risks, and make smart control to avoid the vehicles driven by distracted drivers. Hence, in this paper, we envisage a collaborative framework integrating human driver distraction monitoring, V2V communications, and AV velocity control. Then, we design the smart velocity control of AVs by taking into consideration the distraction behaviors of the drivers in the human-driven vehicles, and by formulating it as a feasible optimization problem based on model predictive control (MPC) strategies. Furthermore, we analyze the safety benefits that the collaborative framework could help improve on the condition of preserving traffic performance. Finally, we implement the contrast tests of real-time evaluation on driver distraction monitoring based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and perform simulations of smart velocity control strategies of the AV at avoiding the distracted driver and reducing rear-end collisions. Through the analysis and the simulations, we show our framework could increase the safety regions, reduce the rear-end collisions, and thus increase the safety of the whole transportation networks.

AB In presence of the emerging technology of automated vehicles, it is anticipated that the future traffic system would be comprised of mixed traffic with both self-driving autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven conventional vehicles. It is imperative to propose new traffic management measures to manage the future traffic system, as complement of the existing ones such as road pricing schemes. This study seeks to take advantage of the controllable property of AVs' routing choices to develop a day-to-day routing allocation scheme for a certain number of autonomous vehicles so as to drive the mixed traffic system into a desired traffic state. Specifically, we assume that all travelers are bounded rational and AV users are willing to accept route allocation with route travel cost not exceeding HV users' indifference band. Therefore, the best case bounded rationality user equilibrium (BRUE) flow pattern is in principle the most desirable traffic state out of all the BRUE solutions. This study proposes a day-to-day AVs' routing allocation scheme by which the traffic system would be directed to evolve towards the desired best case BRUE. The day-to-day traffic dynamics of HVs are proposed to follow a general framework, which can be further proved to be the BRUE rational behavior adjustment process (BRUE-RBAP). The condition for convergence is investigated under general assumptions. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this traffic management scheme.

AB Speed judgment is a vital component of autonomous driving perception systems. Automobile drivers were able to evaluate their speed as a result of their driving experience. However, driverless automobiles cannot autonomously evaluate their speed suitability through external environmental factors such as the surrounding conditions and traffic flows. This study introduced the parameter of overtaking frequency (OTF) based on the state of the traffic flow on both sides of the lane to reflect the difference between the speed of a driverless automobile and its surrounding traffic to solve the above problem. In addition, a speed evaluation algorithm was proposed based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. To train the LSTM model, we extracted OTF as the first observation variable, and the characteristic parameters of the vehicle's longitudinal motion and the comparison parameters with the leading vehicle were used as the second observation variables. The algorithm judged the velocity using a hierarchical method. We conducted a road test by using real vehicles and the algorithms verified the data, which showed the accuracy rate of the model is 93%. As a result, OTF is introduced as one of the observed variables that can support the accuracy of the algorithm used to judge speed.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential to solve many traffic problems, such as accidents, congestion and pollution. However, there are still challenges to overcome, for instance, AVs need to accurately perceive their environment to safely navigate in busy urban scenarios. The aim of this paper is to review recent articles on computer vision techniques that can be used to build an AV perception system. AV perception systems need to accurately detect non-static objects and predict their behaviour, as well as to detect static objects and recognise the information they are providing. This paper, in particular, focuses on the computer vision techniques used to detect pedestrians and vehicles. There have been many papers and reviews on pedestrians and vehicles detection so far. However, most of the past papers only reviewed pedestrian or vehicle detection separately. This review aims to present an overview of the AV systems in general, and then review and investigate several detection computer vision techniques for pedestrians and vehicles. The review concludes that both traditional and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for pedestrian and vehicle detection; however, DL techniques have shown the best results. Although good detection results have been achieved for pedestrians and vehicles, the current algorithms still struggle to detect small, occluded, and truncated objects. In addition, there is limited research on how to improve detection performance in difficult light and weather conditions. Most of the algorithms have been tested on well-recognised datasets such as Caltech and KITTI; however, these datasets have their own limitations. Therefore, this paper recommends that future works should be implemented on more new challenging datasets, such as PIE and BDD100K.

AB This paper proposes a new safety system named emergency steering assist (ESA), which consists of the autonomous steering subsystem and differential braking subsystem. The control system is developed to mediate the conflict objectives of vehicle stabilisation and rear-end collision avoidance in highway driving. Instead of predefining a collision-free trajectory in the entire process of collision avoidance, the process of collision avoidance is divided into two stages. In stage 1, where the vehicle is guided to enter the adjacent lane with a constant centripetal acceleration to avoid collision, the steering manoeuvre is determined by the feedforward controller based on the steering dynamics. In stage 2, where the vehicle is guided along the centreline of the adjacent lane, the steering manoeuvre is determined by the controller based on the theory of model predictive control. In addition, the differential braking subsystem is designed with a comprehensive treatment to the requirements of collision avoidance and vehicle stabilisation. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ESA system can effectively achieve better balance between an emergency collision avoidance manoeuvre and vehicle stabilisation at high speeds in different conditions. The hardware-in-the-loop experiment developed by the authors is used to validate the real-time performance and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; CONTROLLER
AB In the design of a path-tracking controller for autonomous vehicles, mediating the conflicting objectives among path-tracking, vehicle stabilisation, and low computational cost is a challenging issue. Accordingly, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based path-following controller with steering angle envelopes. In contrast to previous MPC-based structure, in which the constraints in terms of the road sides and lateral stabilisation directly impose on the algorithm, in the proposed approach, these aspects are formulated as the steering angle envelopes. This feature enables the controller to simultaneously ensure the tracking performance and computational feasibility. Moreover, considering the trade-off between path-tracking and vehicle stabilisation, the full-length prediction horizon pertaining to the steering angle envelopes are divided into two different parts: the safe road envelope is applied in the short-term, and the stable handling envelope is applied in other part. By modelling vehicles driving under different road conditions with various driving speeds and road adhesion values, the developed controller is compared with several existing control schemes via simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments. The comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in realising path-tracking, lateral stabilisation, and real-time computational capabilities in the best possible manner.

AB The investigation of factors contributing at making humans trust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will play a fundamental role in the adoption of such technology. The users ability to form a mental model of the AV, which is crucial to establish trust, depends on effective user-vehicle communication; thus, the importance of Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) is poised to increase. In this work, we propose a methodology to validate the user experience in AVs based on continuous, objective information gathered from physiological signals, while the user is immersed in a Virtual Reality-based driving simulation. We applied this methodology to the design of a head-up display interface delivering visual cues about the vehicles sensory and planning systems. Through this approach, we obtained qualitative and quantitative evidence that a complete picture of the vehicles surrounding, despite the higher cognitive load, is conducive to a less stressful experience. Moreover, after having been exposed to a more informative interface, users involved in the study were also more willing to test a real AV. The proposed methodology could be extended by adjusting the simulation environment, the HMI and/or the vehicles Artificial Intelligence modules to dig into other aspects of the user experience.

AB This paper focuses on the controller design for path-tracking problem of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) by employing a multi-constraint nonlinear predictive control (NMPC) schema. It is aimed to improve the transient performance of the vehicle and to consider a rollover prevention criterion in the proposed method. The path-tracking problem is transformed into the yaw stabilization issue, and a feedback control law with input saturation is developed to decrease the steady-state errors. Furthermore, the yaw-rate signal is generated for the desired path-tracking performance. The major contributions of the present paper are, first, developing a neural network autoregressive with exogenous input system to assist in obtaining an accurate and explicit model in order to contribute to the control of the system over the prediction horizon; second, describing a Frenet-Serret differential geometry based path-following agenda and developing AGV dynamic model by incorporating the vehicle vertical mode of motion to prevent vehicle rollover during critical maneuvers, and finally, achieving an enhanced yaw stabilization and transient tracking performance considering saturated input signal by employing the proposed system identification algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is verified by comparing with the traditional NMPC method by employing a high fidelity CarSim/MATLAB framework.

The TARP results in a constrained version of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW). As an approach to this problem, a cooperative algorithm with autonomous distributed agents has been proposed. The algorithm is able to plan deadlockfree routes even though the buffer capacity is less, but includes reformability at the point that computation time of that case increases drastically. This paper proposes an initial task assignment method to reduce computation time on planning routes. Results of computational experiments show effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) have received considerable attention in the past few decades, mainly because they play essential roles in broad marine applications such as environmental monitoring and resource exploration. Recent advances in the field of communication technologies, perception capability, computational power and advanced optimization algorithms have stimulated new interest in the development of AMVs. In order to deploy the constrained AMVs in the complex dynamic maritime environment, it is crucial to enhance the guidance and control capabilities through effective and practical planning, and control algorithms. Model predictive control (MPC) has been exceptionally successful in different fields due to its ability to sys-tematically handle constraints while optimizing control performance. This paper aims to provide a review of recent progress in the context of motion planning and control for AMVs from the perceptive of MPC. Finally, future research trends and directions in this substantial research area of AMVs are highlighted.

AB In this paper we study models and coordination policies for intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD), wherein a fleet of self-driving vehicles provides on-demand mobility jointly with public transit. Specifically, we first present a network flow model for intermodal AMoD, where we capture the coupling between AMoD and public transit and the goal is to maximize social welfare. Second, leveraging such a model, we design a pricing and tolling scheme that allows the system to recover a social optimum under the assumption of a perfect market with selfish agents. Third, we present real-world case studies for the transportation networks of New York City and Berlin, which allow us to quantify the general benefits of intermodal AMoD, as well as the societal impact of different vehicles. In particular, we show that vehicle size and powertrain type heavily affect intermodal routing decisions and, thus, system efficiency. Our studies reveal that the cooperation between AMoD fleets and public transit can yield significant benefits compared to an AMoD system operating in isolation, whilst our proposed tolling policies appear to be in line with recent discussions for the case of New York City.

AB In this paper, a human-like driving system is designed for autonomous vehicles (AVs), which aims to make AVs better integrate into the human transportation systems and mitigate misunderstanding and conflicts when interacting with human-driven vehicles. Based on the analysis of the real world INTERACTION dataset, a driving aggressiveness estimation model is established with the fuzzy inference approach. In the human-like lane-change decision-making algorithm, the cost function is designed comprehensively considering driving safety and travel efficiency. Based on the cost function with multi-constraint, a dynamic game algorithm is developed to model the interactions and decision making between AV and human-driven vehicles. Additionally, to guarantee the safety during lane-change of AVs, an artificial potential field model is built for collision risk assessment. Further, a human-like driving model is designed, which integrates the brain emotional learning circuit model (BELCM) with a two-point preview model. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated through human-in-the-loop experiments, and the results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In the planning stage of emerging mobility options, residents' stated preferences are important to understand the acceptability, co-existence, demand estimation, and utilization. Thus, this study applied Bayesian Networks (BN) on the survey data from Gilbert City, Arizona, to explore the residents' stated preferences for Autonomous vehicles (AVs). It further explored the AVs association with four mobility options - electric vehicles (EVs), electric scooters, and docked and dockless bikes. It was revealed that about 66 % of respondents who want AVs would use them, making about 34 % overestimation when want is used to estimate demand. Furthermore, respondents interested in using EV charging stations are also more likely to want the AVs in the city as well as use them. No significant difference was observed between docked and dockless bikes on wanting the AVs but on using them. Furthermore, respondents who would not use dockless bikes have the highest predicted percentage difference between wants and use of AVs. The joint analysis of the variable revealed that the highest prediction of using AVs is attained for male respondents who would use all emerging mobility options. The practical application of this study is presented along with recommendations to operators, city engineers, and planners.

AB In this paper, evolving Takagi-Sugeno (eTS) fuzzy driver model is proposed for simultaneous lateral and longitudinal control of a vehicle in a test track closed to traffic. The developed eTS fuzzy driver model can capture human operator's driving expertise for generating desired steering angle, throttle angle and brake pedal command values by processing only information which can be supplied by the vehicle's on-board control systems in real time. Apart from other fuzzy rule based (FRB) models requiring human expert knowledge or off-line clustering, the developed eTS driver model can adapt itself automatically, even 'from scratch', by an on-line learning process using eTS algorithm while human driver is supervising the vehicle. Proposed eTS fuzzy driver model's on-line human driver identification capability and autonomous vehicle driving performance were evaluated on real road profiles created by digitizing two different intercity express ways of Turkey in IPG (c) CarMaker (R) software. The training and validation simulation results demonstrated that eTS fuzzy driver model can be used in product development phase to speed up different tests via realistic simulations. Furthermore eTS fuzzy driver model has an application potential in the field of autonomous driving.

AB Now a days, the number of vehicles especially cars are increased day by day and the people expect sophistication with safety and they wish automation for the perfection by reducing their effort and to prevent damage from collision of the vehicle. Parking the vehicle has always been a big task for the drivers that lead to problems such as traffic, congestion, accident, pollution etc. In order to overcome the parking problem, an automatic steering, braking and accelerating system is proposed to park a vehicle in a stipulated area and also to enhance the parking in a safety and secured way. This paper is part of our research in designing a pallet over the automated vehicle. In this paper, an automatic parking system over the existing vehicles is proposed. The vehicle to be parked will be carried by the pallet over the proposed autonomous vehicle. A detailed design of automatic car parking system has been proposed with a working model. The proposed model is equipped with sensors and the controls such as steering, acceleration and braking are achieved with the major objectives such as safety and accuracy. The proposed autonomous parking vehicle is modeled. The micro controllers in the control systems are programmed. The working model was rigorously tested with all the possibilities including collision, speed, trajectory and efficient placement on the stipulated parking slot. The system has been analyzed against various parameters and found that more durable. The performance analysis has been made on the proposed model and shaft analysis is made with Ansys. The proposed geometric modeling ensures precision with safety.

DE Autonomous vehicles; Brakes; Emergency services; road surface
   classification; LiDAR; spatiotemporal architecture
AB This paper proposes a spatiotemporal architecture with a deep neural network (DNN) for road surface conditions and types classification using LiDAR for autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems. It is known that LiDAR provides information on the reflectivity and number of point clouds depending on a road surface. Thus, this paper utilizes the characteristics of LiDAR and the vehicle's speed obtained from in-vehicle sensors for classifying front road surface conditions for the AEB system application. First, we divided the front road area into four subregions to use spatial information from the vehicle's speed. Second, we constructed feature vectors using each subregion's reflectivity, number of point clouds, and in-vehicle information. Third, the DNN classifies road surface conditions and types for each subregion. Finally, the output of the DNN feeds into the spatiotemporal process to make the final classification reflecting vehicle speed and probability given by the outcomes of softmax functions of the DNN output layer. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed a comparative study with five other algorithms. With the proposed DNN, we obtained the highest accuracy of 98.0% and 98.6% for two subregions near the vehicle. In addition, we implemented the proposed method on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 board to confirm that it is applicable in real-time.

AB We investigate the effects of actuator and sensor bandwidths on robust stability of intelligent cruise control of autonomous vehicles with different feedback biasing strategies for two types of boundary conditions. The first one is a platoon of vehicles on an open stretch of highway, and the other one with periodic boundary conditions. The goal of the feedback is to maintain the same relative velocity and keep a certain safe distance between adjacent vehicles. We obtain in closed form the stability regions in the parameter space of the feedback gains for different biasing strategies of controllers. If there is biasing, it is shown that the two types of boundary conditions engender qualitative different stability characteristics: when the number of vehicles n is large, the robust stability in the case of periodic boundary conditions is much weaker than open boundary conditions. The spatially discrete model is approximated by a continuum model described by partial differential equations. The n-mode truncation of the continuum model and the spatially discrete model predict approximately the same region of stability for lower order modes, as well as the same qualitative features of overall stability region in the parameter space of feedback gains.

AB Taking advantage of available measurement in Internet of Things (IoT) for intelligent transportation systems, a sideslip angle estimation method for autonomous vehicles is presented and experimentally verified by fusing global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU), and by constructing an observability index (OI). The correlation between the vehicle sideslip error and the inertial navigation system (INS) heading error is presented first. Then, the observability for the heading error in a velocity-based Kalman filter is discussed and a novel index is defined to check the observability of the heading error. The course from a single antenna GNSS in an autonomous vehicle is augmented to estimate the heading error when the observability of the heading error is low. To reject the course measurement for scenarios that include sideslip movement, a binary hypothesis test approach is applied to indicate whether the vehicle is sidesliping. In addition, based on the OI and the sideslip indicator, a hybrid feedback strategy is designed for the heading error correction. To improve the convergence rate of the heading error in the velocity-based Kalman filter, a tuning strategy is presented. The stochastical observability of the designed Kalman observer is investigated for known and stochastic initial conditions. Finally, the proposed sideslip angle estimator is experimentally validated through a vehicle test platform in critical driving scenarios. The results confirm that the proposed OI can effectively identify when the heading error is observable, and also corroborate the effectiveness of the hybrid feedback strategy and adaptation method in the Kalman observer.

AB This paper proposes a novel integrated path following control scheme for a 4-Wheel Independent Drive (4WID) autonomous vehicle that can adaptively change its mechanism according to the driving conditions. The proposed integrated system handles the lateral steering controller, longitudinal speed, and yaw moment controls considering tire force capacity of each corner. For the lateral controller, the cornering stiffness uncertainties and the transient performance are considered and combined into an H infinity robust controller based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) theory. A super-twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) based longitudinal controller is designed to deal with disturbances and suppress chattering. When encountering extreme conditions, the active yaw moment controller with hierarchical structure is adaptively activated to prevent large deviation from the reference path and maintain the stability of vehicle. For the tire force allocation, an optimization algorithm is proposed, which has flexible equality constraints to coordinate the longitudinal and lateral motions according to the driving conditions. Simulations based on Carsim-Simulink co-simulation platform show that the proposed method is effective and has excellent performance in both normal and extreme driving conditions.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles promise to improve traffic safety, increase fuel efficiency and reduce congestion in future intelligent transportation systems. Ecological driving characteristics are first studied to concentrate on energy consumption, the ability to quickly pass its destination, etc. of autonomous electric vehicle plans (AEVPs) to maximize total energy efficiency benefits. To realize this goal, an optimal control model is developed to provide ecological driving suggestions to AEVPs. The Radau pseudospectral method (RPM) is adopted to put the optimal control model into nonlinear programs (NLP), and multiobjective optimization, including safety, economy and fast mobility, is considered, which conditions and constraints such as vehicle dynamics, traffic rules, and energy consumption. To enhance optimal model applicability, two ecological driving procedures are proposed. One procedure is that two-phase trajectory optimization and ecological driving states, such as velocity and acceleration, for the leading vehicle are developed according to RPM characteristics, while the other provides a set of targeted driving states to the following vehicles. The objective of the procedure is to minimize the total energy consumption of AEVPs, while travel comfort and safety are integrated into the schematization by optimization functions. Numerical experiments illustrate significance when ecological driving strategy for AEVPs considers energy consumption characteristics, thereby ensuring total energy consumption efficiency for AEVPs.

AB In this paper, we investigate the creation of an underwater acoustic network to support marine operations based on static and mobile nodes. Each underwater device combines communication, networking, and sensing capabilities and cooperates with the other devices in coordinated missions. The proposed system is built upon the SUNSET framework, providing acoustic communications and networking capabilities to autonomous underwater vehicles, autonomous surface vessels, and moored systems, using underwater acoustic modems. Specific solutions have been developed and tested to control the underwater nodes acoustically and to instruct the vehicles on keeping a given formation using acoustic links. One of the novelties of our approach has been the development and utilization of a realistic simulation infrastructure to provide a very accurate representation of all the dynamic systems involved in the network, modeling the vehicle dynamics, the acoustic channel, and the communication messages. This infrastructure has been extensively used to investigate and validate the proposed solutions under different environmental conditions before the actual deployment of devices. Several experiments were then conducted in the laboratory and in the field. The experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and the reliability of the proposed simulation framework in estimating system performance.

AB According to data gathered by the Korean National Police Agency, 1,028,777 vehicle-to-vehicle traffic accidents and 125,597 vehicle-to-pedestrian traffic accidents occurred in 2020. To decrease the occurrence possibility of traffic accidents, advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), which provides assistance in regions that drivers do not recognize, have attracted increasing interest. Among the representative functions of ADAS, autonomous emergency braking (AEB) is a valuable system for accident prevention and mitigation. In this study, to evaluate AEB by using dual cameras, actual vehicle tests were conducted. In addition, the theoretically calculated values, results obtained using dual cameras, and results obtained using measuring instruments were compared and analyzed. The result values using the proposed theoretical formula and those of the actual vehicle test using the measurement instruments were compared and analyzed. The minimum and maximum error rates were 0.11% and 4.45%, respectively. For results obtained using dual cameras and measurement instruments, the minimum and maximum error rates were 1.80% and 8.89%, respectively. In the development stage of ADAS especially when developing AEB system, the use of the theoretical formula and dual cameras can decrease the cost burden compared to that associated with testing.

DE autonomous vehicle; local path planning; Bi-RRT; path reorganization;
   path coherence
AB The existing variants of the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) cannot be effectively applied in local path planning of the autonomous vehicle and solve the coherence problem of paths between the front and back frames. Thus, an improved heuristic Bi-RRT algorithm is proposed, which is suitable for obstacle avoidance of the vehicle in an unknown dynamic environment. The vehicle constraint considering the driver's driving habit and the obstacle-free direct connection mode of two random trees are introduced. Multi-sampling biased towards the target state reduces invalid searches, and parent node selection with the comprehensive measurement index accelerates the algorithm's execution while making the initial path gentle. The adaptive greedy step size, introducing the target direction, expands the node more effectively. Moreover, path reorganization minimizes redundant path points and makes the path's curvature continuous, and path coherence makes paths between the frames connect smoothly. Simulation analysis clarifies the efficient performance of the proposed algorithm, which can generate the smoothest path within the shortest time compared with the other four algorithms. Furthermore, the experiments on dynamic environments further show that the proposed algorithm can generate a differentiable coherence path, ensuring the ride comfort and stability of the vehicle.

AB Accurate positioning, especially lateral positioning, is an essential requirement of autonomous driving. Although high accuracy vehicle positioning can be conducted in open-sky environments by global navigation satellite system (GNSS), the positioning accuracy cannot be guaranteed in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and tunnels. To solve this issue, inertial navigation systems, vehicle speed sensors, and vehicle motion constraints are often fused to mitigate positioning errors. However, this integration cannot meet the decimeter-level lateral positioning accuracy of autonomous vehicles' localization requirements. This article proposes a multi-information integration method aided by lane distance to further eliminate lateral error. In the proposed method, the lateral vehicle-to-lane distance measurements from camera-based systems, and the map-matching lane distance based on high-definition map were utilized to provide absolute lane distance measurement corrections in GNSS-denied environments. Field vehicular tests with low-cost integration systems were conducted to evaluate the navigation performance of the proposed multi-information integration method, and the results indicated that it is feasible for the proposed method to maintain continuous and reliable lateral positioning accuracy of better than 0.6 m under reliable lane line detection conditions in GNSS-denied environments.

AB This paper deals with the integration of robust bond-graph-model-based fault diagnosis (FD) with structural recoverability analysis and fault-tolerant control (FTC) of an intelligent heavy-size and autonomous vehicle, used for loading and routing 20- and 40-ft containers inside port terminals. The overactuated vehicle is an omnidirectional mobile platform with redundant actuators such as four independent driven wheels, four independent braking wheels, and four-wheel steering systems. The supervision system is able to monitor the health condition of the vehicle and to study the fault recoverability possibilities to reconfigure the control input when a fault occurs. For FD, analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) are derived from the bond graph model. The latter is constraint relations describing the nominal system behavior and is written in terms of the measured system variables. To perform robust FD, adaptive thresholds are generated. They consider modeling and measurement uncertainties. Once a fault is detected, the structural recoverability algorithm analyzes the redundancy presented on the system, and an appropriate control strategy is applied. The designed procedure of FD and FTC is validated by considering a multiple-fault scenario on the vehicle and comparing its results with the nominal case.

AB A novel potential field-based model curve fitting method (PF-MCF) is presented in this paper to handle emergency collision avoidance in waypoint tracking (following waypoints from a leading vehicle). It is reported that the PF has high performance on real-time obstacle avoidance in robotic path planning. However, some inherent limitations exist in the PF, such as no passage between closely spaced obstacles and oscillations in the presence of obstacles, which is rarely discussed in the research field of PF-based autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in waypoint tracking. To solve these problems, we propose the PF-MCF method to transform the clothoid curve into a quadratic programming form and solve the optimization under reasonable constraints to consider the different waypoints from the PF and the leading vehicle. The proposed PF-MCF method is validated via MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim to avoid multiple obstacle vehicles in waypoint tracking compared with the two latest methods (PF-based model predictive controller and PF-based curve fitting method). The simulation results confirm the efficiency of finding a passage in closely spaced obstacle vehicles and eliminating oscillations (under 0.5 [deg] in tire steering angle) in the presence of obstacles compared to other latest methods.

ID BUS PRIORITY; ALGORITHM
AB Numerous approaches have attempted to develop systems that more appropriately manage street crossings in cities in recent years. Solutions range from intelligent traffic lights to complex, centralized protocols that evaluate the policies that vehicles must comply with at intersections. Such works attempt to provide traffic-control strategies at intersections where the complexity of a dynamic environment, with vehicles crossing in different directions and multiple conflict points, pose a significant challenge for city traffic optimization. Traditionally, a traffic-control system at an intersection gives the green light to one lane while keeping the other lanes on red. But there may be situations in which there are different levels of vehicle priority; for example, emergency vehicles may have priority at intersections. Thus, this work proposes a distributed junction-management protocol that pays special attention to emergency vehicles. The proposed algorithm implements rules based on the distributed intersection management (DIM) protocol; such rules are used by vehicles while negotiating their crossing through the intersection. The proposal also seeks to affect the traffic flow of non-priority vehicles minimally. An evaluation and comparison of the proposed algorithm are presented in the paper.

AB The evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems in recent times necessitates the development of self-awareness in agents. Before the intensive use of Machine Learning, the detection of abnormalities was manually programmed by checking every variable and creating huge nested conditions that are very difficult to track. This paper aims to introduce a novel method to develop self-awareness in autonomous vehicles that mainly focuses on detecting abnormal situations around the considered agents. Multi-sensory time-series data from the vehicles are used to develop the data-driven Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) models used for future state prediction and the detection of dynamic abnormalities. Moreover, an initial level collective awareness model that can perform joint anomaly detection in co-operative tasks is proposed.
   The GNG algorithm learns the DBN models' discrete node variables; probabilistic transition links connect the node variables. A Markov Jump Particle Filter (MJPF) is applied to predict future states and detect when the vehicle is potentially misbehaving using learned DBNs as filter parameters.
   In this paper, datasets from real experiments of autonomous vehicles performing various tasks used to learn and test a set of switching DBN models. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is anticipated that the backbone of Smart Cities concerning automation and networking will be formed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the imminent future. Therefore, our research focuses on developing advanced microcontrollers embedded with Artificial Intelligence techniques for self-governing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The main objective of this research was to enable full automation for the execution of flight paths with non-trivial sequences that will be performed with centimetre-level accuracy. Also, by utilising dynamic flight plans and trajectories, we aim to secure autonomous aviation based on norms, with control loops and fundamental constraints. More specifically, we evolved a novel algorithmic technique for trajectory optimisation, which deploys a modification to the A* search algorithm, implemented by the Haversine formula and enhances accuracy using Vincenty's formula. Furthermore, realistic values for trajectory optimisation and obstacle avoidance were found through the implementation of a simulative investigation. The outcomes of our methodology indicate that the safety constraints associated with the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the urban environment can be significantly mitigated. Consequently, their effectiveness will be increased in realising their diverse operations and capabilities.

AB Estimating the fastest trajectory is one of the main challenges in autonomous vehicle research. It is fundamental that the vehicle determines its path not only to minimize travel time, but to arrive at the destination safely by avoiding any obstacles that may be in collision route. In this paper, we consider estimating the trajectory and acceleration functions of the trip simultaneously with an optimization objective function. By approximating the trajectory and acceleration function with B-splines, we transform an infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. Obstacle avoidance and kinematic constraints are carried out with the addition of a penalization function that penalizes trajectories and acceleration functions that do not satisfy the vehicles' constraints or that are in a collision route with other obstacles. Our approach is designed to model observations of the obstacles that contain measurement errors, which incorporates the realistic stochasticity of radars and sensors. We show that, as the number of observations increases, the estimated optimization function converges to the optimal one where the obstacles' positions are known. Moreover, we show that the estimated optimization function has a minimizer and that its minimizers converge to the minimizers of the optimization function involving the true threat zones.

AB We study the interaction between a fleet of electric self-driving vehicles servicing on-demand transportation requests (referred to as autonomous mobility-on-demand, or AMoD, systems) and the electric power network. We propose a joint model that captures the coupling between the two systems stemming from the vehicles' charging requirements, capturing time-varying customer demand, battery depreciation, and power transmission constraints. First, we show that the model is amenable to efficient optimization. Then, we prove that the socially optimal solution to the joint problem is a general equilibrium if locational marginal pricing is used for electricity. Finally, we show that the equilibrium can be computed by selfish transportation and generator operators (aided by a nonprofit independent system operator) without sharing private information. We assess the performance of the approach and its robustness to stochastic fluctuations in demand through case studies and agent-based simulations. Collectively, these results provide a first-of-a-kind characterization of the interaction between AMoD systems and the power network, and shed additional light on the economic and societal value of AMoD.

AB Due to the uncertainty of vehicle model parameters, modeling errors and external disturbances, the performance of path tracking control system is poor, especially under high velocity and large curvature extreme conditions. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel gain-scheduled robust control strategy based on linear parameter varying system with model predictive control (MPC) and H-infinity. Firstly, fully considering the influence of the time-varying characteristics of vehicle velocity and tire cornering stiffness on the path tracking system model, a novel linear parameter varying system model is built for path tracking control of autonomous vehicle. Then, a path tracking robust controller is designed based on gain-scheduled approach, and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) is applied to solve optimization problem, in which MPC and H-infinity robust control theory are applied to the controller design process. Finally, the simulation experiments have verified that the proposed novel robust control strategy can improve the path tracking accuracy and ensure the vehicle lateral and roll stability, especially under high velocity and large curvature extreme conditions. Meanwhile, the proposed robust controller shows superiority to suppress the parameters uncertainty, modeling error and external disturbance.

AB Locating the vehicle in its road is a critical part of any autonomous vehicle system and has been subject to different research topics. In most works presented in the literature, ego-localization is split into three parts: Road level-localization consisting in the road on which the vehicle travels, Lane level localization which is the lane on which the vehicle travels, and Ego lane level localization being the lateral position of the vehicle in the ego-lane. For each part, several researches have been conducted. However, the relationship between the different parts has not been taken into consideration. Through this work, an end-to-end ego-localization framework is introduced with two main novelties. The first one is the proposition of a complete solution that tackles every part of the ego-localization. The second one lies in the information-driven approach used. Indeed, we use prior about the road structure from a digital map in order to reduce the space complexity for the recognition process. Besides, several fusion framework techniques based on Bayesian Network and Hidden Markov Model are elaborated leading to an ego-localization method that is, to a large extent, robust to erroneous sensor data. The robustness of the proposed method is proven on different datasets in varying scenarios.

AB Path following is the basic technology of the autonomous vehicle (AV), many preview control methods have been widely applied to path following tasks. However, less of them take the variable vehicle velocities into account. In fact, the velocity is an important factor affecting the tracking accuracy. Especially, when an AV is in high velocity, it is not easy to achieve path following with high accuracy. To improve the adaptivity of path following in different velocities, an improved adaptive path following control system (PFCS) constructed by a course angle optimal referential model (CAORM) and a model predictive controller (MPC) is developed in this paper. The CAORM can provide the referential course angle, according to the vehicle longitudinal and lateral velocities, which significantly improves the adaptivity of the proposed PFCS in different velocities. And the CAORM is mainly implemented by a fuzzy inference system and a novel preview model, using human driving experience. The MPC is applied to realize the course control with high accuracy via manipulating the steering angle. Finally, the tracking performance of the PFCS is verified via simulation experiments on the Simulink-CarSim platform.

AB In this article, a novel approach of decision-making and motion control is designed for realizing safe and personalized driving of autonomous vehicles. A new lane-change intention generation model and a new lane-change decision-making algorithm are proposed. The feature of the proposed decision-making module is that the interactions between the ego vehicle and other surrounding vehicles are represented by the dynamic potential field (DPF) and embedded in the gap acceptance model to ensure the safety and personalization during driving. In addition, an integrated trajectory planning and tracking control algorithm, which incorporates the artificial potential field and constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT) into the model predictive control framework, is developed. The newly developed integrated controller allows efficient execution of the expected motion. The proposed approach is tested under different driving conditions and further compared with an existing baseline method. The results show that the proposed approach is able to make safe and personalized decisions, and execute motion control more efficiently for automated driving under dynamic situations, validating its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB Jointly optimizing multi-vehicle trajectories is a critical task in the next-generation transportation system with autonomous and connected vehicles. Based on a space-time lattice, we present a set of integer programming and dynamic programming models for scheduling longitudinal trajectories, where the goal is to consider both system-wide safety and throughput requirements under supports of various communication technologies. Newell's simplified linear car following model is used to characterize interactions and collision avoidance between vehicles, and a control variable of time-dependent platoon-level reaction time is introduced in this study to reflect various degrees of vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication connectivity. By adjusting the lead vehicle's speed and platoon-level reaction time at each time step, the proposed optimization models could effectively control the complete set of trajectories in a platoon, along traffic backward propagation waves. This parsimonious multi-vehicle state representation sheds new lights on forming tight and adaptive vehicle platoons at a capacity bottleneck. We examine the principle of optimality conditions and resulting computational complexity under different coupling conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the containment control of networked autonomous underwater vehicles guided by multiple dynamic leaders over a directed network. Each vehicle is subject to model uncertainty and unknown time-varying ocean disturbances. A new predictor-based neural dynamic surface control design approach is presented to develop the adaptive containment controllers, under which the trajectories of vehicles converge to the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders. Specifically, iterative neural updating laws, based on prediction errors, are constructed, which enable the accurate identification of the unknown dynamics for each vehicle, not only in steady state but also in transient state. Furthermore, this result is extended to the output-feedback case where only the position-yaw information can be measured. A neural observer is developed to recover the unmeasured velocity information. Based on the observed velocities of neighboring vehicles, distributed output-feedback containment controllers are devised, under which the containment can be achieved regardless of model uncertainty, unknown ocean disturbances, and unmeasured velocity information. For both cases, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are used to prove the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop error signals. Comparative studies are given to show the performance improvement of the proposed methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The introduction of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) gives rise to mixed traffic flow on the roadway, and the coexistence of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and CAVs may last for several decades. CAVs are expected to improve the efficiency of mixed traffic flow. In this paper, the car -following behavior of HVs is modeled by the intelligent driver model (IDM) based on actual trajectory data. The cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) model from the PATH laboratory is adopted for the car-following model of CAVs. The string stability of mixed traffic flow is analyzed for different market penetration rates of CAVs, showing that CAVs can effectively prevent stop-and-go waves from forming and propagating. In addition, the fundamental diagram is obtained from the equilibrium state, and the flow-density chart indicates that CAVs can improve the capacity of mixed traffic flow. Furthermore, the periodic boundary condition is designed for numerical simulation according to the infinite length platoon assumption in the analytical approach. The simulation results are consistent with the analytical solutions, suggesting the validity of the string stability and fundamental diagram analysis of mixed traffic flow.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold great promise for increasing the capacity of existing roadways and intersections, providing more mobility to a wider range of people, and are likely to reduce vehicle crashes. However, AVs are also likely to increase travel demand which could diminish the potential for AVs to reduce congestion and cause emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and other air pollutants to increase. Therefore, understanding how AVs will affect travel demand is critical to understanding their potential benefits and impacts. We evaluate how adoption of AVs affects travel demand, congestion and vehicle emissions over several decades using an integrated travel demand, land-use and air quality modeling framework for the Albuquerque, New Mexico metropolitan area. We find that AVs are likely to increase demand and GHG emissions as development patterns shift to the region's periphery and trips become longer. Congestion declines along most roadways as expanded capacity from more efficient AV operation outpaces increasing demand. Most of the population can also expect a reduction in exposure to toxic vehicle emissions. Some locations will experience an increase in air pollution exposure and traffic congestion from changes in land-use and traffic patterns caused by the adoption of AVs.

AB The article discusses the short, medium, and long-term effects of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on the urban transportation and environment by means of a systematic review of the extant literature on the subject matter. A corpus of 130 articles was collected from multiple sources using selected keywords. The review critically analyzes key findings of these papers in the light of a SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) analysis. Although the technology remains to be commercially deployed, broad consensus is found in the literature. First, AV would influence urban transportation and human mobility by reducing vehicle ownership, public and active travel, traffic delay and congestion, travel costs, and by increasing accessibility, mobility, Vehicle Miles Traveled, and revenue generation for commercial operators. Second, AVs would have long-term effects by encouraging dispersed urban development, reducing parking demand, and enhancing network capacity. Third, AVs would reduce energy consumption and protect the environment by reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions. Fourth, AVs would reduce traffic crashes involving human errors and increase the convenience and productivity of passengers by facilitating for multitasking. However, most people are very concerned about personal safety, security, and privacy. Finally, the study identifies critical research gaps and advances priority directions for further research.

   recognition; Gaussian process; Vehicle trajectory prediction
ID FRAMEWORK
AB In mixed and dynamic traffic environments, accurate long-term trajectory forecasting of surrounding vehicles is one of the indispensable preconditions for autonomous vehicles to accomplish reasonable behavioral decisions and guarantee driving safety. In this paper, we propose an integrated probabilistic architecture for long-term vehicle trajectory prediction, which consists of a driving inference model (DIM) and a trajectory prediction model (TPM). The DIM is designed and employed to accurately infer the potential driving intention based on a dynamic Bayesian network. The proposed DIM incorporates the basic traffic rules and multivariate vehicle motion information. To further improve the prediction accuracy and realize uncertainty estimation, we develop a Gaussian process-based TPM, considering both the short-term prediction results of the vehicle model and the driving motion characteristics. Afterward, the effectiveness of our novel approach is demonstrated by conducting experiments on a public naturalistic driving dataset under lane-changing scenarios. The superior performance on the task of long-term trajectory prediction is presented and verified by comparing with other advanced methods. (c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

ID ISSUES
AB The mobility status of self and surrounding vehicles provides important information to various tasks in autonomous driving (AD) and intelligent transportation system (ITS). Accordingly, a precise, stable, and robust mobility tracking framework is essential. Compared with self-tracking that relies only on mobility observations from onboard sensors [e.g., global positioning system (GPS), inertial measurement unit (IMU), and camera], cooperative tracking markedly increases the precision and reliability of the mobility information by integrating observations from roadside units (RSUs) and nearby vehicles through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Nevertheless, cooperative tracking can be quite vulnerable if there are malicious users sending bogus observations in the cooperative network. In this article, we present a malicious user detection framework, which includes two sequential detection algorithms and a secure mobility data exchange and fusion model to detect and remove bogus mobility information and integrate proposed detection algorithms with previous data fusion algorithms, which secures the cooperative mobility tracking in AD, ITS. Simulations validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework under different types of attacks.

AB Recently, inferring lane change intention has received considerable attention. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic contexts, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of long-term prediction tasks and lack the ability of capturing nonlinear temporal dependencies. This paper proposes an intention inference model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to tackle time series prediction problems. Considering dynamic interaction among surrounding vehicles, our model takes the sequence motion information of surrounding vehicles as inputs and calculates the congestion of different lanes, integrated with vehicle states of the object vehicle. To illustrate the availability of the proposed RNN intention inference model, a motion planning controller considering intention was developed. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) was established to planning a safe, sub-optimal path for autonomous driving vehicle under collision avoidance constraints. The experiments on the proposed model were conducted, based on two RNN structure Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Generalized Recurrent Unit (GRU), by Tensorflow with NGSIM data. The motion planning controller is modeled and simulated by Carsim with Simulink for some typical scenarios. Subsequently, experimental results demonstrate that RNN achieves best performance, inferring intention with 96% accuracy, compared with other approaches.

AB This paper presents a novel motion planning and tracking framework for automated vehicles based on artificial potential field (APF) elaborated resistance approach. Motion planning is one of the key parts of autonomous driving, which plans a sequence of movement states to help vehicles drive safely, comfortably, economically, human-like, etc. In this paper, the APF method is used to assign different potential functions to different obstacles and road boundaries; while the drivable area is meshed and assigned resistance values in each edge based on the potential functions. A local current comparison method is employed to find a collision-free path. As opposed to a path, the vehicle motion or trajectory should be planned spatiotemporally. Therefore, the entire planning process is divided into two spaces, namely the virtual and actual. In the virtual space, the vehicle trajectory is predicted and executed step by step over a short horizon with the current vehicle speed. Then, the predicted trajectory is evaluated to decide if the speed should be kept or changed. Finally, it will be sent to the actual space, where an experimentally validated Carsim model controlled by a model predictive controller is used to track the planned trajectory. Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

   System of Small Biomimetic Autonomous Underwater Vehicle - Preliminary
   Report

LA English

DE Underwater navigation; Odometry; Underwater vehicle; Evolutionary
   algorithms
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robots that operate in underwater environment and do not need involvement of an operator when performing some tasks. In order to move independently in water environment, AUVs need navigation capabilities, on the one hand, they have to be able to detect obstacles and avoid them, and on the other hand, they also have to know their own position and spatial orientation, at least course. With regard to the orientation, there are many various solutions like inertial systems, inclinometers, magnetic compasses, optical gyro-compasses, whereas, position due to unavailability of GPS requires solutions dedicated to underwater environment such as inertial navigation. To this end, information about spatial orientation and velocity is necessary. When the vehicle is not equipped with a device to measure velocity, e.g. because of small size of the vehicle itself, the only solution is to use odometry, that is, to apply information from the drive to estimate the velocity. The paper presents Odometric Navigational System (ONS) designed for a small biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV) and tuned by means of neuro-evolutionary techniques.

AB Highly automated vehicles are regarded as the next revolution of the transport system. Automated vehicles include a spectrum from vehicles with driver assistance systems through to highly automated vehicles. These vehicles will only gradually appear in the overall vehicle fleet. Their impact as part of future traffic is of reference value for transport decision-makers. The present paper starts from assumptions for the shares of vehicles with different levels of automation in 2030 and 2050 (representing the near and far-distant future) and compares the effects of these automated vehicles on traffic flow using microscopic traffic simulations. The simulated vehicles include non-assisted vehicles, semi-automated vehicles with driver assistance systems, and fully autonomous vehicles. To obtain a more realistic result, a traffic scenario of the city of Duisburg is used in this thesis. With the support of the city administration, existing data of the origin/target matrix, detector data including induction loops, and cameras were available. Thus, the data of the origin/target matrix are used to generate the real traffic scenario and the detector data to investigate the accuracy of the generated traffic. The result shows that automated vehicles would have a positive impact on traffic, a proportion of automated vehicles can reduce the average travel time. For areas with different traffic conditions, the degree of impact of automated vehicles can be very different.

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; biomedical systems; robot navigation
AB in this work, an interface specially designed for a robotic wheelchair's navigation within confined spaces is presented. The interface performance is based on two modus: autonomous and non-autonomous. The non-autonomous execution of the robotic wheelchair interface is performed by means of a joystick. The joystick is adapted to the wheelchair's patient capabilities and it governs the motion of the vehicle within the environment. The autonomous modus of the robotic wheelchair is executed when the user has to turn a given angle within the environment. The turning strategy is performed by means of both: a maneuverability algorithm which is compatible with the wheelchair's kinematics and the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm. In addition, the autonomous modus is composed by two modules: a path planning module and a control module. The path planning module uses the map information provided by the SLAM algorithm to generate a safe path compatible with the robotic wheelchair. Such path will allow the vehicle to reach the orientation -angle of turning- given by the user. The control module governs the motion of the robotic wheelchair by means of a trajectory controller when following the path generated by the path planning algorithm. The controller references are updated by the SLAM estimation of the wheelchair's pose within the environment. Experimental results using a real robotic wheelchair are also shown in this work.

AB Vehicle automation is coming, but environmental and energy imperatives are NOT what's motivating it. In fact, its energy and environmental outcomes are deeply uncertain. The promise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is greater safety and mobility. The question is: How do we achieve that promise while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and saving energy?
   Future AV scenarios range widely, from dramatically higher to dramatically lower GHG emissions. Fortunately, the best case for the environment is also the best case for business, for the economy, and for safe and affordable mobility: autonomous Taxi fleets that operate clean vehicles, encourage ridesharing, and are integrated with other public and private transportation modes. Governments, businesses, drivers and riders make decisions that can increase or decrease the likelihood of the best-case scenario.
   The stakes are very high, as the transportation sector is now the largest source of U.S. GHG emissions.
   Emissions are equal to (1) emissions per-vehicle-mile, multiplied by (2) vehicle-miles traveled (VMT). This paper explores the business, technology and behavioral decisions with respect to automation that have the greatest impact along these two dimensions. It then identifies policy interventions that could influence these key decisions to achieve the best GHG outcomes. AVs are an important international issue, although this paper is focused on the United States.

AB Due to the unavailability of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication in current transportation systems, Traffic Light Detection (TLD) is still considered an important module in autonomous vehicles and Driver Assistance Systems (DAS). To overcome low flexibility and accuracy of vision-based heuristic algorithms and high power consumption of deep learning-based methods, we propose a lightweight and real-time traffic light detector for the autonomous vehicle platform. Our model consists of a heuristic candidate region selection module to identify all possible traffic lights, and a lightweight Convolution Neural Network (CNN) classifier to classify the results obtained. Offline simulations on the GPU server with the collected dataset and several public datasets show that our model achieves higher average accuracy and less time consumption. By integrating our detector module on NVidia Jetson TX1/TX2, we conduct on-road tests on two full-scale self-driving vehicle platforms (a car and a bus) in normal traffic conditions. Our model can achieve an average detection accuracy of 99.3 percent (mRttld) and 99.7 percent (Rttld) at 10Hz on TX1 and TX2, respectively. The on-road tests also show that our traffic light detection module can achieve < +/- 1.5m errors at stop lines when working with other self-driving modules.

DE Autonomous driving; trajectory prediction; attention mechanism; informer
AB Accurate and efficient prediction of the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is of utmost importance in motion planning for autonomous driving. The ability to predict longer-term trajectories provides valuable information for effective motion planning. Numerous studies have contributed to the prediction of long-term vehicle trajectories. However, it is important to note that longer-term predictions can potentially lead to a trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. In this work, we propose a structural Informer method, which can achieve accurate and efficient long-term trajectory prediction of the target vehicle. Specifically, the proposed method considers not only the temporal and spatial features of the interaction vehicle trajectory, but also the impact of vehicle state changes on the trajectory. To reduce computational redundancy and complexity while improving memory usage and prediction accuracy, the ProbSparse self-attention mechanisms and attention distillation operations are employed. The method is validated and evaluated using the NGSIM dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed structural Informer achieves satisfactory accuracy and time cost in long-term prediction of the TV compared with state-of-the art methods.

AB Offshore marine engineering, offshore aquaculture, and offshore environmental protection require periodic offshore surveys. At present, the main means of offshore marine surveys are mooring buoys and marine survey ships. Anchored buoys are fixed in place for a long time, which affects the navigation of ships. Therefore, mooring buoys cannot be deployed over a large area with high density. The cost of marine survey ships is high, especially when multipoint synchronous marine surveys are needed, and marine survey ships cannot perform offshore surveys under bad sea conditions. A profile autonomous underwater vehicle system is developed to meet the requirements of multipoint short-term synchronous offshore surveys. It is a small, reusable, low-cost equipment designed to move up and down at a mooring position while measuring temperature, salinity, depth, and other quantities along a vertical water section. Profile autonomous underwater vehicles can be commanded remotely and report their measurements in near real-time via wireless telemetry. The time it takes for a profile AUV to move up and down can indicate the current velocity. Tests were carried out on a wharf and in offshore areas, and the results were satisfactory.

AB Cooperative control for multiple vehicles is a promising technology with the capability to improve traffic efficiency and fuel savings. Given its potential for both commercial and military applications, multiple unmanned vehicle formation has attracted considerable attention recently. In this paper, the use of formation control for connected and autonomous vehicles was explored and a novel distributed formation control approach was proposed. To begin, the evolution mechanism of multi-lane formation was investigated and a formation transition model based on a finite state machine was constructed. A bi-level formation control scheme was then proposed; this framework's upper and lower levels were used to perform trajectory planning and MPC-based control, respectively. A novel trajectory planning approach was constructed by combining the distributed consensus algorithm and the potential field method. Moreover, additional acceleration constraints were imposed on the trajectory planning algorithm. Finally, three scenarios were designed to validate the proposed formation control algorithm using Webots. The results illustrate that a formation deployed with the proposed formation control algorithm can handle abnormal situations and realize consensus within 12s.

AB This paper describes the concept, the technical implementation and the practical application of a miniaturized sensor system integrated into an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for real-time acquisition of water quality parameters. The main application field of the presented system is the analysis of the discharge of nitrates into Norwegian fjords near aqua farms. The presented system was developed within the research project SALMON (Sea Water Quality Monitoring and Management) over a three-year period. The development of the sensor system for water quality parameters represented a significant challenge for the research group, as it was to be integrated in the payload unit of the autonomous underwater vehicle in compliance with the underwater environmental conditions. The German company -4H- JENA engineering GmbH (4HJE), with experience in optical in situ-detection of nutrients, designed and built the measurement system. As a carrier platform, the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) CWolf from Fraunhofer-Institut fur Optronik, Systemtechnik und Bildauswertung - Institutsteil Angewandte Systemtechnik (IOSB-AST) modified to an AUV was deployed. The concept presented illustrates how the measurement system can be integrated easily into the vehicle with a minimum of hard- and software technical interfaces.

AB Addressing the need for exploration of benthic zones utilising autonomous underwater vehicles, this paper presents a simulation for an optimised path planning from the source node to the destination node of the autonomous underwater vehicle SLOCUM Glider in near-bottom ocean environment. Near-bottom ocean current data from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, Canada, have been used for this simulation. A cost function is formulated to describe the dynamics of the autonomous underwater vehicle in near-bottom ocean currents. This cost function is then optimised using various biologically-inspired algorithms such as genetic algorithm, Ant Colony optimisation algorithm and particle swarm optimisation algorithm. The simulation of path planning is also performed using Q-learning technique and the results are compared with the biologically-inspired algorithms. The results clearly show that the Q-learning algorithm is better in computational complexity than the biologically-inspired algorithms. The ease of simulating the environment is also more in the case of Q-learning techniques. Hence this paper presents an effective path planning technique, which has been tested for the SLOCUM glider and it may be extended for use in any standard autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB We develop a system-level design for the provision of Ancillary Service (AS) for control of electric power grids by in-vehicle batteries, suitably applied to Electric Vehicles (EVs) operated in a sharing service. An architecture for cooperation between transportation and energy management systems is introduced that enables us to design an autonomous Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) for the provision of multi objective AS: primary frequency control in a transmission grid and voltage amplitude regulation in a distribution grid connected to EVs. The design is based on the ordinary differential equation model of distribution voltage, which has been recently introduced as a new physics-based model, and is utilized in this paper for assessing and regulating the impact of spatiotemporal charging/charging of a large population of EVs to a distribution grid. Effectiveness of the autonomous V2G design is evaluated with numerical simulations of realistic models for transmission and distribution grids with synthetic operation data on EVs in a sharing service. In addition, we present a hardware-in-the-loop test for evaluating its feasibility in a situation where inevitable latency is involved due to power, control, and communication equipments.

AB Path Tracking Controller (PTC) plays a key role in achieving improved dynamic behaviour of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) while it is mainly responsible for implementing the planned paths. In this work, a learning-based Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is proposed to integrate a data-driven approach to the path tracking task using human driving demonstrations. The objective is to reproduce customised vehicle motion profile that is statistically comparable to a human driver with a proper trade-off between vehicle speed-acceleration profile and tracking accuracy. A combined longitudinal and lateral MPC controller with a novel feature-based parametric cost function is designed to perform the path tracking task under different road conditions. A high precision data logging system is developed to collect human driving demonstration data. From the analysis of the collected data, relevant features are chosen based on their applicability to produce a customised motion profile while performing AV's path tracking task. Next, a bi-level optimisation-based Inverse Optimal Controller (IOC) is designed to learn the cost function's parameters using the human demonstration data. The outcomes of the study show that the proposed controller can effectively regenerate some characteristics of human driving, including speed, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and yaw rate.

AB The fusion of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and camera data in real-time is known to be a crucial process in many applications, such as in autonomous driving, industrial automation, and robotics. Especially in the case of autonomous vehicles, the efficient fusion of data from these two types of sensors is important to enabling the depth of objects as well as the detection of objects at short and long distances. As both the sensors are capable of capturing the different attributes of the environment simultaneously, the integration of those attributes with an efficient fusion approach greatly benefits the reliable and consistent perception of the environment. This paper presents a method to estimate the distance (depth) between a self-driving car and other vehicles, objects, and signboards on its path using the accurate fusion approach. Based on the geometrical transformation and projection, low-level sensor fusion was performed between a camera and LiDAR using a 3D marker. Further, the fusion information is utilized to estimate the distance of objects detected by the RefineDet detector. Finally, the accuracy and performance of the sensor fusion and distance estimation approach were evaluated in terms of quantitative and qualitative analysis by considering real road and simulation environment scenarios. Thus the proposed low-level sensor fusion, based on the computational geometric transformation and projection for object distance estimation proves to be a promising solution for enabling reliable and consistent environment perception ability for autonomous vehicles.

AB Aiming for better mobility and more efficient utilization of transportation networks, emergent connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies, and the resulting communication capabilities can produce more coordinated and efficient routing behavior. Current routing strategies either rely on a centralized control system which can fail in scaling, or employ decentralized schemes that yield sub-optimal coordination and accordingly poor system performance. This paper presents a Decentralized Collaborative Time-dependent Shortest Path Algorithm (Dec-CTDSP) with which the CAVs optimize their routes according to the communicated mobility messages from the other CAVs within their connected cluster. These messages are assumed to carry information regarding the vehicles' location, speed, and preferred path to their destination. We analyzed the impacts of this optimization scheme under various levels of CAV market penetration and communication radius. The results of this study reveal (1) Up to 40% improvement in mean system travel time and speed; (2) Up to 45% increase in travel time and speed prediction reliability; (3) A strong correlation between mean system travel time and network usage distribution; and (4) significant improvements in network utilization as a result of Dec-CTDSP. The performance of Dec-CTDSP, in terms of runtime, convergence, and mobility improvements, is further benchmarked against other random and Dijkstra-based algorithms. The findings of this work will help steer further research on the implementation of coordinated and decentralized multiagent routing optimization in the context of connected and autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper presents a novel direct yaw moment control (DYC) strategy for autonomous distributed drive electric vehicle (DDEV) to improve path-following driving stability under critical maneuvers. Due to the fact that the tire mechanical characteristics show highly nonlinear under those critical conditions, the piecewise affine (PWA) identification method is chosen in this work to model the tire nonlinear mechanical characteristics since it shows best model accuracy/simplicity compromise for system control design. On this basis, to properly reflect the coupling behaviors between longitudinal motion and lateral motion, the vehicle dynamics model which considers the tire nonlinear mechanical characteristics in the PWA form is established. By analyzing the phase plane of vehicle nonlinear model, a novel external yaw moment calculation method based on global fast terminal sliding mode (GFTSM) control method is applied to the upper layer of DYC architecture for eliminating the errors of yaw rate and sideslip angle. Then, different weight coefficients are allocated to obtain the final external yaw moment. In the lower controller, the optimal four-wheel torque is distributed according to a concise and accurate algorithm in which adaptive weight coefficients are considered. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in improving the driving stability performance of autonomous DDEV against two other control strategies under three extreme conditions.

AB This work proposes a fuel efficient vehicle speed control strategy for a connected and autonomous vehicle to pass the intersection (the eco-approach application). A control framework is developed to integrate traffic prediction (enabled by connectivity) and speed optimization. The traffic prediction is based on traffic flow model and can be applied to mixed-traffic scenarios where both connected and non-connected vehicles are on the road. Real-time information from connected vehicles and signal lights provides 'partial' measurement of the traffic states. The unknown traffic states are estimated using an observer (Unscented Kalman Filter). Uncertainties in the traffic prediction are systematically considered during the vehicle speed optimization to improve the robustness of the optimal control. Effects of powertrain states (the transmission gear ratio) on fuel consumption are considered as well. The vehicle speed optimization problem is real-time implementable using an efficient nonlinear programming solver. The optimal speed control strategy is evaluated in both a simulated traffic scenario and a real-world traffic scenario. In the simulated traffic scenario, fuel benefits vary from 5.3% to 9.4% as the penetration rate of connectivity increases. This is satisfactory compared to 11.7% fuel benefits with perfect traffic prediction. In the real-world traffic scenario, experimental results show that 6.9% fuel benefits can be achieved with two connected preceding vehicles and 11.2% fuel benefits can be obtained with perfect prediction. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the traffic prediction and the optimal vehicle speed control strategy.

Reference state decision module determines reference state profiles consisting of yaw rate and velocity in order to overcome the limitation of the error dynamics-based path tracking controller, which requires several assumptions on the reference path. The MPC-based vehicle motion controller is designed with a linear time-varying vehicle model in order to optimally allocate the control effort to each actuator. A linear time-varying MPC is adopted to reduce computational burden caused by using a non-linear one. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via simulation on MATLAB/Simulink and CarSim. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves the reference tracking performance by effectively distributing the control effort to the steering angle and driving force of each actuator.

AB This paper presents a novel adaptive multiple-model predictive control (MPC) scheme for Four-Wheel Independent Drive (4WID) autonomous vehicles with a holistic structure. Firstly, the combined vehicle-path model is established. To ensure the real-time performance of MPC, the coupling relationships in the control output and the longitudinal/lateral motions are well decoupled, in this way a linear integrated model is utilized as the internal model of the controller. Then, the holistic MPC is proposed to acquire the steering angle and the force on each corner. Based on the advantages of the proposed structure, a weight adaptive mechanism is introduced to improve the handling ability of the controller to various driving conditions, especially some extreme conditions. For the uncertainties in tire cornering stiffness, a multiple-model adaptive law is designed with its convergence proved by Lyapunov theory. Numerical results based on Carsim-Simulink co-simulation platform demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control method in both normal and extreme driving conditions.

AB This paper investigates the potential of improving the overall traffic and energy efficiency by properly controlling a proportion of controllable connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in a mixed traffic corridor. Specifically, we develop a control framework that optimizes controllable CAV trajectories taking into account other vehicles for simultaneously improving traffic throughput and reducing the total energy consumption of all vehicles. The property of the control framework is firstly analytically examined in a simplified and tractable scenario where a human-driven vehicle (HV) follows a CAV. We found that the optimal acceleration is larger if one emphasizes more on improving travel distance within the optimization horizon, or smaller when one emphasizes more on saving energy. The continuous-time optimization model formulation is then discretized, which is solved for real-time application in a model predictive control (MPC) fashion. In numerical studies, the proposed method is tested in various scenarios, e.g., with/without an intersection, under different proportions of controllable CAVs, possible vehicle permutations, and varying overall traffic intensities. Numerical results show that the normalized energy consumption can be reduced by up to 45% and the average travel time reduced by 65%, showing a significant improvement in the road throughput. Notably, even with a limited number of controllable CAVs, the proposed method can achieve a promising performance, e.g., about 20% controllable CAVs can achieve half the benefits of a fully controllable CAV environment.

AB In autonomous vehicles (AVs), ensuring pedestrian safety within intricate and dynamic settings, particularly at crosswalks, has gained substantial attention. While AVs perform admirably in standard road conditions, their integration into unique environments like shared spaces devoid of traditional traffic infrastructure control presents complex challenges. These challenges involve issues of right-of-way negotiation and accessibility, particularly in "naked streets". This research delves into an innovative smart pole interaction unit (SPIU) with an external human-machine interface (eHMI). Utilizing virtual reality (VR) technology to evaluate the SPIU efficacy, this study investigates its capacity to enhance interactions between vehicles and pedestrians at crosswalks. The SPIU is designed to communicate the vehicles' real-time intentions well before arriving at the crosswalk. The study findings demonstrate that the SPIU significantly improves secure decision making for pedestrian passing and stops in shared spaces. Integrating an SPIU with an eHMI in vehicles leads to a substantial 21% reduction in response time, greatly enhancing the efficiency of pedestrian stops. Notable enhancements are observed in unidirectional (one-way) and bidirectional (two-way) scenarios, highlighting the positive impact of the SPIU on interaction dynamics. This work contributes to AV-pedestrian interaction and underscores the potential of fuzzy-logic-driven solutions in addressing complex and ambiguous pedestrian behaviors.

AB This paper investigates a post-impact control (PIC) method for four-wheel independently actuated (FWIA) electric autonomous vehicles (EAVs) after an initial impact. Differential steering angles actuated by differential torques generated from the left and right wheels have been utilized as an inherent redundant control strategy when the steering motor totally fails, to realize the PIC and secondary collision mitigation. To this end, a vehicle state estimation-based PIC strategy is developed in this work, and three contributions have been made as follows: 1) A novel cascaded estimation approach using the adaptive complementary filters (ACF) is proposed to estimate the longitudinal and lateral velocities with low-cost measurement; 2) Experiments on a scaled FWIA EAV with differential steering mechanism have been conducted to verify the proposed ACF approach, indicating that ACF can accurately estimate the longitudinal and lateral velocities; 3) The vehicle velocity estimation-based path planning and following with model predictive control (MPC) strategy are proposed for PIC and for FWIA EAVs, both for the first time. Finally, the verifiable simulation based on the high-fidelity CarSim-Simulink conjoint platform with the experimentally identified vehicle parameters has been conducted, which has verified the proposed ACF-based PIC strategy can effectively avoid the secondary collision and guarantee vehicle stability and control performance.

AB Detection and tracking of moving objects (DATMO) in an urban environment using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a major challenge for autonomous vehicles due to sparse point cloud, multiple moving directions, various traffic participants, and computational load. To address the complexity of this issue, this study presents a novel model-free approach for DATMO using 2D LiDAR implemented on autonomous vehicles. The approach has been used to classify moving points in the point cloud using the predicted Static Obstacle Map (SOM) generated via interaction between Geometric Model-Free Approach (GMFA) and SOM, and estimates the state of each moving object via GMFA. The motion of each point represented by the state of moving objects updates the SOM. The interaction between GMFA and SOM estimates the correspondence between consecutive point clouds in real-time. The proposed approach has been evaluated via RT range and labeled dataset. The accuracy of estimation of the yaw angle and the velocity of a moving vehicle has been quantitatively evaluated using the RT-range. The performance is significantly improved compared with the geometric model-based tracking (MBT). The estimation of the yaw angle, which has a significant effect on the cut-in/cut-out intention of the target vehicle, is shown to be remarkably improved. Based on the evaluation of the labeled dataset, false-positive and false-negative features are suppressed more than MBT.

AB This paper describes an algorithm for distributed acoustic navigation for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Whereas typical AUV navigation systems utilize pre-calibrated arrays of static transponders, our work seeks to create a fully mobile network of AUVs that perform acoustic ranging and data exchange with one another to achieve cooperative positioning for extended duration missions over large areas. The algorithm enumerates possible solutions for the AUV trajectory based on dead-reckoning and range-only measurements provided by acoustic modems that are mounted on each vehicle, and chooses the trajectory via minimization of a cost function based on these constraints. The resulting algorithm is computationally efficient, meets the strict bandwidth requirements of available AUV modems, and has potential to scale well to networks of large numbers of vehicles. The method has undergone extensive experimentation, and results from three different scenarios are reported in this paper, each of which utilizes MIT SCOUT Autonomous Surface Craft (ASC) as convenient platforms for testing. In the first experiment, we utilize three ASCs, each equipped with a Woods Hole acoustic modem, as surrogates for AUVs. In this scenario, two ASCs serve as Communication/Navigation Aids (CNAs) for a third ASC that computes its position based exclusively on GPS positions of the CNAs and acoustic range measurements between platforms. In the second scenario, an undersea glider is used in conjunction with two ASCs serving as CNAs. Finally, in the third experiment, a Bluefin12 AUV serves as the target vehicle. All three experiments demonstrate the successful operation of the technique with real ocean data.

AB Due to the influence of the complex underwater environment, safety, smoothness, real-time requirements and poor integrity, the path of autonomous underwater vehicles is mainly determined by perception, decisionmaking and control systems. These not only achieve object detection and environmental investigation but also ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation systems. This paper proposes a whale optimization algorithm based on forward-looking sonar to tackle the three-dimensional path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles. The purpose of path planning is to effectively avoid threatened regions and obtain the shortest and safest paths with minimal fuel and time. The whale optimization algorithm based upon bubble-net hunting behavior imitates the contraction surrounding mechanism, logarithmic spiral position updating mechanism and stochastic searching mechanism to effectively solve the complex problem in the solution space. The whale optimization algorithm not only avoids premature convergence and avoids falling into the local optimum to achieve the global optimal solution but also utilizes exploration and exploitation to enhance the convergence speed and calculation accuracy. To verify the superiority and overall optimization performance of the whale optimization algorithm, the optimization results of the algorithm are compared with other algorithms by minimizing the fitness value. The experimental results reveal that the whale optimization algorithm has better planning efficiency, shorter execution time, faster convergence speed and higher solution precision, which is effective and efficient for path planning.

AB The purpose of this paper is to stimulate the development and deployment of networked vehicle systems for coastal field studies over the next decades. The approach used to accomplish this goal was to present current developments in unmanned vehicle systems and in networked vehicle systems before examining future trends and challenges for environmental field studies. Examples of developments from the Underwater Systems and Technologies Laboratory from Porto University illustrate the key points.
   The Light Autonomous Vehicle (LAUV) developed by Porto University in Portugal is described along with results from operational oceanographic and harbour surveillance missions.
   The LAUV is a small, low-cost, torpedo shaped vehicle made of composite materials (110 x 15 cm) with one propeller and 3 (or 4) control fins and configurable for multiple operation profiles and sensor configurations. The LAUV is an open system engineered to evolve with the user requirements. The LAUV facilitates the access to the ocean and to the integration of new technologies and user developments.
   The LAUV system comes with an advanced software tool set, including an Application Programming Interface allowing the user to develop dedicated applications, a publish/subscribe framework supporting multi-vehicle operations with mixed initiative interactions (operator in the planning and control loop) and a command and control framework compliant with interoperability standards. The LAUV has been tested at sea, in harbours and in estuarine environments in Portugal and in the United States.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential in solving challenges across various domains, notably in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, implementing RL in autonomous driving comes with its own set of difficulties, such as the overestimation phenomenon, extensive learning time, and sparse reward problems. Although solutions like hindsight experience replay (HER) have been proposed to alleviate these issues, the direct utilization of RL in autonomous vehicles remains constrained due to the intricate fusion of information and the possibility of system failures during the learning process. In this paper, we present a novel RL-based autonomous driving system technology that combines obstacle-dependent Gaussian (ODG) RL, soft actor-critic (SAC), and meta-learning algorithms. Our approach addresses key issues in RL, including the overestimation phenomenon and sparse reward problems, by incorporating prior knowledge derived from the ODG algorithm. With these solutions in place, the ultimate aim of this work is to improve the performance of reinforcement learning and develop a swift, stable, and robust learning method for implementing autonomous driving systems that can effectively adapt to various environments and overcome the constraints of direct RL utilization in autonomous vehicles. We evaluated our proposed algorithm on official F1 circuits, using high-fidelity racing simulations with complex dynamics. The results demonstrate exceptional performance, with our method achieving up to 89% faster learning speed compared to existing algorithms in these environments.

We designed a hybrid control architecture which integrates task, path, motion planning/replanning, and execution monitoring. The high-level system relies on a continuous monitoring and planning cycle to suitably react to events, user interventions, and failures, communicating with the low level control layers. The system has been assessed on real-world and simulated scenarios representing an industrial environment.

AB Human-machine cooperation (HMC) driving can realize the sharing of vehicle control rights between drivers and autonomous driving systems. However, the system disturbances and parameter uncertainties introduced by HMC driving are also inevitable. To solve the above problems, this study proposes an HMC steering torque control method based on the model reference adaptive control (MRAC). First, to describe the driver's operating behavior and the transient characteristics of the steering system and the vehicle, an HMC vehicle-road model with steering torque input is established. Then, the exponential decay function is taken as a reference model to increase the decay rate of road lateral deviation. Besides, for the problem of model parameter uncertainties, the parameter adaptive laws are designed in the control process, and the robust term is considered into the parameter adaption law to improve the robustness of the closed-loop system. Robust stability under bounded disturbances is guaranteed by boundary estimation of unknown disturbances between driver input and steering load. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the proposed control strategy. The results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can converge rapidly under the disturbances and parameter uncertainties introduced by HMC.

AB Rail traffic in passenger miles [in the UK] is projected to increase by 100% over the next 30 years, which presents a considerable challenge for the current infrastructure to perform the regular fluid servicing tasks. Developing robotic autonomous systems for train fluid servicing is a prospect for which no solutions currently exist. Therefore, the economic and technical feasibility of a robotic autonomous system to perform several key fluid servicing tasks on passenger train vehicles is investigated. The fluid servicing tasks chosen include those that to a significant degree are repetitive or hazardous for humans to perform, and therefore if performed by a robotic autonomous system will release service personnel to focus on more suitable tasks. The economic and technical cases presented strongly support the use of a robotic autonomous system for fluid servicing of trains. Generally available robotic autonomous system technology has reached a state of development capable of delivering what is required once reliable couplings and fluid hose technologies have been developed for this application. Overall, the findings are that fluid servicing capacity will at least double for around 15% of the cost of an equivalent manual servicing facility, which represents a substantially attractive business case. There will be modest technical challenges to be overcome that will add unknown cost elements such as modifications to vehicle fluid ports for robotic autonomous system compatibility and development of long power hoses.

AB Complex Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology are increasing the number of vehicle recalls. At the same time, financial risks resulting from extensive product recall events can severely affect vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers, exposing the automotive supply chain to business continuity, legal and reputational risk. However, these risk implications are under-appreciated by large segments of the supply chain. This study shows that product recall events are increasing in general but recall events associated with ADAS/AV technology form an increasingly large percentage of these recall events. Based on this analysis, we describe ADAS/AV-specific aspects of risk mitigation and present a multidimensional approach, combining production-centric risk mitigation avenues in the automotive supply chain with the transfer of residual financial risks via insurance. We find that this comprehensive risk mitigation approach benefits in higher transparency of total production costs and increased resilience of the automotive supply chain. Against the background of an increasing product recall risk resulting from the increasing automation and interconnectedness of modern vehicles, we therefore suggest a closer, more strategic cooperation between insurance companies, car manufacturers and automotive suppliers for the benefit of all parties.

AB In this paper, an experimental investigation of the sampling/patrolling tasks by means of cooperative underwater vehicles is presented. Both in the case of sampling and patrolling, the mission consists in periodically visiting proper locations of the environment in order to estimate the field of interest or check for unexpected events. In previous work of the same authors, it has been shown that these tasks can be addressed by a proper combination of Gaussian Processes and Voronoi tessellation tools. The Gaussian Processes allow to put these tasks in a probabilistic framework, while the Voronoi tessellation allows to distribute the overall strategy as well as the handling of asynchronous communication or possible loss or adjunct of vehicles. The approach was already tested in simulation by varying all the parameters of interest as well as on a set-up composed by three marine surface vehicles. In this paper, experiments are extended to the still challenging scenario of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) communicating by acoustic modems and moving in the 3D space. The experiments were run in the La Spezia harbour, in Italy, as demo of the European project CO(3)AUV5. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work explores both modeling and control of the experimental Ciscrea autonomous underwater vehicle. A 6-degree-of-freedom model is presented and validated for turn and emerge/sink maneuvers. Then, a constraint compensating algorithm is proposed based on quasi-sliding mode conditioning ideas and added to a pre-existing inaccessible proportional-derivative controller in order to improve the overall closed-loop response. By considering actuator constraints, the employed technique allows path following at greater speed than the original controller for a given error tolerance. Experimental results on the so-called Ciscrea underwater robot are presented.

AB In this work, we propose a robust energy-optimal control that achieves 3-D path following for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in environments with ocean currents. The actual algorithm is decomposed into two elements: setpoint computation and setpoint tracking. For setpoint computation, the surge velocity, heave velocity, and pitch angle setpoints are optimized by minimizing vehicle propulsion energy considering the uncertainty set defined by the state estimate and associated uncertainty. A line-of-sight (LOS)-based guidance law, which integrates direct and indirect drift angle compensation for reduced path-following error and path-convergence time, is established to compute the yaw angle setpoints. Two setpoint-tracking model predictive controllers, minimizing a weighted sum of setpoint-tracking error and control efforts, are designed to control horizontal and vertical vehicle motion with low computational complexity. Simulation is conducted on a lawnmower-type mission under different flow conditions in the presence of measurement noises and biased ocean current estimates. The performance robustness in path following and energy saving of the proposed approach is verified through extensive numerical and theoretical analysis.

AB This paper proposes a novel autonomous underwater vehicle path planning algorithm in a cluttered underwater environment based on the heat method. The algorithm calculates the isotropic and anisotropic geodesic distances by adding the direction and magnitude of the currents to the heat method, which is named the anisotropy-based heat method. Taking account of the relevant influence of the environment on the cost functions, such as currents, obstacles and turn of the vehicle, an efficient collision-free and energy-optimized path solution can be obtained. Simulation results show that the anisotropy-based heat method is able to find a good trajectory in both static and dynamic clutter fields (including uncertain obstacles and changing currents). Compared with the fast marching (FM) algorithm, the anisotropy-based heat method is not only robust, flexible, and simple to implement, but it also greatly saves time consumption and memory footprint in a time-variant environment. Finally, the evaluation criteria of paths are proposed in terms of length, arrival time, energy consumption, and smoothness.

AB The third generation partnership project (3GPP) has issued specifications for the autonomous assignment of radio resources by vehicles on the sidelink of the cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology. It is based on a sensing mechanism for resource selection and a semi-persistent scheduling for resource reservation to periodic safety messages. Imperfect sensing due to hidden terminals and to half-duplex on board transceivers may result in the selection of interfered resources for successive message transmissions. As a consequence of the lost packets, involved vehicles may become blind to the presence of other vehicles in their vicinity even for many seconds, with threats to the road safety. In this paper, we define these events as wireless blind spots (WBSs) and characterize their probability to occur. We propose an enhancement to the autonomous mode in order to reduce the WBS duration and demonstrate the benefits of the proposal against the legacy mode, both analytically in a simplified scenario and through simulations in a highway environment.

AB A state equation model is proposed for predicting the proportion of dual command cycles in autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems that use interleaving. This proportion is used to estimate storage and retrieval cycle times, system utilization and throughput capacity for alternative system design profiles defined by the number of storage aisles, storage rack height and depth, the vehicle fleet size and the number of lifts used for vertical movement. The state equation model enables the user to explicitly trade off model accuracy and computational complexity in the pre-engineering or 'concepting' stage of system development. A sample problem is used to demonstrate the model.

AB The need for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for intervention missions becomes greater as they can perform underwater tasks requiring physical contacts with the underwater environment, such as underwater plug-in/plug-out, construction and repair, cable streaming, mine hunting, munitions retrieval, and scientific sampling. This paper describes a semi-autonomous underwater vehicle for intervention missions that has multiple on-board CPUs, redundant sensors and actuators, on-board power source and a robotic manipulator for dextrous underwater performance. Such a complex robotic vehicle system requires advanced control software architecture for on-board intelligence with a wide range of sensors and actuators to carry out required missions. In this paper, AUV control architectures are reviewed and a sensor data bus based control architecture (SDBCA) is presented. SDBCA is a modified hierarchical architecture that offers good controllability and stability while sensor data bus increases flexibility of system design, making it possible to have a prompt response from high-level control with respect to low-level sensor data. The overall sensor input mechanism of SDBCA becomes similar to the sensor input mechanism of subsumption architecture. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The potential increase/decrease in energy consumption of traffic operation modes is a hot topic in the studies of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), but there are few theoretical studies on the fuel consumption of human driving vehicles (HDVs) and CAV mixed platoon as a result of limited data. Based on the power distribution of light-duty vehicles, this study developed a fuel consumption model for HDV and CAV mixed platoons by theoretical hypothesis considering the oscillation along with the platoon. Firstly, a vehicle-specific power (VSP) distribution conforming to normal distribution is constructed with hypothesis-based VSP standard deviation and constant VSP average value at each speed bin under different platoon arrangement conditions. Then, the fuel factors (mL/km) are calculated by weighted fuel rate (mL/s) according to the VSP distribution. Finally, a library of fuel consumption values for multiple penetration rates, platoon intensities, and speeds was established. In the case, at a speed of 30 km/h, the fuel consumption in the CAV group was reduced by 0.8-5%, 1.9-12.5%, 8.6-12%, and 12.4%, respectively, at the penetration rate of 20%, 50%, 80%, and 100%, compared to the HDV group. The fuel consumption reduction effect of CAV was negatively correlated with the speed.

AB Automobile manufacturers, transportation researchers, and policymakers are interested in knowing the future of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To this end, this study proposes a new simulation-based fleet evolution framework to forecast Americans' long-term (year 2015-2045) adoption levels of CAV technologies under eight different scenarios based on 5% and 10% annual drops in technology prices; 0%, 5%, and 10% annual increments in Americans' willingness to pay (WTP); and changes in government regulations (e.g., mandatory adoption of connectivity on new vehicles). This simulation was calibrated with data obtained from a survey of 2167 Americans, regarding their preferences for CAV technologies (e.g., WTP) and their household's annual vehicle transaction decisions.
   Long-term fleet evolution suggests that the privately held light-duty-vehicle fleet will have 24.8% Level 4 AV penetration by 2045 if one assumes an annual 5% price drop and constant WTP values (from 2015 forward). This share jumps to 87.2% if one uses a 10% annual rate of decline in prices and a 10% annual rise in WTP values. Overall, simulations suggest that, without a rise in most people's WTP, or policies that promote or require technologies, or unusually rapid reductions in technology costs, it is unlikely that the U.S. light duty vehicle fleet's technology mix will be anywhere near homogeneous by the year 2045.

AB Autonomous driving solutions stretch over different disciplines and technologies e.g., sensors, communication, computation, machine learning, data analytic, etc., that need to be smartly stitched together for achieving end-to-end solutions. In this paper, we discuss the vision of level 5 autonomous vehicles (AV), relevant challenges, and analysis of the research literature. The paper focuses on the role of communication for connected and automated vehicles. Furthermore, the need for implanting intelligence in different architectural components and for various Autonomous Driving relevant operations is discussed. Challenges specific to communication, perception, service orchestration, service mobility, etc. are highlighted, relevant research literature analyzed, and potential solutions sketch is provided. We have also provided an overview of the large-scale proof-of-concepts around the globe that guide the readers towards studying different aspects of the autonomous driving and perspectives of stakeholders therein. The potential of Satellite-Air-Ground-Integrated-Networks (SAGINs) is studied for realizing the objectives of envisioned higher level autonomous driving. Based on the exhaustive analysis of the research work, this work concludes that there is a need for zooming out strategy, where the novel architectural, technological, and AI-based solution approaches are crafted by capturing the end-to-end system with the focus on most (if not all) stakeholders and their objectives.

AB This paper is about detecting and counting the passengers of a tracking vehicle using on-car monocular vision. By having a model of nearby vehicle occupants, intelligent reasoning systems of autonomous cars will be provided with this additional knowledge needed in emergency situations such as those that many philosophers have recently raised. The on-road Vehicle PassengEr Detection (ViPED) system is based on the human perception model in terms of spatio-temporal reasoning, namely the slight movements of passenger shape silhouettes inside the cabin. The main challenges we face are the low light conditions of the cabin (no feature points), the subtle non-rigid motions of the occupants (possible artifactual transitions), and the puzzling discrimination problem of back or front seat occupants (lack of depth information inside the cabin). To overcome these challenges, we first track the detected car windshield and find the optimal affine warp. The registered windshield images are preprocessed in order to extract a feature matrix, which serves as input to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for inferring the number and position of passengers. We demonstrate that our low-cost sensor system is able to detect in most cases successfully all the passengers in preceding moving vehicles at various distances and occupancies. Metrics and datasets are included for possible community future work on this new challenging task. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent researches on advanced driver-assistance systems indicate great advances in terms of safety and comfort in automated driving. Advanced driver-assistance systems use control systems to perform most of the maneuvers as performed by the driver in the past. One of the useful advanced driver-assistance systems is automatic lane change system in order to avoid accidents. This study designs the controller of an automatic lane change system for an autonomous vehicle. The control law in this study is adaptive sliding mode control. To avoid chattering in adaptive sliding mode control, fuzzy boundary layer is used. Also, adaptive law is used for sliding-based switching gain. This adaptive controlling law is used to avoid the calculation of upper bound of system uncertainties. In this study, based on the boundary conditions, the vehicle lane change path planning and different maneuver periods are evaluated. To simulate the designed controller, CarSim-Simulink joint simulation model is used. This linkage leads to a full non-linear vehicle model. The results of simulation show excellent tracking for dry road conditions and acceptable tracking in icy and wet roads in some maneuvers of above 4-s long.

ID INTERSECTIONS
AB With the technological drive for realizing smart cities, work on Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) protocols opts to replace the traditional traffic light system by using cooperative Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in order to decrease road congestion and increase vehicular throughput. However, these protocols simply ignore pedestrians as road users and do not provision for safe pedestrian crossing. Basically, a road intersection not only could be traffic bottleneck, but also nearly 23% of the total automotive related fatalities and almost 1 million injury-causing crashes occur at or within intersections every year. This article opts to fill such a technical gap. We present a novel system that prioritizes pedestrians crossing and guarantees safety while preserving the efficiency of AIM based approaches. Our system does not require additional infrastructure or pedestrian-carried devices, and works for both self-driving and human-derived vehicles. The simulation results show that our proposed system for Autonomous Pedestrian Crossing (APC) protocol of non-signalized intersections significantly decreases the vehicle's delay and pedestrian walk duration compared to the conventional traffic light-based systems. The effectiveness of APC is validated for traffic scenarios with (1) self-driving vehicles, and (2) mix of human-based and self-driving vehicles.

AB Accurate perception of intelligent vehicles is critical for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. However, current perception methods often struggle to effectively detect intelligent vehicles when obstacles block their field of view. Collaborative perception, although attracting considerable attention, presents challenges in terms of privacy and data trust. In this study, we present a novel design for Enhancing Intelligent Vehicle (), a cost-effective and comprehensive perception system for intelligent vehicles. We discovered that during the process of memory caching raw sensing data in the intelligent vehicle's system-on-chip (SOC), continuous fluctuating currents inside the memory result in the emission of Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR). As a result, intelligent vehicles actively expose themselves on the electromagnetic spectrum. is based on a set of specially designed antenna arrays that scan the spectrum and utilize a joint Kalman filtering algorithm to enhance EMR signals. The micro-Doppler signature of each EMR signal is then analyzed to identify signals from intelligent vehicles and construct a vehicle database. A multi-antenna joint estimation algorithm is also designed to further estimate the position, distance, and direction of the target vehicle. Our experiments demonstrate that offers advantages in terms of timeliness, robustness, and accuracy.

AB Collision avoidance ability is very important for autonomous agricultural vehicles, but the influence of different obstacles in agricultural environment is rarely taken into account. In this paper, a velocity control strategy for collision avoidance was proposed to adjust the velocity of autonomous agricultural vehicles according to the movement state and dangerous degree of the obstacles and the distance between the obstacles and the vehicles, thus to improve intelligence and safety of the vehicles. The control strategy involved two steps: collision prediction in dynamic environments with an improved obstacle space-time grid map, and velocity generator for collision avoidance with a cloud model. Simulations were conducted on the obstacle collision prediction and the designed cloud generator for velocity control respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy can effectively predict collision with anti-disturbance ability for threat-free obstacles and rapid and accurate velocity output. And it realizes the real-time operation in dynamic environments with an average time of 0.2 s to predict collision. Additionally, field experiments including five trial schemes were performed to test the proposed velocity control strategy on an agricultural robot, where a haystack, a tractor and walking persons were regarded as static or dynamic obstacles. The results of the field experiments show that the proposed velocity control strategy has strong feasibility and effectiveness.

ID LI-ION BATTERIES; CONSUMPTION
AB Weight, computing load, sensor load and possibly higher drag may increase the energy use of automated electric vehicles relative to human-driven electric vehicles, although this increase may be offset by smoother driving. Here, we use a vehicle dynamics model to evaluate the trade-off between automation and electric vehicle range and battery longevity. We find that automation will likely reduce electric vehicle range by 5-10% for suburban driving and by 10-15% for city driving. The effect on range is strongly influenced by sensor drag for suburban driving and computing loads for city driving. The impact of automation on battery longevity is negligible. While some commentators have suggested that the power and energy requirements of automation mean that the first automated vehicles will be gas-electric hybrids, our results suggest that this need not be the case if automakers can implement energy-efficient computing and aerodynamic sensor stacks.
   Autonomous driving is being implemented in electric vehicles, but its energy impact is unclear. Here the authors build physics models to analyse the energy demand of autonomous electric vehicles and suggest that the influences of automation on vehicle range and battery longevity are small.

AB In this paper we describe the experimental implementation of an online algorithm for cooperative localization of submerged autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) supported by an autonomous surface craft. Maintaining accurate localization of an AUV is difficult because electronic signals, such as GPS, are highly attenuated by water. The usual solution to the problem is to utilize expensive navigation sensors to slow the rate of dead-reckoning divergence. We investigate an alternative approach that utilizes the position information of a surface vehicle to bound the error and uncertainty of the on-board position estimates of a low-cost AUV. This approach uses the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) acoustic modem to exchange vehicle location estimates while simultaneously estimating inter-vehicle range. A study of the system observability is presented so as to motivate both the choice of filtering approach and surface vehicle path planning. The first contribution of this paper is to the presentation of an experiment in which an extended Kalman filter (EKF) implementation of the concept ran online on-board an OceanServer Iver2 AUV while supported by an autonomous surface vehicle moving adaptively. The second contribution of this paper is to provide a quantitative performance comparison of three estimators: particle filtering (PF), non-linear least-squares optimization (NLS), and the EKF for a mission using three autonomous surface craft (two operating in the AUV role). Our results indicate that the PF and NLS estimators outperform the EKF, with NLS providing the best performance.

AB When attempts are made to incorporate shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) into urban mobility services, public transportation (PT) systems are affected by the changes in mode share. In light of that, a simulation-based method is presented herein for analyzing the manner in which mode choices of local travelers change between PT and SAVs. The data used in this study were the modal split ratios measured based on trip generation in the major cities of South Korea. Subsequently, using the simulated results, a city-wide impact analysis method is proposed that can reflect the differences between the two mode types with different travel behaviors. As the supply-demand ratio of SAVs increased in type 1 cities, which rely heavily on PT, use of SAVs gradually increased, whereas use of PT and private vehicles decreased. Private vehicle numbers significantly reduced only when SAVs and PT systems were complementary. In type 2 cities, which rely relatively less on PT, use of SAVs gradually increased, and use of private vehicles decreased; however, no significant impact on PT was observed. Private vehicle numbers were observed to reduce when SAVs were operated, and the reduction was a minimum of thrice that in type 1 cities when SAVs and PT systems interacted. Our results can therefore aid in the development of strategies for future SAV-PT operations.

AB The macroscopic evaluation of road traffic characteristics is vital as they will alter significantly with the emergence of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The macroscopic second-order traffic flow models are emerging as essential tools to observe the evolutionary dynamics of traffic flow. These models are significantly improved to describe the dynamics of traffic flow in view of Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). However, proficient macroscopic second-order traffic flow models are indispensable in comprehending and elucidating the descriptions of traffic flow dynamics, particularly in the view of evolving CAVs. Therefore, we propose a macroscopic second-order traffic model that distinguishes CAVs from HDVs by meticulously considering their distinct driving characteristics. The proposed model incorporates lengthways between the vehicles, and the reaction time of the CAVs, and is evaluated on a 20,000 m ring road. The findings show that with smaller lengthways and reaction times of CAVs, traffic evolves quickly during transitions. An increase in average traffic velocity is observed as the reaction time is significantly small. It has been demonstrated that CAVs can significantly limit variations in velocity resulting in smoother flow operations.

ID VEHICLES
AB Intersections are considered one of the most complex scenarios in a self-driving framework due to the uncertainty in the behaviors of surrounding vehicles and the different types of scenarios that can be found. To deal with this problem, we provide a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for intersection handling, which is combined with Curriculum Learning to improve the training process. The state space is defined by two vectors, containing adversaries and ego vehicle information. We define a features extractor module and an actor-critic approach combined with Curriculum Learning techniques, adding complexity to the environment by increasing the number of vehicles. In order to address a complete autonomous driving system, a hybrid architecture is proposed. The operative level generates the driving commands, the strategy level defines the trajectory and the tactical level executes the high-level decisions. This high-level decision system is the main goal of this research. To address realistic experiments, we set up three scenarios: intersections with traffic lights, intersections with traffic signs and uncontrolled intersections. The results of this paper show that a Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm can infer ego vehicle-desired behavior for different intersection scenarios based only on the behavior of adversarial vehicles.

AB The uncertainties in tire cornering stiffness can degrade the path following the performance of autonomous vehicles, especially in low adhesive conditions, to deal with this problem, a novel multi-model adaptive predictive control is proposed in this study. Firstly, a model predictive path following controller is designed based on a combined model of vehicle dynamics and road-related kinematics relationship. Then, to deal with the model uncertainties, the multiple model adaptive theory is introduced, and the recursive least adaptive law is proposed with its convergence proved by Lyapunov theory. Finally, the multiple-model adaptive law is combined with the proposed model predictive control by a convex polytope of tire cornering stiffness. In this way, the proposed algorithm can be adaptive to the uncertainties of tire cornering stiffness. Simulation results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method to the uncertainties of the tire cornering stiffness resulting in an excellent performance in any road condition without introducing conservativeness.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold great potential to improve traffic safety. However, urban streets present a dynamic environment where unforeseen and complex scenarios can arise. The establishment of a systematic framework to extract a variety of vehicle driving scenarios could empower AVs to learn from and effectively navigate various situations. This study introduces a driving anomaly scenario extraction (DAnoScenE) framework tailored for AVs operating in urban street settings. The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) is used to showcase the framework's capability to capture an extensive range of realistic driving anomaly scenarios. The central process involves the detection and labeling of driving anomalies. To avoid the erroneous detected and labeled driving anomalies arising from issues such as outliers and noise within vehicle track data, a two-step approach is introduced to analyze and rectify vehicle movement parameters in raw data. To comprehend these driving anomalies and their associated scenarios, manual labeling identifies causative factors of scenarios such as traffic signals and behaviors of other agents, forming three scenario groups: Signal Interaction, Agent Interaction, and Other. A multimodal model is developed to classify scenario groups, complemented by a segmentation process that further divides groups into specific scenarios based on simple conditions. The results show that recognition accuracy for driving anomaly scenario groups achieved 98.4%, and the scenario segmentation method achieved 100% accuracy by simple conditions. The proposed framework provides valuable support for the advancement of autonomous driving algorithms and comprehensive AV testing, with a specific emphasis on navigating abnormal driving environments.

Its solution, together with the back-stepping and the forwarding control design methods, is exploited in the control of the nonlinear lateral dynamics of a vehicle. Even though the theoretical studies of the lateral control of autonomous vehicles are traditionally applied to lane keeping cases, the results can be applied to broader range of areas, such as lane changing cases. The comparison between the performances of the closed-loop systems with the given controller and a typical human driver is given and demonstrates the speediness and the effectiveness of the feedback controller.

AB Conventional autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems derive the relative distance of a curve using a curvature calculated through an in-vehicle sensor. However, as the AEB system cannot reflect geometric factors of a curve with variable curvature, it does not accurately estimate relative distances, based on which the AEB performance is evaluated. Accordingly, an AEB system reflecting the geometric information of curves needs to be considered and developed to improve the AEB performance for curves. This study proposes a method to improve the performance of AEB systems for curves through curvilinear coordinate conversion, which is used to reflect the geometric information of roads for the navigation of an autonomous vehicle. Both the host and target vehicles are located by means of curvilinear coordinate conversion. The positions thus identified are used to calculate the relative distance and lanes. Finally, the hazard risk criterion-that is, time-to-collision (TTC)-is derived using the proposed AEB system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AEB system, this study compares it with the conventional AEB system by analyzing the collision avoidance performance on curves through relative distances and TTC.

AB In this paper, the effects of wheel slip estimation and compensation of trajectory tracking for orchard applications were investigated. A slippage estimator was developed and adapted into a car-like robot model. Steering and velocity commands were generated using a model-based control approach. The whole system was implemented and tested on an autonomous orchard vehicle that has steerable front wheels and actuated rear wheels. A high accuracy positioning system was used to estimate the longitudinal and lateral slip velocities while the vehicle is moving. A laser scanning range finder was placed at the front centre of the vehicle, which was used to detect rows of trees in the orchard. Procedures were first tested in a non-flat but open space, which was covered with snow. Then it was tested on an experimental orchard where the surface was covered with heavy mud and the vehicle was expected to follow trajectories that span multiple rows in the orchard. The vehicle detected individual trees as well as rows of trees to track the centre of each row and manoeuvred from one row to the next. The experimental results showed that trajectory tracking performance of the vehicle was enhanced via integrating a slippage estimator into the system model. Furthermore, using the slippage estimation in the system model increased the accuracy, repeatability and performance of the control system. (C) 2016 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vehicle lane-level localization is a fundamental technology in autonomous driving. To achieve accurate and consistent performance, a common approach is to use the LIDAR technology. However, it is expensive and computational demanding, and thus not a practical solution in many situations. This paper proposes a stereovision system, which is of low cost, yet also able to achieve high accuracy and consistency. It integrates a new lane line detection algorithm with other lane marking detectors to effectively identify the correct lane line markings. It also fits multiple road models to improve accuracy. An effective stereo 3D reconstruction method is proposed to estimate vehicle localization. The estimation consistency is further guaranteed by a new particle filter framework, which takes vehicle dynamics into account. Experiment results based on image sequences taken under different visual conditions showed that the proposed system can identify the lane line markings with 98.6% accuracy. The maximum estimation error of the vehicle distance to lane lines is 16 cm in daytime and 26 cm at night, and the maximum estimation error of its moving direction with respect to the road tangent is 0.06 rad in daytime and 0.12 rad at night. Due to its high accuracy and consistency, the proposed system can be implemented in autonomous driving vehicles as a practical solution to vehicle lane-level localization.

AB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) utilizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars is widely recognized as an essential component for autonomous driving applications. In this article, we present a Reconfigurable Holographic Surface (RHS)-aided SLAM system, incorporating federated learning. The hardware cost of autonomous driving systems can be significantly reduced by replacing the expensive phased array antennas, traditionally used in mmWave radars, with the low-cost RHS metasurface antenna. Furthermore, multiple vehicles can collaborate through the federated learning framework, obtaining additional sensed data to enhance SLAM performance. However, the distinctive radiation structure of the RHS and the information exchange within the federated learning framework introduce complexities to the overall SLAM system design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-vehicle SLAM protocol that regulates RHS-based radar sensing and data processing across multiple vehicles. Additionally, we design algorithms for RHS radiation optimization and federated learning-based localization and mapping. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach when compared to existing phased array-based and non-cooperative schemes.

TI A Small and Lightweight Autonomous Laser Mapping System without GPS
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
ID MODEL
AB Autonomous mapping systems execute multiple tasks that include navigation, location, and map generation via the collaborative work of multiple sensors. They are the object of a substantial research focus in the fields of robotics and remote sensing. Although the state-of-the-art mobile mapping systems typically found in ready-made vehicles or robots are reliable, they are rather large and heavy, their cost is high, and they generally use GPS and an inertial measurement unit to position, so their working environments are limited. After reviewing the current state of autonomous mapping systems, we describe the design and development of a small and lightweight autonomous mapping system (ASQ-6DMapSys) without GPS, which incorporates low-cost sensors and components. We describe the layout and selection strategy for sensors and other components in detail, and we present the design methodology for each subsystem. The ASQ-6DMapSys employs a two-dimensional (2D) lidar, an inclinometer, and two wheel encoders, which constitute a pose subsystem that uses extended Kalman filtering and simultaneous localization and mapping techniques to compute the pose of the vehicle body. A low-cost 3D lidar that we developed is also installed on the vehicle body, and the resultant data are aligned with the corresponding pose data of the vehicle body to build a 3D point cloud that describes the global geometry of the environment. We designed and developed every subsystem of the ASQ-6DMapSys, including the robot vehicle, so it will be easy to expand its functions in the future. The ASQ-6DMapSys performs well in indoor, outdoor, and tunnel environments, and the experiments in different environments show that the ASQ-6DMapSys is an effective, small, and lightweight autonomous mapping system with a high performance/price ratio.

AB This paper addresses modeling and simulating pedestrian trajectories when interacting with an autonomous vehicle in a shared space. Most pedestrian-vehicle interaction models are not suitable for predicting individual trajectories. Data-driven models yield accurate predictions but lack generalizability to new scenarios, usually do not run in real time and produce results that are poorly explainable. Current expert models do not deal with the diversity of possible pedestrian interactions with the vehicle in a shared space and lack microscopic validation. We propose an expert pedestrian model that combines the social force model and a new decision model for anticipating pedestrian-vehicle interactions. The proposed model integrates different observed pedestrian behaviors, as well as the behaviors of the social groups of pedestrians, in diverse interaction scenarios with a car. We calibrate the model by fitting the parameters values on a training set. We validate the model and evaluate its predictive potential through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with ground truth trajectories. The proposed model reproduces observed behaviors that have not been replicated by the social force model and outperforms the social force model at predicting pedestrian behavior around the vehicle on the used dataset. The model generates explainable and real-time trajectory predictions. Additional evaluation on a new dataset shows that the model generalizes well to new scenarios and can be applied to an autonomous vehicle embedded prediction.

AB With rising use of ridesourcing apps and, eventually, self-driving vehicles, demands for airport parking spaces, rental cars, and, ultimately, air travel is expected to fall everywhere, relative to background trends. This study uses publicly available ridesourcing demand data for the Austin, Texas area to pursue simulations of a fleet of shared autonomous vehicles or "SAVs", and quantify airport revenue and operations impacts. Results suggest that dynamic ride-sharing (DRS) of centrally-dispatched vehicles across strangers (with current travel patterns) may reduce airport-related ground travel by up to 30% while reducing airport-access revenues by 46%, assuming ridesourcing permits continue to be charged $2 per trip. A time-varying zone-based toll around the airport can help offset lost parking and car-rental (but not seat-mile) revenues and potentially double present-day airport-access revenues. Such policies can come at the cost of adding non-revenue ridesourcing and SAV miles to the rest of the network, when incentivizing SAVs to leave the airport zone after a dropoff, in order to avoid curbside congestion. A combination of DRS and use of access fees on all commercial vehicles dropping off or picking up travelers can achieve a useful middle ground.

AB The driver-automation shared driving is a transition to fully-autonomous driving, in which human driver and vehicular controller cooperatively share the control authority. This paper investigates the shared steering control of semi-autonomous vehicles with uncertainty from imprecise parameter. By considering driver's lane-keeping behavior on the vehicle system, a driver-automation shared driving model is introduced for control purpose. Based on the interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy theory, moreover, the driver-automation shared driving model with uncertainty from imprecise parameter is described using an IT2 fuzzy model. After that, the corresponding IT2 fuzzy controller is designed and a direct Lyapunov method is applied to analyze the system stability. In this work, sufficient design conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived, to guarantee the closed-loop stability of the driver-automation shared control system. In addition, an H-infinity performance is studied to ensure the robustness of control system. Finally, simulation-based results are provided to demonstrate the performance of proposed control method. Furthermore, an existing type-1 fuzzy controller is introduced as comparison to verify the superiority of the proposed IT2 fuzzy controller.

AB The ability of artificial intelligence to drive toward an intended destination is a key component of an autonomous vehicle. Different paradigms are now being employed to address artificial intelligence advancement. On the one hand, modular pipelines break down the driving model into submodels, such as perception, maneuver planning and control. On the other hand, we used the end-to-end driving method to assign raw sensor data directly to vehicle control signals. The latter is less well-studied but is becoming more popular since it is easier to use. This article focuses on end-to-end autonomous driving, using RGB pictures as the primary sensor input data. The autonomous vehicle is equipped with a camera and active sensors, such as LiDAR and Radar, for safe navigation. Active sensors (e.g., LiDAR) provide more accurate depth information than passive sensors. As a result, this paper examines whether combining the RGB from the camera and active depth information from LiDAR has better results in end-to-end artificial driving than using only a single modality. This paper focuses on the early fusion of multi-modality and demonstrates how it outperforms a single modality using the CARLA simulator.

   IMPACT
AB As connectivity and automation make their way in to transportation systems, they are expected to have a forceful impact, drastically changing road transportation. The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is expected to advance safety and comfort. But, they can also affect characteristics of road networks, such as capacities, delays and efficiency. To foresee important challenges, reinforce potential benefits and reduce potential disadvantages of this new disruptive technology, its impacts should be well studied and understood before their anticipated introduction. In this paper, a microscopic simulation framework to estimate these impacts is developed. Simulation experiments are conducted for various traffic mixtures of manually driven vehicles, AVs and CAVs, different desired time headways settings and traffic demand levels, to evaluate the sensitivity of the network performance to these factors. The ring road of Antwerp is used for the case study. Thus, the results and conclusions refer to a large real-world network. The consequences of the introduction of AVS and CAVs on traffic flow and pollutant emissions are evaluated. The results show that depending on the demand, AVs introduction can have negative effects on traffic flow, while CAVs may benefit the network performance, depending on their market penetration.

AB This paper investigates a dynamic motion planning approach and an adaptive tracking control scheme for a class of two-wheeled autonomous vehicle with an underactuated pendular suspension subject to nonholonomic constraint. Compared with the wheeled inverted pendulum system, this kind of two-wheeled pendular suspension (WPS) vehicle is more suitable for autonomous exploration in the complex unstructured environment. By Lagrange principle, a four-independent-coordinate dynamic model, which can describe the multivariate, nonlinear, and underactuated characteristics of the system, is first proposed. Besides, a reduced order dynamic is developed in the following so as to tackle the nonholonomic problem, and then the three-independent-coordinate reduced order dynamic is divided into an actuated part constituted by the rotational subsystem, and an underactuated part combined by the longitudinal and the swing angle subsystems. The sliding mode control (SMC) technique is utilized to construct the controller; especially, a composite sliding mode surface is proposed which can realize the velocity tracking and oscillation suppression for pendular suspension simultaneously. Furthermore, the adaptive mechanism is employed to update the true values of the inaccessible physical parameters which can enhance the adaptability of the WPS vehicle in unstructured environment. In addition, a dynamic motion planning method is presented, by aid of which the vehicle can track an arbitrary trajectory in Cartesian coordinate. The simulation results show the effectiveness and merits of the proposed control approaches.

AB With the advent of autonomous vehicles society will need to confront a new set of risks which, for the first time, includes the ability of socially embedded forms of artificial intelligence to make complex risk mitigation decisions: decisions that will ultimately engender tangible life and death consequences. Since AI decisionality is inherently different to human decision-making processes, questions are therefore raised regarding how AI weighs decisions, how we are to mediate these decisions, and what such decisions mean in relation to others. Therefore, society, policy, and end-users, need to fully understand such differences. While AI decisions can be contextualised to specific meanings, significant challenges remain in terms of the technology of AI decisionality, the conceptualisation of AI decisions, and the extent to which various actors understand them. This is particularly acute in terms of analysing the benefits and risks of AI decisions. Due to the potential safety benefits, autonomous vehicles are often presented as significant risk mitigation technologies. There is also a need to understand the potential new risks which autonomous vehicle driving decisions may present. Such new risks are framed as decisional limitations in that artificial driving intelligence will lack certain decisional capacities. This is most evident in the inability to annotate and categorise the driving environment in terms of human values and moral understanding. In both cases there is a need to scrutinise how autonomous vehicle decisional capacity is conceptually framed and how this, in turn, impacts a wider grasp of the technology in terms of risks and benefits. This paper interrogates the significant shortcomings in the current framing of the debate, both in terms of safety discussions and in consideration of AI as a moral actor, and offers a number of ways forward.

AB In this paper, a hybrid Voronoi-based ant colony optimization (V-ACO) technique for multiple autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) is proposed to solve adaptive ocean sampling problem. The Voronoi-based scheme utilizes Voronoi partition with tournament selection method that enables more Voronoi edges lie in higher scientific interest regions. This scheme is then combined with ant colony optimization (ACO) using modified heuristic function, to find collision-free optimal trajectories for multiple AMVs to collect ocean measurements. For comparison, conventional ACO, rapidly-exploring random tree star (RRT*) and Dijkstra's algorithm are also applied and tested for adaptive ocean sampling. Results of simulation tests specifically highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed V-ACO path planner in generating trajectories of multi-AMVs that maximize data collection for adaptive ocean sampling in high scientific interest areas while considering specified mission time, inter-vehicle and obstacles avoidance constraints. Furthermore, field experiments validate the capability of the proposed V-ACO path planner in finding optimal solutions for adaptive ocean sampling. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This article investigates the adaptive learning control problem for a class of nonlinear autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with unknown uncertainties. The unknown nonlinear functions in the AUVs are approximated by radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), in which the weight updating laws are designed via gradient descent algorithm. The proposed gradient descent-based control scheme guarantees the semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness (SUUB) of the system and the fast convergence of the weight updating laws. In order to reduce the computational burden during the backstepping control design process, the command-filter-based design technique is incorporated into the adaptive learning control strategy. Finally, simulation studies are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB An improved autonomous underwater vehicle federal integrated navigation method based on two-stage position matching technology is proposed in this study to solve the problem of positioning divergence caused by the defects of error accumulation in an inertial navigation system. The improved two-stage position matching method includes the acquisition and preprocessing of the strap-down inertial navigation system and indicates track sequences and elevation measurement sequences. The first-stage position matching is based on iterative closest contour point, while the second-stage position matching is based on an affine algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm solves the problem of the limitation of the rigid transformation of traditional iterative closest contour point and effectively resolves the matching failure caused by the large initial position error of long-time navigation.

AB Set point tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) via robust model predictive control (RMPC) is considered. Input-constrained RMPC with integral action, which has been developed in our previous work, is used to control the AUV in this study. In order to derive a RMPC control rule, non-linear dynamics of AUV with six degree of freedom is linearized at certain operating points. So, horizontal and vertical plane dynamics of system are represented by linear models which have polytopic uncertainties. Since the derived control rule will be used in real time, the computation time should be reduced. To overcome this computational time problem and get rid of trial-error step of Algorithm 1, a new algorithm is proposed here. The simulations are carried out using the control rule based on this algorithm and these results are presented.

AB We present the results of a chemical survey at a submarine volcano, Teishi Knoll, obtained using a submersible in-situ Mn analyzer (GAMOS) mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) platform. During this survey, high-resolution data of dissolved Mn were obtained in three dimensions in nearly real time. The AUV enabled continuous detailed observations along a preprogrammed pathway, which could not have been performed with conventional CTD hydrocasts. During this observation, anomalously high dissolved Mn concentrations were obtained within the crater, corresponding to high water temperatures. The anomalies might be a hydrothermal signature due to volcanic activity from the crater.

AB In this paper, on algorithm for autonomous stair climbing with a tracked vehicle is presented. The proposed method achieves robust performance under real-world conditions, without assuming prior knowledge of the stair geometry, the dynamics of the vehicle's interaction with the stair surface, or lighting conditions. The approach relies on fast and accurate estimation of the robot's heading and its position relative to the stair boundaries. An extended Kalman filter is used for quaternion-based attitude estimation, fusing rotational velocity measurements from a 3-axial gyroscope, and measurements of the stair edges acquired with an onboard camera. A two-tiered controller, comprised of a centering- and a heading-control module, utilizes the estimates to guide the robot rapidly, safely, and accurately upstairs. Both the theoretical analysis and implementation of the algorithm are presented in detail, and extensive experimental results demonstrating the algorithm's performance are described.

AB Autonomous in-flight aerial refueling is an important capability for the future deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles, because they will likely be ferried in flight to overseas theaters of operation instead of being shipped unassembled in containers. A reliable sensor, capable of providing accurate relative position measurements of sufficient bandwidth, is key to such a capability. A vision-based sensor and navigation system is introduced that enables precise and reliable probe-and-drogue autonomous aerial refueling for non-micro-sized unmanned aerial vehicles. A performance robust controller is developed and integrated with the sensor system, and feasibility of the total system is demonstrated by simulated docking maneuvers with both a stationary drogue and a drogue subjected to light turbulence. An unmanned air vehicle model is used for controller design and simulation. Results indicate that the integrated sensor and controller enables precise aerial refueling, including consideration of realistic measurement errors and disturbances.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have advanced rapidly in recent years as they promise to be safe and minimize the burden coming from the driving task. AVs share the road with various categories of vehicles as Emergency Vehicles (EMVs) (e.g police and ambulance vehicles). When being approached by an active EMV, it is natural to expect all vehicles to cooperate with EMV, such that the EMV travel time is minimized. The decision-making block of an AV includes the responsibility of instructing the AV to change lanes, which is typically handled by the Lane Change Decision (LCD) model. A typical LCD model tends to overlook the presence of EMVs around, as they neglect the impact of the lane change on the EMV utility. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Emergency Vehicle Aware LCD via utilizing Deep Reinforcement Learning. To our best knowledge, this is one of the pioneering works that propose a DRL solution for the problem, addressing important limitations that have been identified. The proposed solution was evaluated against a rule-based LCD known as MOBIL in terms of safety and level of cooperativeness with the EMV. Some key results found from the comparison between the proposed solution and MOBIL are (1) identical safety levels,(2) proposed solution is takes far less time to give up the lane when being approached by an EMV, and (3) proposed solution never blocks the path of the EMV, whereas MOBIL occasionally block the path.

AB Ensuring the safety of fully autonomous vehicles requires a multi-disciplinary approach across all the levels of functional hierarchy, from hardware fault tolerance, to resilient machine learning, to cooperating with humans driving conventional vehicles, to validating systems for operation in highly unstructured environments, to appropriate regulatory approaches. Significant open technical challenges include validating inductive learning in the face of novel environmental inputs and achieving the very high levels of dependability required for full-scale fleet deployment. However, the biggest challenge may be in creating an end-to-end design and deployment process that integrates the safety concerns of a myriad of technical specialties into a unified approach.

AB Due to the broad attack surface and the lack of runtime protection, potential safety and security threats hinder the real-life adoption of autonomous vehicles. Although efforts have been made to mitigate some specific attacks, there are few works on the protection of the autonomous driving system, i.e., the control software system performing such as perception, decision making, and motion tracking. This article presents a decentralized self-protection framework called Guardauto to protect the autonomous driving system against runtime threats. First, Guardauto proposes an isolation model to decouple the autonomous driving system and isolate its components with a set of partitions. Second, Guardauto provides self-protection mechanisms for each target component, which combines different methods to monitor the target execution and plan adaption actions accordingly. Third, Guardauto provides cooperation among local self-protection mechanisms to identify the root-cause component in the case of cascading failures affecting multiple components. A prototype has been implemented and evaluated on the open-source autonomous driving system Autoware. Results show that Guardauto could effectively mitigate runtime failures and attacks, and protect the control system with acceptable performance overhead.

AB Changes in gravity and buoyancy of a Full Ocean Depth Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (FOD-AUV) during its descending and ascending process must be considered very carefully compared with a Human Occupied Vehicle (HOV) or a Remotely Pperated Vehicle (ROV) whose activities rely on human decision. We firstly designed a two-step weight dropping pattern to achieve a high descending and ascending efficiency and a gravity-buoyancy balance at designed depth. The static equations showed that gravity acceleration, seawater density and displacement are three key aspects affecting the balance. Secondly, we try our best to analysis the gravity and buoyancy changing according to the previous known scientific information, such as anomaly of gravity acceleration, changing of seawater states. Finally, we drew conclusion that gravity changes little (no more than 0.1 kgf, it is impossible to give a accurate value). A density-depth relationship at the Challenger Deep was acquired and the displacement changing of the FOD-AUV was calculated preciously. (C) 2018 Society of Naval Architects of Korea.

AB This paper focuses on global adaptive neural network control for a class of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of possibly large modeling parametric uncertainty. As the control inputs cannot directly act in the sway and heave directions, two virtual velocities defined here, plus three actual control actions provided by the thrusters and rudders, are used to achieve the convergence of the system errors to around zero. Motivated by real-time characteristics in the trajectory tracking, the proposed controller presents a significant advantage because it contains only one adaptive parameter to be updated online rather than the neural network weights. In addition, we also consider the practical situation that the velocities of the vehicle may experience sharp speed jumps when the position tracking errors initially change suddenly, which always results in thruster saturation. The biologically inspired model is introduced to smooth the virtual velocity commands such that the vehicle satisfies the control input and velocity constraints. Finally, comparison simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB The increasing number of vehicles on the road places high demands for autonomous driving in future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To realize automated services in ITSs, high-accuracy positioning is increasingly important, while positioning simultaneity for high-mobility vehicles should be guaranteed. Existing positioning systems have many constraints in locating vehicles in urban environments, making it difficult to meet the performance requirements. With the development of 6G, massive numbers of high-frequency base stations (BSs) are expected to be deployed to ensure connectivity and benefit positioning performance. However, high-frequency signals have severe distance attenuations and strong sensitivity to the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environment that is prevalent in cities. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), with its ability to control signal reflections and create beyond-LoS communications, is a promising technology to improve positioning performance in urban vehicular networks. In this article, we discuss the existing positioning systems and explain the potentials of IRS for future BS-enabled positioning systems. We also provide an example to illustrate how to optimize the performance of IRS-aided vehicle positioning systems. Furthermore, we highlight important issues and give future directions.

AB The use of intelligent systems to prevent accidents and safety enhancement in vehicles is becoming a requirement. Besides, the development of autonomous cars is progressing every day. One of the main challenges in transportation is the high mortality rate of vehicles colliding with pedestrians. This issue becomes severe due to various and abnormal situations. This paper proposes a new intelligent algorithm for pedestrian collision avoidance based on deep reinforcement learning. A deep Q-network (DQN) is designed to discover an optimal driving policy for pedestrian collision avoidance in diverse environments and conditions. The algorithm interacts with the vehicle and the pedestrian agents and uses a specific reward function to train the model. We have used Car Learning to Act (CARLA), an open-source autonomous driving simulator, for training and verifying the model in various conditions. Applying the proposed algorithm to a simulated environment reduces vehicles and pedestrians' collision by about 64 %, depending on the environment. Our findings offer an early-warning solution to mitigate the risk of a crash of vehicles and pedestrians in the real world.

AB This study micro-simulates 2% and 5% of the region's 9.5 million daily person-trips and 20% of trips in the central Twin Cities with shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) in the 7-county Minneapolis-Saint Paul region using MATSim to appreciate the effects of different trip-making densities and curb-use restrictions. Results suggest the average SAV in this region can serve at most 30 person-trips per day with less than 5 min average wait time, but generates 13% more vehicle-miles traveled (VMT). With dynamic ride-sharing (DRS), SAV VMT fell, on average, by 17% and empty VMT (eVMT) fell by 26%. Compared to idling-at-curb scenarios, parking restricted scenarios generated 8% more VMT. Relying on 52 mi/gallon hybrid electric SAVs, as opposed to a 31 mi/gallon conventional drivetrain SAV, is estimated to lower travelers' energy use by 21% and reduce tailpipe emissions by 30%, assuming no new or longer trips. Similarly, a 106 mi/gallon equivalent battery-electric fleet does much better by lowering energy use by 64%.

AB Land efficient last mile delivery concepts are key to reducing the traffic in cities and to minimising its environmental impact. This paper proposes a decision support method that evaluates the autonomous delivery concept and applies it to one year's worth of real parcel delivery data in London. Deliveries to modular and fixed lockers with autonomous delivery vans and road-based autonomous lockers (RAL) and sidewalk autonomous delivery robots (SADRs) have been simulated. Various types of autonomous delivery van fleets, depot locations, customer modes of transport, parcel demand levels, parcel locker network densities and adjustment frequencies of modular lockers are considered. A routing and scheduling algorithm is used to optimise delivery tours and vehicle choice. The optimisation algorithm finds both the optimal number of collection and delivery points (CDPs) and the delivery concept (e.g., modular lockers, sidewalk autonomous delivery robot) depending on the customer mode chosen. The results show that modular lockers which are adjusted weekly are the best option for the current or higher parcel demand levels and road-autonomous parcel lockers (RAL-R) are the best option at the lowest parcel demand level.

AB Dedicated Lanes (DLs) have become prevalent on highways and arterial roads as they help accelerate carpooling vehicles or buses. However, capacity is wasted if the penetration rates of these vehicles with priority are low. Wasted capacity can be utilized optimally by implementing Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology and granting General-Purpose (GP) vehicles the ability to traverse on DLs. However, existing research on flexible DLs has mostly focused on preset, static operating rules. In this study, we propose a true, active DL management strategy named Dedicated Lane with Intermittent Priority (DLIP) that operates at the vehicle level. An Optimal Right of Way Allocation (ORWA) model is proposed that maximizes the benefits of allowing GP vehicles into the DLs. To validate the proposed strategy, a simulation model based on VISSIM was developed. Results under various demand scenarios demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms traditional DL management strategies in terms of overall productivity, with improvements ranging from 10% to 25%.

AB The introduction of more automation into our vehicles is increasing our ability to avoid or mitigate the effects of collisions. Early systems could brake when a likely collision was detected, while more advanced systems will be able to steer to avoid or reconfigure a collision during the same circumstances. This paper addresses how the post-impact motion of an impacted vehicle could be included in the decision-making process of severity minimisation motion planning. A framework is proposed that builds on previous work by the authors, combining models from motion planning, vehicle dynamics, and accident reconstruction. This framework can be configured for different contexts by adjusting its cost function according to relevant risks. Simulations of the unified system are carried out and analysed from the perspective of vehicle model complexity and collision parameters sensitivity. Additionally, effects are highlighted concerning different modelling decisions, with respect to vehicle dynamics models and collision models, that are important to consider in further research.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB In this paper, a novel approach is presented to solve the trajectory tracking problem for autonomous vehicles. This approach is based on the use of a cascade control where the external loop solves the position control using a novel Takagi Sugeno-Model Predictive Control (TS-MPC) approach and the internal loop is in charge of the dynamic control of the vehicle using a Takagi Sugeno-Linear Quadratic Regulator technique designed via Linear Matrix Inequalities (TS-LMI-LQR). Both techniques use a TS representation of the kinematic and dynamic models of the vehicle. In addition, a novel Takagi-Sugeno estimator-Moving Horizon Estimator-Unknown Input Observer (TS-MHE-UIO) is presented. This method estimates the dynamic states of the vehicle optimally as well as the force of friction acting on the vehicle that is used to reduce the control efforts. The innovative contribution of the TS-MPC and TS-MHE-UIO techniques is that using the TS model formulation of the vehicle allows us to solve the nonlinear problem as if it were linear, reducing computation times by 10-20 times. To demonstrate the potential of the TS-MPC, we propose a comparison between three methods of solving the kinematic control problem: Using the nonlinear MPC formulation (NL-MPC) with compensated friction force, the TS-MPC approach with compensated friction force, and TS-MPC without compensated friction force.

AB Autonomous-vehicle (AV) technologies are rapidly advancing, but a great deal remains to be learned about their interaction and perception on public roads. Research in this area usually relies on AV trials using naturalistic driving which are expensive with various legal and ethical obstacles designed to keep the general public safe. The emerging concept of Wizard-of-Oz simulation is a promising solution to this problem wherein the driver of a standard vehicle is hidden from the passenger using a physical partition, providing the illusion of riding in an AV. Furthermore, headmounted display (HMD) virtual reality (VR) has been proposed as a means of providing a Wizardof-Oz protocol for on-road simulations of AVs. Such systems have potential to support a variety of study conditions at low cost, enabling simulation of a variety of vehicles, driving conditions, and circumstances. However, the feasibility of such systems has yet to be shown. This study makes use of a within-subjects factorial design for examining and evaluating a virtual reality autonomous vehicle (VRAV) system, with the aim of better understanding the differences between stationary and on-road simulations, both with and without HMD VR. More specifically, this study examines the effects on user experience of conditions including presence, arousal, simulator sickness and task workload. Participants indicated a realistic and immersive driving experience as part of subjective evaluation of the VRAV system, indicating the system is a promising tool for humanautomation interaction and future AV technology developments.

AB Automotive companies continue to develop integrated safety, sustainability, and reliability features that can help mitigate some of the most common driving risks associated with autonomous vehicles (AVs). Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) offer practical solutions to use control strategies to cut down fuel usage and emissions. AVs and HEVs are combined to take the advantages of each kind to solve the problem of wasting energy. This paper presents an intelligent driver assistance system, including adaptive cruise control (ACC) and an energy management system (EMS), for HEVs. Our proposed ACC determines the desired acceleration and safe distance with the lead car through a switched model predictive control (MPC) and a neuro-fuzzy (NF) system. The performance criteria of the switched MPC toggles between speed and distance control appropriately and its stability is mathematically proven. The EMS intelligently control the energy consumption based on ACC commands. The results show that the driving risk is extremely reduced by using ACC-MPC and ACC-NF, and the vehicle energy consumption by driver assistance system based on ACC-NF is improved by 2.6%.

ID STABILITY
AB Technological advances in self-driving vehicles will soon enable the implementation of large-scale mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems. The efficient management of fleets of vehicles remains a key challenge, in particular to achieve a demand-aligned distribution of available vehicles, commonly referred to as rebalancing. In this article, we present a discrete-time model of an autonomous MoD system, in which unit capacity self-driving vehicles serve transportation requests consisting of a (time, origin, destination) tuple on a directed graph. Time delays in the discrete-time model are approximated as first-order lag elements yielding a sparse model suitable for model predictive control (MPC). The well-posedness of the model is demonstrated, and a characterization of its equilibrium points is given. Furthermore, we show the stabilizability of the model and propose an MPC scheme that, due to the sparsity of the model, can be applied even to large-scale cities. We verify the performance of the scheme in a multiagent transport simulation and demonstrate that service levels outperform those of the existing rebalancing schemes for identical fleet sizes.

ID TRACKING
AB Pedestrian detection is a critical feature of autonomous vehicle or advanced driver assistance system. This paper presents a novel instrument for pedestrian detection by combining stereo vision cameras with a thermal camera. A new dataset for vehicle applications is built from the test vehicle recorded data when driving on city roads. Data received from multiple cameras are aligned using trifocal tensor with pre-calibrated parameters. Candidates are generated from each image frame using sliding windows across multiple scales. A reconfigurable detector framework is proposed, in which feature extraction and classification are two separate stages. The input to the detector can be the color image, disparity map, thermal data, or any of their combinations. When applying to convolutional channel features, feature extraction utilizes the first three convolutional layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network cascaded with an AdaBoost classifier. The evaluation results show that it significantly outperforms the traditional histogram of oriented gradients features. The proposed pedestrian detector with multi-spectral cameras can achieve 9% log-average miss rate. The experimental dataset is made available at http://computing.wpi.edu/dataset.html.

ID VEHICLE CONTROL
AB We address the problem of ego-vehicle navigation in dense simulated traffic environments populated by road agents with varying driver behaviors. Navigation in such environments is challenging due to unpredictability in agents' actions caused by their heterogeneous behaviors. We present a new simulation technique consisting of enriching existing traffic simulators with behavior-rich trajectories corresponding to varying levels of aggressiveness. We generate these trajectories with the help of a driver behavior modeling algorithm. We then use the enriched simulator to train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy that consists of a set of high-level vehicle control commands and use this policy at test time to perform local navigation in dense traffic. Our policy implicitly models the interactions between traffic agents and computes safe trajectories for the ego-vehicle accounting for aggressive driver maneuvers such as overtaking, over-speeding, weaving, a nd sudden lane changes. Our enhanced behavior-rich simulator can be used for generating datasets that consist of trajectories corresponding to diverse driver behaviors and traffic densities, and our behavior-based navigation scheme can be combined with state-of-the-art navigation algorithms.

DE Unmanned vehicle; Neural network; Fuzzy logic; ANFIS; Control
AB A Neuro-fuzzy control method for an Unmanned Vehicle (UV) simulation is described. The objective is guiding an autonomous vehicle to a desired destination along a desired path in an environment characterized by a terrain and a set of distinct objects, such as obstacles like donkey traffic lights and cars circulating in the trajectory. The autonomous navigate ability and road following precision are mainly influenced by its control strategy and realtime control performance. Fuzzy Logic Controller can very well describe the desired system behavior with simple "if-then" relations owing the designer to derive "if-then" rules manually by trial and error. On the other hand, Neural Networks perform function approximation of a system but cannot interpret the solution obtained neither check if its solution is plausible. The two approaches are complementary. Combining them, Neural Networks will allow learning capability while Fuzzy-Logic will bring knowledge representation (Neuro-Fuzzy). In this paper, an artificial neural network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) controller is described and implemented to navigate the autonomous vehicle. Results show several improvements in the control system adjusted by neuro-fuzzy techniques in comparison to the previous methods like Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

ID PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS
AB This paper investigates formation control protocols for autonomous vehicular strings with vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication connections. To this end, a four-layer framework is first proposed to illustrate the cooperative mechanism within and across strings. Then, cooperative control protocols are designed based on vehicle role, i.e., leader or follower, in vehicular multi-string. In particular, longitudinal controllers are designed for single string and multiple strings by incorporating inter-vehicle gap and velocity difference of the follower vehicle with respect to the preceding vehicle and the lead vehicle. In addition, lateral controllers are proposed for single string and multiple strings based on the artificial function method. The proposed protocols ensure that follower vehicles asymptotically track the leader within each string, while different vehicular strings can form a desired platoon pattern. The study further analyzes the stability and consensus of the proposed control protocols using the Routh-Hurwitz stable criterion and the Lyapunov technique. Numerical experiments are performed for two cooperative mechanisms-parallel and serial. Results from numerical experiments illustrate the effects of the proposed control protocols on road throughput and demonstrate their effectiveness for position and velocity consensuses.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and cooperative automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to largely reshape our mobility systems. The limited deployment of AVs and CAVs on roads makes it difficult to fully assess their impact and interactions with other road users. Advanced simulations are often sought for conducting accelerated tests of AVs and CAVs in a virtual environment. However, existing off-the-shelf simulators are typically focused on conventional traffic simulation and human-driving simulation. Advanced simulators that enable core functionalities (e.g., sensing and communication) of AVs and CAVs have been underexploited. In this paper, the authors aim to develop a realistic co-simulation framework for testing autonomous driving and cooperative driving automation (CDA). The proposed co-simulation framework utilizes the open-source concept to support the AV and CAV community in developing and deploying AV and CAV technologies. This framework integrates multiple open-source platforms, including Eclipse MOSAIC (TM) simulation framework, Eclipse Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO (TM)) traffic simulator, and CARLA AV driving simulator. The framework enables AV and CAV simulation in mixed traffic environments. The developed co-simulation models have been tested with different scales of networks and traffic flow. The assessment of the co-simulation framework shows that it can support faster-than-real-time simulation for use in accelerated tests with more realistic scenarios. In addition, the developed co-simulation framework is proven to be extensible with the inclusion of other network simulators for supporting vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication among vehicles.

AB It is a striking fact that the path tracking accuracy of autonomous vehicles based on active front wheel steering is poor under high-speed and large-curvature conditions. In this study, an adaptive path tracking control strategy that coordinates active front wheel steering and direct yaw moment is proposed based on model predictive control algorithm. The recursive least square method with a forgetting factor is used to identify the rear tire cornering stiffness and update the path tracking system prediction model. To adaptively adjust the priorities of path tracking accuracy and vehicle stability, an adaptive strategy based on fuzzy rules is applied to change the weight coefficients in the cost function. An adaptive control strategy for coordinating active front steering and direct yaw moment is proposed to improve the path tracking accuracy under high-speed and large-curvature conditions. To ensure vehicle stability, the sideslip angle, yaw rate and zero moment methods are used to construct optimization constraints based on the model predictive control frame. It is verified through simulation experiments that the proposed adaptive coordinated control strategy can improve the path tracking accuracy and ensure vehicle stability under high-speed and large-curvature conditions.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Path planning is the precondition for Hybrid Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (HAUV) to enter the submerged area to undertake a mission. The influence of ocean currents on HAUV should be further investigated to obtain a time-optimal path. The improved A* algorithm and the neural network model are employed in this paper to plan a time-optimal path for the vehicle. The HAUV in glider mode is capable of traveling forward mainly through the zigzag motion in vertical plane. Since the vehicle can only receive the command orders when it surfaces from the water, the path is expected to include a series of discrete waypoints in the water surface. At the same time, the presence of submerged riverbeds is also taken into account to avoid hazards for HAUVs when it navigates in the water. It can be demonstrated that ocean currents can be used to decrease the operating time. The comparison results of the two methods verify that the size of the map affects the calculation time. In addition, the neural node represented method surpasses the modified A* method, especially when the map is too large.

AB Robust and adaptive vehicle state estimation and tracking algorithms have become a very important part within the autonomous driving field. The family of interacting multiple model (IMM) filters has shown to provide very effective and accurate state estimation in systems whose behavior patterns change significantly over time. The main reason for the improved performance of IMM filters compared to single model approaches is the mode mixing, which constantly aligns the different models. This paper proposes an innovative way for the mode mixing, when the state-vectors of the models are of different size. The proposed mixing approach consists of two parts: firstly mixing the common states and secondly weighting between original and mixed states based on the model probabilities. Results from artificial simulations and real world measurement setups are shown to demonstrate the validity of the approach. Compared to previously suggested solutions, the proposed approach is more general and the overall complexity of the mode mixing step is reduced, which is the main contribution of the presented paper.

AB In this article, a distributed cooperative path-maneuvering control approach is developed for the region-searching of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles under both dynamic uncertainties and ocean currents. Salient contributions are as follows: (1) by virtue of boustrophedon motions and trigonometric functions, the coverage path-planning design is first proposed to generate multiple parameterized paths, which can guarantee that the region-searching is successfully completed by one trial; (2) combining with sliding mode and adaptive technique, distributed maneuvering control laws for surge and yaw motions are employed to drive vehicles to track the assigned paths, thereby contributing to the cooperative maneuvering performance with high accuracy; (3) by the aid of graph theory, the distributed signal observer-based consensus protocols are developed for path parameter synchronization, and successfully apply to maintain the desired formation configuration. The globally asymptotical stability of the closed-loop signals is analyzed via the direct Lyapunov approach, and simulation studies on WL-II are conducted to illustrate the remarkable performance of the proposed path-maneuvering control approach.

AB Accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles and assessing the collision risks are essential to avoid side and rear-end collisions caused by cut-in. To improve the safety of autonomous vehicles in the mixed traffic, this study proposes a cut-in prediction and risk assessment method with considering the interactions of multiple traffic participants. The integration of the support vector machine and Gaussian mixture model (SVM-GMM) is developed to simultaneously predict cut-in behavior and trajectory. The dimension of the input features is reduced through Chebyshev fitting to improve the training efficiency as well as the online inference performance. Based on the predicted trajectory of the cut-in vehicle and the responsive actions of the autonomous vehicles, two risk measurements are introduced to formulate the comprehensive interaction risk through the combination of Sigmoid function and Softmax function. Finally, the comparative analysis is performed to validate the proposed method using the naturalistic driving data. The results show that the proposed method can predict the trajectory with higherprecision and effectively evaluate the risklevelofacut-in maneuver compared to the methods without considering interaction.

AB Growing concerns, regarding transport disadvantage and increased socioeconomic disparities, demand innovative ways to improve equity and make transportation systems smarter. One of the most anticipated developments within the field of smart mobility is driving automation systems. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve accessibility, affordability, safety and efficiency of transport systems, but come with risks including the intensification of private vehicle travel. Understanding public awareness is an important step to determine whether motivation and intention to use AVs will impact on its potential. This paper aims to investigate factors influencing public awareness of AVs as a solution to transport disadvantage. The study applies an ordinal logistic regression analysis to analyse survey data collected from the residents of Brisbane (Australia). Our findings reveal that awareness is positively correlated within young and middle-aged adults, low-income residents, disability, public transport users, and those who feel unsafe on public transport, while an increase in the number of household vehicles is negatively correlated. The study provides insights into public awareness towards the potential benefits of AVs, and highlights potential opportunities and challenges associated with these expectations.

AB Under a new wave of artificial intelligence, the transportation industry is facing a revolution similar to machines replacing animals one century ago. In this time, humans could, for the first time, be fully out of the control loop of personal transportation. However, revolution comes with disruption and uncertainty. This paper focuses on mapping various causal relationships during this significant transition phase and understanding the impacts of different influencing loops. A systems dynamic model is constructed including two different transportation methods (personal owned vehicle and car services) and three autonomy levels (non, semi, and fully). The US auto insurance industry was chosen as a major industry that will be impacted by autonomous vehicles' impacts and consequences. Consumer choices, product familiarity, and acceptance are modeled to represent purchasing behavior. Vehicle crash rate and loss ratio are considered to calculate the insurance industry's premium collections. Different scenarios are quantified and discussed. Several important causal loops are identified that will help achieve the faster growth of the technology. Several potentially new insurance products are evaluated.

AB Leveraging the advancements in sensor and mapping technologies, the collision-free autonomous vehicle becomes possible in the future. In this article, a case study of collision avoidance by active steering control is presented and verified by a driver-in-the-loop platform. The proposed control system integrates a risk assessment algorithm and a hierarchical model predictive control approach to ensure a safe driving. First, a fuzzy logic is used to estimate the potential conflict. Besides, a nonlinear model predictive control is introduced in the upper layer of the model predictive controller to generate a collision-free trajectory. Furthermore, the lower layer determines the optimal steering angle based on the linear time-variant model predictive control to follow the replanning path. The performance of the controller has been evaluated in the real-time driver-in-the-loop test. The results show that the autonomous vehicle is able to avoid the collision with the surrounding vehicle that is operated by a real driver, and the performance of collision avoidance is improved by means of the risk assessment.

AB The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has depicted a promising future of a safer and more efficient transportation system. To better induce this revolution, massive efforts have been spent on the technical competence of AVs. However, the human comfort in AVs has been an under-discussed yet important topic to the user acceptance of AVs. For the detection of human comfort, existing studies focus more on the physical influential factors of comfort such as sitting posture, vibration, and noise. With the introduction of AVs, psychological factors also have gained greater influence on human comfort. Despite existing studies of exploring correlations between human comfort and some physiological signals in automated driving contexts, there is few study on how human comfort level in AVs can be detected with these physiological signals. In this paper, we developed effective human comfort study approaches in autonomous vehicles with wearable sensors. We also proposed a machine learning based approach with adaptive feature selection to detect human comfort levels based on the wearable sensing data. The experimental results illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in studying human comfort in AVs.

AB Despite the significant technological progress with Autonomous Buses (ABs), there is still a limited understanding how users perceive and experience large, mass transit ABs in real-life traffic environments. This paper follows a pilot project on AB use by tourists in the city of Malaga, Spain. Discrete choice analysis was employed to study their willingness to use the AB and the passengers' actual satisfaction on board the AB. The obtained results reveal higher willingness levels to adopt ABs among individuals more open to new technologies and more environmentally conscious. Higher levels of satisfaction on board are reported by older passengers, women, employed, private vehicle users, and people with environmental consciousness and openness to new technologies. Finally, the research discusses how socio-demographics and personality-related barriers affect the further implementation of autonomous mobility in public transportation systems, adding new reflections on the capacity of ABs to support or even replace conventional buses.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS; VEHICLE; SYSTEMS
AB In this article, a spatial learning-based fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed for precise lateral tracking of autonomous vehicles subject to dynamical uncertainties, external disturbances as well as actuator failures. In order to facilitate the controller design, the uncertain vehicle dynamics are firstly transformed into a parametric form in the space domain, where the system uncertainties are reorganized and combined into the parametric and input distribution uncertainties. Furthermore, considering the under-actuated property of the vehicle dynamics, a novel technique in dealing with the non-square input distribution matrix is employed, in which a pseudo-like inverse matrix and a robust term are introduced into the controller to compensate the mismatch between the number of inputs and outputs. Then the proposed spatial learning-based fault tolerant control algorithm is developed, which is equipped with two adaptive parametric updating laws to estimate the parametric uncertainties and the multiplicative actuator faults correspondingly. Consequently, the convergence of the control algorithm is analyzed rigorously under the framework of composite energy function. Case studies verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB To improve the safety of pedestrians crossing the road in the mixed traffic conditions, this study proposed an active collision avoidance method based on the prediction of pedestrian trajectory. A convolutional neural network is applied to identify the motion feature of pedestrians crossing the road in the image of an automated driving environment with vehicular sensors. Then combined with the pedestrian motion parameters, a new Kalman filtering algorithm is proposed to analyze the change of pedestrian motion feature and predict the trajectory of the pedestrian. Furthermore, a PDS (Pedestrian, Distance, and Speed) estimated braking distance model based on pedestrian characteristics, the distance between pedestrian and vehicle, and the speed of the vehicle is established in this study for the autonomous vehicle controlling speed in advance to avoid risks. It improves both the crossing road pedestrian safety and efficiency of traffic. Eventually, simulations based on CarSim/Simulink are designed to verify the validity of the method. Results show that the method proposed can effectively predict pedestrian trajectories and realize active collision avoidance under the time delay of the detection link.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) are set to revolutionise the way in which we use our transportation system. However, we do not fully understand how the integration of wireless and autonomous technology into the road transportation network affects overall network dynamism. This paper uses the theoretical principles underlying Distributed Cognition to explore the dependencies and interdependencies that exist between system agents located within the road environment, traffic management centres and other external agencies in both non-connected and connected transportation systems. This represents a significant step forward in modelling complex sociotechnical systems as it shows that the principles underlying Distributed Cognition can be applied to macro-level systems using the visual representations afforded by the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) method.

AB In this paper, a study of the odometric system for the autonomous cart Verdino, which is an electric vehicle based on a golf cart, is presented. A mathematical model of the odometric system is derived from cart movement equations, and is used to compute the vehicle position and orientation. The inputs of the system are the odometry encoders, and the model uses the wheels diameter and distance between wheels as parameters. With this model, a least square minimization is made in order to get the nominal best parameters. This model is updated, including a real time wheel diameter measurement improving the accuracy of the results. A neural network model is used in order to learn the odometric model from data. Tests are made using this neural network in several configurations and the results are compared to the mathematical model, showing that the neural network can outperform the first proposed model.

AB Autonomous vehicles admit consideration of novel traffic behaviors such as reservation based intersection controls and dynamic lane reversal. We present a cell transmission model formulation for dynamic lane reversal. For deterministic demand, we formulate the dynamic lane reversal control problem for a single link as an integer program and derive theoretical results. In reality, demand is not known perfectly at arbitrary times in the future. To address stochastic demand, we present a Markov decision process formulation. Due to the large state size, the Markov decision process is intractable. However, based on theoretical results from the integer program, we derive an effective heuristic. We demonstrate significant improvements over a fixed lane configuration both on a single bottleneck link with varying demands, and on the downtown Austin network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ongoing competition between traditional vehicle manufacturers and technology companies for quickly developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) and gaining early traction in the market is well known. However, some issues need to be cleared regarding the antecedents of the behavioral intention to use AVs. In this context, we conducted a meta-analysis using the TIS (Technological, Individual, and Security) framework, to understand the convergence and divergence of the factors influencing the behavioral intention to use AV technology. This metaanalysis tested the hypotheses using a database of 65 studies obtained from 58 articles with the cumulative sample size of 37,076. The study identified perceived usefulness, attitude, trust, safety, hedonic motivation, and social influence as the critical antecedents of AV adoption. Several of the relationships investigated in the study were moderated by factors such as level of automation, vehicle ownership and culture. The results revealed fewer incentives for the public to accept AVs. Theoretical contributions and recommendations to practitioners and policymakers have also been discussed.

AB In this study, a decision-making and motion planning controller with continuous action space is constructed in the highway driving scenario based on deep reinforcement learning. In the decision-making and planning problem, the goal is to achieve the safety, efficiency, and comfort of automated vehicles. In the driving scenario, the surrounding vehicles are controlled by the intelligent driver model and a general model (minimizing overall braking induced by lane change, MOBIL), which enables them to react to the environment and mimic the vehicle interactions on the highway. Given the uncertainties in the driving conditions, a specific deep reinforcement learning technique, called soft actor-critic, is used to solve the decision-making and planning problem with continuous action space. Simulation results show that the proposed method can solve the decision-making and motion planning problem in the interactive traffic environment to carry out safe lane-change maneuvers and cruise at high speed. In addition, two control policies are developed with different weights on safety, efficiency, and comfort.

AB Due to the excessive demand of automated solutions, intelligent transportation is the currently popular research area. Internet of things (IoT) is a boon to the today's world, as communication with almost all the things around is made possible. IoT based autonomous vehicle (AV) is the most researchable topic, which is being approached by technology giants such as Google, Hyundai, Uber and so on. Inspired by this concept, this paper presents a technique to detect speed bumps and lanes on roads by utilizing IoT. This work considers that the speed bump and lane detection are the most fundamental, yet primary requirements of any AV. Both the goals are attained by employing ultrasonic and Wi-Fi sports camera sensor respectively. The lane detection is carried out by a computer vision based algorithm, which processes the video data. Furthermore, this work can be utilized on vehicle with drivers for the sake of alerting. The performance of the work is quite satisfactory in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F-measure with reasonable time consumption.

TI Hull hydrodynamic optimization of autonomous underwater vehicles

SO OCEAN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Wave resistance; Hull optimization; Autonomous underwater vehicles;
   Panel method
AB Traditionally autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been built with a torpedo-like shape. This common shaping is hydrodynamically suboptimal for those AUVs required to operate at snorkeling condition near the free surface. In this case, the wave resistance associated to the wavy deformation of the sea surface induced by the motion of the platform is an important component of the drag. This work has investigated the optimum hull shape of an underwater vehicle moving near the free surface. Specifically a first-order Rankine panel method has been implemented to compute the wave resistance on a body of revolution moving close to the free surface. A simulated annealing algorithm was then employed to search those set of parameters defining the hull shape that minimize the wave resistance. The optimization was constrained to keep constant the total volume of the vehicle. The total drag of scaled models of the torpedo-like and resulting optimum shapes was measured in the naval tank of the University of Trieste. Measurements showed a smaller resistance of the optimized shape in the range of the considered Froude numbers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Owing to the advancements in communication and computation technologies, the dream of commercialized connected and autonomous cars is becoming a reality. However, among other challenges such as environmental pollution, cost, maintenance, security, and privacy, the ownership of vehicles (especially for Autonomous Vehicles) is the major obstacle in the realization of this technology at the commercial level. Furthermore, the business model of pay-as-you-go type services further attracts the consumer, because there is no need for upfront investment. In this vein, the idea of car-sharing (aka carpooling) is getting ground due to, at least in part, its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and affordable choice of transportation. Carpooling systems are still in their infancy and face challenges such as scheduling, matching passengers interests, business model, security, privacy, and communication. To date, a plethora of research work has already been done covering different aspects of carpooling services (ranging from applications to communication and technologies); however, there is still a lack of a holistic, comprehensive survey that can be a one-stop-shop for the researchers in this area to (i) find all the relevant information and (ii) identify the future research directions. To fill these research challenges, this article provides a comprehensive survey on carpooling in autonomous and connected vehicles and covers architecture, components, and solutions, including scheduling, matching, mobility, pricing models of carpooling. We also discuss the current challenges in carpooling and identify future research directions. This survey is aimed to spur further discussion among the research community for the effective realization of carpooling.

AB This paper intends to harness recent advances in intelligent commands to develop a novel steering control strategy for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) maneuvering problems. In this research, the vehicle is embodied by a single track-model (ST) taking into consideration its lateral dynamics. Besides, it is subject to unknown disturbances and uncertainties, associated with the tire/road adhesion coefficient, which are upper bounded by a positive limit. An on-line Radial Basis-function Neural-Networks (RBNN) adaptive mechanism is designed to estimate this upper limit in the sense of Lyapunov. On this basis, a novel robust adaptive neurosliding mode steering angle controller (AN-SMC) is introduced. Whilst the effectiveness of the controller is impacted by its parameters, a new neural-network optimization algorithm (NNA) is employed to provide optimal values for these settings. The proposed approach is evaluated through a single lane-change-maneuver planned out by a new methodology. The steering controller revealed a powerful path-tracking via the comparisons carried out in support of the developed strategy.

AB While autonomous vehicles (AVs) are potentially the future of transportation, one of the main issues that need to be addressed is their behaviour and response to adverse weather conditions. Herein, we proposed a research frame to understand and mitigate the impact of weather stressors (wind, rain, snow, ice, and fog) on AVs. A recently launched initiative to design and engineer an indigenous Canadian road vehicle served as a background for this intended framework. The proposed frame consists of (i) on-road testing and numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to derive statistically significant critical weather conditions (weather design cases, WDCs) and (ii) simulation of these weather conditions in the ACE climatic wind tunnel at Ontario Tech University, Canada, to (iii) identify adaptive controls to minimize the effects of the WDCs on vehicles improving their aerodynamics, safety, and sensor functionality. This framework is intended to (i) provoke discussions among the AV industry and research stakeholders in Canada and elsewhere and (ii) provide a context for future research in related areas such as AV aerodynamics, maneuverability, weather impacts (e.g., wind, rain, snow, ice, and fog), sensors, and soiling.

AB In this article, an enhanced model reference adaptive control (EMRAC) algorithm is used to design a generic lateral-tracking controller for a vehicle. This EMRAC is different from the EMRAC in the literature as it adopts a sigma-modification approach to bind the adaptive gain of the switching action. Moreover, an extended Lyapunov theory for discontinuous systems is used to analytically prove the ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop control system when the adaptive gain of the switching action is bounded with a sigma-modification strategy. The control algorithm is applied to a vehicle path-tracking problem and its tracking performance is investigated under conditions of: 1) external disturbances such as crosswind; 2) road surface changes; 3) modeling errors; and 4) parameter missmatches in a co-simulation environment based on IPG Carmaker/MATLAB. The simulation studies show that the controller is effective at tracking a given reference path for performing different autonomous highway driving maneuvers while ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals even when the system is subjected to the conditions mentioned above.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a potentially disruptive yet beneficial change to our transportation system. This new technology has the potential to impact vehicle safety, congestion, and travel behavior. All told, major social AV impacts in the form of crash savings, travel time reduction, fuel efficiency and parking benefits are estimated to approach $2000 to per year per AV, and may eventually approach nearly $4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for. Yet barriers to implementation and mass-market penetration remain. Initial costs will likely be unaffordable. Licensing and testing standards in the U.S. are being developed at the state level, rather than nationally, which may lead to inconsistencies across states. Liability details remain undefined, security concerns linger, and without new privacy standards, a default lack of privacy for personal travel may become the norm. The impacts and interactions with other components of the transportation system, as well as implementation details, remain uncertain. To address these concerns, the federal government should expand research in these areas and create a nationally recognized licensing framework for AVs, determining appropriate standards for liability, security, and data privacy.

AB As an important branch of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, autonomous vehicle (AV) positioning based on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation has received extensive attention in recent years. In this article, an AV positioning method under unknown mutual coupling is proposed within the framework of a large-dimensional asymptotic theory (LAT). First, enhanced and closed-form DOA estimation is achieved by jointly exploiting large-scale uniform linear arrays (ULAs), Toeplitz rectification and the phase transformation result associated with the sample covariance matrix; second, a more reliable subset/set of DOAs is constructed according to the signal-to-noise at receivers; finally, robust AV positioning is achieved with the reliable subset/set. Motivated by satisfactory DOA estimation performance, an AV contour extraction scheme is developed with the aid of two antennas installed on an AV. The proposed method shows several salient advantages compared with existing methods, including improved resolution and accuracy, reduced computational complexity, robustness to mutual coupling and unreasonable DOA estimates, as well as the ability to effectively extract AV contour information.

AB Logistics planning for large operations often demands the solution to highly combinatorially complex optimization models. Moreover, planning activities can include evaluating the logistics system under varying operational scenarios and with multiple objectives. This article presents a model formulation for operational-level logistics planning in a sea-based military context. The model integrates autonomous and unmanned vehicles with traditional platforms to test the effectiveness of alternative platform mixes. The formulation includes three objective functions and a series of constraints on the supplies to deliver, the vehicle locations, and the cargo on vehicles. A solution approach is presented using geographic information systems to model and store the scenarios and to compute spatial characteristics for the optimization, with a tight integration of optimization software to solve for the optimal delivery pattern and return the solution to the geographic software for post-processing and cartographic display. Solutions with variant platform mixes are compared. These results confirm that operational-level logistics problems are tractable, that autonomous and unmanned vehicles can be integrated into logistics modeling, and that the integration of geographic and optimization software can provide an effective testbed for evaluating alternatives.

AB The present paper introduces a three-dimensional guidance system developed for a miniature Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The guidance system determines the best trajectory for the vehicle based on target behavior and vehicle capabilities. The dynamic model of this novel AUV is derived based on its special characteristics such as the horizontal posture and the independent diving mechanism. To design the guidance strategy, the main idea is to select the desired depth, presumed proportional to the horizontal distance of the AUV and the target. By connecting the two with a straight line, this strategy helps the AUV move in a trajectory sufficiently close to this line. The adjacency of the trajectory to the line leads to reasonably short travelling distances and avoids unsafe areas. Autopilots are designed using sliding mode controller. Two different engagement geometries are considered to evaluate the strategy's performance: stationary target and moving target. The simulation results show that the strategy can provide sufficiently fast and smooth trajectories in both target situations.

DE Autonomous Vehicle; Steering System; Model Predictive Control (MPC);
   Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA); System on Chip (SOC)
AB The autonomous vehicle steering system, a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system, is challenging to design using traditional controllers due to the interaction between inputs and outputs. If PID controllers are used the control loops are executed independently of each other as there is no interaction between the loops. Designing a larger system increases the controller parameters requiring tuning. Model Predictive Control (MPC) overcomes this problem, as it is a multi-variable control method taking into account the interactions of the variables in the target system. Achieving a high safety level is also critical for autonomous vehicle systems. This can be provided by an MPC controller, which can handle constraints such as maintaining a safe distance from other cars. Wider applicability of the Model Predictive Controller calls for more efficient hardware architectures for implementation. The aim of this paper is to achieve optimal implementation of the MPC controller by increasing the computational speed in order to reduce execution time for optimization. An MPC controller is used to control the steering system of an autonomous vehicle to keep it on the desired path. A traditional MPC controller is used to control the system where the plant dynamics do not change, whereas an Adaptive MPC controller is used when the system is nonlinear or its characteristics vary with time (the longitudinal velocity changes as the vehicle moves). Results are discussed in terms of performance, resource utilization, cost, and energy-effective implementations taking into consideration a reasonable size number of constraints handled by the controller.

ID SEARCH ALGORITHM; STRATEGY; DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY
AB With the advent of modular autonomous vehicles (MAVs), this paper presents a novel operational design for flex-route transit services to reduce operation costs of vehicles and improve the service quality of customers. The regime allows the simultaneous dispatch of a certain amount of MAVs from a bus terminal at a departure time. Each MAV is allowed to visit customers freely outside of checkpoints. Self-adaptive capacity and flexible service mode adapt time- and space-dependent demand characteristics. The presented operational design is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that is NP-hard. A two-stage solution framework is developed to decompose the proposed mathematical programming cautiously. In the first stage, customized dynamic programming with valid cuts is designed to solve a bus scheduling problem efficiently. In the second stage, an effective and fast heuristic is proposed to solve a variant of the dial-a-ride problem and satisfy the technical requirements for developing on-line applications. Numerical examples and a case study show the effectiveness of the proposed design by comparing the flex-route transit services using traditional vehicles.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB Autonomous vehicles hold promise for increased vehicle and traffic safety, and there are several developments in the field where one example is an avoidance maneuver. There it is dangerous for the vehicle to be in the opposing lane, but it is safe to drive in the original lane again after the obstacle. To capture this basic observation, a lane-deviation penalty (LDP) objective function is devised. Based on this objective function, a formulation is developed utilizing optimal all-wheel braking and steering at the limit of road-tire friction. This method is evaluated for a double lane-change scenario by computing the resulting behavior for several interesting cases, where parameters of the emergency situation such as the initial speed of the vehicle and the size and placement of the obstacle are varied, and it performs well. A comparison with maneuvers obtained by minimum-time and other lateral-penalty objective functions shows that the use of the considered penalty function decreases the time that the vehicle spends in the opposing lane.

   Machine Experiment
AB In a recent paper in Nature(1) entitled The Moral Machine Experiment, Edmond Awad, et al. make a number of breathtakingly reckless assumptions, both about the decisionmaking capacities of current so-called "autonomous vehicles" and about the nature of morality and the law. Accepting their bizarre premise that the holy grail is to find out how to obtain cognizance of public morality and then program driverless vehicles accordingly, the following are the four steps to the Moral Machinists argument: 1) Find out what "public morality" will prefer to see happen. 2) On the basis of this discovery, claim both popular acceptance of the preferences and persuade would-be owners and manufacturers that the vehicles are programmed with the best solutions to any survival dilemmas they might face. 3) Citizen agreement thus characterized is then presumed to deliver moral license for the chosen preferences. 4) This yields "permission" to program vehicles to spare or condemn those outside the vehicles when their deaths will preserve vehicle and occupants. This paper argues that the Moral Machine Experiment fails dramatically on all four counts.

AB Automation is expected to effectively address the growing demand for passenger and freight transportation, safety issues, human errors, and increasing congestion. The growth of autonomous vehicles using the state-of-the-art connected vehicle technologies has paved the way for the development of passenger and freight autonomous trains (ATs), also known as driverless trains. ATs are fully automated trains that are centrally controlled using advanced communication and internet technologies, such as high-speed internet (5G) technology, Internet of Things, dedicated short range communications, digital video detection cameras, and artificial intelligence-based methods. The current study focuses on a detailed up-to-date review of the existing trends, technologies, advancements, and challenges in the deployment of ATs with a full automation level in rail transportation. The basic AT features along with the key technologies that are instrumental for the AT deployment and operations are discussed in detail. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art research efforts is performed as well with a specific emphasis on the issues associated with the AT deployment, user perception and outlook for ATs, innovative concepts and models that could be used for the AT design, and the AT operations at highway-rail grade crossings. Based on the conducted review, this study determines the main advantages and challenges from the AT deployment. The identified challenges have to be collaboratively addressed by the relevant stakeholders, including railroad companies, researchers, and government representatives, to facilitate the AT development and deployment considering the perspectives of future users and without affecting the safety level.

These EVs are assumed to accurately follow a pre-determined speed profile. By transformation of the nonlinear optimization problem for optimal allocation of WPTSys to an OCP, well-known methods guaranteeing the global optimality of solution for the ()CP are applied, such as Pontryagin's maximum principle or dynamic programming. Therefore, the global optimal solution of the allocation problem of WPTSys can be obtained. In addition, we consider a practical situation of EV operation from a probability point of view, where many EVs are operated with different initial battery state-of-charge.

AB This paper studies the model predictive stabilization problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with control input constraints, where the full dynamic and kinematic model including Coriolis and centripetal matrix, the hydrodynamic added mass, and damping is utilized, and a four-control-input configuration is considered. A novel model predictive control algorithm is proposed based on the homogeneity of system model and an existing time-varying control law. Theoretical results on ensuring algorithm feasibility and closed-loop stability are provided. It is shown that if the terminal set level and the cost weights are designed appropriately, the developed algorithm is iteratively feasible and the closed-loop system is asymptotically stabilized at the equilibrium point. Comparison studies verify the effectiveness of the developed results.

TI Autonomous Coil Alignment System Using Fuzzy Steering Control for

ID POWER; DESIGN; PICKUP
AB An autonomous coil alignment system (ACAS) using fuzzy steering control is proposed for vehicles with dynamic wireless charging. The misalignment between the power receiver coil and power transmitter coil is determined based on the voltage difference between two coils installed on the front-left/front-right of the power receiver coil and is corrected through autonomous steering using fuzzy control. The fuzzy control is chosen over other control methods for implementation in ACAS due to the nonlinear characteristic between voltage difference and lateral misalignment distance, as well as the imprecise and constantly varying voltage readings from sensors. The operational validity and feasibility of the ACAS are verified through simulation, where the vehicle equipped with ACAS is able to align with the power transmitter in the road majority of the time during operation, which also implies achieving better wireless power delivery.

AB This paper presents the design and development of an enhanced inertial navigation system that is to be integrated into the Morpheus autonomous underwater vehicle at Florida Atlantic University. The inertial measurement unit is based on the off-the-shelf Honeywell HG1700-AG25 3-axis ring-laser gyros and three-axis accelerometers and is aided with ground speed measurements obtained using an RDI Doppler-velocity-log sonar. An extended Kalman filter has been developed, which fuses together asynchronously the inertial and Doppler data, as well as the differential global positioning system positional fixes whenever they are available. A complementary filter was implemented to provide a much smoother and stable attitude estimate. Thus far, preliminary study has been made on characterizing the inertial navigation system-based navigation system performance, and the corresponding results and analyzes are provided in this paper.

AB Utility All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) are commonly used on farms for agricultural activities such as carrying implements, applying fertilizers, and transportation. Among all agricultural ATV incidents on farms, rollover crushes are the leading cause of fatalities. Crush Protection Devices (CPDs) are passive safety structures that potentially decrease the severity of injuries and the number of deaths in agricultural ATV rollover incidents. However, there are contradictions in the results of previous studies regarding the effectiveness of CPDs in protecting the operator in rollover incidents. The effectiveness of CPDs should be evaluated experimentally with an autonomous ATV, allowing repeatable and systematic rollover tests. This study aims at developing three automatic control systems on an ATV for future rollover simulations: (1) Global Positioning System (GPS)-based navigation system that allows autonomous steering, (2) remote cruise control module for keeping consistent riding speeds, and (3) remote braking system for safety in future unmanned ATV tests. The performance of each system was examined by operating the autonomous ATV in an outdoor testing terrain. The term autonomy in this study refers to the autonomous steering system, along with the remotely controlled speed and braking systems. Results showed that the developed systems performed within the acceptable range for conducting future rollover tests accurately and safely. Application of the autonomous ATV expects to deliver repeatable results in rollover simulations, and thus increases the reliability of CPD evaluation.

AB The recent social trends and accelerated technological progress culminated in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Reliability assessment for AV systems is in high demand before its market launch. In safety-critical systems (SCSs) such as AV systems, the reliability concept should be broadened to consider more safety-related issues. In this paper, reliability is defined as the probability that the system performs satisfactorily for a given period of time under stated conditions. This paper proposes a reliability assessment framework of AV, consisting of three main stages: (i) modeling the safety control structure through the Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP); (ii) mapping the control structure and functional relationships to a directed acyclic graph (DAG); and (iii) construct a Bayesian network (BN) on DAG to assess the system reliability. The fully automated (level 5) vehicle system is shown as a numeric example to illustrate how this suggested framework works. A brief discussion on involving human factors in systems to analyze lower levels of automated vehicles is also included, demonstrating the need for further research on real case studies.

AB The path tracking is a basic function of the autonomous vehicle. Generally, it is difficult to realize the path tracking with high accuracy at high speeds. To solve this problem, an adaptivity-enhanced path tracking system (AEPTS) is investigated in this paper. The adaptive performance of this AEPTS is realized via three aspects. The first is to achieve preview distance adaptivity by a dynamic multi-point preview model (DMPPM), which provides the desired course deviation according to the vehicle speed and the reference path. The second is to improve the adaptivity of an adaptive fuzzy steering controller (AFSC) with an adaptive steering gainmodel which is built via the path curvature and vehicle speed. The third is that an optimal parameter surface is devised to enhance the adaptivity of the AEPTS at high speeds. Such a surface can provide the optimal coefficients for the AEPTS, and it is implemented using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a curve fitting method. At last, simulation experiments are given to verify the adaptivity of the proposed method.

AB The effects of a propulsor on the hydrodynamic forces acting on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) were investigated by towing tank model tests. A mathematical maneuvering model using a whole vehicle model was established, and captive model tests using vertical planar motion mechanism equipment were performed to obtain maneuvering coefficients. The Reynolds number of the full scale test model in the operation condition was 4.12 x 10(6), and the revolution rate of the propulsor was fixed at the self-propulsion point. The forces on the body and control fins were measured in static drift, control fin deflection, pure heave and pure pitch tests with and without the propulsor. The propulsor effects on the hydrodynamic force and moment were identified as spatially irregular thrust, flow acceleration around the control fins, and added mass of the propulsor. In the simulation using the component model where the propulsor effect considered as a constant thrust, the maneuverability of the AUV was overestimated compared to that of the whole vehicle model. Thus, the mathematical maneuvering model should consider propulsor-hull interactions.

AB A real improvement in efficiency and productivity has been successfully achieved in precision agriculture using auto-guidance systems. The global positioning system (GPS) real-time kinematic (RTK) system, which allows for centimetre accuracy, is one alternative for implementing such systems. However, geographic positioning errors, vehicle dynamics, agricultural devices, and field environment conditions may influence the performance of GPS-based autonomous agricultural vehicles. Measuring the vehicle position using cameras, lasers, odometers, and ultrasonic sensors can aid this influence assessment. This work aims to propose a methodology to assess the accuracy of auto-guidance systems under actual field conditions using computer vision methods. The pinhole camera method was used to map vehicle location by processing a checkerboard image in the field. The proposal is validated by performing several field tests. The use of computer vision methods can be an accurate alternative to evaluate auto-guidance systems if devices, procedures, and parameters are appropriately selected and calibrated.

AB Reliable autonomous driving requires comprehensive environment perception, among which the road recognition is critical for autonomous vehicles to achieve adaptability, reliability, and safety. Existing equipped sensors such as cameras, LiDAR, and accelerometers have been adopted widely for road recog-nition. However, single sensor based recognition methods present challenges in balancing high accuracy and adaptability. In this study, we propose a visual-tactile fusion road recognition system for autonomous vehicles. The visual modality is derived from the captured road images, and the tactile modality in-formation comes from the designed intelligent tire system, containing a low-cost piezoelectric sensor. For accurate road recognition, we propose a multimodal fusion recognition network based on the CNN -transformer architecture. The visual and tactile modalities are fed into modality-specific SE-CNNs, which emphasize valuable input information to obtain weighted features. These features are subsequently input to "bottleneck" based fusion transformer encoders and output the recognition results. We design a fusion feature extractor to enhance the fusion representation capability and improve accuracy. The vehicle field experiments are conducted to build the dataset consisting of four road surfaces, and the results show that the proposed network achieves an accuracy of 99.48% in road recognition task.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB A digital twin is often adopted in computer simulations to expedite autonomous vehicle developments by using the simulated 3D environment that reflects a physical environment. In particular, traffic simulations are a crucial part of training the driving logic before the field test of an autonomous vehicle is performed on specific regions to adapt to the region-specific, dynamic traffic conditions. Currently, the traffic conditions are either synthesised by tools (e.g. using mathematical models) or created manually (using domain knowledge), which cannot reflect the realistic, region-specific conditions or will require extensive labour works. In this article, we propose an automatic methodology to model the real-world traffic conditions captured by the sensor data and to reproduce the modeled traffic in the digital twin. We have built the tools based on the methodology and use the KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of the tools. To recreate the region-specific traffic, we present the results of capturing, modelling, and recreating the two-wheeler traffic condition on the Southeast Asia road. Our experimental results show that the proposed method facilitates the simulation of real-world, Southeast Asia-specific traffic conditions by removing the needs of the synthesised traffic and the labour hours.

AB Emotion and a broader range of affective and cognitive states play an important role on the road. While this has been predominantly investigated in terms of driver safety, the approaching advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is expected to bring a fundamental shift in focus for emotion recognition in the car, from the driver to the passengers. This work presents a number of affect-enabled applications, including adapting the driving style for an emotional experience or tailoring the infotainment to personal preferences. It attempts to foresee upcoming challenges and provides suggestions for multimodal affect modelling, with a focus on the audio and visual modalities. In particular, this includes context awareness, reliable diarisation of multiple passengers, group affect, and personalisation. Finally, we provide some recommendations on future research directions, including explainability, privacy, and holistic modelling.

AB The use of varied Maritime Autonomous Vehicles (MAVs) for border surveillance purposes has increasing implications for international laws related to maritime security. The focus of this article is on the deployment of aerial MAVs (drones) over the Mediterranean to detect and monitor the movement of migrants from northern Africa into Europe. It examines how laws relating to search and rescue, migrant smuggling and human rights might be interpreted and applied when drones are being used in relation to migration by sea. It is argued that while some aspects of drone usage fit within existing international law obligations, their potential to assist in saving lives at sea may not be at the expense of human rights violations.

AB For high speed vehicles, the dimensions of the observed information from the sensors are not always appropriate, and the quality of the information differs. To enhance the accuracy of the terminal autonomous navigation for high speed vehicle, A checking unscented information filters (CUIF) algorithm is proposed based on the principle of EIF(extended information fusion). CUIF adopts distributed structure instead of centralized one, While the sub-algorithm of Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used instead of Extended Kalman filter (EKF). The improved algorithm performs real-time system state compensation for the delayed information acquired from the sensors, so that problems such as single sensor signal delay, packet loss could be resolved.
   Simulation results indicate that the CUIF algorithm is 50% more accurate than the UIF and EIF in terms of positioning precision, while both consistency and robustness are improved in global terms.

AB In this paper, we outline a methodology for evaluating the situation awareness (SA) provided by a supervisory interface for an autonomous on-road vehicle. Our goal is to be able to use the evaluations to compare interface designs with respect to how well each facilitates the users' acquisition of SA. We used Endsely's Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) (Endsely, 1988) and developed scenarios and assessment questions appropriate for supervisors of autonomous on-road driving vehicles. We describe the results of two experiments used to refine our SA assessment implementation. In a third experiment, we applied the refined implementation to a graphical user interface we developed to test the sensitivity of our SAGAT implementation. We discuss the results of this experiment and implications for applying the SAGAT methodology to supervisory user interfaces for autonomous vehicles.

AB Non-player character vehicles (NPC-Vs) denote crucial components of autonomous driv-ing systems (ADSs) and autonomous driving assistance algorithms (ADAAs) when con-ducting virtual simulation testing (VST). Human-like behaviors and trajectories of NPC-Vs could provide information on complex background traffic flow to the tested ADS and ADAA, thus ensuring rigorous tests on the reliability and stability of the ADS and ADAA. However, a VST based on data injection faces the problems of a small amount of data and difficulty in extracting critical scenarios and methods' transplantation and reuse. To address these problems, this study takes intersection as a research scenario and proposes a probability-limited parameter combination method and a learning-based batch human-like trajectory generation model to generate different human-like trajectories according to different motion states of vehicles. First, an effective IM-sampling algorithm, which samples trajectory data and obtains equal-number-coordinate trajectories as trajectory generation model labels, is proposed. Second, dependency probabilities between differ-ent vehicle kinematic parameters (VKPs) are calculated to form a probability-limited generation tree, which generates different VKP combinations representing different vehicle motion states that are used as trajectory generation model inputs. Finally, a learning-based batch trajectory generation model is developed. After model training and testing, the generated VKP combinations are used for trajectory generation, and the generated trajectories are subjected to the human-like degree analysis considering multiple metrics. The experimental results show that the proposed model is capable of generating more complex human-like trajectories and behaviors than real trajectories in batch. The proposed model could be used to generate complex and human-like NPC-V trajectories for the autonomous driving VST and thus accelerate the autonomous driving VST.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents the design and construction of Guanay-II vehicle. It is an autonomous underwater vehicle that navigates over the sea surface and, at certain fixed points, dives vertically to obtain a profile of a water column. It was designed for shallow water, with maximum depth of 30 m. The vehicle uses a cylinder to do the immersions. The cylinder can take in and eject water smoothly, thus it can change the vehicle's buoyancy, and avoid creating perturbations in the environment. The designed vehicle has a double-hull structure. The external fiberglass hull, which is not watertight, has been designed in accordance with Myring profiles to provide good hydrodynamic performance. The watertight module located inside the external hull is made of aluminum and contains the immersion actuator, batteries and the electronic system to control the vehicle operations. The control system is divided into several subsystems: navigation, propulsion/immersion, safety, communication and data acquisition. The vehicle is 2300 mm in length by 320 mm in diameter, and weighs 90 kg.

AB Great efforts have been devoted to the intelligent control of autonomous systems. Yet, most of existing methods fail to effectively handle the uncertainty of their environment and models. Uncertain locations of dynamic obstacles pose a major challenge for their optimal control and safety, while their linearization or simplified system models reduce their actual performance. To address them, this paper presents a new model predictive control framework with finite samples and a Gaussian model, resulting in a chance-constrained program. Its nominal model is combined with a Gaussian process. Its residual model uncertainty is learned. The resulting method addresses an efficiently solvable approximate formulation of a stochastic optimal control problem by using approximations for efficient computation. There is no perfect distribution knowledge of a dynamic obstacle's location uncertainty. Only finite samples from sensors or past data are available for moment estimation. We use the uncertainty propagation of a system's state and obstacles' locations to derive a general collision avoidance condition under tight concentration bounds on the error of the estimated moments. Thus, this condition is suitable for different obstacles, e.g., bounding box and ellipsoid obstacles. We provide proved guarantees on the satisfaction of the chance-constraints corresponding to the nominal yet unknown moments. Simulation examples of a vehicle's control are used to show that the proposed method can well realize autonomous control and obstacle avoidance of a vehicle, when it operates in an uncertain environment with moving obstacles. It outperforms the existing moment methods in both performance and computational time.

AB Intelligent traffic management systems have become one of the main applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). There is a growing interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL) based control methods in ITS applications such as autonomous driving and traffic management solutions. Deep learning helps in approximating substantially complex nonlinear functions from complicated data sets and tackling complex control issues. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and smart routing to improve the flow of autonomous vehicles on road networks. We evaluate Multi-Agent Advantage Actor-Critic (MA2C) and Independent Advantage Actor-Critical (IA2C), recently suggested Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning techniques with smart routing for traffic signal optimization to determine its potential. We investigate the framework offered by non-Markov decision processes, enabling a more in-depth understanding of the algorithms. We conduct a critical analysis to observe the robustness and effectiveness of the method. The method's efficacy and reliability are demonstrated by simulations using SUMO, a software modeling tool for traffic simulations. We used a road network that contains seven intersections. Our findings show that MA2C, when trained on pseudo-random vehicle flows, is a viable methodology that outperforms competing techniques.

AB Under traditional car-following control, i.e., human drivers' behaviour, the stability condition of traffic system isnotsatisfied in general. For safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, additional danger warning system must be used in the adaptive cruise control system to prevent inevitable potential collisions. One reasonable quantity of evaluating potential collisions is time to contact (TTC): how soon will potential collision occur? In this paper, we provide TTC feedback control to improve safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, and show the effectiveness of TTC feedback. TTC can be estimated by machine vision techniques with single uncelebrated camera (i.e., passive sensors). We provide detailed mathematical analysis and algorithmic implementation. The machine vision-based TTC algorithm is pretty fast such that the whole system can be implemented on Android smartphones running in real-time. Moreover, it is not trial to estimate relative velocity by differentiating the measured distance between cars with respect to time, because inevitable measurement noise in the distance measurements will be amplified by the derivative operation. The time-to-contact-based algorithm provides an alternative approach to estimating the relative velocity, which can also be fused with measurements from other active sensors, if desired.

AB This study introduces an advanced autonomous navigation algorithm for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) operations in complex coastal traffic areas. To facilitate the undertaking of tests for innovative technologies, the Korean government has designated regulation-free special zones, thereby enabling field tests for USV demonstrations without an onboard safety person on real manned-ship navigation routes. To enable real-world USV operation without onboard safety person, an existing autonomous navigation algorithm is extended to achieve sufficiently reliable and robust USV operation. Accordingly, berthing and unberthing algorithms are newly developed for unmanned operation, and enhanced situational awareness algorithms are applied to detect all types of obstacles, including small-sized floating objects spread over a wide range, such as a fish farm. In particular, the Korean intelligent maritime transportation service, called e-Navigation, is incorporated into the autonomous navigation algorithms to overcome the limitations of vehicle autonomy based on onboard sensors. To demonstrate the capability of fully unmanned operation in real marine traffic scenarios, long-distance navigation (54 km on a single voyage) was conducted by running several missions, including navigation in complex fish farm areas, maritime surveys, collision avoidance, navigation on real traffic routes, and emergency response. The extended navigation algorithms and results of the field tests are presented and discussed in this paper.

AB The precise estimation of vehicle mass is crucial for the optimal performance of electronic control systems in autonomous vehicles. However, the nonlinear nature of vehicle dynamics makes it a challenging task to estimate the mass accurately. In response to this concern, this paper proposes a dynamic vehicle mass estimation framework underpinned by a bidirectional gated recurrent unit, developed using deep neural networks. The bidirectional mechanism and gated recurrent unit network are adopted to elevate the precision of the neural network estimator. The dataset used for training and validation is collected from heavy-duty vehicle simulations and real vehicle road tests. The average root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and mean absolute error evaluated over simulation tests are 92.66 kg, 0.93%, and 79.67 kg, respectively, and those in real vehicle data tests are 16.61 kg, 0.13%, and 16.61 kg, respectively. The outcomes manifest that the method put forth surpasses the contrasted approaches in relation to accuracy in the conducted experiments.

AB This is a study on the development of a road following vision-based guidance system for unmanned air vehicles (UAV) in real world applications. Currently, autonomous navigation requires the use of GPS. In many applications, however, dependence on GPS is undesirable. GPS signals are weak and can be jammed easily. Also, GPS waypoints may not be up-to-date. In recent years, vision-based navigation has been gaining popularity. Vision-based guidance requires existence of visible paths or extended landmarks for air vehicles to detect and follow. Roads are the most commonly available path to follow. Moreover, the abundance of events that happen along roads make them appealing subjects of surveillance. Many road detection (single images) and road tracking (videos) algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Fast detection and tracking has been the emphasis of those intended for UAVs. Due to the complexity of road detection, we not only need advanced software but also the most effective sensors. In this paper, we propose a road following algorithm that uses both RGB camera and hyperspectral sensor and report the results of actual test flights conducted in different locations and different seasons.

AB This paper proposes a robust H-2 optimal control strategy for the depth-plane motion of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of output disturbances and time delay. The six degrees of freedom nonlinear kinematic and dynamic equations of motion of the vehicle are firstly described. The depth-plane linearization of the vehicle equations of motion is then derived for efficient controller design from the practical point of view. Using this linearized and reduced-order model, a robust H-2 optimal control method is designed. The designed control method takes into account both the output disturbances and time delay and provides suitable control action for desired tracking. The robust stability and robust performance of the proposed control method with respect to the model uncertainties are discussed. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed robust H-2 optimal control strategy has remarkable performance and provides higher tracking accuracy, better output disturbances rejection ability, stronger robustness against model uncertainties, and smaller fin angle input than the existing pitch-and-depth loop PD depth controller.

AB Localization of vehicles in a 3D environment is a basic task in autonomous driving. In the low-light environments, it is difficult to navigate independently using a visual odometry for autonomous driving. The main reason for this challenge is the blurred images in the scenes with insufficient illumination. Although numerous works focused on this issue, it still has a number of inherent drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight stereo visual odometry system for navigation of autonomous vehicles in low-light situations. Contrary to the existing recovery methods, we aim to divide the captured image into the illumination image as well as the reflectance image and only estimate the illumination one, where the enhanced map of the low-light image is acquired by using the retinex theory. In addition, we further utilize a simplified and rapid feature detection scheme, which reduces the computation time by about 85% but maintaining the matching accuracy similar to that of ORB features. Finally, the experiments show that our average memory consumption of our proposed method is much less than the conventional algorithm.

AB There is currently a huge interest around autonomous vehicles from both industry and academia. This is mainly due to recent advances in machine learning and deep learning, allowing the development of promising methods for autonomous driving. The gap toward full autonomy is incrementally being reduced with essentially three main existing approaches. First, Modular systems that combine a pipeline of methods with each solving one specific sub-task of driving. Second, Direct Perception techniques that directly estimate affordances (car orientation, distances between lane borders, etc) used to compute control commands through a simple logic. Finally, end-to-end frameworks that automatically map raw sensor data to actuation values. The objective of this paper is to review some recent works focusing on end-to-end deep learning models for lane stable driving, as well as some publicly available real world datasets and open-source simulators that enable the development and evaluation of such methods.

AB Uniform traffic flow has been shown to be unstable in certain flow regimes due to collective behaviors of human drivers, resulting in the well-observed stop-and-go waves. These traffic waves can arise even in the absence of merges, bottlenecks, or lane changing, and may lead to higher vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. In this article, we aim to smooth unstable traffic flow via optimal control of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in a predominantly human-driven traffic flow. These controlled AVs act as mobile actuators in the traffic without changing the way human-driven vehicles (HVs) normally operate. We develop a dynamic model to describe mixed traffic flow in the presence of both HVs and AVs, whose dynamics follow general nonlinear car-following principles. Based on this general framework, we formulate an optimal control problem with the objective of minimizing vehicle speed perturbation, and prove the existence of optimal AV control policy. Following the necessary conditions of optimality prescribed by the well-known Pontryagin's minimum principle, we present a computational algorithm to determine the optimal AV control strategy and prove its convergence. The mathematical model is further illustrated using the intelligent driver model (IDM) and optimal velocity with relative velocity (OVRV) model for HVs and AVs, respectively. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on traffic smoothing, as well as the improvement on vehicle fuel economy.

AB Research has identified some individual and situational factors that relate to the public's preference for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in moral dilemmas. The present study shows that people in the AV industry attach moral value to (and prefer to buy) AVs that prioritize passenger protection at all costs. By contrast, people outside the AV industry prefer utilitarian AVs programmed to minimize casualties, even though they are more likely to buy AVs that protect passengers. This study also shows that people are averse to random algorithms. It replicates gender differences, the effect of perspective, and the paradox between moral choice and AV purchase intention. This study contributes to the field by expanding our understanding of the factors that influence moral judgements on AVs; it also provides a reference for designing moral algorithms that govern AVs.

AB Traffic sign recognition is a crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle research, and deep learning techniques have significantly contributed to its progress. Nevertheless, the distribution of traffic sign information in natural complex road conditions is long-tailed, and traffic sign identification in complex road conditions has become a significant barrier to autonomous vehicle applications. The imbalanced distribution of information on the dataset migrates to the feature space during training, resulting in imbalanced classifier prediction. In this paper, we propose the gradient rebalanced traffic sign recognition (GRTR) method to address this problem for the first time. GRTR first evaluates the prediction and classification bias of the classifier using the fitted deviation between the model's output probability and the ground-truth distributions. Then, GRTR dynamically adjusts the correction and compensation factors following the classifier's prediction and classification biases. GRTR rebalances the positive and negative sample gradients for each category based on the synergistic effect of the correction and compensation factors to prevent the transfer of distribution imbalance and to significantly enhance the performance of the traffic sign classifier under difficult road conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our GRTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed traffic sign and multilabel datasets. Note to Practitioners-Most traffic sign recognition algorithms are still designed based on the assumption of a balanced distribution of traffic signs in the dataset. Real-world autonomous vehicles require traffic sign recognition on datasets with severely imbalanced distributions. This paper proposes a general approach to solving the long-tailed traffic sign recognition problem.

AB How humans will adapt and respond to the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is uncertain. This study used an agent-based model to explore how AVs, human-operated vehicles, and cyclists might interact based on the introduction of flawlessly performing AVs. Under two separate experimental conditions, results of experiment 1 showed that, despite no conflicts occurring between cyclists and AVs, modelled conflicts among human-operated cars and cyclists increased with the introduction of AVs due to cyclists' adjusted expectations of the behaviour and capability of human-operated and autonomous cars. Similarly, when human-operated cars were replaced with AVs over time in experiment 2, cyclist conflict rates did not follow a linear reduction consistent with the replacement rate but decreased more slowly in the early stages of replacement before 50% substitution. It is concluded that, although flawlessly performing AVs might reduce total conflicts, the introduction of AVs into a transport system where humans adjust to the behaviour and risk presented by AVs could create new sources of error that offset some of AVs assumed safety benefits. Practitioner summary: Ergonomics is an applied science that studies interactions between humans and other elements of a system, including non-human agents. Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) provides an approach for exploring dynamic and emergent interactions between agents. In this article, we demonstrate ABM through an analysis of how cyclists and pedestrians might interact with Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in future road transport systems.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB Pedestrian detection appears to be an integral part of a vast array of vision-based technologies, ranging from item recognition and monitoring via surveillance cameras to, more recently, driverless cars or autonomous vehicles. Moreover, due to the rapid development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for object identification, pedestrian detection has reached a very high level of performance in dataset training and evaluation environment in autonomous vehicles. In order to attain object identification and pedestrian detection, a sensor fusion mechanism named Fully Convolutional Neural networks for LIDAR-camera fusion is proposed, which combines Lidar data with multiple camera images to provide an optimal solution for pedestrian detection. The system model proposes a separate algorithm for image fusion in pedestrian detection. Further, architecture and framework are designed for Fully Convolutional Neural networks for LIDAR-camera fusion for Pedestrian detection. In addition, a fully functional algorithm for Pedestrians detection and identification is proposed to precisely locate the pedestrian in the range of 10 to 30 m. Finally, the proposed model's performance is evaluated based on multiple parameters such as Precision, Sensitivity, Accuracy, etc.; hence the proposed system model has proven to be effective comparatively.

AB Most formation approaches of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) focus on the control techniques, ignoring the influence of underwater channel. This paper is concerned with a communication-aware formation issue for AUVs, subject to model uncertainty and fading channel. An integral reinforcement learning (IRL) based estimator is designed to calculate the probabilistic channel parameters, wherein the multivariate probabilistic collocation method with orthogonal fractional factorial design (M-PCM-OFFD) is employed to evaluate the uncertain channel measurements. With the estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we employ the IRL and M-PCM-OFFD to develop a saturated formation controller for AUVs, dealing with uncertain dynamics and current parameters. For the proposed formation approach, an integrated optimization solution is presented to make a balance between formation stability and communication efficiency. Main innovations lie in three aspects: 1) Construct an integrated communication and control optimization framework; 2) Design an IRL-based channel prediction estimator; 3) Develop an IRL-based formation controller with M-PCM-OFFD. Finally, simulation results show that the formation approach can avoid local optimum estimation, improve the channel efficiency, and relax the dependence of AUV model parameters.

AB Despite the great technological advances in ADAS, autonomous driving still faces many challenges. Among them is improving decision-making algorithms so that vehicles can make the right decision inspired by human driving. Not only must these decisions ensure the safety of the car occupants and the other road users, but they have to be understandable by them. This article focuses on decision-making algorithms for autonomous vehicles, specifically for lane changing on highways and sub-urban roads. The challenge to overcome is to develop a decision-making algorithm that combines fidelity to human behavior and that is based on machine learning, with a global structure that allows understanding the behavior of the algorithm and that is not opaque such as black box algorithms. To this end, a three-step decision-making method was developed: trajectory prediction of the surrounding vehicles, risk and gain computation associated with the maneuver and based on the predicted trajectories, and finally decision making. For the decision making, three algorithms: decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural network are proposed and compared based on a naturalistic driving database and a driving simulator.

AB The technology of Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings tremendous possibilities for autonomous vehicle applications. One of the essential tasks of autonomous vehicle is environment perception using machine learning algorithms. Since the cyclists are the vulnerable road users, cyclist detection and tracking are important perception sub-tasks for autonomous vehicles to avoid vehicle-cyclist collision. In this paper, a robust method for cyclist detection and tracking is presented based on multi-layer laser scanner, i.e., IBEO LUX 4L, which obtains four-layer point cloud from local environment. First, the laser points are partitioned into individual clusters using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method based on subarea. Then, 37-dimensional feature set is optimized by Relief algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to produce two new feature sets. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers are further combined with three feature sets, respectively. Moreover, Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) algorithm and Kalman filter based on Current Statistical (CS) model are applied to track moving cyclists and estimate the motion state. The performance of the proposed cyclist detection and tracking method is validated in real road environment.

AB In this article, a new composite anti-windup (AW) compensator scheme is proposed to tackle the rate and amplitude saturations in an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV). The actuator input saturation is a practical and critical challenge in the controller design of autonomous vehicles. Nowadays, modern anti-windup compensators are presenting practical remedies to cope with input amplitude and rate saturation. Meanwhile, Riccati-based compensators can be a suitable choice due to their high performance and simplicity. Therefore, this article proposes an integrated approach by combining the anti-windup amplitude and rate methods to deal with the aforementioned problems. First, the basic controller function on the linear model is examined. It is shown that this controller behaves well so long as there is no saturation. However, when saturation occurs, its performance is decreased and even becomes unstable. By modifying the controller via the proposed method, the controller efficiency is increased significantly. The proposed method has been implemented on an autonomous aerial vehicle with 6-degrees of freedom (6DOF). Through various simulation scenarios, it is shown that the proposed method can show proper behavior in the case of a nonlinear and close-to-reality model of the system. In addition, the proposed controller efficacy has been investigated in a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation and it is shown that the proposed method keeps its efficiency against the practical uncertainties of the system behavior.

AB This article presents a novel thruster fault diagnosis approach for an autonomous underwater vehicle. In the novel approach, a time-frequency entropy enhancement is used to extract feature, and then a boundary constraint-assisted relative gray relational grade is applied to identify thruster fault. The time-frequency entropy enhancement is developed from the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution combined with Shannon entropy. First, the energy distributions of autonomous underwater vehicle dynamic signals are given in the time-frequency plane. And then the energy concentration in the energy distribution is enhanced based on a serial signal processing, including wavelet decomposition, modified Bayes' classification algorithm, and two dimensional convolution operation, successively. After that the Shannon entropy of the energy distribution is calculated. The boundary constraint-assisted relative gray relational grade comes from the gray relational analysis. A mapping function between the relative gray relational grade and the fault severity is established. And then the boundary constraints of relative gray relational grades at each standard fault level are determined. Moreover, the mapping function is modified based on the boundary constraints. Experiments are performed on an experimental prototype autonomous underwater vehicle in a pool. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approaches in terms of improving the sensitivity of the fault feature to the fault severity, compared with the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution combined with Shannon entropy, and increasing the identification accuracy, compared with the gray relational analysis.

AB Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landing can be useful in multiple applications. Precise landing is a difficult task because of the significant navigation errors of the global positioning system (GPS). To overcome these errors and to realize precise landing control, various sensors have been installed on UAVs. However, this approach can be challenging for micro UAVs (MAVs) because strong thrust forces are required to carry multiple sensors. In this study, a new autonomous MAV landing system is proposed, in which a landing platform actively assists vehicle landing. In addition to the vision system of the UAV, a camera was installed on the platform to precisely control the MAV near the landing area. The platform was also designed with various types of equipment to assist the MAV in searching, approaching, alignment, and landing. Furthermore, a novel algorithm was developed for robust spherical object detection under different illumination conditions. To validate the proposed landing system and detection algorithm, 80 flight experiments were conducted using a DJI TELLO drone, which successfully landed on the platform in every trial with a small landing position average error of 2.7 cm.

AB An autonomous car is a self-driving vehicle that has the capability to perceive the surrounding environment and navigate itself without human intervention. For autonomous driving, complex autonomous driving algorithms, including perception, localization, planning, and control, are required with many heterogeneous sensors, actuators, and computers. To manage the complexity of the driving algorithms and the heterogeneity of the system components, this paper applies distributed system architecture to the autonomous driving system, and proposes a development process and a system platform for the distributed system of an autonomous car. The development process provides the guidelines to design and develop the distributed system of an autonomous vehicle. For the heterogeneous computing system of the distributed system, a system platform is presented, which provides a common development environment by minimizing the dependence between the software and the computing hardware. A time-triggered network protocol, FlexRay, is applied as the main network of the software platform to improve the network bandwidth, fault tolerance, and system performance. Part II of this paper will provide the evaluation of the development process and system platform by using an autonomous car, which has the ability to drive in an urban area.

AB Emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) offers the potential to fundamentally transform the way how urban transport systems be designed and deployed, and alter the way we view private car ownership. In this article we advocate a forward-looking, ambitious and disruptive smart cloud commuting system (SCCS) for future smart cities based on shared AVs. Employing giant pools of AVs of varying sizes, SCCS seeks to supplant and integrate various modes of transport - most of personal vehicles, low ridership public buses, and taxis used in today's private and public transport systems - in a unified, on-demand fashion, and provides passengers with a fast, convenient, and low cost transport service for their daily commuting needs. To explore feasibility and efficiency gains of the proposed SCCS, we model SCCS as a queueing system with passengers' trip demands (as jobs) being served by the AVs (as servers). Using a 1-year real trip dataset from Shenzhen China, we quantify (i) how design choices, such as the numbers of depots and AVs, affect the passenger waiting time and vehicle utilization; and (ii) how much efficiency gains (i.e., reducing the number of service vehicles, and improving the vehicle utilization) can be obtained by SCCS comparing to the current taxi system. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SCCS framework can serve the trip demands with 22 percent fewer vehicles and 37 percent more vehicle utilization, which shed lights on the design feasibility of future smart transportation systems.

ID MODEL
AB Aiming at the speed change of obstacle vehicles in the process of autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) overtaking on two-lane highways, an overtaking control method including trajectory planning and trajectory control is proposed. First, the reference overtaking trajectory of the AGV is planned in stages (lane changing, passing and merging) using fifth order polynomials satisfying stability and comfort constraints. The initial planning trajectory may be unsafe due to the speed change of obstacle vehicles. So a collision prediction algorithm is built to predict two kinds of dangerous situations in real time: AGV collides with the leading vehicle during lane changing, and AGV collides with the oncoming vehicle during merging. Secondly, the potential field of the obstacle vehicles embedded with the relative speed is established and combined with the road potential field as the risk indicator. Then, combining the nonlinear model predictive control algorithm and risk index, the overtaking trajectory is replanned in real time with the initial trajectory as reference. Finally, a lateral path tracking controller based on model predictive control and a longitudinal speed tracking controller based on sliding mode control are established to track the planned trajectory rapidly and stably. To verify the performance of the proposed method, overtaking in three cases is simulated, and vehicle responding curves are obtained. The results show that the proposed control method can achieve safe and stable overtaking.

ID DESIGN
AB This letter proposes a rotation-free wireless power transfer system based on a new coil structure to achieve stable output power and efficiency against rotational misalignments for charging autonomous underwater vehicles. The new coil structure has two decoupled receivers composed of two reversely wound receiver coils and the magnetic flux directions of the two receivers are perpendicular to each other, guaranteeing a relatively constant total mutual inductance and a decoupled characteristic under rotational misalignments. The proposed coil structure is verified via finite element analysis based on ANSYS Maxwell. A rotation-free LCC-LCC compensated WPT prototype is built and the experimental results verify the theoretical analysis and simulations. The system can deliver 664Wwith a dc-dc efficiency of 92.26% under the best case and 485 W with a 92.10% dc-dc efficiency under the worst case.

AB In the context of oil spill cleaning by autonomous vehicles in dynamic and uncertain environments, this paper presents a multi-resolution algorithm that seamlessly integrates the concepts of local navigation and global navigation based on the sensory information; the objective here is to enable adaptive decision making and online replanning of vehicle paths. The proposed algorithm provides a complete coverage of the search area for clean-up of the oil spills and does not suffer from the problem of having local minima, which is commonly encountered in potential-field-based methods. The efficacy of the algorithm is tested on a high-fidelity player/stage simulator for oil spill cleaning in a harbour, where the underlying oil weathering process is modelled as 2D random-walk particle tracking.

AB This paper presents a new direct discrete-time design methodology of a robust sampled-data fuzzy controller for a class of nonlinear system with parametric uncertainties that is exactly represented by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. Based on an exact discrete-time fuzzy model in an integral form, sufficient conditions for a robust asymptotic stabilization of the nonlinear system are investigated in the discrete-time Lyapunov sense. It is shown that the resulting sampled-data controller indeed robustly asymptotically stabilizes the nonlinear plant. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, an example, a sampled-data depth control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is provided.

AB This article studies the problem of trajectory optimization for autonomous ground vehicles with the consideration of irregularly placed on-road obstacles and multiple maneuver phases. By introducing a series of event sequences, a new multiphase constrained optimal control formulation is constructed to describe the automatic overtaking process. Although existing trajectory optimization techniques can be applied to address the constructed problem, they may suffer from poor or premature convergence issues due to the complexity of the mission formulation. Thus, to offer an effective alternative, a novel desensitized trajectory optimization method is designed and implemented to explore the optimal overtaking maneuver for the AGVs. The proposed method applies a double layer structure, where an enhanced intelligent optimization method is used in the outer layer such that the main inner optimization routine can be boosted by starting at a better reference solution. The algorithm convergence as well as the solution optimality conditions are theoretically analyzed. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the validity of the established formulation. Comparative case studies were executed to demonstrate the quality of the obtained solution and the enhanced performance of the proposed trajectory optimization method.

AB In this article, we present an innovative approach, i.e., horizonwise model-predictive control (H-MPC), to solve the model-predictive control (MPC) problem of a linear time-varying (LTV) system. In H-MPC, we regard the time-varying parameters as time invariant within the prediction horizon. To solve the MPC problem of the time-varying system, the decision variable is decomposed into two terms: one for linear time-invariant optimization and the other for compensating LTV uncertainties with an introduction to a uniform compensation condition. The proposed H-MPC solves the time-varying problem by removing the uncertainty due to the future parameter variations within the horizon and by updating the time-invariant MPC at each sampling time. To validate the usefulness of the proposed H-MPC, it is applied to lane tracking control for an autonomous driving vehicle. From a comparative study of the H-MPC and conventional MPCs in lane tracking control, it is confirmed that the proposed H-MPC has a competitive performance compared to LTV-MPC despite its much simpler structure.

AB Underwater localization is one of the main problems that must be addressed in subsea exploration, where no global positioning system (GPS) is available. In addition to the traditional underwater localization systems, such as long base line (LBL), new methods have been developed to increase the navigation performance and flexibility and to reduce the deployment costs. For example, range-only and single-beacon (ROSB) is based on an autonomous vehicle that localizes and tracks different underwater targets using slant range measurements carried out with acoustic modems. This paper presents different strategies to improve ROSB tracking methods. The ROSB target tracking method can be seen as a hidden Markov model (HMM) problem. Using Bayes' rule, the probability distribution function of the HMM states can be solved by using different filtering methods. Here, we present and compare different methods under different scenarios, both evaluated in simulations and field tests. The main mathematical notation and performance of each algorithm are presented, where best practice has been derived. From a methodological point of view, this paper advanced the understanding of accuracy that can be achieved by using the ROSB target tracking methods with autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming popular among researchers and vital platforms for several autonomous mission systems. In this paper, we present the design and development of a miniature autonomous rotorcraft weighing less than 700 g and capable of waypoint navigation, trajectory tracking, visual navigation, precise hovering, and automatic takeoff and landing. In an effort to make advanced autonomous behaviors available to mini- and microrotorcraft, an embedded and inexpensive autopilot was developed. To compensate for the weaknesses of the low-cost equipment, we put our efforts into designing a reliable model-based nonlinear controller that uses an inner-loop outer-loop control scheme. The developed flight controller considers the system's nonlinearities, guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system, and results in a practical controller that is easy to implement and to tune. In addition to controller design and stability analysis, the paper provides information about the overall control architecture and the UAV system integration, including guidance laws, navigation algorithms, control system implementation, and autopilot hardware. The guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) algorithms were implemented on a miniature quadrotor UAV that has undergone an extensive program of flight tests, resulting in various flight behaviors under autonomous control from takeoff to landing. Experimental results that demonstrate the operation of the GN&C algorithms and the capabilities of our autonomous micro air vehicle are presented. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB High-precision positioning capability is a crucial technology for achieving accurate navigation in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, due to severe electromagnetic wave attenuation underwater and the unavailability of the global positioning system (GPS), inertial-navigation-based dead reckoning is considered the primary method for underwater positioning. Unfortunately, errors accumulated during the navigation process lead to unbounded drift, and filtering-based methods have been used to mitigate the errors, but with limited success. In this paper, we propose a precise underwater dead-reckoning mathematical model that recursively calculates the ground truth and corresponding errors based on an AUV's motion model, and we derive empirical formulas. Compared to related methods, this approach not only models the cumulative errors of relative noise measurements, but also provides recursive expressions with corresponding statistical moments. The experimental results demonstrate that this formula significantly reduces positioning errors in underwater navigation tasks.

AB In order to improve the control effect and robust performance of autobraking systems under overload, heat recession, and water recession, an autonomous vehicle of Chery is taken as a research subject. Parameter perturbation is investigated with a fourth dynamics perturbation model and brake perturbation model. Then, linear fractional transformations is applied to represent uncertainties and mu theory is used to design the controller of an autobraking system through D-K iteration. Simulation and autobraking system hardware in loop experiments are conducted to test the robustness of a mu controller compared with an H-infinity controller. Simulation and experimental results show that the designed mu controller can reduce the impact of system parameter perturbation as well as external noise effectively, and has better robust performance than the H-infinity controller.

AB Industrial robotics, military, surveying, and delivery applications have laid a foundation for research into autonomous machines, including unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous ground vehicles, and autonomous undersea vehicles. This paper supports this research by developing a new guidance method which combines potential fields, typically used for obstacle avoidance, and parallel navigation, a popular missile guidance method. The new unified algorithm allows a mobile robot interceptor to guide to, and rendezvous with, a moving target while avoiding obstacles in its path. A Matlab simulator is used to analyze performance for different interceptor-target geometries and obstacle densities. Simulations and analysis show that the combined algorithm increases performance by reducing the time-to-contact in most of the cases. Specifically, it was found to provide a 14.4%-21.3% improvement in approximately 96%-98% of the simulation cases.

TI Autonomous Control Agents for Adaptive MAV Mission Profiles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICRO AIR VEHICLES
LA English
DT Article
AB When a mission profile of an unmanned micro air vehicle is known a priori, one of the strategies adopted in autonomous control is to first generate a compatible trajectory in off-line and then implement a controller to track the trajectory. However, in decision rich intelligent aerial robots and in 6DOF operations of unmanned aerial vehicles, the mission profiles are usually known during an operation. Hence the trajectories are instantaneously inferred. Here an adaptive controller with capabilities to track these trajectories is required. In this paper, it is shown that an extended Kalman filter is an excellent tool to design such a controller which accepts the trajectory generation module as an input and then reconstructs its trajectories. To illustrate this feature, a 3DOF micro air vehicle in pitch plane is considered and an adaptive controller (referred as autonomous control agent) using an extended Kalman filter is applied to infer typical adaptive mission profiles.

AB With the development of automatic driving technology and the internet of vehicles, platooning based on control of connected autonomous vehicles has become one of the most promising approaches to improve traffic efficiency. This paper studies the control problem of mixed vehicle platoons consisting of human-driven vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles. Firstly, we propose a data-driven method to model mixed vehicle platoons based on Koopman operator theory. This method gives a way to represent the mixed vehicle platoon by a linear model in a high-dimensional space, the approximation of which is obtained by a neural network framework. Secondly, we employ model predictive control (MPC) to address the platoon control problem of mixed vehicle platoons, where both centralized MPC and distributed MPC algorithms are designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the data-driven modeling method and the centralized/distributed MPC algorithms is verified by numerical simulations. It is revealed that the proposed data-driven DMPC algorithm exhibits comparable control performance with less computation cost compared with the centralized MPC algorithm, and it shows faster convergence speed than the nonlinear model based DMPC algorithm.

AB End-to-end approaches are one of the most promising solutions for autonomous vehicles (AVs) decision-making. However, the deployment of these technologies is usually constrained by the high computational burden. To alleviate this problem, we proposed a lightweight transformer-based end-to-end model with risk awareness ability for AV decision-making. Specifically, a lightweight network with depth-wise separable convolution and transformer modules was firstly proposed for image semantic extraction from time sequences of trajectory data. Then, we assessed driving risk by a probabilistic model with position uncertainty. This model was integrated into deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to find strategies with minimum expected risk. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated in three lane change scenarios to validate its superiority.

AB Widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) presents formidable challenges in terms on handling scalability and complexity, particularly regarding vehicular reaction in the face of unforeseen corner cases. Hierarchical Emergent Behaviors (HEB) is a scalable architecture based on the concepts of emergent behaviors and hierarchical decomposition. It relies on a few simple but powerful rules to govern local vehicular interactions. Rather than requiring prescriptive programming of every possible scenario, HEB?s approach relies on global behaviors induced by the application of these local, well-understood rules. Our first two papers on HEB focused on a primal set of rules applied at the first hierarchical level. On the path to systematize a solid design methodology, this paper proposes additional rules for the second level, studies through simulations the resultant richer set of emergent behaviors, and discusses the communication mechanisms between the different levels.

AB Over the past several decades, the automobile industry has devoted much significant research efforts to developing autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). One of the most fundamental issues for AGVs is path following, which is concerned with the control strategy for AGVs to follow the scheduled paths. This paper presents a new path following control approach, where an output-feedback triple-step controller is designed to realize coordinated lateral and longitudinal control without a measurement of lateral velocity. The main contribution of this paper is the integrated design of the observer and control gains in the framework of Lyapunov stability and input-to-state stability (ISS) theory. The effectiveness of the proposed control system has been evaluated through simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous flights are the major industry contributors towards next-generation developments in pervasive and ubiquitous computing. Modern aerial vehicles are designed to receive actuator commands from the primary autopilot software as input to regulate their servos for adjusting control surfaces. Due to real-time interaction with the actual physical environment, there exists a high risk of control surface failures for engine, rudder, elevators, and ailerons etc. If not anticipated and then timely controlled, failures occurring during the flight can have severe and cataclysmic consequences, which may result in mid-air collision or ultimate crash. Humongous amount of sensory data being generated throughout mission-critical flights, makes it an ideal candidate for applying advanced data-driven machine learning techniques to identify intelligent insights related to failures for instant recovery from emergencies. In this paper, we present a novel framework based on machine learning techniques for failure prediction, detection, and classification for autonomous aerial vehicles. The proposed framework utilizes long short-term memory recurrent neural network architecture to analyze time series data and has been applied at the AirLab Failure and Anomaly flight dataset, which is a comprehensive publicly available dataset of various fault types in fixed-wing autonomous aerial vehicles' control surfaces. The proposed framework is able to predict failure with an average accuracy of 93% and the average time-to-predict a failure is 19 s before the actual occurrence of the failure, which is 10 s better than current state-of-the-art. Failure detection accuracy is 100% and average detection time is 0.74 s after happening of failure, which is 1.28 s better than current state-of-the-art. Failure classification accuracy of proposed framework is 100%. The performance analysis shows the strength of the proposed methodology to be used as a real-time failure prediction and a pseudo-real-time failure detection along with a failure classification framework for eventual deployment with actual mission-critical autonomous flights.

AB Autonomous vehicle path tracking accuracy and vehicle stability can hardly be accomplished by one fixed control frame in various conditions due to the changing vehicle dynamics. This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) path-tracking controller with switched tracking error, which reduces the lateral tracking deviation and maintains vehicle stability for both normal and high-speed conditions. The design begins by comparing the performance of three MPC controllers with different tracking error. The analyzing results indicate that in the steady-state condition the controller with the velocity heading deviation as the tracking error significantly improves the tracking accuracy. Meanwhile, in the transient condition, by substituting the steady-state sideslip for real-time sideslip to compute the velocity heading deviation, the tracking overshoot can be reduced. To combine the strengths of these two methods, an MPC controller with switched tracking error is designed to improve the performance in both steady-state and transient conditions. The regime condition of a vehicle maneuver and the switching instant are determined by a fuzzy-logic-based condition classifier. Both normal and aggressive driving scenarios with the vehicle lateral and longitudinal acceleration combination of 5 m/s(2) and 8 m/s(2) are designed to test the proposed controller through CarSim-Simulink platform. The simulation results show the improved performance of the MPC controller with switched tracking error both in tracking accuracy and vehicle stability in both scenarios.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are a highly discussed topic owing to their great performance and convenience. However, some requirements limit their wider deployment. Specifically, AV should be controlled by remote users during emergencies. It may lead to AV's system facing the risk of being intruded on by a malicious party, resulting in unreasonable decisions. We, therefore, design the Internet of autonomous vehicle (IoAV) model to mitigate the problems arising from these limitations. To promote a secure remote control of the AV, a reliable authentication scheme, which can be used in IoAV, must be performed. Our proposed chaotic map-based authenticated key agreement (CMAKA) method provides secure remote control features for AVs. In this method, users, data centers, and AV establish a secure communication channel through the negotiation of three independent session keys. Furthermore, a physical unclonable function (PUF) is employed to produce a trusted private key during the authentication. The security of our scheme is evaluated using game hopping through the widespread Real-or-Random (ROR) model. Compared with other existing three-factor authentication schemes, the performance of our protocol is higher in both security requirements and total cost.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle; Trajectory tracking control;

AB This article focuses on the event-triggered model-parameter-free (ETMPF) control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To realize the trajectory tracking goal under internal model parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, the ETMPF control law is firstly presented via the properties of Euler-Lagrange systems. In the designed ETMPF control law, a static event-triggered mechanism (SETM) is developed to reduce its communication burden with actuators. Then, by introducing internal dynamic variables for the SETM, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) is further developed. Compared to the SETM, the maximum triggering frequency under the DETM is computable and can be adjustable by tuning control parameters, which makes it applicable to more serve network resource-limited scenarios. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed two ETMPF control schemes is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and simulation results.

We talk about social research being dependent on 'self-selection', but we say less about what happens when the people with whom we wish to engage do not agree to do so; when we are unable to get the insights we need to answer our research questions or respond to our research aims. In this Viewpoint, we discuss three interconnected methodological themes: locating and accessing participants, participant self-selection and identification in the context of the research, and topical fatigue. We discuss these themes in relation to recent developments in transport and the rise of autonomous vehicles in particular.

AB Drowsy driving centric accidents are increasing at a frightening rate. Needless to say that the state-of-the-art technologies only have competencies in detecting drowsiness and alerting the drowsy driver. Existing methods have some remarkable hindrances in the domain of handling the distressed situation. Therefore these methodologies are ineffective to take additional safety measures if the driver is not proficient enough to operate the vehicle even though an alarm is given. Consequently, after evaluating the existing methodologies and the growth of autonomous vehicles, we have proposed an innovative approach that detects driver drowsiness in real-time. Our suggested model can locate a nearest available safe parking space and reach the parking location after initiating the autonomous driving mode to ensure safety. The proposed methodology has achieved an accuracy of 98%.

AB In this paper a biologically inspired neural dynamics and map planning based approach are simultaneously proposed for AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) path planning and obstacle avoidance in an unknown dynamic environment. Firstly the readings of an ultrasonic sensor are fused into the map using the D-S (Dempster-Shafer) inference rule and a two-dimensional occupancy grid map is built. Secondly the dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation. The AUV path is autonomously generated from the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network and previous AUV location. Finally, simulation results show high quality path optimization and obstacle avoidance behaviour for the AUV.

AB Understanding human interactions in today's transportation system is a prerequisite for developing well-accepted cooperatively interacting autonomous vehicles. This paper is devoted to the two-sided narrow passage scenario and uses trajectory data to investigate drivers' interaction behavior when encountering each other from opposite directions. Trajectory data of 209 encounters at a road narrowing were analyzed in terms of drivers' approaching behavior and arrival order. The exploratory analysis has shown that in this specific location an informal traffic rule has developed: It was not the order of arrival but the direction of travel that primarily determined who passed the road narrowing first. This result shows that informal rules can influence drivers' interaction behavior and should accordingly be considered in the development of autonomous vehicles to ensure safe and efficient encounters with human road users.

AB At present, the study on autonomous unmanned ground vehicle navigation in an unstructured environment is still facing great challenges and is of great significance in scenarios where search and rescue robots, planetary exploration robots, and agricultural robots are needed. In this paper, we proposed an autonomous navigation method for unstructured environments based on terrain constraints. Efficient path search and trajectory optimization on octree map are proposed to generate trajectories, which can effectively avoid various obstacles in off-road environments, such as dynamic obstacles and negative obstacles, to reach the specified destination. We have conducted empirical experiments in both simulated and real environments, and the results show that our approach achieved superior performance in dynamic obstacle avoidance tasks and mapless navigation tasks compared to the traditional 2-dimensional or 2.5-dimensional navigation methods.

AB The mission route plays an essential role for the mission security and reliability of an unmanned system. This paper gives a route planning method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on the hybrid of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and radial basis function (RBF). In the improved PSO algorithm, metropolis criterion is used to prevent the improved PSO algorithm from falling into local optimum and RBF is used to smooth the path planned by PSO algorithm. Compared with classic PSO algorithm, the hybrid algorithm of PSO and RBF can avoid falling into the local optimum effectively and plan an anti-collision route. Moreover, based on the simulation results, it can be seen that the approach presented here is more efficient in convergence performance, and the planned route requires lower performance of AUVs.

AB Drag estimation and shape optimization of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) hulls are critical to energy utilization and endurance improvement. In the present work, a shape optimization platform composed of several commercial software packages is presented. Computational accuracy, efficiency and robustness were carefully considered and balanced. Comparisons between experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were conducted to prove that a two-dimensional (2D) unstructured mesh, a standard wall function and adaptive mesh refinement could greatly improve efficiency as well as guarantee accuracy. Details of the optimization platform were then introduced. A comparison of optimizers indicates that the multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) obtains a better hull shape than particle swarm optimization (PSO), despite being a little more time consuming. The optimized hull shape under general volume requirement could provide reference for AUV hull design. Specific requirements based on optimization testify of the platform's robustness.

AB The goal of this project was to evaluate the potential of a controller area network (CAN bus) to be used as the communication network for a distributed control system on an autonomous agricultural vehicle. The prototype system utilized microcontroller-driven nodes to act as control points along a CAN bus. Messages were transferred to the steering, transmission, and hitch control nodes via a task computer The task computer utilized global positioning system data to generate appropriate control commands. Laboratory and field testing demonstrated that each of the control nodes could function simultaneously over the CAN bus. Results showed that the task computer adequately applied a feedback control model to the system and achieved guidance accuracy levels well within the desired range. Testing also demonstrated the system's ability to complete normal field operations, such as headland turning and implement control.

DE Autonomous vehicle; one-shot learning; policy improvement; reinforcement

AB Disengagement cases during naturalistic driving are rare or even one-shot, but valuable for autonomous driving. The autonomous vehicles are necessary to continually learn from these disengagement cases, to improve the policy for better performance when next time meeting these cases. Manually adjusting the policy or adding the rules to fix these disengagement cases may cause engineering burden and may contradict other driving functions. To this end, this work proposes a continually learning agent which can automatically get improved once encountering a disengagement case. The main idea is to establish a disengagement-imagination environment, and then train the policy using imagination data for performance improvement, named disengagement-case imagination augmented continual learning (DICL). In the imagination environment, the surrounding objects are designed to first follow the recorded trajectory, and then switch to the interactive models for the policy training. The switch point is carefully designed to make the imagination contain the disengagement reasons but avoid overfitting the collected driving case. This method is evaluated by the real autonomous driving disengagement data, collected from an open-road-testing autonomous vehicle. The results show that the DICL agent can automatically learn to handle the emerging disengagement case and similar cases. This work provides a possible way to make the AV agents automatically get improvement during road testing.

DE autonomous underwater vehicle; active disturbance rejection control;

ID AUV
AB An active disturbance rejection control based on fractional calculus is proposed to improve the motion performance and robustness of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method can estimate and compensate the total disturbance of AUV automatically. The fractional-order PID (proportional integral derivative) has fast dynamic response, which can eliminate the estimation error of extended state observer. The fractional calculus active disturbance rejection strategy combines the advantages of the above two algorithms, and it is designed for AUV heading and pitch subsystems. In addition, the stability of fractional calculus ADRC heading subsystem is proven by Lyapunov stability theorem. The numerical simulations and experimental results document that the superior performance has been achieved. The fractional calculus ADRC strategy has more excellent abilities for disturbance rejection, performs better than ADRC and PID, and has important theoretical and practical value.

AB Present study consists a pre-mission time optimal inspection path planning for visual inspection of a well-characterized submerged vertical pole using an autonomous underwater vehicle. Target environment, which is the entire surface of a submerged pole, is modelled as a planar map for easy path planning. Proposed inspection path planning utilizes the concept of grid-based coverage path planning, where the target environment is break into many same size grid cells. Various inspection path patterns are designed manually based on boustrophedon and spiral motions with different sweep direction and turning pattern. They are analysed in term of trajectory length, inspection time, and coverage percentage to choose the best inspection path among them. Calculation results show that the chosen inspection path can cover 99% of the entire pole surface with shortest distance travelled and shortest operational time.

AB In this paper, a novel dynamic velocity regulation approach is proposed for the planar trajectory tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles subject to constant disturbances by integrating two neurodynamics models and the backstepping technique. The planar trajectory tracking virtual control laws are established by improving the virtual velocity variable method, and a dynamic velocity regulation controller is designed under constant disturbances. Compared with the traditional backstepping technique, which employs virtual velocity variables to represent state errors, the represented algorithm is capable of preventing the singularity when the absolute value of yaw angle error is 90 degrees. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is well proved that the designed controlled system is uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB In this article, a deep reinforcement learning based three-dimensional path following control approach is proposed for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). To be specific, kinematic control laws are employed by using the three-dimensional line-of-sight guidance and dynamic control laws are employed by using the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3), contributing to the surge velocity, pitch angle and heading angle control of an underactuated AUV. In order to solve the chattering of controllers, the action filter and the punishment function are built respectively, which can make control signals stable. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed control approach. And results show that the AUV can complete the control mission successfully.

AB An H infinity controller combined with an Artificial Potential Field Method (APFM) was applied to seabed navigation for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), aimed particularly at obstacle avoidance and bottom-following operations in the vertical plane. Depth control and altitude control prevented the AUV from colliding with the sea bottom or with obstacles and prevented the AUV from diving beyond its maximum depth limit when bottom following. Simulation and laboratory trials with various seabed contours indicated that with the H infinity controller, the AUV was able to safely reach appointed destinations without collisions. Tests also showed that the H infinity controller was robust and suppressed interference, hence ensuring the precision of its navigation control. The proposed H infinity controller combined with the APFM has thus been proved to be both feasible and effective.

AB This paper presents the development and experimental validation of a side-scan sonar based self-localization algorithm for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Different classes of visually salient features are continuously extracted from dual-frequency sonar imagery using machine perception and subsequently utilized to generate sparse bathymetric maps. The diversity within the feature set, i.e. features of different sizes and features extracted at different sonar operating frequencies, allows for robust multimodal feature matching. Highly robust navigation solutions are generated in real-time by matching newly acquired features to a previously generated reference map. For each feature class, feature matching is carried out in four dimensions correlating feature location as well as perceived intensity. Overall utility and technical claims have been validated using real-world sonar imagery collected using an Iver3 AUV platform.

AB An accurate method to detect obstacles and dangerous areas is the key to the safe performance of autonomous robots. Time of flight sensors can report their existence through the emission, reflection, and measurement of wave patterns, but large wavelength light projection is often unreliable in outdoors environments, due to solar radiation contamination. In this paper, a specific Microsoft Kinect arrangement on a robotic vehicle is proposed, such that outdoors detection is possible. The main contribution of this paper is the description of a sequence of filtering techniques, which translate the depth image provided by the sensor into definite obstacle projections in the navigability map used by the vehicle. A series of experiments proves that the Kinect device is more accurate at detecting obstacles using this procedure than a camera pair using two different stereovision techniques.

ID LOCATIONS
AB Trajectory prediction is an essential ability for the intelligent transportation system to navigate through complex traffic scenes. In recent times, trajectory prediction has become an important task, especially in crowded scenes, because of the great demands of emerging artificial intelligence applications like service bots and autonomous cars. As autonomous vehicles travel in interactive and highly uncertain environments shared with other dynamic road agents like other vehicles or pedestrians, predicting the trajectories of the surrounding agents is essential for an autonomous driving system (ADS) to plan safe motion, fast reaction time and comfortable maneuvers. The trajectory for each dynamic object (or road agent) is described as a sequence of states within a time interval, with each state representing the object's spatial coordinates under the world coordinate frame. In the trajectory prediction (TP) problem, given the trajectory of each object between intervals of time, we predict their trajectories between these intervals of time. We plan to design a Multi-Scale Graph Neural Network (GNN) with temporal features architecture for this prediction problem. Experiments show that our model effectively captures comprehensive Spatio-temporal correlations through modeling GNN with temporal features for TP and consistently surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets for trajectory. Compared to prior methods, our model's performance is more for the sparse datasets than for the dense datasets.

AB Despite the advances in the autonomous driving domain, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are still inefficient and limited in terms of cooperating with each other or coordinating with vehicles operated by humans. A group of autonomous and human-driven vehicles (HVs) which work together to optimize an altruistic social utility can co-exist seamlessly and assure safety and efficiency on the road. Achieving this mission without explicit coordination among agents is challenging, mainly due to the difficulty of predicting the behavior of humans with heterogeneous preferences in mixed-autonomy environments. Formally, we model an AV's maneuver planning in mixed-autonomy traffic as a partially-observable stochastic game and attempt to derive optimal policies that lead to socially-desirable outcomes using a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework (MARL), and propose a semi-sequential multi-agent training and policy dissemination algorithm for our MARL problem. We introduce a quantitative representation of the AVs' social preferences and design a distributed reward structure that induces altruism into their decision-making process. Altruistic AVs are able to form alliances, guide the traffic, and affect the behavior of the HVs to handle competitive driving scenarios. We compare egoistic AVs to our altruistic autonomous agents in a highway merging setting and demonstrate the emerging behaviors that lead to improvement in the number of successful merges and the overall traffic flow and safety.

AB This article considers the issue of event-based coordinated formation control for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles subject to time-varying communication delay and alterable topology under discretized time. First, to derive the dynamics model in the discrete-time domain, the state feedback technique and the forward difference approach are employed for the continuous-time nonlinear model of autonomous underwater vehicle. For each follower, the event-triggering function and the coordinated controller are designed, using only discrete-time state information of the leader or other followers. Under this control strategy, the controller will not be updated at each discrete-time instant. Then, the coordinated control problem is turned into the asymptotic stability problem of the multi-autonomous underwater vehicle system. According to the stability analysis, sufficient conditions are presented for successfully completing the formation assignment without and with time-varying delay, respectively. Finally, by performing some numerical simulation experiments, the efficacity of our proposed event-based controller and the correctness of the main theoretical results are demonstrated. The impact of different communication conditions on the control system is revealed by the comparison of several scenarios.

AB Autonomous driving has so far received numerous attention from academia and industry. However, the inevitable occlusion is a great menace to safety and reliable driving. Existing works have primarily focused on improving the perception ability of a single autonomous vehicle (AV), but the safety problem brought by occlusions remains unanswered. In this paper, we propose a multi-tier perception task offloading framework with a collaborative computing approach, where an AV is able to achieve a comprehensive perception of the concerned region-of-interest (RoI) by leveraging collaborative computation with nearby AVs and road side units (RSUs). Besides, the collaborative computation provides offloading service for computationally intensive tasks so as to reduce processing delay. Specifically, we formulate a joint problem of perception task assignment, offloading and resource allocation, by fully considering the AV's mobility, task dependency, and delay requirement. The collaborative offloading is modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. We design a two-layer binary intelligent firefly (TL-BIFA) algorithm to solve MINLP, with the goal of minimizing execution delay. The proposed TL-BIFA synthesizes the advantages of heuristic methods and deterministic methods. Through extensive simulations, the proposed collaborative offloading approach and the TL-BIFA show superiority in enhancing the autonomous driving system's safety, efficiency and resource utilization.

AB Mapping technologies have improved over time, and autonomous driving techniques have advanced substantially over recent decades. High-definition (HD) maps are key for autonomous driving because of their accurate and rich interpretations of road scenes. HD maps provide information about road features, such as lane lines, centerlines, traffic signs, and traffic lights, to help autonomous vehicles navigate safely. HD maps have three major challenges: the standardization of the format of HD maps, conversion between map formats, and lack of techniques for automated HD map generation. These issues influence the costs of HD maps. Therefore, this article proposes strategies to overcome these challenges as well as control the cost with the support of the Ministry of the Interior in Taiwan. We established relevant HD map standards and guidelines to standardize the HD map production procedure. Additionally, we contribute to developing semiautomated HD map production tool to enhance the efficiency of HD map production. Another contribution is to develop HD map format conversion tool to satisfy the map requirement for different end-user. This project not only promotes the development of the Taiwanese autonomous driving industry but also increases its international competitiveness.

AB The development of partially and highly autonomous vehicles that take over parts of the driving task will result in changes in e.g. the responsibilities, interface and system design, task allocation and communication between driver and automated vehicle. To support this change and the increasing space of cooperative possibilities between driver and vehicle, generally accepted design principles and preconditions for successful driver-vehicle cooperation (Directability, Mutual Predictability, Joint Goals and Mutual Task-Dependency) were defined. However, research lacks validated scales measuring the proposed basic principles of driver-vehicle cooperation. Furthermore, a theory is missing that links those basic principles with a theory that enables an understanding of the influence of drivers' perception of the autonomous vehicle and context on driver-vehicle cooperation. Therefore, this work links the basic theoretical principles of driver-vehicle cooperation with the social psychological Theory of Interdependence and their dimensions (Conflict, Power, Mutual Dependence, Information Certainty, Future Interdependence). Filling the gap of missing validated scales for the principles of driver-vehicle cooperation, this study provides the development and validation of the Human-Machine-InteractionInterdependence (HMII) questionnaire. In two studies, the new HMII questionnaire to measure drivers' perception in driver-vehicle cooperation was developed. In the first study (n = 94), items for the perception of the situation were transferred from the original Theory of Interdependence to the driver-vehicle cooperation. A 7-dimension model was identified via Explorative Factor Analysis. In the second study (n = 314), the model and items were validated via confirmatory factor analysis. A seven-factor model (Power, Conflict, Mutual Dependence Information Certainty: System to Human, Information Certainty (two levels) Future Interdependence (two levels) with 33 items showed a good fit to the data, chi2 = 841, p < .001, adjusted chi2 = 1.77, SRMR = 0.071. In sum, this questionnaire can help designers evaluate the impact of their system designs on driver perceptions of the drivervehicle cooperation.

ID MODEL
AB The selected motions of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are subject to the constraints from the surrounding traffic environment, infrastructure and the vehicle's dynamic capabilities. Normally, the motion control of the vehicle is composed of trajectory planning and trajectory following according to the surrounding risk factors, the vehicles' capabilities as well as tyre/road interaction situations. However, pure trajectory following with a unique path may make the motion control of the vehicle be too careful and cautious with a large amount of steering effort. To follow a planned trajectory, the AVs with the traditional path-following control algorithms will correct their states even if the vehicles have only a slight deviation from the desired path or the vehicle detects static infrastructure like roadside trees. In this case, the safety of the AVs can be guaranteed to some degree, but the comfort and sense of hazards for the drivers are ignored, and sometimes the AVs have unusual motion behaviours which may not be acceptable to other road users. To solve this problem, this study aims to develop a safety corridor-based vehicle motion control approach by investigating human-driven vehicle behaviour and the vehicle's dynamic capabilities. The safety corridor is derived by the manoeuvring action feedback of actual drivers as collected in a driving simulator when presented with surrounding risk elements and enables the AVs to have safe trajectories within it. A corridor-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) has been developed which controls the vehicle state to achieve a smooth and comfortable trajectory while applying trajectory constraints using the safety corridor. The safety corridor and motion controller are assessed using four typical scenarios to show that the vehicle has a human-like or human-oriented behaviour which is expected to be more acceptable for both drivers and other road users.

AB Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) is widely used for localization in the autonomous driving sector. The traditional methods use the onboard camera to characterize the surrounding environment and estimate the pose of vehicles. However, the accuracy and robustness are fragile when the vehicle moves rapidly. To tackle this problem, a map aided Visual-Inertial fusion method is proposed. Firstly, the camera is adopted to reconstruct and save the map of the surrounding environment at the low driving speed. In the second run, the pose of the vehicle is estimated by loading and matching on the previously built map. Since the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is integrated, the errors of visual map can be effectively corrected in the stage of map building. The experimental results on the KITTI dataset and real-world scenes show that the proposed algorithm has excellent performance for continuous localization. Besides, though the quantitative evaluation for Root-Mean-Square-Errors (RMSEs), Frame-Lost-Rate (FLR), and Path-Lost-Rate (PLR) metrics, it is also verified to have higher accurate and robust performance than the state-of-the-art V/VI-SLAM algorithms.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the most disruptive technologies with potentially wide-ranging social implications, including improvements in passenger/driver safety, environmental protection, and equity considerations. The current research extends the UTAUT2 model in the context of fully AVs (level 5 automation) to determine and rank determinants of intention to adopt AVs. Collected data from 378 respondents were analysed by a hybrid approach employing partial least squares (PLS) complemented by the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) technique. According to the findings, five major determinants emerged: trust, hedonic motivation, social influence, compatibility, and effort expectancy. Furthermore, compatibility positively moderates the association between performance expectancy and intention to use AVs. The findings shed light on determinant factors, their level of importance, and the potential interplay between them in shaping individuals' intention to adopt and use AVs. Furthermore, the current research provides valuable insights to carmakers, technology developers, and practitioners on determinants of AVs adoption, assisting them in devising effective AVs-related strategies.

ID TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROL; MANAGEMENT
AB Reservation-based intersection controls, in which vehicles reserve space-time paths through the intersection, have the potential to make greater use of intersection capacity than traffic signals. However, the efficiency of previous microsimulations of reservations has been severely limited by, a protocol that requires vehicles to request reservations and the intersection manager to accept or reject them. We propose a new protocol, AIM*, in which the intersection manager assigns reservations to vehicles, to greatly increase the optimization possibilities. Then, we present a mixed integer linear program for optimally choosing vehicle reservations under AIM*. The formulation is similar to conflict resolution models for aviation, and ensures separation at all points that vehicles might intersect. We therefore present a rolling-horizon algorithm to extend the method to larger numbers of vehicles. Results show that the optimal reservation assignments from AIM* significantly reduce delays over previous protocols. Furthermore,, the rolling horizon solutions have similar delays to a fixed horizon, thereby providing an efficient method of implementing AIM*.

ID DUTY VEHICLE
AB In the era of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, platooning has the potential to increase roadway capacity and reduce energy consumption. However, as vehicles try to form platoons they may also expend extra energy. Also, depending on its position within a platoon, the energy savings of each vehicle can be different. Thus, optimizing and quantifying the savings that may be gained from platooning is challenging. In this paper, we develop a simulation-optimization framework to tackle this challenge of quantifying energy savings from platooning. Our optimization model determines vehicle-to-platoon assignments given the current location, speed, and destination of all the vehicles and platoons on the freeway. The simulation model takes these platooning decisions from the optimization model and implements them. Vissim is used to simulate the actions taken by all the vehicles and platoons and capture the energy expended by each vehicle over its entire trip duration. To quantify the energy savings, the system is simulated with and without platooning. That is, the optimization model is turned off when assessing the performance of the system without platooning. In addition to the simulation-optimization framework, an accurate energy consumption model is developed in this paper, which is inspired by the work of Tadakuma and colleagues. The energy consumption model utilizes a hybrid prediction formula for aerodynamic drag reduction in multi-vehicle formations unifying both physical mechanisms and existing empirical study data. Our results show that a system wide savings of about 3% can be realized over 160 kilometers when platoons are formed strategically.

AB For autonomous vehicles, real-time localization and mapping in the unknown environment is very important. In this paper, a fast and lightweight 3D LiDAR simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) is presented for the localization of autonomous vehicles in large-scale urban environments. A novel encoding approach based on depth information is proposed to encode unordered point clouds with various resolutions, which avoids missing dimensional information in the projection of point clouds onto a 2D plane. Principal components analysis (PCA) is modified by dynamically selecting neighborhood points according to the encoded depth information to fit the local plane with less time consuming. The threshold and the number of feature points are adaptive according to distance intervals, results in sparse feature points extracted and uniformly distributed in the three-dimensional space. The extracted significant feature points improve the accuracy of the odometer and speed up the alignment of the point cloud. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are verified on the KITTI odometry benchmark and MVSECD. A fast runtime of 21 ms is obtained for the odometer estimation. Compared to several typical state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI odometry benchmark, the proposed approach reduces translation errors by at least 19% and rotation errors by 7.1%.

AB Ensuring a convenient yet accurate localization solution is an essential problem in wireless-denied industrial scenarios. Therefore, in this study, a vision localization system with light emitting diode (LED) array targets for autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) navigation is proposed. The visible targets are calibrated and the pose can be computed using a camera that views the LED target. A novel data filtering method that integrates the odometer data and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data with vision data is introduced to provide stable and accurate localization. The vision localization system was tested on a 5-m-long AGV and the results demonstrated that the proposed system obtained a static position accuracy at 6 mm, kinematic position accuracy at 10 mm, and angle accuracy at 0.052 degrees, which is more precise than the other methods used in industrial AGV applications.

AB In this paper, a disturbance observer-based model predictive control (DO-MPC) scheme is developed for cross tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under sea current disturbances. A high-gain observer is used to estimate the current velocity, external sway force and yaw torque. Based on the disturbance estimates, a nonlinear model predictive controller is designed with consideration of actuator constraints. The control inputs are solved by optimizing the future trajectories of the nonlinear system under input constraints within a certain time horizon, which are predicted by the system model with estimated disturbances. The stability of the predictive control cross-tracking system is also proved with a Lyapunor-based method. The comparative simulation results with different algorithms are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents an integrated approach, of a multi-criteria decision-making framework and fuzzy multi-objective programming to optimize dispatching and rebalancing for Ride-sharing Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (RAMoD) systems, whereby, a fleet of self-driving electric vehicles are coordinated to service on-demand travel requests and eventually allowing multiple passengers to share rides. Specifically, the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and the Fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution are first integrated in order to analyze customer preferences, prioritize their attitudes toward autonomous vehicles, and then to rank fleet vehicles according to these prioritizations. Next, leveraging the ranks of vehicles, we introduce a new Multi-Objective Possibilistic Linear Programming (MOPLP) model, considering realistic constraints and handling the uncertain nature of some critical data affecting RAMoD systems. Three conflicting goals are considered simultaneously which are (i) to minimize the lost customer requests, (ii) to minimize the total transportation cost and (iii) to improve customer satisfaction. This MOPLP model is converted to an equivalent crisp MOLP through applying appropriate strategies and the goal programming method is called to solve this MOLP and find an efficient compromise solution. Finally, the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach are presented through an illustrative example. Collectively, this work provides a unified framework for controlling and analyzing RAMoD systems, which includes a wide range of modeling options (e.g., the inclusion of the uncertain future demand), and provides the first correlation between the dispatching and rebalancing decisions, and the process of analyzing customer preferences toward autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to take complete control of the driving process, enabling the former drivers to act as passengers only. This could lead to increased sickness as they can be engaged in tasks other than driving. Adopting different sickness mitigation techniques gives us unique types of motion sickness in autonomous vehicles to be studied. In this paper, we report on a study where we explored the possibilities of assessing motion sickness with electrogastrography (EGG), a non-invasive method used to measure the myoelectric activity of the stomach, and its potential usage in autonomous vehicles (AVs). The study was conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator with a virtual reality (VR) headset. There separate EGG measurements were performed: before, during and after the driving AV simulation video in VR. During the driving, the participants encountered two driving environments: a straight and less dynamic highway road and a highly dynamic and curvy countryside road. The EGG signal was recorded with a proprietary 3-channel recording device and Ag/AgCl cutaneous electrodes. In addition, participants were asked to signalize whenever they felt uncomfortable and nauseated by pressing a special button. After the drive they completed also the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and reported on their overall subjective perception of sickness symptoms. The EGG results showed a significant increase of the dominant frequency (DF) and the percentage of the high power spectrum density (FSD) as well as a significant decrease of the power spectrum density Crest factor (CF) during the AV simulation. The vast majority of participants reported nausea during more dynamic conditions, accompanied by an increase in the amplitude and the RMS value of EGG. Reported nausea occurred simultaneously with the increase in EGG amplitude. Based on the results, we conclude that EGG could be used for assessment of motion sickness in autonomous vehicles. DF, CF and FSD can be used as overall sickness indicators, while the relative increase in amplitude of EGG signal and duration of that increase can be used as short-term sickness indicators where the driving environment may affect the driver.

AB From the early stages of autonomous vehicle's development, traffic light detection/perception system have been an important area of research for making collision safe self-driving vehicles. Here Automatic Traffic Light Detection System (ALTDS) helps in accurate detection of Traffic Lights for Autonomous vehicles and Driver assistance systems (DAS). These vision-based system captures images using a camera mounted on a car and no other sensors. As traffic light is a small object in a real-time traffic scenario, so high-quality images are the main success factor of ATLDS. This paper elucidates the ideas and challenges that needs to be worked upon for better traffic light detection system used in self-driving cars. In this paper, we present a state-of-art review of various techniques used in traffic light detection. Different ATLDS techniques such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification and post-processing are categorized based on the features used at each stage, a comparison of the pros and cons of each technique is also provided. The hardware/software limitations, laws related to self-driving vehicles along-with simulation environments are also provided. The conclusion and future scope are given at the end.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicles (AV) heralds yet another turning point in the evolution of the urban land-scape, our daily lives, and the advancement of human civilization as a whole. A very disruptive technology, whose implementation will have ramifications for road safety, air pollution, travel behavior, parking issues, commute time, and other aspects of daily life. The introduction of autonomous vehicles for regular transportation in developed countries is expected to take place over the next decade. Its implementation would be impossible for developing countries for another five decades, at the very least. However, there is potential for its use in selected applications soon. This paper investigates and analyzes the challenges that will be faced in the wide-spread adoption AV in developing countries. The literature is used to identify a variety of challenges which are then modeled using a hybrid approach that incorporates both ISM (Interpretive Structural Modeling) and MICMAC (Matrice d'impacts croise ' s multiplication applique ' e a ' un classment) techniques. The results of this analysis would help policy makers and AV manufacturers to understand the level of significance of each chal-lenge and its interrelations. This would help them to focus on critical challenges and initiate remedial actions.

AB Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) are robots destined for the operation at water basins like lakes, canals, harbors and even open sea. They are used for different purposes, e.g. for patrol tasks, as scouts, or as a support for Navy ships. One of the main tasks of ASV is to move along a fixed path to a destination point. To this end, an anti-collision system (ACS) has to be used with the ability to lead ASV along a path and to simultaneously avoid all additional objects present at the basin, e.g. ships, sailing boats, fishing cutters, icebergs. To perform this task, the ACS implemented as an evolutionary neural network can be used. The paper describes architecture of the neural ACS, presents two neuro-evolutionary methods used to build the system, and reports the whole process of constructing it. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This article presents a novel thruster fault feature extraction method for autonomous underwater vehicle in time-varying ocean currents. The novel method is based on the combination of ensemble empirical mode decomposition and independent component analysis, which is a universal single-channel blind source separation method. When using ensemble empirical mode decomposition to decompose the autonomous underwater vehicle surge speed signal into a set of intrinsic mode functions, the original number of intrinsic mode functions is big, making the independent components that are separated and reconstructed from the intrinsic mode functions based on independent component analysis contain many false components. To reduce the original number of intrinsic mode functions, a method combining wavelet decomposition with empirical mode decomposition is proposed. When extracting fault feature value from independent components based on modified Bayes' classification algorithm, the results show that the difference of fault feature value and noise feature value is small, and the ratio of fault feature value and noise feature value is small as well, which make it difficult to distinguish fault feature value from noise feature value. To increase the difference and the ratio, a wavelet detail component-assisted feature extraction method is proposed. The method combining wavelet decomposition with empirical mode decomposition and the wavelet detail component-assisted feature extraction method together constitute a novel thruster fault feature extraction approach which is suitable for autonomous underwater vehicle in time-varying ocean currents. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by the pool experiments of the experimental prototype.

AB Developing a human-like autonomous driving system has gained increasing amounts of attention from both technology companies and academic institutions, as it can improve the interpretability and acceptance of the autonomous system. Planning a safe and human-like obstacle avoidance trajectory is one of the critical issues for the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, when designing automatic obstacle avoidance systems, few studies have focused on the obstacle avoidance characteristics of human drivers. This paper aims to develop an obstacle avoidance trajectory planning and trajectory tracking model for AVs that is consistent with the characteristics of human drivers' obstacle avoidance trajectory. Therefore, a modified artificial potential field (APF) model was established by adding a road boundary repulsive potential field and ameliorating the obstacle repulsive potential field based on the traditional APF model. The model predictive control (MPC) algorithm was combined with the APF model to make the planning model satisfy the kinematic constraints of the vehicle. In addition, a human driver's obstacle avoidance experiment was implemented based on a six-degree-of-freedom driving simulator equipped with multiple sensors to obtain the drivers' operation characteristics and provide a basis for parameter confirmation of the planning model. Then, a linear time-varying MPC algorithm was employed to construct the trajectory tracking model. Finally, a co-simulation model based on CarSim/Simulink was established for off-line simulation testing, and the results indicated that the proposed trajectory planning controller and the trajectory tracking controller were more human-like under the premise of ensuring the safety and comfort of the obstacle avoidance operation, providing a foundation for the development of AVs.

AB Numerous countries are integrating autonomous vehicles into their public transport systems. Among the expected benefits of autonomous public transport, increased mobility for families with young children is foregrounded. Yet, the potential risks associated with autonomous public transport may impede parents' acceptance of the technology for use by their children. As risk communication is an effective strategy for mitigating the influence of risk perception on acceptance, this study sought to proactively identify risk perceptions that parents hold toward autonomous public transport. Against the backdrop of Singapore's imminent deployment of autonomous public transport and informed by the social representations theory, we elicited a mental model of parents' risk perceptions toward autonomous public transport that was sensitive to the diversity of opinion among parents and their preferences for risk communication messages about autonomous public transport. To that end, we conducted three online focus group discussions consisting of 21 Singaporean parents who had children aged 2 wk to 12 years old. Theoretically, this study addresses research gaps in the mental models literature and offers theoretical implications for scholars seeking to employ the mental models approach to understand lay risk perceptions. Practically, this study informs the design of relevant and targeted risk communication messages about autonomous public transport.

AB This paper addresses trajectory optimization problems for underwater data muling with mobile nodes. In the underwater data muling scenario, multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) sample a mission area, and autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) visit the navigating AUVs to retrieve the collected data. The optimization objectives are to simultaneously maximize fairness in data transmissions and minimize the travel distance of the surface nodes. We propose an nearest-K reinforcement learning algorithm, which chooses only from the nearest-K AUVs as candidates for the next node for data transmissions. We use the distance between AUVs and the ASV as the state, selected AUVs as the action. A reward is designed as the function of both the data volume transmitted and the ASV travel distance. In the scenario with multiple ASVs, an AUV association strategy is presented to support the use of multiple surface nodes. We conduct computer simulations for performance evaluation. The effects from the number of AUVs, the size of the mission area, and the state number are investigated. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional methods in terms of the fairness and ASV travel distance.

AB Panoramic multiple-moving-target recognition and path tracking for agricultural vehicles refers to the process of moving toward the target autonomously in an environment with obstacles. In this paper, the author studies the panoramic multi-moving-target recognition and tracking for autonomous-navigation agricultural vehicles. Through learning training with weight for neural network, the method can effectively eliminate the crosstalk influence for output characteristics of a pressure-sensing array sensor among non-target parameters and largescale sensor signals, such as environment temperature and voltage disturbance, thereby improving the stability and reliability of the agricultural vehicle tactile-sensing suit system. Panoramic vision possessed the advantages of non-blind area detection, and the improved algorithm solved the problem of the overlap in multi-moving object tracking. The multivision images were acquired to stitch panoramic images, the improved kernel function algorithm based on segmented images was used to detect and track the moving object automatically and rapidly. Experiments showed that compared with the traditional kernel function algorithm, the improved algorithm decreased the memory consumption by 66.8% and increased the algorithm speed by 35.63%.

The system has been designed for the long-term monitoring of oil spills, including the search for the spill, and transmitting information on its location, extent, direction and speed. Both vehicles are controlled by two different types of bio-inspired neural networks: a Self-Organization Direction Mapping Network for trajectory generation and a Neural Network for Avoidance Behaviour for avoiding obstacles. The systems' resilient capabilities are provided by bio-inspired algorithms implemented in a modular software architecture and controlled by redundant devices to give the necessary robustness to operate in the difficult conditions typically found in long-term oil-spill operations. The efficacy of the vehicles' adaptive navigation system and long-term mission capabilities are shown in the experimental results.

DE Autonomous vehicle; intersection control; trajectory planning; bilevel

AB Advances in autonomous and connected vehicles bring new opportunities for intelligent intersection control strategies. In this paper, we propose a centralised way to jointly integrate an intersection control problem with vehicle trajectory planning. It is formulated as a bilevel optimisation problem in which the upper level is designed to minimise the total travel time by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. In contrast, the lower level is a linear programming (LP) model with an objective function to maximise the total speed entering the intersection. The two levels are coupled by the arrival time and terminal speed. By using the relationship between the safe time headway and the process time, a novel platoon-based method is developed to reduce the computational burden. Finally, simulation tests are carried out to investigate the control performance under different demands, intersection lengths, communication ranges and traffic compositions.

AB Pedestrian detection and tracking is the key to autonomous vehicle navigation systems avoiding potentially dangerous situations. Firstly, the probability distribution of colour information is established after a pedestrian is located in an image. Then the detected results are utilized to initialize a Kalman filter to predict the possible position of the pedestrian centroid in the future frame. A Camshift tracking algorithm is used to track the pedestrian in the specific search window of the next frame based on the prediction results. The actual position of the pedestrian centroid is output from the Camshift tracking algorithm to update the gain and error covariance matrix of the Kalman filter. Experimental results in real traffic situations show the proposed pedestrian tracking algorithm can achieve good performance even when they are partly occluded in inconsistent illumination circumstances.

AB Teleoperation will be used for rover control during lunar missions. However the interesting places for scientific investigations are located in difficult areas: the south pole, or deep craters in which communications to the earth will be limited and possibly interrupted. To investigate the feasibility of such missions, a testbed has been built in order to check the feasibility of remote control of the rover in the presence of important time delays with low-rate communications, as well as to demonstrate the capability of autonomous motion during communications blackout periods. The testbed consists of a 6x6 vehicle able to move on a moon-representative terrain, either in an autonomous mode or in low-communication-rate teleoperation called TESA. This paper describes the vehicle,its control and the results obtained during the tests. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Integration of self-driving functions in electric vehicles is radically changing the transportation systems, and representing an opportunity for power utilities to develop innovative solutions for harnessing the spatio-temporal charging flexibility of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs). This paper develops a multi-agent reinforcement learning model for intelligent real-time coordinated operation of interdependent autonomous electric ride-hailing system (AERS) and power distribution system (PDS), which enables the coordinated routing and charging of AEVs while ensuring the quality of service by meeting spatio-temporal passenger demand and regularly charging the batteries. The proposed model adopts a modified deep Q-network method with multi-agent rollout to determine the near-optimal solution for the coordinated operation problem that determines the routing and charging of numerous AEVs in real-time. The proposed model is tested on a 13-node transportation network, adopted from the Salt Lake City transportation system, and the IEEE 33-bus test power distribution system to showcase the efficiency of the proposed model in determining the real-time routing and charging decisions for AEVs while meeting the operational constraints of both AERS and PDS.

AB The Fourth Amendment's automobile exception generally allows vehicles to be searched without a warrant. This lessened degree of protection is based partially on the need to afford law enforcement officials discretion when a suspect, evidence, or contraband is found in an automobile. It is also based on the diminished expectation of privacy in vehicles, due to their pervasive regulation and use of the public roadways. Although an autonomous vehicle would seem to undermine the mobility rationale for the automobile exception, it is the information such vehicles collect about their drivers that merits a departure from established Fourth Amendment doctrine to ensure that basic privacy protections remain in full force. This Note argues that although the mobility analysis of the automobile exception does not compel a new approach to Fourth Amendment analysis for autonomous vehicles, the information these vehicles collect represents such a significant privacy interest that law enforcement officials should be required to obtain a warrant before accessing vehicle data. This result is supported by the Supreme Court's analysis in Riley v. California and United States v. Jones.

AB In this paper, an adaptive backstepping control scheme is proposed to solve the the surge motion tracking control problem of an autonomous undersea vehicle (AUV) with system constraint. First, an initial rectification reference signal is constructed for the subsequent implementation of deferred output constraint and making the control input smaller and smoother in the early stage of system operation. Second, a barrier Lyapunov function is adopted for developing an output-constrained state feedback adaptive controller. Then, on the basis of coordinate transformation and estimating the derivative of surge displacement by a linear and nonlinear combined differentiator, we develop an output feedback adaptive backstepping control scheme for AUVs whose velocity signals are unmeasurable. We also carried out a comparative numerical simulation with traditional adaptive control to verify the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.

AB Currently, autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are being actively studied. In particular, there are high expectations for their use in aquaculture and research in coastal areas and by the fishing industry. However, conventional ship-based ASVs require considerable manpower and time during loading and unloading. In addition, it takes time to set up the base station, which makes the use of ASVs difficult. Therefore, we are developing a small ASV based on a surfboard that can be easily operated. We also utilize a sliding mode control method that ignores the effects of model errors and disturbances. A waypoint navigation test and a dynamic position system test were conducted on the developed ASV using this control method and this paper reports the experimental results, along with the results of an experiment combining waypoint navigation dynamic position system control.

AB A set of structural cohesiveness issues raised in control of autonomous multi-vehicle formations is analysed, using a recently developed theoretical framework of graph rigidity and persistence. The general characteristics of rigid and persistent formations and some operational criteria to check the rigidity and persistence of a given formation from the aspect of their use in cohesive motion of vehicle formations, including cohesive formation flight is reviewed. Employing these characteristics and criteria, systematic procedures are provided for acquiring and maintaining the persistence of autonomous formations, which are often found in real-world applications. Although these procedures are provided for certain formation classes (in the case of acquisition) or for certain formation operations (in the case of maintenance), the methodology used to develop these procedures has the potential to generate similar procedures for persistence acquisition and maintenance for other formation classes and operations as well.

AB Semantic segmentation could obtain the pixel level classification of surrounding environments which is an essential task for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots visual perception. Most existing semantic segmentation networks were focused on the visual perception of autonomous vehicles. Little attention is paid to the semantic segmentation for UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) visual perception, which is crucial to UAV autonomous flight and landing spot searching. Compared with views from autonomous vehicles, the UAV-based views were more challenging for the semantic segmentation task due to images captured by UAV containing large-scale variation of objects size caused by different altitude and angle. The existing semantic segmentation networks for the visual perception of autonomous vehicles are generally inadequate to effectively extract the representative features of UAV images which required contain context information and local information simultaneously. A cascade composite transformer-based semantic segmentation network is proposed in this study for UAV visual percep-tion. A cascade composite encoder is designed which consists of three transformer-based feature extraction backbones and cascade fused low-level features, middle-level features and high-level features to achieve better feature representation capacity. The spatial enhanced transformer block is implemented as the basic feature extraction block of each backbone to make the extracted features contain context information of environments and local information of objects. A symmetric rhombus decoder is proposed to integrate multi-stage features and make fully utilise of middle stage features which contained abundance of useful information, thus accurately pixel level prediction could be obtained in this way. Ablation studies and comparison experiments for the pro-posed CCTseg have been conducted on two public UAV imagery datasets suitable for UAV autonomous flight and landing spot observing. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed network structure and the superiority of proposed network over other state-of-the-art methods for the semantic seg-mentation of UAV visual perception.

AB This article presents an approach to autonomous flight planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-Drones as data collectors to the Internet of Things (IoT). We have proposed a model for only one aircraft, as well as for multiple ones. A clustering technique that extends the scope of the number of IoT devices (e.g., sensors) visited by UAVs is also addressed. The flight plan generated from the model focuses on preventing breakdowns due to a lack of battery charge to maximize the number of nodes visited. In addition to the drone autonomous flight planning, a data storage limitation aspect is also considered. We have presented the energy consumption of drones based on the aerodynamic characteristics of the type of aircraft. Simulations show the algorithm's behavior in generating routes, and the model is evaluated using a reliability metric.

AB There are several types of intersections such as merge-roads, diverge-roads, plus-shape intersections and two types of T-shape junctions in urban roads. When an autonomous vehicle encounters new intersections, it is crucial to recognize the types of intersections for safe navigation. In this paper, a novel intersection type recognition method is proposed for an autonomous vehicle using a multi-layer laser scanner. The proposed method consists of two steps: (1) static local coordinate occupancy grid map (SLOGM) building and (2) intersection classification. In the first step, the SLOGM is built relative to the local coordinate using the dynamic binary Bayes filter. In the second step, the SLOGM is used as an attribute for the classification. The proposed method is applied to a real-world environment and its validity is demonstrated through experimentation.

AB The inherent strongly nonlinear and coupling performance of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), maneuvering motion in the diving plane determines its difficulty in parametric identification. The motion parameters in diving plane are obtained by executing the Zigzag-like motion based on a mathematical model of maneuvering motion. A separate identification method is put forward for parametric identification by investigating the motion equations. Support vector machine is proposed to estimate the hydrodynamic derivatives by analyzing the data of surge, heave and pitch motions. Compared with the standard coefficients, the identified parameters show the validation of the proposed identification method. Sensitivity analysis based on numerical simulation demonstrates that poor sensitive derivative gives bad estimation results. Finally the motion simulation is implemented based on the dominant sensitive derivatives to verify the reconstructed model.

   control; uncertainties
AB In this article, we propose a robust depth control design scheme for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties and disturbances. The controller is designed via a new indirect robust control method that handles the uncertainties by formulating the uncertainty bounds into the cost functional and then transforming the robust control problem into an equivalent optimal control problem. Both robust asymptotic stability and optimality can be achieved and proved with this new formulation. The theta-D method is utilised to solve the resultant nonlinear optimal control problem such that an approximate closed-form feedback controller can be obtained and thus is easy to implement onboard without intensive computation load. Simulation results demonstrate that robust depth control is accomplished under the system parameter uncertainties and disturbances with small control fin deflection requirement.

AB The stability of the motion control system is one of the decisive factors of the control quality for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The divergence of control, which the unstable system may be brought about, is fatal to the operation of AUV. The stability analysis of the PD and S-surface speed controllers based on the Lyapunov's direct method is proposed in this paper. After decoupling the six degree-of-freedom (DOF) motions of the AUV, the axial dynamic behavior is discussed and the condition is deduced, in which the parameters selection within stability domain can guarantee the system asymptotically stable. The experimental results, in a tank and on the sea have successfully verified the algorithm reliability, which can be served as a good reference for analyzing other AUV nonlinear control systems.

AB Vehicle behavior decision control plays a crucial role in the development of autonomous driving. However, existing autonomous driving behavior decision control algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning face several challenges, such as low efficiency in updating target network data and a lack of effective balancing between old and new experiences. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dueling double deep Q network (dueling DDQN) algorithm based on a single-step momentum update mechanism. Firstly, a single-step momentum update mechanism is designed to significantly improve the update speed of target network parameters and achieve a balanced weighting of old and new experiences during the parameter update process. Subsequently, the network structures of dueling networks and DDQNs are integrated to enhance the understanding capability of autonomous vehicles concerning their current states. Finally, tests are conducted on the OpenAI Gym simulation platform to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results verified that the dueling DDQN algorithm with single-step momentum updates contributes to improving the convergence speed of autonomous driving car behavior decisions. Compared with the DQN and DDQN algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieved a success rate increase of 6.0 and 8.4 percentage points in the challenging three-lane highway Test Scenario 1, and a success rate increase of 16.7 and 2.9 percentage points in Test Scenario 2, respectively. These findings demonstrate a safer and more efficient performance in autonomous driving decision-making.

AB In order to solve the manual labelling, long-tail effect and driving conservatism of the existing decision-making algorithm. This paper proposed an integrated decision-making framework (IDF) for highway autonomous vehicles. Firstly, states of the highway traffic are extracted by the velocity, time headway (TH) and the probabilistic lane distribution of the surrounding vehicles. With the extracted traffic state, the reinforcement learning (RL) is adopted to learn the optimal state-action pair for specific scenario. Analogously, by mapping millions of traffic scenarios, huge amounts of state-action pairs can be stored in the experience pool. Then the imitation learning (IL) is further employed to memorize the experience pool by deep neural networks. The learning result shows that the accuracy of the decision network can reach 94.17%. Besides, for some imperfect decisions of the network, the rule-based method is taken to rectify by judging the long-term reward. Finally, the IDF is simulated in G25 highway and has promising results, which can always drive the vehicle to the state with high efficiency while ensuring safety.

AB Vision-based lane-detection methods provide low-cost density information about roads for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient method to expand the application of these methods to cover low-speed environments. First, the reliable region near the vehicle is initialized and a series of rectangular detection regions are dynamically constructed along the road. Then, an improved symmetrical local threshold edge extraction is introduced to extract the edge points of the lane markings based on accurate marking width limitations. In order to meet real-time requirements, a novel Bresenham line voting space is proposed to improve the process of line segment detection. Combined with straight lines, polylines, and curves, the proposed geometric fitting method has the ability to adapt to various road shapes. Finally, different status vectors and Kalman filter transfer matrices are used to track the key points of the linear and nonlinear parts of the lane. The proposed method was tested on a public database and our autonomous platform. The experimental results show that the method is robust and efficient and can meet the real-time requirements of autonomous vehicles.

AB The accelerating development of autonomous vehicles is expected to have important effects on society such as reducing the number of traffic accidents, preventing the disabilities and deaths attributed to car accidents, and reducing pollution. However, their adoption depends on the willingness of the population to accept this innovation and incorporate it in their everyday activities. This study investigated the association between socio-demographic factors, political ideology, and attitudes toward technology and its perceived potential impact on society on support for driverless cars. We conducted a secondary analysis of a large sample of employees in the United States (n = 2,470). Based on conceptual frameworks relevant to the study of technology adoption such as the self-interest hypothesis, the usefulness of the technology, ideological orientation, and socio-demographic gaps in attitudes toward technology, our results indicate that perceived social outcomes of driverless cars are strongly associated with their support. Age and gender are negatively associated with support for autonomous vehicles. In contrast, perceived positive outcomes of the introduction of technology in the workplace are positively associated with them. Individuals with a consistently conservative ideology are also less likely to be supporters of autonomous vehicles. Our findings indicate that the centrality of the expected societal impact of autonomous vehicles implies the need to provide the public with accurate facts about their expected effect. Doing so is critical to increasing the public's willingness to adopt the technology and support its production. People must also be reassured that regulations and product designs will be created to ensure their safety.

AB Autonomous Driving (AD) promises an efficient, comfortable and safe driving experience. Nevertheless, fatalities involving vehicles equipped with Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) are on the rise, especially those related to the perception module of the vehicle. This paper presents a real-time and power-efficient 3D Multi-Object Detection and Tracking (DAMOT) method proposed for Intelligent Vehicles (IV) applications, allowing the vehicle to track 360 degrees surrounding objects as a preliminary stage to perform trajectory forecasting to prevent collisions and anticipate the ego-vehicle to future traffic scenarios. First, we present our DAMOT pipeline based on Fast Encoders for object detection and a combination of a 3D Kalman Filter and Hungarian Algorithm, used for state estimation and data association respectively. We extend our previous work ellaborating a preliminary version of sensor fusion based DAMOT, merging the extracted features by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using camera information for long-term re-identification and obstacles retrieved by the 3D object detector. Both pipelines exploit the concepts of lightweight Linux containers using the Docker approach to provide the system with isolation, flexibility and portability, and standard communication in robotics using the Robot Operating System (ROS). Second, both pipelines are validated using the recently proposed KITTI-3DMOT evaluation tool that demonstrates the full strength of 3D localization and tracking of a MOT system. Finally, the most efficient architecture is validated in some interesting traffic scenarios implemented in the CARLA (Car Learning to Act) open-source driving simulator and in our real-world autonomous electric car using the NVIDIA AGX Xavier, an AI embedded system for autonomous machines, studying its performance in a controlled but realistic urban environment with real-time execution (results).

ID DECISION-MAKING; COORDINATION; MODEL
AB In order to resolve the driving conflict and improve the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles at unsignalized intersections, a new decision-making method based on game theory with personalized driving preferences considered is proposed in this paper. In the decision-making method, the alterable game mode is constructed by combing the designed game entrying mechanism and replanning of game sequential order under different intersection conditions to ensure the adaptiveness and effectiveness of the decision-making algorithm. Besides, four payoff indicators and personalized payoff function are designed with the consideration of driving efficiency, safety and comfort requirement. The advantage of proposed method is that it not only reduces the complexity of game mode and improves the effectiveness at the same time, but also fully considers the personalized driving preferences to realize human-like driving and personalized decision while the existing methods usually neglect the difference among the drivers and its influence. Five different typical scenarios at the unsignalized intersection are given under co-simulation environment of Matlab and Prescan. The results show that the proposed decision-making method is able to resolve the driving conflict and ensure the safe passage of autonomous vehicles at unsignalized intersections, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB How decisions are made when autonomous vehicles (AVs) are faced with moral dilemmas is still a challenge. For this problem, this paper proposed the concept of common principles, which were drawn from the general public choice and could be generally accepted by society. This study established five moral dilemma scenarios with variables including the number of sacrifices, passenger status, presence of children, decision-making power subjects, and laws. Based on existing questionnaire data, we used gray correlation analysis to analyze the influence of the individual and psychological factors of participants in decision-making. Then, an independent sample t-test and analysis of covariance were selected to analyze the influence relationship between individual and psychological factors. Finally, by induction statistics of decision choices and related parameters of participants, we obtain common principles of autonomous vehicles, including the principle of protecting law-abiding people, the principle of protecting the majority, and the principle of protecting children. The principles have different priorities in different scenarios and can meet the complex changes in moral dilemmas. This study can alleviate the contradiction between utilitarianism and deontology, the conflict between public needs and individualized needs, and it can provide a code of conduct for ethical decision-making in future autonomous vehicles.

AB Automation with inherent artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly emerging in diverse applications, for instance, autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices. However, despite their growing use, there is still noticeable skepticism in society regarding these applications. Drawing an analogy from human social interaction, the concept of trust provides a valid foundation for describing the relationship between humans and automation. Accordingly, this paper explores how firms systematically foster trust regarding applied AI. Based on empirical analysis using nine case studies in the transportation and medical technology industries, our study illustrates the dichotomous constitution of trust in applied AI. Concretely, we emphasize the symbiosis of trust in the technology as well as in the innovating firm and its communication about the technology. In doing so, we provide tangible approaches to increase trust in the technology and illustrate the necessity of a democratic development process for applied AI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ID SAFETY ASSESSMENT; DRIVING SYSTEMS
AB Scenario-based test methods are employed to assess the safety and performance of autonomous vehicles. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is a common assessment method for determining the criticality of test scenarios. However, the AHP method is subjective and less reproducible when performed by different persons, as the elements of pairwise comparison values that are directly linked to the outcome must be assigned by the person involved. This paper proposes a novel AHP method that automatically generates pairwise comparison values by optimizing the correlation between performance metrics and risk of test scenarios by simulation. Performance metrics are defined as the minimum relative distances and corresponding relative velocities between vehicles, and the risk of the test scenario is determined by the pairwise comparison values of AHP. The novel AHP method was evaluated using a cut-in scenario. The results showed that the minimum relative distance and the risk determined by the novel AHP method achieved a better correlation coefficient of -0.96, which is better than the conventional AHP of -0.828 and Fuzzy AHP of -0.824. These results suggest that the criticality of the test scenarios determined by the novel AHP method can more accurately reflect real-world driving environments.
   A novel analytic hierarchy process method is proposed to calculate the criticality of test scenarios for autonomous vehicles. In the proposed method, the pairwise comparison values can be automatically generated by the performance metrics from the simulation instead of the person involved. The safety and performance of autonomous vehicles in various scenarios are evaluated using the proposed novel analytic hierarchy process method.image

AB The Center for Self-Organizing and Intelligent Systems (CSOIS) at Utah State University has been engaged in a project to develop a fully autonomous navigation and control system suitable for use on planetary exploration micro-robotic vehicles of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Rocky Rover class. The system employs the identical sensor-avionic system as the Rocky Rover and can be implemented by a software upload only. Navigation is by dead reckoning with steering decisions accomplished by a unique combination of fuzzy logic and decision tree behavioral technology. The rule base for the fuzzy-inference machine was developed by an expert operator trained to steer the vehicle from a so-called approximate, or fuzzy, map of the terrain around the vehicle. This map has proven valuable, in itself, for very low bandwidth telepresence robotic vehicle steering applications. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB There are significant advantages using the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for underwater search. Compared with a single AUV, multi-AUV offers greater efficiency and better stability in underwater search. At the same time, the theoretical and technical level of autonomous navigation and cooperative control of multi-AUV formation is the key to the implementation of the underwater search task. The following key factors are worth discussing in the application of multi-AUV in underwater search: task allocation, path planning, and formation control. The purpose of this paper is to grasp the application and development trend of multi-AUV formation in underwater search, so as to summarize the past, present, and future research and development trends of this investigation field in detail.

The number of controllers is increased to realize AUV motion decoupling. At the same time, in order to avoid the oversize of the algorithm, combined with the controlled content, a simplified Q-learning algorithm is constructed to realize the parameter adaptation of the LADRC controller. Finally, through the simulation experiment of the controller with fixed parameters and the controller based on the Q-learning algorithm, the rationality of the simplified algorithm, the effectiveness of parameter adaptation, and the unique advantages of the LADRC controller are verified.

AB Stability prediction of the securing system for autonomous trucks is an important prerequisite for achieving safety monitoring of large cargo transportation and improving logistics efficiency. Considering the side slide risk of large cargo and the inability to predict stability using the existing under-constrained friction securing model, this paper proposes a new vehicle-cargo securing model based on the 6-SPS parallel mechanism. By establishing an analytical 3-DOF model, the dynamics performance of the vehicle-cargo system is analyzed based on the response solution under sinusoidal excitations. To verify the correctness of the analytical model, a multi-body dynamics model of the whole vehicle-cargo system based on the three-dimensional geometric model and the 6-SPS parallel mechanism is established for simulation in ADAMS. According to road class, pavement roughness is modeled by a white noise power spectrum method as the excitation in the simulation. The results show that the dynamics response of the analytical model accords well with that of the simulation model, with relative errors of 8.34% and 0.036% in amplitude and frequency, respectively. The proposed method can provide theoretical support for accurate stability prediction and for achieving safety monitoring of large cargo transportation for autonomous trucks.

AB Under the connected vehicle environment, autonomous vehicles (AVs) could bring numerous advantages including: improving the traffic flow, enhancing safety and alleviating air pollution. However, optimally operating AVs at signalized multi-lane intersections is a challenging problem due to the complex interaction of vehicles between lanes. It is thus a desire to manage and control the dynamics of AVs at signalized multi-lane intersections. To this end, this paper puts forward a bi-level control framework to optimize the intersection throughput. In our proposed method, the upper level (i.e. the intersection controller) is used to optimize the lane usages of each approach and the AVs' positions. In contrast, the lower level (i.e. the vehicle controllers) receives information from the upper level to control the AVs to get the maximum speed. More specifically, in the upper level, we apply a novel Space Distribution Method (SDM) for the AVs to maximize the throughput (i.e. a number of AVs) of the (multi-lane) intersection where signal timings are predefined. The SDM is divided into three steps: i) platoon formulation; ii) lane-mode optimization; and iii) AVs' position distribution. To maximize the throughput, the intersection controller receives information about the states of the AVs (e.g. the trajectories), then optimizes the lane usages for each approach, the desired speed, and the gap of the AVs as well as the AV's position along the approach. After that, each AV which is allowed to cross the intersection will determine its own trajectory and travel with the scheduled time without crash. Numerical simulations are set up to show that the throughput increases significantly, even more than twice of the throughput obtained from other methods in some circumstances.

AB This paper designs a fault-tolerant controller for the path-following of independently actuated (IA) electric autonomous vehicles (AVs) with steer-by-wire (SBW) systems. Such a controller can handle the effect of steering motor fault and the bounded disturbances of the vehicle dynamic system. Firstly, we formulate the dynamic models of the vehicle, the tire, the SBW system, and the steering motor. Secondly, with the models, we identify the effectiveness coefficient of the steering motor and calculate the steering resistance torque. Both the two parameters are used to determine the potential maximum front-wheel angle. The effectiveness coefficient can determine when the control system switches to the fault-tolerant control (FTC) mode. For the FTC mode, we then introduce a tube-based model predictive control (MPC) framework to guarantee vehicle stability in steering processes and maintain the tracking performance. The disturbances of the vehicle dynamic system affect both the control input and the state. On one hand, the disturbances are formulated to be a tightened state constraint. On the other hand, together with the potential maximum front-wheel angle, the disturbances are formulated to be a tightened input constraint. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the designed fault-tolerant controller via Carsim-Simulink joint simulation and real-vehicle experiment.

ID GENERATION; CHALLENGE
AB This paper introduces a local planner which computes a set of commands, allowing an autonomous vehicle to follow a given trajectory. To do so, the platform relies on a localization system, a map and a cost map which represents the obstacles in the environment. The presented method computes a set of tentative trajectories, using a schema based on a Frenet frame obtained from the global planner. These trajectories are then scored using a linear combination of weighted cost functions. In the presented approach, new weights are introduced in order to satisfy the specificities of our autonomous platform, Verdino. A study on the influence of the defined weights in the final behavior of the vehicle is introduced. From these tests, several configurations have been chosen and ranked according to two different proposed behaviors. The method has been tested both in simulation and in real conditions.

AB In this paper, a novel impulsive networked scheme is investigated to solve the formation control problem of a multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) system. More specifically, instead of requiring continuous-time communication, in this scheme, information exchanges among the AUVs are conducted via impulse time sequences, which is more practical in the unreliable and narrow banded underwater acoustic communication environment. In particular, the proposed scheme has significant advantages in energy conservation and improved robustness and can be widely applied in many other types of multi-agent systems. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the desired formation of the multiple AUVs can be achieved under either fixed or switching communication topologies. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have gained considerable research interest in motion planning (MP) to control driving. Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning motivated through neural networks. This article provides the latest survey on theories and applications of DL, reinforcement learning (RL), and deep RL, and it summarizes different DL methods. In addition, we present the main issues in autonomous driving (AD) and analyze DL-based architectures for decision-making frameworks in MP tasks, such as lane assist, lane following, overtaking, collision avoidance, emergency braking, and MP. Furthermore, we introduce well-known publicly available datasets collected on public roads and simulators suitable for different AD purposes and discuss simulator environments, activation functions, and DL-based libraries for output control in AVs. Moreover, we discuss challenges in terms of hardware and software, safety, computational time and cost, balanced data, multitask learning, and technology issues. Finally, we present future directions for MP.

AB Model predictive control is widely used in the design of autonomous driving algorithms. However, its parameters are sensitive to dynamically varying driving conditions, making it difficult to be implemented into practice. As a result, this study presents a self-learning algorithm based on reinforcement learning to tune a model predictive controller. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is used to extract features of dynamic traffic scenes and adjust the weight coefficients of the model predictive controller. In this method, a risk threshold model is proposed to classify the risk level of the scenes based on the scene features, and aid in the design of the reinforcement learning reward function and ultimately improve the adaptability of the model predictive controller to real-world scenarios. The proposed algorithm is compared to a pure model predictive controller in car-following case. According to the results, the proposed method enables autonomous vehicles to adjust the priority of performance indices reasonably in different scenarios according to risk variations, showing a good scenario adaptability with safety guaranteed.

AB Path following control problem of autonomous vehicles is investigated, concerning both unmeasurable sliding effects and lateral disturbances which lead to some difficulties in designing autonomous control under complex environment. To deal with the sliding effects, sideslip angles are modeled and reconstructed by estimating the tire cornering stiffness, which plays important role in analyzing the sliding effects. To this end, a Luenberger-type observer is designed, which is able to identify the tire cornering stiffness adaptively even in presence of time-varying lateral disturbances. Furthermore, to guarantee high-precision guidance, a sliding mode controller is designed based on chained system theory, and this controller is shown to be robust to both the lateral disturbances and the inaccuracy of the sliding reconstruction. Simulations illustrate that the proposed methods can reconstruct the sliding angles and provide high-accuracy anti-sliding control even in presence of the time-varying lateral disturbances.

AB In this article I investigate a decentralized infrastructure meant to assist autonomous vehicles in making decisions. More akin to a call centre than a centralized control room, Nissan's 'Seamless Autonomous Mobility' (SAM) project imagines that remote 'mobility managers' will intervene in the decision-making of autonomous vehicles, with the assistance of live video streams and other sensor data. Different from other kinds of AI microwork in which human workers prepare, imitate, or verify AI, mobility managers are envisioned instead as 'interveners', meant to directly and actively intervene in the movements of 'autonomous' vehicles when unable to negotiate an obstacle. Firstly, through a comparison between SAM and a traffic management system in Los Angeles, I argue that the former 'normalizes' intervention, in which decision-making delays become ordinary, if not altogether desirable. Secondly, through an analysis of a video in which such normalized interventions are imagined, I consider how SAM offers a kind of speculative mundanity in which remote workers, enabled by a technological infrastructure, embody a novel logic that modifies the social settings of driving.

Using finite-time stability theory, a nonlinear disturbance observer is constructed to provide an estimation of unknown disturbances online. By employing nonlinear disturbance observer to compensate disturbances, a robust containment controller is constructed by combining backstepping technique and dynamic surface control technique. It is proved that the proposed containment control scheme can force all the followers to move into the convex hull spanned by the leaders and guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, four simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the containment controller and its robustness to external disturbances.

ID MOBILE ROBOT; SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB Autonomous transfer vehicles (ATVs) can be considered as one of the critical components of context-aware structured smart factories in Industry 4.0 era. Conventional mapping methods such as grid maps can provide information for navigation, but they are not enough for complex environments that require interactions. On the other hand, high-definition (HD) mapping, which is mainly used in traffic networks, includes more information about an environment to perform excellent autonomous behaviour. In order to increase the efficiency of ATVs in flexible factories, an up-to-date environmental map information is required to perform successful long-term autonomous navigation. Therefore, when there exists a change in the environment, a simultaneous update of HD-map is as important as the creation of it. In this study, we propose an HD-map update methodology for ATVs that operates in smart factories. To the best of our knowledge, HD mapping has not been applied in smart factories. The proposed method includes the object detection and localisation tool to detect objects visually and determines their positions in connection with the conventional maps of the environment. Experimental results of a simulated factory environment demonstrate that the ATV can properly update the HD-map when a predefined sign is removed from or a new sign is added to the environment.

AB The development of autonomous driving technology will lead to a transition period during which human-driven vehicles (HVs) will share the road with autonomous vehicles (AVs). Understanding the interactions between AVs and HVs is critical for traffic safety and efficiency. Previous studies have used traffic/numerical simulations and field experiments to investigate HVs' behavioral changes when following AVs. However, such approaches simplify the actual scenarios and may result in biased results. Therefore, the objective of this study is to realistically model HV-following-AV dynamics and their microscopic interactions, which are important for intelligent transportation applications. HV-following-AV and HV-following-HV events are extracted from the high-resolution (10Hz) Waymo Open Dataset. Statistical test results reveal significant differences in calibrated intelligent driver model (IDM) parameters between HV-following-AV and HV-following-HV. An inverse reinforcement learning model (Inverse soft-Q Learning) is proposed to retrieve HVs' reward functions in HV-following-AV events. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach -soft actor-critic (SAC) -is adopted to estimate the optimal policy for HVs when following AVs. The results show that, compared with other conventional and data-driven car-following models, the proposed model leads to significantly more accurate trajectory predictions. In addition, the recovered reward functions indicate that drivers' preferences when following AVs are different from those when following HVs.

AB The trajectory planning plays an important role in realizing the autonomous driving process. The trajectory that reflects the driving habits of human drivers and conforms with people's driving intuition enables a vehicle to operate smoother and more comfortable when passing through corners, which could improve the acceptability of autonomous vehicles in the market in the future. The research of this paper focuses on planning a human driving characterised trajectory along a road based on the test track that could reflect natural driving behaviour in corners considering the sense of natural and comfortable for the occupants. Firstly, the data collected of the test track are processed and the coordinate system transformation is completed, and the human tested trajectories in the test track is extracted and analysed. Then, the human driving characterised trajectory planning is completed based on optimal control in a lane section on the test track. The trajectory tracking control algorithm based on LQR is designed, and a CarSim/Simulink co-simulation platform is established to track the optimal trajectory generated in a lane and the lane centreline trajectory to verify the superiority of the planned trajectory. The results show that compared with the centreline trajectory, the human driving characterised trajectory planned enables the autonomous vehicle operates smoother and more comfortable, and reflects the characteristic of human drivers to a large extent.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robots capable of operating underwater without the need for human operators. Nonetheless, there is the essential requirement of remote operation capability in case of exceptional situations, such as the encounter of unforeseen obstacles or malfunctions. The corresponding robust controller design is a challenging task, especially due to limited communication bandwidth to the land based control system as well as the exposure to disturbances like water currents. The present study, therefore, proposes a Delta-Sigma-based 1-bit PID controller for such AUVs, which consumes less communication resources and is robust to various disturbances arising in the underwater environment. The proposed controller is designed using the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model of the nonlinear AUV systems. A comparative performance investigation of this controller is carried out with an output feedback controller as reference design, which is based on the same T-S fuzzy model. The stability conditions of both controllers are established. Obtained simulation results indicate that in case of extreme disturbances and limited bandwidth, the reference controller could not stabilise the AUV system. In contrast, the proposed Delta-Sigma-based 1-bit PID controller performed well under all conditions, while using less hardware and communication resources compared to the reference design.

AB In this study, the authors introduce a three-dimensional (3D) discrete-time motion camouflage (MC) control to make an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) chase a manoeuvring target while not rotating the bearing line between the AAV and the target. This study handles a scenario in which the AAV can measure the target's position using remote sensors (e.g. ground-based laser systems) only. Since there exists communication delay between the remote sensors and the AAV, time delay exists between the time instant when the target's position is measured and the time instant when the AAV applies controllers based on sensor measurements. Considering a scenario where the time delay is accessible, the authors develop a 3D MC control based on the time delay explicitly. They prove that as long as several assumptions are satisfied, the angular rate of bearing line is exactly zero at all sampling indexes while the distance between the target and the AAV monotonically decreases as time elapses. The effectiveness of the 3D discrete-time MC control is verified utilising extensive MATLAB simulations.

AB Object detection is an important aspect for autonomous driving vehicles (ADV), which may comprise of a machine learning model that detects a range of classes. As the deployment of ADV widens globally, the variety of objects to be detected may increase beyond the designated range of classes. Continual learning for object detection essentially ensure a robust adaptation of a model to detect additional classes on the fly. This study proposes a novel continual learning method for object detection that learns new object class(es) along with cumulative memory of classes from prior learning rounds to avoid any catastrophic forgetting. The results of PASCAL VOC 2007 have suggested that the proposed ER method obtains 4.3% of mAP drop compared against the all-classes learning, which is the lowest amongst other prior arts.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
AB This study analyzes the behavior of heterogeneous connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and proposes the best vehicle sequence for optimal platoon throughput and platoon formation. A spring-mass-damper (SMD) system is adopted for control of CAVs, and the control parameters are formulated in relation to the physical capabilities of vehicles. To gain insight, we consider three types of vehicle: passenger cars, mini-vans, and heavy-duty vehicles. For each type, we investigate the maximum platoon throughput and the clustering time, defined as the time to reach the target equilibrium state. We further investigate different sequences of vehicle types in a platoon to identify the optimal vehicle order that maximizes the throughput and minimizes clustering time. Findings suggest that the highest performance vehicle (in relation to acceleration capability) should be placed as the leader of a platoon and that the number of passenger cars behind heavy vehicles (e.g., semi-trailers) should be minimized in the platoon. In addition, we examine how the proportions of lower performance vehicles affect throughput and clustering times. The result suggests that the higher the proportions, the lower the throughput and the longer the clustering time. The lowest performance vehicle had the greatest effect.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are considered an emerging technology revolution. Planning paths that are safe to drive on contributes greatly to expediting AV adoption. However, the main barrier to this adoption is navigation under sensor uncertainty, with the understanding that there is no perfect sensing solution for all driving environments. In this paper, we propose a global safe path planner that analyzes sensor uncertainty and determines optimal paths. The path planner has two components: sensor analytics and path finder. The sensor analytics component combines the uncertainties of all sensors to evaluate the positioning and navigation performance of an AV at given locations and times. The path finder component then utilizes the acquired sensor performance and creates a weight based on safety for each road segment. The operation and quality of the proposed path finder are demonstrated through simulations. The simulation results reveal that the proposed safe path planner generates paths that significantly improve the navigation safety in complex dynamic environments when compared to the paths generated by conventional approaches.

TI Vasilius: The design of an autonomous ground robotic vehicle
SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents the design and provides a partial analysis of the performance of an autonomous ground robotic vehicle called Vasilius. Applications for Vasilius include autonomous navigation on a somewhat marked path with obstacles, leader following, and waypoint navigation. The paper focuses on three aspects of Vasilius: the design, the performance, and a technique for filtering, mapping, and learning. The design of Vasilius embodies a novel idea of modeling an autonomous vehicle after human senses and the human decision-making process. For instance, Vasilius integrates information from seven types of independent sensors, and categorizes them into either short-range reaction sensors and/or long-range planning sensors, analogous to what the human brain does. The paper also analyzes the performance of Vasilius, relating theoretical predictions to actual behavior. Some of these analyses, especially for the filtering, mapping, and learning, are still in progress. Performance measures that have been measured include speed, ramp climbing, turn reaction time, battery life, stop reaction time, object detection, and waypoint accuracy. Finally, the paper discusses Vasilius' use of a new approach to filtering, mapping, and learning to enhance its performance. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper presents a latent space reinforcement learning method for interpretable decision-making of autonomous vehicles at highway on-ramps. This method is based on the latent model and the combination model of the hidden Markov model and Gaussian mixture regression (HMM-GMR). It is difficult for the traditional decision-making method to understand the environment because its input is high-dimensional and lacks an understanding of the task. By utilizing the HMM-GMR model, we can obtain the interpretable state providing semantic information and environment understanding. A framework is proposed to unify representation learning with the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, in which the latent model is used to reduce the dimension of interpretable state by extracting underlying task-relevant information. Experimental results are presented and the results show the right balance between driving safety and efficiency in the challenging scenarios of highway on-ramps merging.

AB Despite their promise, there have been discussions surrounding the technological risks of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the extent to which AVs are ready for large-scale deployment. Using a case study approach, this article examines the development and implementation of AVs in Singapore. Our findings reveal that AV regulatory sandboxes, the formalisation of safety assessments and the release of technical guidelines are some of the most adaptive and innovative instruments that have been adopted to govern AVs in Singapore. Furthermore, Singapore?s approach to AVs has applied an adaptive strategy that is both pre-emptive and responsive. The accelerated expansion of trials and regulatory provisions for AVs demonstrates Singapore?s aspiration to be nimble, and showcases the simultaneous adoption of two contrasting implementation approaches ? prescriptive and experimentalist ? to guide AV adoption. The regulatory lessons derived from the governance of AVs in Singapore could provide useful policy guidance, and could inform policy discussions of AVs as well as other autonomous systems.

AB In platoon autonomous driving, a leader vehicle (LV) leads the entire platoon moving forward by instructing the follower vehicles (FVs) to drive cooperatively. To gather sufficient environmental data as the prior knowledge, the LV employs the FVs to perform the data collection tasks. Each FV determines the participation willingness and its effort level according to an incentive mechanism presented by the LV and decisions of the social partners in the same platoon. We develop a game theoretic approach to model the strategic interactions among the LV and FVs. After that, the equilibrium solution is derived based on the backward induction method and information collection of the FVs. We further propose a deep reinforcement learning approach to effectively seek the equilibrium solution without the complete information. In our scheme, we apply a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to train each game player as an agent with the continuous action space. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.

AB The purpose of this article is to implement an algorithm that allows an autonomous ground robot to intervene for the rapid identification of patients with symptoms of COVID-19 in the absence of the medical staff needed to sort patients in hospitals. Based on this autonomous mobile robot-type UGV, it is possible to quickly detect people who show signs of infection with COVID-19. In order to address these problems, investigative equipment (for 3D perception, mapping, navigation, thermal scanning, thermal imaging, detection of facial expressions and of the presence or absence of masks, etc.), as well as behavioral control work were considered on complex scenarios, initially generated online and then by introducing random obstacles. The obtained results showed that the use of mobile robots for special purposes is thus an excellent solution, both for reducing the exposure of medical personnel to the virus, and for increasing the capacity to identify, analyse and warn about the observance of the protection protocols against COVID-19.

AB This paper proposes a collaborative optimization strategy for speed planning and energy management of intelligent plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In this study, a single-axis parallel PHEV with the powertrain of P2 configuration is employed as the research object. Then, dynamic programming (DP) is leveraged to ensure optimal fuel economy with the consideration of the simultaneous optimal demand torque distribution and autonomous speed selection. An adjustment coefficient that reasonably constrains the feasible domain of vehicle speed is designed to limit the range of autonomous speed selection according to driving conditions. The reasonableness of speed selection is enhanced by adding penalty functions to inhibit gear shifting and speed fluctuations. To consider the variability of the control strategies based on the constraints of travel time and distance, a time-domain and a space-domain collaborative optimization model are established respectively, and a simulation analysis of the collaborative optimization energy management strategy is conducted. The simulation result shows that the strategy achieves the collaborative optimization of speed autonomous planning and reasonable allocation for demand torque. In addition, the proposed strategy demonstrates preferable energy economy under different constraints based on time and space domains.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on accurate and robust sensor observations for safety-critical decision making in a variety of conditions. The fundamental building blocks of such systems are sensors and classifiers that process ultrasound, radar, GPS, lidar, and camera signals [1]. It is of primary importance that the resulting decisions are robust to perturbations, which can take the form of different types of nuisances and data transformations and can even be adversarial perturbations (APs).

ID TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS; VEHICLES; MODELS
AB Road autonomous mobile robots have attracted the attention of delivery companies and policy makers owing to their potential to reduce costs and increase urban freight efficiency. Established delivery companies and new startups are investing in technologies that reduce delivery times, increase delivery drivers' productivity, or both. In this context, the adoption of road automatic (or autonomous) delivery robots (RADRs) has a growing appeal. Several RADRs are currently being tested in the United States. The key novel contributions of this research are: (a) an analysis of the characteristics and regulation of RADRs in the U.S. and (b) a study of the relative travel, time, and cost efficiencies that RADRs can bring about when compared to traditional van deliveries. The results show that RADRs can provide substantial cost savings in many scenarios, but in all cases at the expense of substantially higher vehicle miles per customer served. Unlike sidewalk autonomous delivery robots (SADRs), it is possible the RADRs will contribute significantly to additional vehicle miles per customer served.

   Augmentation for 3D Vehicle Detection

DT Article
DE Computer vision for transportation; intelligent transportation systems;
   object detection; segmentation and categorization
AB Camera-LiDAR fusion provides precise distance measurements and fine-grained textures, making it a promising option for 3D vehicle detection in autonomous driving scenarios. Previous camera-LiDAR based 3D vehicle detection approaches mainly focused on employing image-based pre-trained models to fetch semantic features. However, these methods may perform inferior to the LiDAR-based ones when lacking semantic segmentation labels in autonomous driving tasks. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel semantic augmentation method, namely Sem-Aug, to guide high-confidence camera-LiDAR fusion feature generation and boost the performance of multimodal 3D vehicle detection. The key novelty of semantic augmentation lies in the 2D segmentation mask auto-labeling, which provides supervision for semantic segmentation sub-network to mitigate the poor generalization performance of camera-LiDAR fusion. Using semantic-augmentation-guided camera-LiDAR fusion features, Sem-Aug achieves remarkable performance on the representative autonomous driving KITTI dataset compared to both the LiDAR-based baseline and previous multimodal 3D vehicle detectors. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Sem-Aug provides significant improvements in challenging Hard detection scenarios caused by occlusion and truncation.

AB To date, a large number of optimization algorithms have been presented for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) path planning. However, little effort has been devoted to compare these techniques. In this paper, an quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is introduced for solving the optimal path planning problem of an AUV operating in environments with ocean currents. An extensive study of the most important optimization techniques applied to optimize the trajectory for an AUV in several test scenarios is presented. Extensive Monte Carlo trials were also run to analyse the performance of these optimization techniques based on solution quality and stability. The weaknesses and strengths of each technique have been stated and the most appropriate algorithm for AUV path planning has been determined. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper applies a classical physics-based model to control platooning autonomous vehicles (AVs) in a commercial traffic simulation software. In the spring-mass-damper (SMD) model, each vehicle is assumed as a mass coupled with its preceding vehicle with a spring and a damper: the spring constant and damper coefficient control spacing and speed adoption between vehicles. Limitations on the platooning-oriented communication range and number of vehicles in each platoon are applied to the model to reflect real-world circumstances and avoid overlengthened platoons. The SMD model controls both intra-platoon and inter-platoon interactions. Initial evaluation of the model reveals that it does not cause a negative spacing error between AVs in a harsh deceleration scenario, guaranteeing safety. Besides that, the SMD model produces a smaller positive average spacing error than the VISSIM built-in platooning module, which prevents maximum throughput drop. The simulation result for a regular highway section reveals that the proposed platooning algorithm increases the maximum throughput by 10%, 29%, and 63% under 10%, 50%, and full market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs, respectively, with a 0.5 s response time. A merging section with different volume combinations on the main section and merging section and different MPRs of AVs is also modeled to test inter-platoon spacing policy effectiveness in accommodating merging vehicles. Travel time reductions of 20% and 4% are gained under a low MPR of AVs on the main lane and merging lane, respectively. Meanwhile, a more noticeable travel time reduction is observed in both main lane and merging lanes and under all volume combinations in higher AV MPRs.

ID PID CONTROLLER; MOBILE ROBOTS
AB This article proposes an adaptable path tracking control system, based on reinforcement learning (RL), for autonomous cars. A four-parameter controller shapes the behaviour of the vehicle to navigate lane changes and roundabouts. The tuning of the tracker uses an 'educated' Q-Learning algorithm to minimize the lateral and steering trajectory errors, this being a key contribution of this article. The CARLA (CAR Learning to Act) simulator was used both for training and testing. The results show the vehicle is able to adapt its behaviour to the different types of reference trajectories, navigating safely with low tracking errors. The use of a robot operating system (ROS) bridge between CARLA and the tracker (i) results in a realistic system, and (ii) simplifies the replacement of CARLA by a real vehicle, as in a hardware-in-the-loop system. Another contribution of this article is the framework for the dependability of the overall architecture based on stability results of non-smooth systems, presented at the end of this article.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB This article investigates a novel fault identification approach to determine the percentage of the thrust loss for autonomous underwater vehicle thrusters. The novel approach is developed from a combination of the peak region energy (PRE) and support vector data description (SVDD) by considering that PRE is able to acquire a primary feature in low dimensions from signals without any secondary process and that SVDD can establish a hypersphere boundary for a class of fault samples even in the case of a small number of training samples. Three improvements, namely removing the fusion, an energy leakage and a homomorphic transform are applied to the PRE. It forms an improved PRE to increase the area under the curve. Furthermore, another three new contents, namely the least square, a multiple model fusion and a dead zone are added to the SVDD. It constructs a multiple model least square SVDD to increase the overall identification accuracy. Experiments are performed on an experimental prototype autonomous underwater vehicle in a pool. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything) is a state-of-the-art wireless technology used in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This technology has extended the coverage and blind-spot detection of autonomous driving vehicles. Economically, C-V2X is much more cost-effective than the traditional sensors that are commonly used by autonomous driving vehicles. This cost-benefit makes it more practical in a large scale deployment. PC5-based C-V2X uses an RF (Radio Frequency) sidelink direct communication for low latency mission-critical vehicle sensor connectivity. Over the C-V2X radio communications, the autonomous driving vehicle's sensor ability can now be largely enhanced to the distances as far as the network covers. In 2020, 5G is commercialized worldwide, and Taiwan is at the forefront. Operators and governments are keen to see its implications in people's daily life brought by its low latency, high reliability, and high throughput. Autonomous driving class L3 (Conditional Automation) or L4 (Highly Automation) are good examples of 5G's advanced applications. In these applications, the mobile networks with URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication) are perfectly demonstrated. Therefore, C-V2X evolution and 5G NR (New Radio) deployment coincide and form a new ecosystem. This ecosystem will change how people will drive and how transportation will be managed in the future. In this paper, the following topics are covered. Firstly, the benefits of C-V2X communication technology. Secondly, the standards of C-V2X and C-V2X applications for automotive road safety system which includes V2P/V2I/V2V/V2N, and artificial intelligence in VRU (Vulnerable Road User) detection, object recognition and movement prediction for collision warning and prevention. Thirdly, PC5-based C-V2X deployment status in global, especially in Taiwan. Lastly, current challenges and conclusions of C-V2X development.

AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) require autonomous software with a high level of liberalization and automation to complete various missions. Therefore, experimental verification and validation of this software at the initial design stage are essential. However, such experiments are impossible before the actual hardware is developed, and the creation of an external environment for the mission requires substantial cost and time. In this study, virtual prototypes of the mission environment and hardware for the USV are developed. Then, a simulation environment for testing the control algorithms in the autonomous software is constructed. Data communication with the USV hardware is necessary for the autonomous software to acquire information from the sensors and to operate the actuators. Similarly, data communication between the programs of the virtual prototypes and the autonomous software is required for the integrated simulation environment. In this study, the robot operating system (ROS) software platform is adopted to construct the interface for this data communication. Finally, the integrated simulation environment of the control algorithms and the virtual prototypes are constructed based on ROS to verify the autonomous software of the USV. The applicability of the suggested simulation environment is evaluated by application to three scenarios: mine detection, path following, and port entry.

AB This paper presents the lateral control of an autonomous vehicle by using a look-ahead sensing system. In look-ahead sensing by an absolute positioning system, a reference lane, constructed by straight lanes or circular lanes, was switched by a segment switching algorithm. To cope with sensor noise and modeling uncertainty, a robust LMI-based H-infinity lateral controller was designed by the feedback of lateral offset and yaw angle error at the vehicle look-ahead. In order to verify the safety and the performance of lateral control, a scaled-down vehicle was developed and the location of the vehicle was detected by using an ultrasonic local positioning system. In the mechatronic scaled-down vehicle, the lateral model and parameters are verified and estimated by a J-turn test. For the lane change and reference lane tracking, the lateral controllers are used experimentally. The experimental results show that the H-infinity controller is robust and has better performance compared with look-down sensing.

DT Article
DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); external disturbance; finite-time
   convergence; uncertain dynamics
AB Most studies so far on trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) have assumed that the Euler angles are exactly known. However, the AUV inevitably suffers from external environmental disturbances which are driven by wind, density, and temperature gradients. The attitude transducers cannot derive accurate attitude information of the AUV. Additionally, the uncertain hydrodynamic parameters affect the stability of the system. Consequently, it is unknown whether tracking performance of the AUV can be guaranteed. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, a finite-time controller is developed by using the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control technique. A robust differentiator is proposed to estimate the external disturbances and uncertain parts. Simulations are performed to show that with the proposed control laws, the AUV converges to the desired trajectory even in the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainty.

AB This paper presents an improved active disturbances rejecter control (ADRC) for path following control of autonomous underwater vehicles under significant fast-varying disturbances caused by waves and sea currents. Two significant and efficient improvements are introduced to the traditional ADRC in order to accomplish this task. First, a generalized ESO (GESO) and Harmonic ESO (HESO) were designed to achieve a high disturbances estimation quality. Secondly, two AUV path following controllers based on ADRC-GESO and ADRC-HESO were designed to ensure a high performance tracking in presence of periodic-type disturbances. Finally, numerical simulations were performed and the obtained results showed very significant enhancements of robustness and tracking accuracy by the proposed methods compared to conventional ADRC.

AB This paper investigates the trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle in the present of output constraints and environmental disturbances. The designed controller can ensure that the output errors will never violate constraint limitations and solve the singularity problem in the design process by employing Barrier Lyapunov function. Backstepping algorithm, combined with radial basis function neural network for solving external disturbances and the Dynamic Surface Control technique for handling the calculation of explosion problem, is introduced to design the control laws. Then, a stability analysis based on Lyapunov directly method proves that all signals are bounded and tracking errors converge to a neighborhood of the origin. At last, simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed controller.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely used in diverse contexts, especially military affairs. The smooth operation of the AUV requires accurate localization of surrounding objects, especially the aerial objects. In this letter, a novel and practical method is presented for aerial object localization by using gravity and gravity gradient anomaly. Different from the state-of-the-art methods, such as GPS, radar, and laser, the proposed method runs in a passive manner and achieves AUV invisibility without energy emission. Compared with the object localization methods based on gravity and gravity gradient inversion, the proposed method is more practical as no large area gravity and gravity gradient measurements are needed to estimate the object mass. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods.

AB This paper presents a novel autonomous inspection framework for low-cost nano aerial vehicles (NAVs) in indoor assessment scenarios. First, a novel autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance scheme has been developed for effective navigation and image data collection. Second, the collected images have been live-streamed and processed by the real-time vision-based geotagging method and damage detection algorithms to localize damaged structural components. The proposed pipeline has been implemented on reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Parameter studies have been conducted on the influence of navigation formulation, take-off locations, and variation of floor plans. The results show that the proposed navigation algorithm is robust against the take-off location and it can achieve high coverage in all investigated floor plans. The results also demonstrate that the geotagging method and damage detection algorithms can achieve high localization accuracy for structural components, concrete spalling, and steel reinforcement exposure.

ID JUDGMENT; ETHICS; CAUSAL; MIND
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to soon replace human drivers and promise substantial benefits to society. Yet, consumers remain skeptical about handing over control to an AV. Partly because there is uncertainty about the appropriate moral norms for such vehicles (e.g., should AVs protect the passenger or the pedestrian if harm is unavoidable?). Building on recent work on AV morality, the current research examined how people resolve the dilemma between protecting self versus a pedestrian, and what they expect an AV to do in a similar situation. Five studies revealed that participants considered harm to a pedestrian more permissible with an AV as compared to self as the decision agent in a regular car. This shift in moral judgments was driven by the attribution of responsibility to the AV and was observed for both severe and moderate harm, and when harm was real or imagined. However, the effect was attenuated when five pedestrians or a child could be harmed. These findings suggest that AVs can change prevailing moral norms and promote an increased self-interest among consumers. This has relevance for the design and policy issues related to AVs. It also highlights the moral implications of autonomous agents replacing human decision-makers.

AB We present a challenging new dataset for autonomous driving: the Oxford RobotCar Dataset. Over the period of May 2014 to December 2015 we traversed a route through central Oxford twice a week on average using the Oxford RobotCar platform, an autonomous Nissan LEAF. This resulted in over 1000 km of recorded driving with almost 20 million images collected from 6 cameras mounted to the vehicle, along with LIDAR, GPS and INS ground truth. Data was collected in all weather conditions, including heavy rain, night, direct sunlight and snow. Road and building works over the period of a year significantly changed sections of the route from the beginning to the end of data collection. By frequently traversing the same route over the period of a year we enable research investigating long-term localization and mapping for autonomous vehicles in real-world, dynamic urban environments.

AB Sixth-generation (6G)-based communications have many applications and are emerging as a new system to utilize existing vehicles and communication devices in autonomous vehicles (AVs). Electric vehicles and AVs not supporting the integration of intelligent cybersecurity will become vulnerable, and their internal functions, features, and devices providing services will be damaged. This paper presents an intelligent cybersecurity model integrating intelligent features according to the emerging 6G-based technology based on evolving cyberattacks. The model's novel design was developed using the necessary algorithms to provide quick and proactive decisions with intelligent cybersecurity based on 6G (IC6G) policies when AVs face cyberattacks. In this model, network security algorithms incorporating intelligent techniques are developed using applied cryptography. Money transaction handling services implemented in an AV are considered an example to determine the security and intelligence level depending on the IC6G policies. Intelligence, complexity, and energy efficiency (EE) are assessed. Finally, we conclude that the model results are effective for intelligently detecting and preventing cyberattacks on AVs.

AB A receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) framework for ground vehicle navigation using ambient cellular signals of opportunity (SOPs) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is developed. The proposed framework accounts for two types of errors that compromise the integrity of the navigation solution: (i) multipath and (ii) unmodeled biases in the cellular pseudorange measurements due to line-of-sight (LOS) signal blockage and high signal attenuation. This paper, first, characterizes the multipath in a cellular-based navigation framework. Next, a fault detection and exclusion technique for a cellular-based navigation framework is developed. Simulation and experimental results with real long-term evolution (LTE) signals are presented evaluating the efficacy of the proposed RAIM-based fault detection and exclusion technique on a ground vehicle navigating in a deep urban environment in the absence of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. The experimental results on a ground vehicle traversing 825 m in an urban environment show that the proposed RAIM-based measurement exclusion technique reduces the position root mean-squared error (RMSE) by 66%.

DE Autonomous land vehicle; lateral control; dual heuristic programming;

ID ONLINE LEARNING CONTROL; POLICY ITERATION
AB In this paper, to improve the lateral control performance of autonomous land vehicles (ALVs) under different longitudinal velocities, a novel learning-based lateral control method based on the dual heuristic programming (DHP) algorithm is presented. A new way to calculate the lateral control errors based on the geometric relationship between the vehicle and the path is utilized. To minimize the lateral control errors of ALV, the lateral control problem is modelled as a Markov decision problem (MDP). To approximate the optimal control policy of the MDP, a learning controller based on the DHP algorithm is designed, where the critic is used to approximate the derivative of the value function and the actor is utilized to improve the control policy based on the output of the critic. The inputs of the critic and actor are comprised of the lateral control error and the vehicle's longitudinal velocity, which makes the proposed method be effectively adaptive to different longitudinal velocities. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed lateral control scheme has advantages over widely used lateral control methods, such as the pure pursuit, PD control and Stanley methods.

   simulation; modeling and simulation
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have many scientific, military, and commercial applications because of their potential capabilities and significant cost-performance improvements over traditional means for performing search and survey. The development of a reliable sampling platform requires a thorough system design and many costly at-sea trials during which systems specifications can be validated. Modeling and simulation provides a cost-effective measure to carry out preliminary component, system (hardware and software), and mission testing and verification, thereby reducing the number of potential failures in at-sea trials. An accurate simulation can help engineers to find hidden errors in the AUV embedded software and gain insights into the AUV operations and dynamics. This paper reviews our research work on real-time physics-based modeling and simulation for our AUVs. The modeling component includes vehicle dynamics, environment and sensor characteristics. The simulation component consists of stand-alone versus hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) implementation, for both single as well as multiple vehicles. In particular, implementation issues with regard to multitasking system resources will be addressed. The main contribution of this paper is to present the rationale for our simulation architecture and the lessons learned.

AB This paper presents an autonomous unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) tracking system based on an improved long and short-term memory (LSTM) Kalman filter (KF) model. The system can estimate the three-dimensional (3D) attitude and precisely track the target object without manual intervention. Specifically, the YOLOX algorithm is employed to track and recognize the target object, which is then combined with the improved KF model for precise tracking and recognition. In the LSTM-KF model, three different LSTM networks (f, Q, and R) are adopted to model a nonlinear transfer function to enable the model to learn rich and dynamic Kalman components from the data. The experimental results disclose that the improved LSTM-KF model exhibits higher recognition accuracy than the standard LSTM and the independent KF model. It verifies the robustness, effectiveness, and reliability of the autonomous UAV tracking system based on the improved LSTM-KF model in object recognition and tracking and 3D attitude estimation.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are commonly used to conduct complex underwater tasks, such as marine infrastructure overhaul and maintenance, environmental monitoring, oceanographic mapping, and organism capture. These tasks require the ability of an AUV to perform autonomous navigation, especially when communication is limited in the underwater environment. This brief developed a new type of lightweight intervention AUV for autonomous navigation using data from multiple inertial sensors, where multi-sensor error state Kalman filter schemes are preferable to standard Kalman Filters in terms of the AUV's motion estimates. Concerning target recognition, a color restoration method is provided for degraded underwater images and a You Only Look Once strategy is combined with topological analysis for object detection. In addition, the proposed design is robust in terms of its software components and mechanical structure, which provides a feasible platform for AUV's secondary development. Experiments of surveying and object manipulation conducted in underwater environments demonstrate the functionality of the entire system and its potential applications in the fields of science and industry.

AB Humans and animals have learned or evolved to use magnetic fields for navigation. Knowing how to model and estimate these fields can be used for motion planning. However, computing the propagation of electromagnetic fields in a given environment requires solving complex differential equations with advanced numerical methods, and therefore it is not suitable for real-time decision making. In this latter, we present a real-time approximator for Maxwell's equations based on deep neural networks that predicts the distribution of a virtual magnetic field. We show how our approximator can be used to perform autonomous 2D navigation tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art navigation algorithms, ensuring completeness, and providing a near-optimal path up to 200 times per second without any post processing stage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with physics-based simulations of an unmanned aerial vehicle, an autonomous car, as well as real-world experiments using a small off-road autonomous racing vehicle. Furthermore, we show how the approach can be applied to multi-robot systems, video game technology, and can be extended to 3D problems.

AB Autonomous driving is a safety critical application of sensing and decision-making technologies. Communication technologies extend the awareness capabilities of vehicles, beyond what is achievable with the on-board systems only. Nonetheless, issues typically related to wireless networking must be taken into account when designing safe and reliable autonomous systems. The aim of this work is to present a control algorithm and a communication paradigm over 5G networks for negotiating traffic junctions in urban areas. The proposed control framework has been shown to converge in a finite time and the supporting communication software has been designed with the objective of minimizing communication delays. At the same time, the underlying network guarantees reliability of the communication. The proposed framework has been successfully deployed and tested, in partnership with Ericsson AB, at the AstaZero proving ground in Goteborg, Sweden. In our experiments, three heterogeneous autonomous vehicles successfully drove through a 4-way intersection of 235 square meters in an urban scenario.
