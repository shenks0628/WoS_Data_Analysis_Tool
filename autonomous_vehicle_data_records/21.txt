AB Optimal path planning is required in autonomous navigation and intelligent control of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, as a kind of common obstacles in complex three-dimensional (3-D) spaces, U-type obstacles may cause UAV to be confused and even lead to a collision or out of control. Although most of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm can generate proper path, solutions to U-type obstacles based on the specific behaviors of each ant are investigated rarely. Hence, different search strategies are studied and a novel ACO-based method called Self-Heuristic Ant (SHA) is proposed in this paper. The whole space is constructed by grid workspace model firstly, and then a new optimal function for UAV path planning is built. To avoid ACO deadlock state (i.e., ants are trapped in U-type obstacles when there is no optional successor node), two different search strategies are designed for choosing the next path node. In addition, the SHA is utilized to improve the ability of the basic ACO-based method. Specifically, besides pheromone update, a new information communion mechanism is fused to deal with the special areas which contain dense obstacles or many concave blocks. Finally, several experiments are investigated deeply. The results show that the deadlock state can be reduced effectively by the designed two different search strategies of ants. More importantly, compared with the conventional fallback strategy, the average number of retreats and the average running time of ACO can be reduced when SHA is applied.

AB This paper is the first dealing with animal-vehicle collisions (AVC) with red and roe deer in South Tyrol, Northern Italy. The Autonomous Province of Bolzano (South Tyrol) has been collecting AVC data since 2012 on the entire provincial road network. Each year, AVC data accounted for more than 700 cases per year, with several socioeconomic and ecological implications. The aim of this research is to identify the locations where AVC occur more frequently than expected (hotspots) and better outline subsequent implementation of mitigation measures. For an effective identification of AVC hotspots, we applied a combined methodology of temporal and spatial analysis on AVC data collected on the South Tyrol road network in the years 2012-2014. AVC data enabled the identification of the temporal patterns, which showed different behaviors of the two target species in close proximity of the road network and throughout the 12months. The KDE+ software applied to the 2012-2014 AVC database allowed for spatial analysis and the identification of hotspots, i.e., the road sections having the highest risk for drivers. The integration of the results, coming from the abovementioned methodologies, contributes to a detailed assessment of roads that would allow the identification of the local contributing factors and a base-line of potential problematic areas that will highlight the need for further investigation to assess whether the risk-rank is accurate and allocate effectively limited resources to a feasible number of identified hotspots and reduce the current degree of AVC in the South Tyrolean road network.

TI Trajectory prediction for autonomous driving based on multiscale
   spatial-temporal graph
SO IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Predicting the trajectories of surrounding heterogeneous traffic agents is critical for the decision making of an autonomous vehicle. Recently, many existing prediction methods have focused on capturing interactions between agents to improve prediction accuracy. However, few methods pay attention to the temporal dependencies of interactions that there are different behavioural interactions at different time scales. In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for trajectory prediction by stacking spatial-temporal layers at multiple time scales. Firstly, the authors design three kinds of adjacency matrices to capture more genuine spatial dependencies rather than a fixed adjacency matrix. Then, a novel dilated temporal convolution is developed to handle temporal dependencies. Benefiting from the dilated temporal convolution, the authors' graph convolution is able to aggregate information from neighbours at different time scales by stacking spatial-temporal layers. Finally, a long short-term memory networks (LSTM)-based trajectory generation module is used to receive the features extracted by the spatial-temporal graph and generate the future trajectories for all observed traffic agents simultaneously. The authors evaluate the proposed model on the publicly available next generation simulation dataset (NGSIM), the highway drone dataset (highD), and ApolloScape datasets. The results demonstrate that the authors' approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the proposed method ranked #1 on the leaderboard of the ApolloScape trajectory competition in March 2021.

AB Various sensors are embedded in automobiles to implement intelligent safety technologies such as autonomous driving and front-rear collision avoidance technology. In particular, ultrasonic sensors have been used in the past because they have an accuracy of centimeters to sub-centimeters in air despite their low cost and low hardware complexity. Recently, the crosstalk problem between ultrasonic sensors has been raised because the number of ultrasonic sensors in the unit space has increased as the number of vehicles increases. Various studies have been conducted to solve the crosstalk, but a demodulation error occurs when signals overlap. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method that is robust to ultrasonic signal overlap, is robust even at shorter code length, and has reduced time of flight (TOF) error compared to the existing method by applying frequency sweep keying modulation based on code division multiple access (CDMA). As a result of the experiment, the code was detected accurately regardless of the overlap ratio of the two signals, and it was robust even in situations where the power of the two signals was different. In addition, it shows an accurate TOF estimation even if the ID code length is shorter than the existing on-off-keying, frequency shift keying, and phase shift keying methods.

AB Real-time path planning is crucial for intelligent vehicles to achieve autonomous navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) based method for real-time online path planning in unknown cluttered environments. Firstly, an end-to-end DNN architecture named online three-dimensional path planning network (OTDPP-Net) is designed to learn 3D local path planning policies. It determines actions in 3D space based on multiple value iteration computations approximated by recurrent 2D convolutional neural networks. Moreover, a path planning framework is also developed to realize near-optimal real-time online path planning. The effectiveness of the proposed planner is further improved by a switching scheme, and the path quality is optimized by line-of-sight checks. Both virtual and real-world experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed DNN-based path planner in terms of efficiency, success rate and path quality. Different from existing methods, the computational time and effectiveness of the developed DNN-based path planner are both independent of environmental conditions, which reveals its superiority in large-scale complex environments.

AB This study presents a novel octree-based three-dimensional (3D) exploration and coverage method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Robotic exploration can be defined as the task of obtaining a full map of an unknown environment with a robotic system, achieving full coverage of the area of interest with data from a particular sensor or set of sensors. While most robotic exploration algorithms consider only occupancy data, typically acquired by a range sensor, our approach also takes into account optical coverage, so the environment is discovered with occupancy and optical data of all discovered surfaces in a single exploration mission. In the context of underwater robotics, this capability is of particular interest, since it allows one to obtain better data while reducing operational costs and time. This study expands our previous study in 3D underwater exploration, which was demonstrated through simulation, presenting improvements in the view planning (VP) algorithm and field validation. Our proposal combines VP with frontier-based (FB) methods, and remains light on computations even for 3D environments thanks to the use of the octree data structure. Finally, this study also presents extensive field evaluation and validation using the Girona 500 AUV. In this regard, the algorithm has been tested in different scenarios, such as a harbor structure, a breakwater structure, and an underwater boulder.

AB Underwater Robots such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) has played an important role in many tasks, such as marine environmental monitoring, underwater resource exploration, oil and gas industries, hydrographic surveys, military missions, etc. Underwater robotic swarm is a team of cooperative underwater robots which focuses on controlling multiple underwater robots to work in an organic group. In contrast to a single underwater robot, underwater robotic swarm represents higher operation efficiency and better stability while executing complex tasks. However, it needs higher intelligence to realize complementary cooperation than a single robot. It is beneficial to researchers to present a comprehensive survey of the state of the art of cooperative research for underwater robotic swarm. We observe that the research of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for multiple underwater robots is still in an early stage. In this paper, we study different collaborative operation mode in detail, such as formation control, task allocation, path planning, obstacle avoidance, flocking control etc. We propose different classification frameworks for these research topics and it also can be used to compare different methods and help engineers choose suitable methods for various applications. To achieve better cooperative performance of underwater robots, there are several key factors, including multi-source heterogeneous sensing, cooperative communication and navigation, information fusion and decision. Moreover, cooperative AI for underwater robotic swarm has different kinds of interesting and helpful applications. Finally, several possible applied AI methods including meta-heuristic algorithms, deep learning method and distributed learning method are accomplishing to cooperation of underwater robotic swarm.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB A well-planned robot dispatching platform reduces costs and increases efficiency for companies while also reducing carbon emissions and achieving sustainable development. At the moment, the solution to the difficulty of warehouse logistics is use of multiple distribution centers with autonomous mobile robots (AMR). To solve this problem, this paper establishes a semi-closed model of multiple distribution centers, considering the number of cycles and the number of vehicles. An improved ant colony algorithm is proposed to improve the heuristic function based on the node distance relationship to improve the quality of path search. Dynamic variable pheromone concentration and volatility factors are set to accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm while effectively reducing the problem of the premature algorithm. The traditional ant colony algorithm and the improved ant colony algorithm are used to solve the established model. In addition, the results show that the traditional ant colony algorithm has a certain rate of dominance in the single-day cost of the closed distribution model, but the overall comprehensive cost is lower than that of the improved ant colony algorithm. The single-day cost of the semi-open multi-distribution center logistics and distribution model is lower than that of the closed multi-distribution center logistics and distribution model, and the 7 day average cost is reduced by 12%. The improved ant colony algorithm can save about 119 kWh of electricity under the same target volume requirement, which achieves the company's goals of cost reduction and increased efficiency, as well as green and sustainable development.

AB With the advent of 5G communication networks, many novel areas of research have emerged and the spectrum of communicating objects has been diversified. Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Software Defined Networking (SDN), are the two broader areas that are tremendously being explored to optimize the network performance parameters. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is one such example of where end-to-end communication is developed with the aid of intervening network slices. Adoption of these technologies enables a shift towards Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) across various domains including autonomous vehicles that demand a hundred percent Quality of Service (QoS) and extremely low latency rates. Due to the limitation of resources to ensure such communication requirements, telecom operators are profoundly researching software solutions for network resource allocation optimally. The concept of Network Slicing (NS) emerged from such end-to-end network resource allocation where connecting devices are routed toward the suitable resources to meet their requirements. Nevertheless, the bias, in terms of finding the best slice, observed in the network slices renders a non-optimal distribution of resources. To cater to such issues, a Deep Learning approach has been developed in this paper. The incoming traffic has been allocated network slices based on data-driven decisions as well as predictive network analysis for the future. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) time series prediction approach has been adopted that renders optimal resource utilization, lower latency rates, and high reliability across the network. The model will further ensure packet prioritization and will retain resource margin for crucial ones.

AB The classic propagation model of received signal strength (RSS) measurement is significantly affected by the environment. This article divides the error sources of RSS ranging into three parts and deals with them in different methods. First, considering the influence of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) pose on RSS, the compensation model is established through Gaussian process regression (GPR) for the first time by mapping the quaternion of the UAV and the attenuation caused by the influence of anisotropy on the antenna in the corresponding special orthogonal group SO(3). On this basis, the distribution of random compensation variables is derived by unscented transformation (UT) and covariance propagation. Besides, a polynomial function is employed for fitting the distance-dependent environment noise. Then, to deal with the RSS measurement instability caused by the environment noise and the uncertainty of compensation, the adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) is introduced. Finally, an UWB-based environmental adaptive algorithm (UEAA) is proposed to improve ranging precision by using the UWB device in a dynamic environment. By setting the threshold parameter, the UEAA enables the classic RSS ranging model to have a certain adaptive ability for the dynamic environment of UAV, which significantly reduces the error caused by model parameter mismatch. Several experiments are carried out on the UAV platform, and the results show that the improvement of the RSS propagation model is adequate.

AB A reliable self-contained navigation system is essential for autonomous vehicles. Based on our previous study on Wheel-INS niu2019, a wheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning (DR) system, in this paper, we propose a multiple IMUs-based DR solution for the wheeled robots. The IMUs are mounted at different places on the wheeled vehicles to acquire various dynamic information. In particular, at least one IMU has to be mounted at the wheel to measure the wheel velocity and take advantage of the rotation modulation. The system is implemented through a distributed extended Kalman filter structure where each subsystem (corresponding to each IMU) retains and updates its own states separately. The relative position constraints between the multiple IMUs are exploited to further limit the error drift and improve the system's robustness. Particularly, we present the DR systems using dual Wheel-IMUs, one Wheel-IMU plus one vehicle body-mounted IMU (Body-IMU), and dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU as examples for analysis and comparison. Field tests illustrate that the proposed multi-IMU DR system outperforms the single Wheel-INS in terms of both positioning and heading accuracy. By comparing with the centralized filter, the proposed distributed filter shows unimportant accuracy degradation while holding significant computation efficiency. Moreover, among the three multi-IMU configurations, the one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU design obtains the minimum drift rate. The position drift rates of the three configurations are 0.82% (dual Wheel-IMUs), 0.69% (one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU), and 0.73% (dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU), respectively.

AB The area coverage problem is the task of efficiently servicing a given two-dimensional surface using sensors mounted on robots such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). We present a novel formulation for generating coverage routes for multiple capacity-constrained robots, where capacity can be specified in terms of battery life or flight time. Traversing the environment incurs demands on the robot resources, which have capacity limits. The central aspect of our approach is transforming the area coverage problem into a line coverage problem (i.e., coverage of linear features), and then generating routes that minimize the total cost of travel while respecting the capacity constraints. We define two modes of travel: (1) servicing and (2) deadheading, which correspond to whether a robot is performing task-specific actions or not. Our formulation allows separate and asymmetric travel costs and demands for the two modes. Furthermore, the cells computed from cell decomposition, aimed at minimizing the number of turns, are not required to be monotone polygons. We develop new procedures for cell decomposition and generation of service tracks that can handle non-monotone polygons with or without holes. We establish the efficacy of our algorithm on a ground robot dataset with 25 indoor environments and an aerial robot dataset with 300 outdoor environments. The algorithm generates solutions whose costs are 10% lower on average than state-of-the-art methods. We additionally demonstrate our algorithm in experiments with UAVs.

AB The interference between software components is increasing in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous driving. Low-criticality (LC) tasks, such as vehicle communication, may control high-criticality (HC) tasks, such as acceleration. In such cases, the LC task should also be considered as an HC task because the HC tasks relies on the LC task. However, the difficulty in guaranteeing these LC tasks is the catastrophic cost of computing resources, the electronic control unit in the domain of vehicles, required for every task. In this paper, we theoretically and practically provide safety-guaranteed and inexpensive scheduling for LC tasks by borrowing the computational power of neighbored systems in distributed systems, obviating the need for additional hardware components. As a result, our approach extended the schedulability of LC tasks without violating the HC tasks. Based on the deadline test, the compatibility of our approach with the task-level MC scheduler was higher than that of the system-level MC scheduler, such that the task-level had all dropped LC tasks recovered while the system-level only had 25.5% recovery. Conversely, from the worst-case measurement of violated HC tasks, the HC tasks were violated by the task-level MC scheduler more often than by the system-level MC scheduler, with 70.3% and 15.4% average response time overhead, respectively. In conclusion, under the condition that the HC task ratio has lower than 47% of the overall task systems at 80% of total utilization, the task-level approach with task migration has extensively higher sustainability on LC tasks.

AB The demand for accurate and fast trajectory tracking for multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have grown recently due to advances in UAV avionics technology and application domains. In many applications, the multirotor UAV is required to accurately perform aggressive maneuvers in challenging scenarios like the presence of external wind disturbances or in-flight payload changes. In this paper, we propose a systematic controller tuning approach based on identification results obtained by a recently developed Deep Neural Networks with the Modified Relay Feedback Test (DNN-MRFT) algorithm. We formulate a linear equivalent representation suitable for DNN-MRFT using feedback linearization. This representation enables the analytical investigation of different controller structures and tuning settings, and captures the non-linearity trends of the system. With this approach, the trade-off between performance and robustness in design was made possible which is convenient for the design of controllers of UAVs operating in uncertain environments. We demonstrate that our approach is adaptive and robust through a set of experiments, where accurate trajectory tracking is maintained despite significant changes to the UAV aerodynamic characteristics and the application of wind disturbance. Due to the model-based system design, it was possible to obtain low discrepancy between simulation and experimental results which is beneficial for potential use of the proposed approach for real-time model-based planning and fault detection tasks. We obtained RMSE of 3.59 cm when tracking aggressive trajectories in the presence of strong wind, which is on par with state-of-the-art.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation rendezvous path planning problem is one of the important research topics in multiple UAV (multi-UAV) coordinated path planning. Aiming at solving low computational efficiency and poor scalability of the traditional multi-UAV path planning method, the decentralized multi-UAV path planning method suitable for obstacle environments is proposed. Firstly, the UAV rendezvous path planning problem with constraints such as the kinematics of UAVs and collision-free constraints is modeled as a non-convex optimal control problem. To minimize formation rendezvous time and energy consumption, a two-layer coordinative framework is developed to solve this problem. In the coordination layer, relying only on the information of neighboring UAVs, each UAV in the decentralized communication graph negotiates the desired flight time using a consensus protocol to achieve coordination among UAVs. In the planning layer, the initial non-convex formation rendezvous path planning problem is decoupled into several sub-problems, which can be solved in parallel by path planners distributed on each UAV using sequential convex programming. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results show that this decentralized multi-UAV path planning method can handle the minimum-time rendezvous path planning problem and optimize the energy consumption in flight, and the computing time does not increase significantly with the enlargement of the UAV swarm. This decentralized framework scales well with the number of UAVs and can be applied for future urban flight and supplies delivery tasks.

AB In this study, multi-dimensional Taylor network (MTN) inspired sliding mode robust control theory based adaptation laws are proposed to realise trajectory tracking for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. Compared with existing methods, the composite disturbance considered in this study includes external multiple interference and fuselage parameter perturbation, which is more in accord with reality. Through a linear state transformation, the uncertain coefficients and unknown external disturbances are grouped together and the original kinetic model is decoupled into two subsystems of position and attitude that make the control design become feasible. MTNs are used to compensate the lumped non-linearities, and the adaptive sliding mode technique is employed to construct the controller. Different from the controllers based on neural networks, MTN contains only addition and multiplication, which greatly lessens the computational complexity and improves the real-time performance. By the Lyapunov theory, the position tracking error, attitude tracking error and fuselage load identification error are bounded in probability have been proved and the stability of the system is guaranteed. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed trajectory tracking control scheme.

AB Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are used extensively by the offshore oil and gas and renewables industries for inspection, maintenance, and repair of their infrastructure. With thousands of subsea structures monitored across the world's oceans from the shallows to depths greater than 1,000 m, there is a great and underutilized opportunity for their scientific use. Through slight modifications of ROV operations, and by augmenting industry workclass ROVs with a range of scientific equipment, industry can fuel scientific discoveries, contribute to an understanding of the impact of artificial structures in our oceans, and collect biotic and abiotic data to support our understanding of how oceans and marine life are changing. Here, we identify and describe operationally feasible methods to adjust the way in which industry ROVs are operated to enhance the scientific value of data that they collect, without significantly impacting scheduling or adding to deployment costs. These include: rapid marine life survey protocols, imaging improvements, the addition of a range of scientific sensors, and collection of biological samples. By partnering with qualified and experienced research scientists, industry can improve the quality of their ROV-derived data, allowing the data to be analyzed robustly. Small changes by industry now could provide substantial benefits to scientific research in the long-term and improve the quality of scientific data in existence once the structures require decommissioning. Such changes also have the potential to enhance industry's environmental stewardship by improving their environmental management and facilitating more informed engagement with a range of external stakeholders, including regulators and the public.

AB Purpose of ReviewBy 2050, 70% of the global population will live in urban areas, exposing a greater number of people to specific city-related health risks that will only be exacerbated by climate change. Two prominent health risks are poor air quality and physical inactivity. We aim to review the literature and state the best practices for clean air and active transportation in urban areas.Recent FindingsCities have been targeting reductions in air pollution and physical inactivity to improve population health. Oslo, Paris, and Madrid plan on banning cars from their city centers to mitigate climate change, reduce vehicle emissions, and increase walking and cycling. Urban streets are being redesigned to accommodate and integrate various modes of transportation to ensure individuals can become actively mobile and healthy. Investments in pedestrian, cycling, and public transport infrastructure and services can both improve air quality and support active transportation. Emerging technologies like electric and autonomous vehicles are being developed and may reduce air pollution but have limited impact on physical activity. Green spaces too can mitigate air pollution and encourage physical activity.SummaryClean air and active transportation overlap considerably as they are both functions of mobility. The best practices of clean air and active transportation have produced impressive results, which are improved when enacted simultaneously in integrated policy packages. Further research is needed in middle- and low-income countries, using measurements from real-world interventions, tracing air pollution back to the sources responsible, and holistically addressing the entire spectrum of exposures and health outcomes related to transportation.

AB While research on developing and testing automated vehicle (AVs) technologies is well underway, research on their implications on travel-related behavior is in its infancy. The aim of this paper is to summarize and analyze literature that focuses on travel-related behavior impacts of AVs, namely levels 4 and 5, as well as highlight important directions of research. We review five methods used to quantitatively investigate these implications and how each method contributes to this literature: 1) controlled testbeds, 2) driving simulators and virtual reality, 3) agent-based and travel-demand models, 4) surveys, and 5) field experiments. We also present five critical research questions regarding the implications of AVs on the demand side of transportation and summarize findings from the current literature on: 1) what is the willingness to adopt the technology? and what are the impacts of the technology on 2) in-vehicle behavior? 3) value of time? 4) travel-related behaviors (activity pattern, mode, destination, residential location)? and 5) vehicle miles traveled (VMT)? Results can be divided into four categories. The first category corresponds to results on research questions with numerous data points where the direction of the impact is consistent across the literature, albeit the magnitude varies considerably. For instance, surveys indicate 19% to 68% of people are unwilling to adopt AV technology, a sentiment that is fading over time. Moreover, people prefer owning AVs over sharing them and don't believe their car ownership will decrease. Regarding VMT, most studies predict an increase that varies from a low of 1% to a high of 90% depending on the scenario and assumptions under study. The second category of findings corresponds to research questions with limited and consistent, albeit highly variable data points. For example, a few stated preference survey studies indicate that reduced stress and multitasking during travel will reduce the value of time between 5% and 90%. The third category of results is on research questions with a few but conflicting data points. For instance, surveys indicate that people (80% to 85%) do not believe their residential location will be impacted by the adoption of AVs. Some simulation studies, however, indicate that lower travel costs will drive people away from cities and into suburbs while other studies report the opposite. The final category of results corresponds to research question with a single or no data points. For instance, one study explores how users will use vehicles to run errands while no studies investigate user preferences for vehicle types (e.g. mobile-homes vs. right-sized) or how they plan to use their vehicles when they are not needed (e.g. rent out vs. leave them idle). Moving forward, the goal is to shift all results into the first category while simultaneously tightening the prediction interval of the magnitude of the impacts. This can be achieved by: 1) focusing more efforts on research questions that fall under the three remaining categories to fill the holes in the literature, and 2) establishing consistency and clarity of assumptions used by researchers to enable comparisons and transferability of results.

AB Commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers often experience difficulties in turning and crossing at ramp terminals. CMV-involved crashes could cause queue spillback at ramp terminals and possibly nearby freeway mainline and crossroads. The safety and mobility of ramp terminals for accommodating CMVs is thus of significant importance. However, interchange ramp terminals have rarely been investigated in previous safety studies, especially with regard to CMV-involved crashes. This study aimed at examining CMV-related crashes that occurred at ramp terminals. Heterogeneous negative binomial (HTNB) and traditional negative binomial (NB) models were fitted and compared while developing a safety performance function (SPF) for predicting CMV crashes and identifying high-risk ramp terminals. Information on crash history and site-specific characteristics was collected at 285 ramp terminals in the state of Kentucky between 2015 and 2019. The results showed that the HTNB model outperformed the NB model in relation to various goodness-of-fit measures (e.g., likelihood ratio test "LRT", Akaike information criterion "AIC" and McFadden Pseudo R-squared statistic). The predicted crash frequencies while applying the HTNB model were then used to identify and rank high-risk ramp terminals. Ramp terminals with signalized traffic control type, with greater average daily traffic on the exit ramp, with two or more traffic lanes on the exit ramp, and adjacent to commercial or industrial areas were found to experience more CMV crashes. Several safety countermeasures were proposed to alleviate CMV-involved crashes at ramp terminals. One example is ensuring the presence of physical medians on crossroads (or major roads) ahead of exits ramps.

Inefficient mobility in cities can lead to problems such as traffic congestion, which results in frustration for residents and a decrease in the quality of life. Against the backdrop of global warming, cities also strive to reduce CO2 emissions, an attempt which requires sustainable and novel mobility concepts. Blockchain is a current technology, said to have huge potential, that is being investigated for application in many facets of smart cities. In the context of smart mobility, blockchain can be used for transactions relating to ridesharing and electric charging, handling of interactions of platoon members, or serving as a foundation for communication between vehicles. Although initial research about this topic exists, it is distributed among different use-cases and applications. This article conducts a systematic literature review to analyze blockchain's role in mobility and transportation in smart cities, and its potential to increase efficiency in these areas. With this review, we aim to consolidate and summarize the current knowledge about this topic. As a first result, we present the findings from our literature review, which can be divided into five categories of use-cases. We also present a platform for further research about this emerging topic by identifying promising future research avenues. For this purpose, we derive a future research agenda based on our findings.

AB We propose a multi-agent based computational framework for modeling decision-making and strategic interaction at micro level for smart vehicles in a smart world. The concepts of Markov game and best response dynamics are heavily leveraged. Our aim is to make the framework conceptually sound and computationally practical for a range of realistic applications, including micro path planning for autonomous vehicles. To this end, we first convert the would-be stochastic game problem into a closely related deterministic one by introducing risk premium in the utility function for each individual agent. We show how the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of the simplified deterministic game can be solved by an algorithm based on best response dynamics. In order to better model human driving behaviors with bounded rationality, we seek to further simplify the solution concept by replacing the Nash equilibrium condition with a heuristic and adaptive optimization with finite lookahead anticipation. In addition, the algorithm corresponding to the new solution concept drastically improves the computational efficiency. To demonstrate how our approach can be applied to realistic traffic settings, we conduct a simulation experiment: to derive merging and yielding behaviors on a double-lane highway with an unexpected barrier. Despite assumption differences involved in the two solution concepts, the derived numerical solutions show that the endogenized driving behaviors are very similar. We also briefly comment on how the proposed framework can be further extended in a number of directions in our forthcoming work, such as behavioral calibration using real traffic video data, and computational mechanism design for traffic policy optimization.

AB Nowadays, emerging technologies, such as long-range transmitters, increasingly miniaturized components for positioning, and enhanced imaging sensors, have led to an upsurge in the availability of new ecological applications for remote sensing based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sometimes referred to as "drones". In fact, structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry coupled with imagery acquired by UAVs offers a rapid and inexpensive tool to produce high-resolution orthomosaics, giving ecologists a new way for responsive, timely, and cost-effective monitoring of ecological processes. Here, we adopted a lightweight quadcopter as an aerial survey tool and object-based image analysis (OBIA) workflow to demonstrate the strength of such methods in producing very high spatial resolution maps of sensitive marine habitats. Therefore, three different coastal environments were mapped using the autonomous flight capability of a lightweight UAV equipped with a fully stabilized consumer-grade RGB digital camera. In particular we investigated a Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow, a rocky coast with nurseries for juvenile fish, and two sandy areas showing biogenic reefs of Sabelleria alveolata. We adopted, for the first time, UAV-based raster thematic maps of these key coastal habitats, produced after OBIA classification, as a new method for fine-scale, low-cost, and time saving characterization of sensitive marine environments which may lead to a more effective and efficient monitoring and management of natural resources.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving and SLAM technology, the perception system of a vehicle heavily relies on laser and image sensors to capture the real-world scenario and avoid obstacles autonomously. To achieve accurate and robust multi-sensor fusion computation, high-precision extrinsic calibration of camera and laser scanner is a necessary requirement. Traditional multi-sensor calibration methods based on manual features rely on specific scenarios and may not provide feature information over long distances. In this paper, we present a novel approach for robustly calibrating the extrinsic parameters of a solid-state(SS) lidar-camera system in a natural environment. Our proposed method begins with obtaining robust line feature information. we first innovatively employ a super-voxel clustering method to extract global 3D line features from the complete point cloud and then back-project these 3D line features into 2D space. Afterward, a transformer-based edge detection network, EDTER, is used to detect the edge features and estimate the probability pixel-by-pixel. To consider the uncertainty of two-dimensional line features and the inconsistency of residuals at different distances, we construct a line feature weight model for line feature residual calculation. Finally, we minimize the residual errors using least squares optimization to recover the relative pose of the camera and the lidar sensor. We conducted a performance study to compare our proposed method against existing targetless calibration methods on various natural scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves higher robustness, accuracy, and consistency, making it suitable for real-world applications.

AB Trajectory optimization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating as flying base stations (FBSs) evolved as a novel integration component in beyond 5G (B5G) networks and has recently received significant research attention. Notably, the vast majority of previous research has mainly concentrated on the case of a single terrestrial macro base station (BS) which is used as a depot for multiple FBSs. In this article, we focus on the more general use case where multiple FBSs located at different macro-BSs used as a depot serve ground users (GUs) at cluster points (CPs). To this end, we formulate the FBSs trajectory optimization problem using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation with the aim to minimize the total travel time (TTT) of the FBSs in a multicell network in which their cell coverage or boundary is adjustable for the FBSs deployment; creating in that sense virtual cells for the FBSs. Furthermore, heuristic algorithms are proposed to provide competitive solutions and reduce the computational time in view of the curse of dimensionality of the original problem. Numerical investigations reveal that the proposed FBSs path planning optimization solutions decrease the TTT and increase the efficiency of offloading collected data for the FBSs deployment with gains up to approximately 23% and 19%, respectively, compared to nominal schemes that consider the predefined coverage range of the cells or no cell boundaries. Aside from the above, compared to previously proposed nominal strategies, the proposed schemes achieve an almost 27% improvement in terms of fairness (Jain's index) on the FBS traveling time.

AB management of remote services, such as remote surgery, remote sensing, or remote driving, has become increas-ingly important, especially with the emerging 5G and Beyond 5G technologies. However, the strict network requirements of these remote services represent one of the major challenges that hinder their fast and large-scale deployment in critical infras-tructures. This article addresses certain issues inherent in remote and immersive control of virtual reality (VR)-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), whereby a user remotely controls UAVs, equipped with 360 degrees cameras, using their head-mounted devices (HMD) and their respective controllers. Remote and immersive control services, using 360 degrees video streams, require much lower latency and higher throughput for true immersion and high ser-vice reliability. To assess and analyze these requirements, this article introduces a real-life testbed system that leverages dif-ferent technologies (e.g., VR, 360 degrees video streaming over 4G/5G, and edge computing). In the performance evaluation, different latency types are considered. They are namely: 1) glass-to-glass latency between the 360 degrees camera of a remote UAV and the HMD display; 2) user/pilot's reaction latency; and 3) the com-mand/execution latency. The obtained results indicate that the responsiveness (dubbed Glass-to-Reaction-to-Execution-GRE- latency) of a pilot, using our system, to a sudden event is within an acceptable range, i.e., around 900 ms.

AB With the continuous expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) application scope, there are growing IoT scenarios that lack the coverage of wireless communication networks have the demand for data offloading. Efficient data transmission has been the main concern of these applications. Thus, data offloading within the limited communication environment has become a hotspot in both industry and academia. Since unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can move across regions to make up for the communication gap caused by the loss of wireless communication networks, a lot of in-depth studies on UAV-enabled data offloading have been conducted. Nevertheless, few studies to date consider the uncertain user status and the heterogeneous UAV capabilities, which is however more practical and needs more attention. In this article, we propose an innovative framework to dynamically estimate user status information and determine the UAV scheduling strategy. On this basis, the heterogeneous UAV-enabled data offloading is modeled as a constrained multiobjective optimization problem, whose purpose is to lower the user data queue length while extending the working time of the UAV. Moreover, a differential evolution-based dynamic objective approximation method-RUDDER is proposed to solve the constrained multiobjective optimization problem. Through rigorous mathematical proof, we prove that RUDDER can consistently guide the population to approach the optimization solution with polynomial-level time complexity. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed RUDDER, extensive experiments are conducted to compare it with five comparison algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the RUDDER in terms of energy saving, time efficiency, and adaptability.

AB Optical flow estimation is a basic task in self driving and robotics systems, which enables to temporally interpret traffic scenes. Autonomous vehicles clearly benefit from the ultra-wide Field of View (FoV) offered by 360 degrees panoramic sensors. However, due to the unique imaging process of panoramic cameras, models designed for pinhole images do not directly generalize satisfactorily to 360 degrees panoramic images. In this paper, we put forward a novel network framework-PANOFLOW, to learn optical flow for panoramic images. To overcome the distortions introduced by equirectangular projection in panoramic transformation, we design a Flow Distortion Augmentation (FDA) method, which contains radial flow distortion (FDA-R) or equirectangular flow distortion (FDA-E). We further look into the definition and properties of cyclic optical flow for panoramic videos, and hereby propose a Cyclic Flow Estimation (CFE) method by leveraging the cyclicity of spherical images to infer 360 degrees optical flow and converting large displacement to relatively small displacement. PanoFlow is applicable to any existing flow estimation method and benefits from the progress of narrow-FoV flow estimation. In addition, we create and release a synthetic panoramic dataset FlowScape based on CARLA to facilitate training and quantitative analysis. PanoFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public OmniFlowNet and the fresh established FlowScape benchmarks. Our proposed approach reduces the End-Point-Error (EPE) on FlowScape by 27.3%. On OmniFlowNet, PanoFlow achieves an EPE of 3.17 pixels, a 55.5% error reduction from the best published result (7.12 pixels). We also qualitatively validate our method via an outdoor collection vehicle and a public real-world OmniPhotos dataset, indicating strong potential and robustness for real-world navigation applications.

AB Unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs)-enabled mobile-edge computing (MEC) networks have shown a huge advantage in providing on-demand communication and computation service for the ground users. To reap the benefit of these integrated networks, reducing their energy consumption becomes a key issue, since both UAVs and ground users are energy-limited devices. To address this problem, this article attempts to provide a novel method that optimizes communication, computation, and control (3C), i.e., user association, computational task offloading, and UAVs flight control, to reduce the communication and computation energy consumption. Specifically, in order to find out the appropriate deployment positions for UAV MEC servers to provide on-demand communication and computation service, we propose the concept of the virtual force field (VFF) based on the user statistical distribution model and then devise a coordinated flight control algorithm for UAV MEC servers. After that, the user association and computational task offloading are optimized alternately. Utilizing the optimal transport theory (OTT), we derive the boundary formulation of the optimal user association and develop an iterative algorithm to approach the optimal association boundary. Then, given the user association, the optimal computational task offloading scheme is investigated. The convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm and the alternating optimization algorithm is proved. The complexity of the 3C optimization method is also analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed designs considerably outperform the similar existing algorithm. Comparisons with the benchmark scheme show that the proposed scheme can reduce about 88% energy consumption and also improve energy efficiency performance greatly under the same simulation setups.

ID MODEL
AB Realistic and diverse simulation scenarios with reactive and feasible agent behaviors can be used for validation and verification of self-driving system performance without relying on expensive and time-consuming real-world testing. Existing simulators rely on heuristic-based behavior models for background vehicles, which cannot capture the complex interactive behaviors in real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, existing learning-based methods are typical insufficient, yielding behaviors of traffic participants that frequently collide or drive off the road especially for a long horizon. To address this issue, we propose TrajGen, a two-stage trajectory generation framework, which can capture more realistic and diverse behaviors directly from human demonstration. In particular, TrajGen consists of the multi-modal trajectory prediction stage and the reinforcement learning based trajectory modification stage. In the first stage, we propose a novel auxiliary RouteLoss for the trajectory prediction model to generate multi-modal diverse trajectories in the drivable area. In the second stage, reinforcement learning is used to track the predicted trajectories while avoiding collisions, which can improve the reactivity and feasibility of generated trajectories. In addition, we develop a simulator I-Sim that can provide support for data-driven agent behavior simulation and train reinforcement learning models in parallel based on naturalistic driving data. The vehicle model in I-Sim can guarantee that the generated trajectories by TrajGen satisfy vehicle kinematic constraints. Finally, we give comprehensive metrics to evaluate generated trajectories for simulation scenarios, which shows that TrajGen outperforms either trajectory prediction or inverse reinforcement learning in terms of fidelity, reactivity, feasibility, and diversity.

AB Using aerial platforms for Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) of large and complex structures is a growing field of interest in various industries. Infrastructures such as: buildings, bridges, oil and gas, etc. refineries require regular and extensive inspections. The inspection reports are used to plan and perform required maintenance, ensuring their structural health and the safety of the workers. However, performing these inspections can be challenging due to the size of the facility, the lack of easy access, the health risks for the inspectors, or several other reasons, which has convinced companies to invest more in drones as an alternative solution to overcome these challenges. The autonomous nature of drones can assist companies in reducing inspection time and cost. Moreover, the employment of drones can lower the number of required personnel for inspection and can increase personnel safety. Finally, drones can provide a safe and reliable solution for inspecting hard-to-reach or hazardous areas. Despite the recent developments in drone-based NDI to reliably detect defects, several limitations and challenges still need to be addressed. In this paper, a brief review of the history of unmanned aerial vehicles, along with a comprehensive review of studies focused on UAV-based NDI of industrial and commercial facilities, are provided. Moreover, the benefits of using drones in inspections as an alternative to conventional methods are discussed, along with the challenges and open problems of employing drones in industrial inspections, are explored. Finally, some of our case studies conducted in different industrial fields in the field of Non-Destructive Inspection are presented.

AB Ocean processes are dynamic and complex and occur on multiple spatial and temporal scales. To obtain a synoptic view of such processes, ocean scientists collect data over long time periods. Historically, measurements were continually provided by fixed sensors, e.g., moorings, or gathered from ships. Recently, an increase in the utilization of autonomous underwater vehicles has enabled a more dynamic data acquisition approach. However, we still do not utilize the full capabilities of these vehicles. Here we present algorithms that produce persistent monitoring missions for underwater vehicles by balancing path following accuracy and sampling resolution for a given region of interest, which addresses a pressing need among ocean scientists to efficiently and effectively collect high-value data. More specifically, this paper proposes a path planning algorithm and a speed control algorithm for underwater gliders, which together give informative trajectories for the glider to persistently monitor a patch of ocean. We optimize a cost function that blends two competing factors: maximize the information value along the path while minimizing deviation from the planned path due to ocean currents. Speed is controlled along the planned path by adjusting the pitch angle of the underwater glider, so that higher resolution samples are collected in areas of higher information value. The resulting paths are closed circuits that can be repeatedly traversed to collect long-term ocean data in dynamic environments. The algorithms were tested during sea trials on an underwater glider operating off the coast of southern California, as well as in Monterey Bay, California. The experimental results show improvements in both data resolution and path reliability compared to previously executed sampling paths used in the respective regions. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The design of future mobility solutions and the design of the mobility systems they enable are closely coupled. Indeed, knowledge about the intended service of novel mobility solutions would impact their design and deployment process, whilst insights about their technological development could significantly affect transportation management policies. This requires tools to study such a coupling and co-design mobility systems in terms of different objectives. We present a framework to address such co-design problems, leveraging a mathematical theory of co-design to frame and solve the problem of designing and deploying an intermodal mobility system, whereby autonomous vehicles service travel demands jointly with micromobility solutions and public transit, in terms of fleets sizing, vehicle characteristics, and public transit service frequency. Our framework is modular and compositional, allowing one to describe the design as the interconnection of simple components and to tackle it from a systemic perspective. Moreover, it requires general monotonicity assumptions and naturally handles multiple objectives, delivering rational, actionable solutions for policy makers. We showcase our methodology in a case study of Washington D.C., USA. Our work suggests the possibility to create user-friendly optimization tools to systematically assess costs and benefits of interventions, and to inform policy-making in the future.

AB Antarctica has been significantly influenced by global climate change. Owing to the spatiotemporal limitations of existing datasets, budgetary constraints, logistical challenges, and adverse temperature and climatic conditions of Antarctica, researchers face great challenges. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have helped to solve this issue because they can collect high-resolution spatiotemporal data and conduct operations in inaccessible locations at a low cost and with ease compared with in situ observation and conventional spaceborne and airborne remote sensing. The development and testing of UAVs for use in polar environments mainly focus on enhancing UAV performance in extreme Antarctic conditions by improving their endurance, wind resistance, and aerial photography stability. The equipped multisensors, flexible data collection and operation window, and high-spatiotemporal resolution all contribute to making UAVs the most powerful platform for cryospheric research. In recent years, a series of UAV-related studies on the cryosphere have been published. However, a thorough review that explicitly details the scientific progress and possibilities of using UAVs in Antarctic polar research is lacking. In this era of rapid global and regional climate change, it is becoming increasingly necessary to employ UAVs to investigate the finer changes in the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) and ice shelves. This work investigates the use of UAVs in the monitoring of the glacial microtopography (including rifts and crevasses, surface subsidence, and melting ponds), ice surface landforms, atmosphere, flora and fauna, sea ice, subglacial environment, and other aspects of Antarctic glaciology investigation, and it speculates on their future use in multidisciplinary research.

AB AGV systems are considered a necessary element of the recently created cyber-physical systems whose task is to support material flows in intelligent factories. The implementation of AGV systems in cyber-physical systems generates new types of threats, and the level of risk of adverse events related to the operation of these systems is changing. This article aims to present the results of an open-access literature review, the purpose of which was to identify issues addressed in studies of the analysis and risk management of AGV systems, to group publications according to the proposed topical framework, and to identify gaps in the current research. We used the PRISMA concept to review the literature. After completing all stages of the procedure, 153 publications on risk in AGV systems were selected for analysis. To ensure the high quality of the analysis, access to the full texts of the selected documents was necessary. For this reason, we have limited the collection to open-access publications. The results of the analysis allowed us to distinguish 12 primary categories and 26 additional subcategories within the literature. These categories are characterized by different numbers of publications and cover different AGV systems operation areas. The simultaneous assignment of documents to several subcategories indicates the need for a holistic view of issues related to the risk of AGV operation in operating environments with varying degrees of automation. An essential scientific contribution of our analysis is the identification of a research gap. The analyzed publications lacked studies on methods of risk identification and assessment that take into account the specificity of AGV operation, especially in the cyber-physical systems of Logistics 4.0.

AB The dynamic position deployment and resource allocation of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks has great significance in terms of interference management, coverage enhancement, and capacity improvement. Since the transmission power and energy resources of the UAVs are limited and the actual communication environment is complex and time-varying, it is challenging for the multiple UAVs to dynamically make decisions to ensure the communication performance of the system. Meanwhile, the centralized architecture may generate a certain degree of communication delay and affect communication efficiency. Facing this challenge, a resource allocation algorithm for the UAV networks based on multi-agent collaborative environment learning is proposed. This method is based on a distributed architecture. Each UAV is modeled as an independent agent, which improves the utility of the UAV networks through the dynamic selection decisions of its deployment position, transmission power, and occupied sub-channels. Each UAV learns the mapping of the network information to the position deployment and resource selection decisions based on the reinforcement learning algorithm according to partial of the state information it can observe. For the overall network, a multi-agent reinforcement learning method based on federated learning is designed on the purpose of realizing information interaction and combined dispatching of the UAVs. In the multi-agent system, the framework of federated learning is introduced to realize the sharing of non-privacy data among the UAVs. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively improve the network utility compared with the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm without information interaction.

AB BACKGROUND Agricultural pests and diseases affect grain yield and quality. In addition to the use of chemical agents, the biological control of diseases and insect pests has attracted more and more attention due to an urgent need for environmental protection. However, traditional operational methods do not integrate well with biological control technology. With the advantages of simple operation, low operating cost, high operating efficiency and wide application range, use of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in biological control is of great significance.
   RESULTS An intelligent delivery system comprising an insect natural enemy (Trichogramma) capsule based on an M45 electric multirotor UAV was built to release Trichogramma ostriniae in corn fields under full autonomous mode. During operation, the M45 UAV can fly accurately in accordance with operational requirements; average deviation between the actual and planned routes was 0.24 m, the average flight speed was 9.18 m s(-1) and the average altitude was 5.08 m. The effective coverage rate of natural enemies was 99.33% and the coverage redundancy was 36.75%. After delivery, an investigation into the field control effect showed an average control effect of 83.70%, which can result in effective pest control.
   CONCLUSION A natural enemy carrier intelligent delivery system based on an M45 electric multirotor UAV was found to have good flight performance. In addition, natural enemies were evenly distributed, giving even coverage of the target fields. The system had a good control effect.

AB Bird damage to fruit crops is a significant problem and incurs great cost due to product losses on an annual basis. In this study, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) that incorporated the principles of bird psychology were used to measure the efficacy of deterring pest birds in vineyards. Earlier experiments measuring bird responses to UAVs demonstrated successful deterrence to a variety of bird species. To study efficacy, the same UAV method was applied in conjunction with another bird-scaring method involving static visual devices, as well as the netting method. The methods were applied concurrently in delineated treatment blocks within the same vineyard for a 7-day period and this comparison was repeated at three different locations. Bird damage was visually estimated and recorded as average percentage damage within grape bunches. In summary, percentage damage to bunches within treatment blocks: (1) UAV, (2) visual scaring, and (3) netting was: 0.9%, 1.8% and 1.2% at the first location; 1.6%, 2.5% and 0.7% at the second location; 1.2%, 4.8% and 0.5% at the third location. Statistical analyses showed that damage experienced in the UAV deterrent and netted treatment blocks were similar across locations. In contrast, the visual scaring treatment block experienced significantly more damage than the netted treatment block at each location. Efficacy of the UAV deterrent could be further improved by broadcasting distress signals that are specific to the pest species. The cost-effectiveness could be greatly improved by making the system autonomous in the future thereby removing the need for direct human involvement and saving labour costs.

AB With the ever-increasing of population and economy worldwide, buildings have become major energy consumers and greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters. The hybrid AC/DC microgrid is a promising alternative for existing power distribution systems to achieve the goal of nearly/net zero energy buildings (nZEBs). However, the increasing demand for compact structure, seamless integration of distributed generators (DGs) and loads, as well as more control flexibility of hybrid microgrids cannot be adequately satisfied by conventional grid architectures. In view of this, an integrated and reconfigurable hybrid AC/DC microgrid architecture with its hierarchical control strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a novel interlinking converter named smart interlinking unit (SIU) is presented, which can provide multiple AC/DC interfaces and diverse operation modes with various control functionalities. Secondly, the SIU-based hybrid microgrid architecture and its hierarchical control structure are established. The dedicated interfaces and cluster controllers for electric vehicles (EVs) facilitate the implementation of centralized vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service. Thirdly, a hierarchical control strategy of SIU, which involves local control in primary control level and power flow control in secondary control level, is introduced to realize coordinated operation of microgrid. The model of the proposed hybrid microgrid architecture is built, and the simulation results demonstrate that the microgrid architecture and hierarchical control strategy can achieve a reliable and coordinated system operation under various kinds of scenarios. Additionally, the mutual power support between AC and DC sub-grids is realized with increased utilization and local consumption of renewable energy resources (RESs).

AB We propose a fast and effective method, fast target detection (FTD), to detect the moving cooperative target for the unmanned aerial vehicle landing, and the target is composed of double circles and a cross. The purpose of our strategy is to land on the target. The FTD method needs to detect the target at the high and low heights. At the high height, the target appears completely and stably in the camera field. The FTD method can detect the circle and cross to rapidly reach the target center, named cross and circle-FTD (C-2 - FTD). To detect the cross, we propose a slope distance equation to obtain the distance between two slopes. The proposed slopes cluster method, based on the distance equation and K-means, is used to determine the cross center. At the low height, the target appears incompletely and unstably. Therefore, FTD methods detect only the cross, named cross-FTD (C-1 - FTD). We extract the cross features (CFs) based on line segments. Then, four CFs are combined based on graph theory. Experiments on our four datasets show that FTD has rapid speed and good performance. (Our method is implemented in C++ and is available at https://github.com/Li-Zhaoxi/UAV-Vision-Servo.) On the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge datasets made we constructed, C-2 - FTD detects the target from a 960 x 540 image approximately 20 ms per pipeline with 82.24% F-measure and tracks target approximately 6.27 ms per pipeline with 94.39% F-measure.

AB This paper discusses radar-based technologies that provide drivers with information about road curves under conditions in which optical sensors are unable to perform. The development of a task capable of estimating road curves has become a popular challenge since the commencement of the active development of advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. Although the hardware implementation of a road curvature measurement system may have many variations, including cameras, we consider microwave sensors to be a reasonable alternative that offers many benefits. Road curvature measurement requires fast acquisition of the necessary data from a moving vehicle followed by efficient postprocessing of the data to identify a sufficient number of reliable featured points in the local environment. These points would enable a hypothesis about the dimensions and shape of the probable road geometry to be built. Different studies attempted to solve this problem using specialized equipment and custom-built algorithms. Our solution is to use a commercially available radar and some preprocessing and postprocessing algorithms for data conditioning and analysis to obtain reliable results in both day-and night-time environments and under various weather conditions in a relatively short time using a simplified approach based on circle-fitting algorithms. We confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting multiple road experiments with a commercially available microwave sensor. Considering that the road infrastructure is currently not optimized for road curvature measurements, the results we obtained with our proposed method (within 10%-17% of those on the actual map) are acceptable.

AB This paper investigates the problem of spatial curvilinear path following control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with multiple uncertainties. Firstly, in order to design the appropriate controller, path following error dynamics model is constructed in a moving Serret-Frenet frame, and the five degrees of freedom (DOFs) dynamic model with multiple uncertainties is established. Secondly, the proposed control law is separated into kinematic controller and dynamic controller via back-stepping technique. In the case of kinematic controller, to overcome the drawback of dependence on the accurate vehicle model that are present in a number of path following control strategies described in the literature, the unknown side-slip angular velocity and attack angular velocity are treated as uncertainties. Whereas in the case of dynamic controller, the model parameters perturbations, unknown external environmental disturbances and the nonlinear hydrodynamic damping terms are treated as lumped uncertainties. Both kinematic and dynamic uncertainties are estimated and compensated by designed reduced-order linear extended state observes (LESOs). Thirdly, feedback linearization (FL) based control law is implemented for the control model using the estimates generated by reduced-order LESOs. For handling the problem of computational complexity inherent in the conventional back-stepping method, nonlinear tracking differentiators (NTDs) are applied to construct derivatives of the virtual control commands. Finally, the closed loop stability for the overall system is established. Simulation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed controller exhibits enhanced performance in the presence of internal parameter variations, external unknown disturbances, unmodeled nonlinear damping terms, and measurement noises.

AB New technologies are required for safe, site-specific and efficient control of weeds, pathogens and insects in agricultural crops and in forestry. The development and use of autonomous tractors equipped with innovative sensor systems, data processing techniques and actuation tools can be highly beneficial because this technology allows pest control measures to be applied only if, when, and where they are genuinely needed, thus reducing costs, environmental damage and risks to farmers. RHEA (Robotics and associated High-technologies and Equipment for Agriculture) is an EC-funded research project conducted by a consortium composed of 15 research partners from eight European countries. The focus of the project is the design, development and testing of a new generation of automatic and robotic systems for both chemical and physical pest management. A heterogeneous fleet of small, cooperative ground and aerial robots equipped with advanced sensors, enhanced end effectors and improved decision control algorithms will be used. Initially, we are investigating three major scenarios: (a) chemical weed control in winter wheat, (b) thermal weed control (i.e., flaming) in maize and (c) variable applications of pesticides in olive crops. A preliminary system evaluation demonstrated that the intelligent sprayer boom applied the control agent to over 95% of the target area and that the response time, 10 s, of the direct-injection system was anticipated in-the sprayer system to ensure the accuracy of herbicide spraying. Field trial results showed that the estimated cost for site-specific flame weeding was approximately 24 ha(-1), whereas approximately 52 (sic) ha(-1) was needed to perform a conventional broadcast treatment. Thus, the use of VRA (Variable Rate Application) flaming reduces the use of liquid petroleum gas (cost savings of 28 (sic) ha(-1)). The results also indicated that the control system, mounted on a prototype, air-blast sprayer design, produced a precise system response to variation in the target features, an approximate accuracy of 0.1 m in horizontal resolution and a rapid actuation response of approximately 100 ms. Workshop and field experiments provide convincing evidence that autonomous agricultural vehicles equipped with intelligent implements represent an important step forward for optimizing pest control applications in sustainable row crop, orchard and cereal crop production systems.

AB Lateral localization is a very sensible factor for evaluating the performance of autonomous driving. This paper addresses the general reasons of the lateral drifting by analyzing the performance of an accurate localization system at level of 10 similar to 20 cm. The performance drops into 0.4 similar to 3 m in winter because of the snow and wet road surface representations in the LIDAR data. Accordingly, we prove that enhancing the quality of online LIDAR data before calculating the matching score with the map is a key-solution to improve the lateral accuracy. This can be achieved by filtering-out snow, regenerating the road edges at correct positions and sharping-up the lane lines. To achieve these objectives, we propose a machine learning based road-mark reconstruction framework. The map images are converted into edge profiles to represent the road-marks in a series of peaks. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to model the relationships between these peaks and extract the dominant distribution patterns. Based on the leading eigenvectors (eigenroads), the LIDAR edge profiles are safely and efficiently reconstructed during the autonomous driving. The reliability of the proposed framework has been tested using map data generated in 2015 and LIDAR data collected in 2016 and 2017 in snowy and rainy weather conditions. The experimental results have verified the robustness and truthfulness of the proposed framework to significantly improve the lateral accuracy in the LIDAR based localization systems. The localization accuracy has been enhanced to be 96.4% for 15 cm average error in very critical situations of changing the road patterns and the environmental conditions.

AB The aim of this paper is to deploy a time-of-flight (ToF) based photonic mixer device (PMD) camera on an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) whose overall target is to traverse from one point to another in hazardous and hostile environments employing obstacle avoidance without human intervention. The hypothesized approach of applying a ToF Camera for an AGV is a suitable approach to autonomous robotics because, as the ToF camera can provide three-dimensional (3D) information at a low computational cost, it is utilized to extract information about obstacles after their calibration and ground testing, and is mounted and integrated with the Pioneer mobile robot. The workspace is a two-dimensional (2D) world map which has been divided into a grid/cells, where the collision-free path defined by the graph search algorithm is a sequence of cells the AGV can traverse to reach the target. PMD depth data is used to populate traversable areas and obstacles by representing a grid/cells of suitable size. These camera data are converted into Cartesian coordinates for entry into a workspace grid map. A more optimal camera mounting angle is needed and adopted by analysing the camera's performance discrepancy, such as pixel detection, the detection rate and the maximum perceived distances, and infrared (IR) scattering with respect to the ground surface. This mounting angle is recommended to be half the vertical field-of-view (FoV) of the PMD camera. A series of still and moving tests are conducted on the AGV to verify correct sensor operations, which show that the postulated application of the ToF camera in the AGV is not straightforward. Later, to stabilize the moving PMD camera and to detect obstacles, a tracking feature detection algorithm and the scene flow technique are implemented to perform a real-time experiment.

AB Improvements in temporal and spatial sampling frequency have the potential to open new windows into the understanding of marine microbial dynamics. In recent years, efforts have been made to allow automated samplers to collect microbial biomass for DNA/RNA analyses from moored observatories and autonomous underwater vehicles. Measurements of microbial proteins are also of significant interest given their biogeochemical importance as enzymes that catalyze reactions and transporters that interface with the environment. We examined the influence of five preservatives solutions (SDS-extraction buffer, ethanol, trichloroacetic acid, B-PER, and RNAlater) on the proteome integrity of the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus WH8102 after 4 weeks of storage at room temperature. Four approaches were used to assess degradation: total protein recovery, band integrity on an SDS detergent polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel, and number of protein identifications and relative abundances by 1-dimensional LC MS/MS proteomic analyses. Total protein recoveries from the preserved samples were lower than the frozen control due to processing losses, which could be corrected for with internal standardization. The trichloroacetic acid preserved sample showed significant loss of protein band integrity on the SDS-PAGE gel. The RNAlater preserved sample showed the highest number of protein identifications (103% relative to the control; 520 31 identifications in RNAlater versus 504 +/- 4 in the control), equivalent to the frozen control. Relative abundances of individual proteins in the RNAlater treatment were quite similar to that of the frozen control (average ratio of 1.01 +/- 0.27 for the 50 most abundant proteins), while the SDS-extraction buffer, ethanol, and B-PER all showed significant decreases in both number of identifications and relative abundances of individual proteins. Based on these findings, RNAlater was an effective proteome preservative, although further study is warranted on additional marine microbes.

AB A robust visual understanding of complex urban environments using passive optical sensors is an onerous and essential task for autonomous navigation. The problem is heavily characterized by the quality of the available dataset and the number of instances it includes. Regardless of the benchmark results of perception algorithms, a model would only be reliable and capable of enhanced decision making if the dataset covers the exact domain of the end-use case. For this purpose, in order to improve the level of instances in datasets used for the training and validation of Autonomous Vehicles (AV), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and autonomous driving, and to reduce the void due to the no-existence of any datasets in the context of railway smart mobility, we introduce our multimodal hybrid dataset called ESRORAD. ESRORAD is comprised of 34 videos, 2.7 k virtual images, and 100 k real images for both road and railway scenes collected in two Normandy towns, Rouen and Le Havre. All the images are annotated with 3D bounding boxes showing at least three different classes of persons, cars, and bicycles. Crucially, our dataset is the first of its kind with uncompromised efforts on being the best in terms of large volume, abundance in annotation, and diversity in scenes.

AB Autonomous mobile robots are a special class of robotic systems that can move a payload from one location to the other or perform a specific task. They allow efficient, precise, and streamlined workflow that makes human work less arduous. The market and research work related to these robots is increasing in anticipation of industry 5.0, where humans and machines are expected to co-exist and co-work. The future mobile robots are desired to have clean and cost-effective energy sources to have longer operation times and compliance with environmental requirements to allow application in diverse fields. The research on mechanical design, perception, navigation and control has carved out many commercially viable solutions for mobile robots. However, their widespread application is still limited due to the lack of efficient power systems for use in diverse and largely unknown/uncontrolled environments. The current power solutions incur high initial costs and require recharging or refuelling, which makes them unsuitable for unattended long-haul worktimes and cost-effective applications. These drawbacks are major hurdles in the wider applicability of terrain-based mobile robots to new domains and daily life scenarios, which are possible with the existing mechanical, perception, and control technologies. Keeping in view the need for advancement in this field and to gain a better understanding of the current state of the art and future directions, this work summarizes and reviews the energy solutions presented in the literature and used in notable commercially available terrainbased mobile robots. The provided solutions are categorized and discussed while the prospects and research gaps are also highlighted. A comparison of discussed power techniques is also provided, which can serve as a guideline for selecting a robot's energy source according to the desired requirements.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Air quality in many poultry buildings is less than desirable. However, the measurement of concentrations of airborne pollutants in livestock buildings is generally quite difficult. To counter this, the development of an autonomous robot that could collect key environmental data continuously in livestock buildings was initiated. This research presents a specific part of the larger study that focused on the preliminary laboratory test for evaluating the navigation precision of the robot being developed under the different ground surface conditions and different localization algorithm according internal sensors. The construction of the robot was such that each wheel of the robot was driven by an independent DC motor with four odometers fixed on each motor. The inertial measurement unit (IMU) was rigidly fixed on the robot vehicle platform. The research focused on using the internal sensors to calculate the robot position (x, y, theta) through three different methods. The first method relied only on odometer dead reckoning (ODR), the second method was the combination of odometer and gyroscope data dead reckoning (OGDR) and the last method was based on Kalman filter data fusion algorithm (KFDF). A series of tests were completed to generate the robot's trajectory and analyse the localisation accuracy. These tests were conducted on different types of surfaces and path profiles. The results proved that the ODR calculation of the position of the robot is inaccurate due to the cumulative errors and the large deviation of the heading angle estimate. However, improved use of the gyroscope data of the IMU sensor improved the accuracy of the robot heading angle estimate. The KFDF calculation resulted in a better heading angle estimate than the ODR or OGDR calculations. The ground type was also found to be an influencing factor of localisation errors.

AB Trace metal micronutrients are integral to the functioning of marine ecosystems and the export of particulate carbon to the deep ocean. Although much progress has been made in mapping the distributions of metal micronutrients throughout the ocean over the last 30 years, there remain information gaps, most notable during seasonal transitions and in remote regions. The next challenge is to develop in situ sensing technologies necessary to capture the spatial and temporal variabilities of micronutrients characterized with short residence times, highly variable source terms, and sub-nanomolar concentrations in open ocean settings. Such an effort will allow investigation of the biogeochemical processes at the necessary resolution to constrain fluxes, residence times, and the biological and chemical responses to varying metal inputs in a changing ocean. Here, we discuss the current state of the art and analytical challenges associated with metal micronutrient determinations and highlight existing and emerging technologies, namely in situ chemical analyzers, electrochemical sensors, passive preconcentration samplers, and autonomous trace metal clean samplers, which could form the basis of autonomous observing systems for trace metals within the next decade. We suggest that several existing assets can already be deployed in regions of enhanced metal concentrations and argue that, upon further development, a combination of wet chemical analyzers with electrochemical sensors may provide the best compromise between analytical precision, detection limits, metal speciation, and longevity for autonomous open ocean determinations. To meet this goal, resources must be invested to: (1) improve the sensitivity of existing sensors including the development of novel chemical assays; (2) reduce sensor size and power requirements; (3) develop an open-source "Do-It-Yourself" infrastructure to facilitate sensor development, uptake by end-users and foster a mechanism by which scientists can rapidly adapt commercially available technologies to in situ applications; and (4) develop a community-led standardized protocol to demonstrate the endurance and comparability of in situ sensor data with established techniques. Such a vision will be best served through ongoing collaborations between trace metal geochemists, analytical chemists, the engineering community, and commercial partners, which will accelerate the delivery of new technologies for in situ metal sensing in the decade following OceanObs'19.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS

DT Review
DE Power line inspection; Vision-based inspection; Deep learning; UAVs
AB To maintain the reliability, availability, and sustainability of electricity supply, electricity companies regularly perform visual inspections on their transmission and distribution networks. These inspections have been typically carried out using foot patrol and/or helicopter-assisted methods to plan for necessary repair or replacement works before any major damage, which may cause power outage. This solution is quite slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous. In recent years, numerous researches have been conducted to automate the visual inspections by using automated helicopters, flying robots, and/or climbing robots. However, due to the high accuracy requirements of the task and its unique challenges, automatic vision-based inspection has not been widely adopted. In this paper, with the aim of providing a good starting point for researchers who are interested in developing a fully automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system, we conduct an extensive literature review. First, we examine existing power line inspection methods with special attention paid to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we summarize well-suited tasks and review potential data sources for automatic vision-based inspection. Then, we survey existing automatic vision-based power line inspection systems. Based on that, we propose a new automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection concept that uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of data analysis and inspection. Then, we present an overview of possibilities and challenges of deep vision (deep learning for computer vision) approaches for both UAV navigation and UAV inspection and discuss possible solutions to the challenges. Finally, we conclude the paper with an outlook for the future of this field and propose potential next steps for implementing the concept.

ID PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB Purpose In path tracking, pure pursuit (PP) has great superiority due to its simple control. However, when in agricultural applications, the performance and accuracy of PP are not so well; it cannot be tracked in time has slow convergence, and low tracking accuracy. Furthermore, in some severe driving scenarios, PP is insufficient to convey the effects of the tracking error. This paper aims to propose an autonomous driving controller to improve the PP model based on heading error rate (Improved PP-improved search strategy ant colony optimization [ISSACO]). Design/methodology/approach First, the heading error rate is added as the control method in the PP model. Second, the predicted heading error was selected as the objective function; the ISSACO is used to obtain the minimum value of the predicted heading error. A PP controller is integrated with the heading error rate by ISSACO to better deal with tracking error by trading off between PP and heading error rate. Third, the ISSACO was used to obtain the optimal values of PP and heading error rate weight. Finally, the error feedback adaptive dynamic adjustment of the improved algorithm is realized to reduce the convergence time and tracking error. Findings The proposed method was tested on a four-wheeled vehicle robot, and the effectiveness of its convergence was proved. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the tracking error, increase convergence, then improve the robot's working quality. Originality/value An adaptive improved PP path tracking control is proposed, which considers both heading error rate and parameter uncertainties. The new autonomous controller has a simple structure and is easy to implement. It can be adjusted according to the path tracking status to improve the adaptability of the system.

AB Designing 5G networks and related applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cellular and autonomous vehicular networks (AVNET) is a challenge. Indeed, these networks are subjected to a number of constraints that play a crucial role in the network's quality of service (QoS). Among these constraints, we have the management of computing, storage, bandwidth resources and low latency requirements. If in the past cloud computing has been used to avoid networks being affected by some of the previous constraints, that technology negatively affects the low latency requirements required by AVNETs for example. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has recently emerged as a palliative solution to cloud computing. MEC aims to bring computing and storage resources from Cloud Data Center to Edge Data Center nearer to the User Equipment (UEs) in order to reduce the UEs' requests latency for an improvement of the network's QoS. Many MEC architectures have been proposed for AVNET. These solutions make use of Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Service Function Chaining (SFC) or Network Slicing (NS) technologies. Some of these techniques combine partially these technologies while others do not. But to the best of our knowledge, none of them combines all these technologies to obtain a better QoS. In this paper, we combine the SDN, NFV, SFC and NS technologies to efficiently manage the MEC server resources for guaranteeing the QoS requirements in AVNETs. The QoS parameters we consider are latency, computing, storage and bandwidth resources. In that way, we first present a MEC server mathematical resource management model, then, we propose a new MEC architecture adapted to AVNETs that uses the aforementioned technologies also as the mathematical model we first present to manage the bandwidth, computing, and storage resources. The simulation results show that these resources are well managed, resulting to a low end to end latency for autonomous vehicles (AVs) requests executing on edge/cloud servers when the direct communication of AVs with cloud server takes long end to end delays, ensuring a better QoS for the AVNET.

AB This paper discusses enabling autonomous mobile robots to operate in unstructured terrain and environments and gather data in a time-efficient manner. In rugged environments such as construction sites and disaster sites, spatiotemporal data is difficult to acquire since these environments are potentially hazardous to humans. Autonomous robot systems represent a reasonable solution to provide topographic and surveillance data that can assist human activity in these environments, whether for exploration, mapping, or search and rescue. However, automatically operating the mobile laser scanning robots at cluttered environments is challenging because as-is geometrical conditions of the site are difficult to comprehend from the ground level due to the blocked line-of site views. To address the issue, this paper introduces a new framework for operating mobile robots equipped with a laser scanning system in cluttered outdoor environments with the aid of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To obtain an initial map from the current field, this method first deploys UAV to collect photographic images of a site and builds a point cloud of a3D terrain of the site including obstacle information. A voxel grid is then created from the UAV-generated point cloud, and simulation for laser scan planning is conducted to determine the stationary laser scan positions at which a mobile robot can collect data with less occluded views while capturing crucial geometric information as much as it can. Finally, optimal paths for the mobile robot to navigate among the estimated scan positions are generated. Promising test results were obtained from a real world outdoor structural material test yard as an example of a cluttered environment. It is expected that the proposed UAV-assisted robotic approach can significantly reduce human intervention and time for data collection and processing and provide technologies to enable cluttered environments to be frequently monitored, updated, and analyzed to support timely decision-making.

ID FAULT-TREE ANALYSIS
AB The use of autonomous systems is becoming increasingly common in many fields. A significant example of this is the ambition to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for both civil and military applications. In order for autonomous systems such as these to operate effectively, they must be capable of making decisions regarding the appropriate future course of their mission responding to changes in circumstance in as short a time as possible. The systems will typically perform phased missions and, owing to the uncertain nature of the environments in which the systems operate, the mission objectives may be subject to change at short notice. The ability to evaluate the different possible mission configurations is crucial in making the right decision about the mission tasks that should be performed in order to give the highest possible probability of mission success.
   Because binary decision diagrams (BDDs) may be quickly and accurately quantified to give measures of the system reliability it is anticipated that they are the most appropriate analysis tools to form the basis of a reliability-based prognostics methodology. The current paper presents a new BDD-based approach for phased mission analysis, which seeks to take advantage of the proven fast analysis characteristics of the BDD and enhance it in ways that are suited to the demands of a decision-making capability for autonomous systems. The BDD approach presented allows BDDs representing the failure causes in the different phases of a mission to be constructed quickly by treating component failures in different phases of the mission as separate variables. This allows flexibility when building mission phase failure BDDs because a global variable ordering scheme is not required. An alternative representation of component states in time intervals allows the dependencies to be efficiently dealt with during the quantification process. Nodes in the BDD can represent components with any number of failure modes or factors external to the system that could affect its behaviour, such as the weather. Path simplification rules and quantification rules are developed that allow the calculation of phase failure probabilities for this new BDD approach. The proposed method provides a phased mission analysis technique that allows the rapid construction of reliability models for phased missions and, with the use of BDDs, rapid quantification.

TI On the accuracy potential of focused plenoptic camera range
   determination in long distance operation
SO ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING

DT Article
DE Plenoptic camera; Light field; Range image; Accuracy
AB Plenoptic cameras have found increasing interest in optical 3D measurement techniques in recent years. While their basic principle is 100 years old, the development in digital photography, micro-lens fabrication technology and computer hardware has boosted the development and lead to several commercially available ready-to-use cameras. Beyond their popular option of a posteriori image focusing or total focus image generation, their basic ability of generating 3D information from single camera imagery depicts a very beneficial option for certain applications.
   The paper will first present some fundamentals on the design and history of plenoptic cameras and will describe depth determination from plenoptic camera image data. It will then present an analysis of the depth determination accuracy potential of plenoptic cameras. While most research on plenoptic camera accuracy so far has focused on close range applications, we will focus on mid and long ranges of up to 100 m. This range is especially relevant, if plenoptic cameras are discussed as potential mono-sensorial range imaging devices in (semi-)autonomous cars or in mobile robotics.
   The results show the expected deterioration of depth measurement accuracy with depth. At depths of 30-100 m, which may be considered typical in autonomous driving, depth errors in the order of 3% (with peaks up to 10-13 m) were obtained from processing small point clusters on an imaged target. Outliers much higher than these values were observed in single point analysis, stressing the necessity of spatial or spatio-temporal filtering of the plenoptic camera depth measurements. Despite these obviously large errors, a plenoptic camera may nevertheless be considered a valid option for the application fields of real-time robotics like autonomous driving or unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles, where the accuracy requirements decrease with distance.

AB Traditional mapping of bedforms in submarine canyons relied on vessel-mounted and towed sensors, but their fine-scale geomorphology and shallow structure requires higher resolution datasets. This study utilizes a high-resolution dataset obtained from an autonomous underwater vehicle, combined with seismic reflection profiles and sediment cores, to analyse bedform sets within a 25.6 km long submarine canyon (canyon C14) in the northern South China Sea. A train of crescent-shaped axial steps, indicative of cyclic steps formed by supercritical turbidity currents, is imaged along the canyon. Axial steps in the upper course show erosional truncations and sub-horizontal reflectors on the lee and stoss sides, respectively, pointing to erosional-depositional cyclic steps formed by confined flows with high erosional capacity. This is facilitated by canyon narrowness and steeper axial gradient. After a transition segment, the lower course widens, with a gentler axial gradient, resulting in increased asymmetry and wavelength of axial steps. Backset bed deposits on the stoss sides of these steps indicate depositional cyclic steps with higher aggradation. Sediment filling, almost padding each cyclic step associated scour suggests the reworking of previously formed bedforms by gravity flows fed by destabilization processes on the canyon sidewalls and upstream lee faces and, possibly, by shelf-edge and uppermost slope spillover into the canyon. At the lowermost course, cyclic steps transition to a furrow field, likely associated with flow velocity reduction facilitated by canyon floor widening and a further decrease in slope gradient. Flow braiding and re-convergence, related to the erosion of fine-grained deposits within the canyon floor, should have played a role to produce furrows under supercritical conditions. This work enhances our understanding of the detailed morphology and shallow relief configuration of bedforms in deep-water submarine canyons, providing insights into their causative processes and evolution.

AB This paper proposes a strategy for visual perception in the context of autonomous driving. Humans, when not distracted or drunk, are still the best drivers you can currently find. For this reason, we take inspiration from two theoretical ideas about the human mind and its neural organization. The first idea concerns how the brain uses structures of neuron ensembles that expand and compress information to extract abstract concepts from visual experience and code them into compact representations. The second idea suggests that these neural perceptual representations are not neutral but functional to predicting the future state of affairs in the environment. Similarly, the prediction mechanism is not neutral but oriented to the planning of future action. We identify within the deep learning framework two artificial counterparts of the aforementioned neurocognitive theories. We find a correspondence between the first theoretical idea and the architecture of convolutional autoencoders, while we translate the second theory into a training procedure that learns compact representations which are not neutral but oriented to driving tasks, from two distinct perspectives. From a static perspective, we force separate groups of neural units in the compact representations to represent specific concepts crucial to the driving task distinctly. From a dynamic perspective, we bias the compact representations to predict how the current road scenario will change in the future. We successfully learn compact representations that use as few as 16 neural units for each of the two basic driving concepts we consider: cars and lanes. We maintain the two concepts separated in the latent space to facilitate the interpretation and manipulation of the perceptual representations.

AB In modern engineering, weld joint excellence achieved through competent and on-line welding imperfections monitoring techniques. Online weld joint examination by non-destructive testing significantly demanded in vehicle, railways, aerospace, petrochemical, oil, gas, land transportation, shipbuilding, and marine industries. These industries demanded weld imperfection inspection as major part of their testing as physical inspection may confuse for appropriate justifications and lead to incorrect identifications. Hence, for error free examination automatic weld, this work proposed an autonomous technique for multi class weld imperfections namely crack, undercut, gas pores, porosity, slag, warm holes, lack of penetration and non defects are detected and classified in X- ray images by employing support vector machine and artificial neural network and confirm their high-performance accuracy. The proposed methods incorporated mainly four modules. In the first module weld image preprocess by median filtering to achieve protective edge of weld image by suppressing noises and by rectangular shaped histogram for dispersal grey levels to wider range with a brightness gradient achieved. Furthermore, second module propose canny edge operator to achieved complete and more continues edge of weld defect as compared to other edge operators. In the third module, ten texture feature extracted by grey level co-occurrence matrix. Moreover, cluster of signifiers identical to texture features measurements extract separated entity and stated as an input classifier. Finally for speedy advances of weld imperfection detection mechanization, support vector machine and artificial neural network detected and classified weld imperfections and confirmed their accuracy performance of 98.75 and 97.5% by confusion matrix. The autonomous technique for detection and classification of X-ray images reveals ideal calculation time without disturbing complete accuracy of features selection and presented comprehensive innovative technique with improved results.

AB The focus of this work is to analyze the behavior of an autonomous swarm, in which only the leader or a dedicated set of agents can take intelligent decisions with other agents just reacting to the information that is received by those dedicated agents, when the swarm comes across stationary or dynamic obstacles. An energy-aware information management algorithm is proposed to avoid over-sensation in order to optimize the sensing energy based on the amount of information obtained from the environment. The information that is needed from each agent is determined by the swarm's self-awareness in the space domain, i.e., its self-localization characteristics. A swarm of drones as a multi-agent system is considered to be a distributed wireless sensor network that is able to share information inside the swarm and make decisions accordingly. The proposed algorithm reduces the power that is consumed by individual agents due to the use of ranging sensors for observing the environment for safe navigation. This is because only the leader or a dedicated set of agents will turn on their sensors and observe the environment, whereas other agents in the swarm will only be listening to their leader's translated coordinates and the whereabouts of any detected obstacles w.r.t. the leader. Instead of systematically turning on the sensors to avoid potential collisions with moving obstacles, the follower agents themselves decide on when to turn on their sensors, resulting in further reduction of overall power consumption of the whole swarm. The simulation results show that the swarm maintains the desired formation and efficiently avoids collisions with encountered obstacles, based on the cross-referencing feedback between the swarm agents.

AB Aim: Vanilloids like capsaicin and resiniferatoxin (RTX) have been used for more than a decade in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity. Recently, the vanilloid molecule piperine (PIP) has been shown to have similar pharmacological properties as these drugs. in this study, we looked at PIP-effects on autonomous bladder contractile activity, with particular interest for its selectivity for the transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPV1) receptor. Additionally, we studied the role of TRPV1 in volume-induced contractile changes using selective and non-selective TRPV1 antagonists. Methods: The acute and prolonged effects of PIP were studied on rat bladders. Each bladder was excised and placed in a heated organ bath, where intravesical pressures were measured. in acute experiments, PIP was added directly to the bathing solution. For prolonged effects, animals were pretreated intravesically with vehicle (ethanol 5%) or PIP (10(-4) M) and sacrificed 72 hr later. The effects of selective (capsazepine (CZP)) and non-selective (ruthenium red (RR)) TRPV1 antagonists on volume-evoked contractile parameters were also studied. Results: Acute administration of PIP 10(-4) M significantly increased amplitude of bladder contractions (p < 0.05). These effects were significantly antagonized (p < 0.05) by the TRPV1-selective antagonist CZP (10(-5) M) and the non-selective TRP-antagonist RR (10(-5) M). Intravesical pre-treatment with PIP induced shorter contractions with more periods of non-activity (p < 0.05) compared to controls. Inhibition of TRPV1 with CZP and RR significantly reduced the volume-evoked rise in contractile amplitude in isolated bladders (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We found evidence for acute and prolonged effects of PIP on bladder contractility, which seem to be mediated through TRPV1. Furthermore, we found evidence for involvement of TRPV1 in afferent signaling of mechanical stimuli.

AB Modern computer vision requires processing large amounts of data, both while training the model and/or during inference, once the model is deployed. Scenarios where images are captured and processed in physically separated locations are increasingly common (e.g. autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, smartphones). In addition, many devices suffer from limited resources to store or transmit data (e.g. storage space, channel capacity). In these scenarios, lossy image compression plays a crucial role to effectively increase the number of images collected under such constraints. However, lossy compression entails some undesired degradation of the data that may harm the performance of the downstream analysis task at hand, since important semantic information may be lost in the process. Moreover, we may only have compressed images at training time but are able to use original images at inference time (i.e. test), or vice versa, and in such a case, the downstream model suffers from covariate shift. In this paper, we analyze this phenomenon, with a special focus on vision-based perception for autonomous driving as a paradigmatic scenario. We see that loss of semantic information and covariate shift do indeed exist, resulting in a drop in performance that depends on the compression rate. In order to address the problem, we propose dataset restoration, based on image restoration with generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our method is agnostic to both the particular image compression method and the downstream task; and has the advantage of not adding additional cost to the deployed models, which is particularly important in resource-limited devices. The presented experiments focus on semantic segmentation as a challenging use case, cover a broad range of compression rates and diverse datasets, and show how our method is able to significantly alleviate the negative effects of compression on the downstream visual task.

AB This article investigates the adaptive fuzzy output-feedback path-following control of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) via the event-triggered mechanism, in which the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are employed to approximate the uncertainties. By transforming the estimation errors, an adaptive fuzzy observer is established to estimate the kinematic states of the ASV, and a serial-parallel estimation model is fabricated based on this observer. By combining the tracking errors with the prediction errors between the observer and the serial-parallel estimation model, the composite adaptive laws are devised for the weights of the FLSs. Then, the event-triggered controller is developed in the channel of sensor to controller, in which the estimated kinematic states, the positional coordinates, and the heading angle of the ASV are sampled only when the triggering condition is violated. In this article, we put forward the problem of "jumps of virtual control laws" at the triggering instants, which commonly exists in the backstepping-based event-triggered control (ETC) in the channel of sensor to controller. To solve this problem, the dynamic surface filters are employed to generate the continuous substitutes for the virtual control laws. The proposed scheme can guarantee at least the similar control performance compared with its continuous alternatives while it importantly reduces the communication burden through the ETC and can enhance the estimation accuracy of the observer by applying the composite learning. All the errors are ensured to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded in the closed-loop system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through the numerical experiment.

AB We propose a high-resolution imaging radar system to enable high-fidelity four-dimensional (4D) sensing for autonomous driving, i.e., range, Doppler, azimuth, and elevation, through a joint sparsity design in frequency spectrum and array configurations. To accommodate a high number of automotive radars operating at the same frequency band while avoiding mutual interference, random sparse step-frequency waveform (RSSFW) is proposed to synthesize a large effective bandwidth to achieve high range resolution profiles. To mitigate high range sidelobes in RSSFW radars, optimal weights are designed to minimize the peak sidelobe level such that targets with a relatively small radar cross section are detectable without introducing high probability of false alarm. We extend the RSSFW concept to multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar by applying phase codes along slow time to synthesize a two-dimensional (2D) sparse array with hundreds of virtual array elements to enable high-resolution direction finding in both azimuth and elevation. The 2D sparse array acts as a sub-Nyquist sampler of the corresponding uniform rectangular array (URA) with half-wavelength interelement spacing, and the corresponding URA response is recovered by completing a low-rank block Hankel matrix. Consequently, the high sidelobes in the azimuth and elevation spectra are greatly suppressed so that weak targets can be reliably detected. The proposed imaging radar provides point clouds with a resolution comparable to LiDAR but with a much lower cost. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed 4D imaging radar system with joint sparsity in frequency spectrum and antenna arrays.

AB Driven by technological advances and economic gain, society's electronic systems are becoming larger, faster, more decentralized and autonomous, and yet with increasing global reach. A prime example are the networks of financial markets which-in contrast to popular perception-are largely all-electronic and decentralized with no top-down real-time controller. This prototypical system generates complex subsecond dynamics that emerge from a decentralized network comprising heterogeneous hardware and software components, communications links, and a diverse ecology of trading algorithms that operate and compete within this all-electronics environment. Indeed, these same technological and economic drivers are likely to generate a similarly competitive all-electronic ecology in a variety of future cyberphysical domains such as e-commerce, defense and the transportation system, including the likely appearance of large numbers of autonomous vehicles on the streets of many cities. Hence there is an urgent need to deepen our understanding of stability, safety and security across a wide range of ultrafast, large, decentralized all-electronic systems-in short, society will eventually need to understand what extreme behaviors can occur, why, and what might be the impact of both intentional and unintentional system perturbations. Here we set out a framework for addressing this issue, using a generic model of heterogeneous, adaptive, autonomous components where each has a realistic limit on the amount of information and processing power available to it. We focus on the specific impact of delayed information, possibly through an accidental shift in the latency of information transmission, or an intentional attack from the outside. While much remains to be done in terms of developing formal mathematical results for this system, our preliminary results indicate the type of impact that can occur and the structure of a mathematical theory which may eventually describe it.

AB Automated driving systems are rapidly developing. However, numerous open problems remain to be resolved to ensure this technology progresses before its widespread adoption. A large subset of these problems are, or can be framed as, statistical decision problems. Therefore, we present herein several important statistical challenges that emerge when designing and operating automated driving systems. In particular, we focus on those that relate to request-to-intervene decisions, ethical decision support, operations in heterogeneous traffic, and algorithmic robustification. For each of these problems, earlier solution approaches are reviewed and alternative solutions are provided with accompanying empirical testing. We also highlight open avenues of inquiry for which applied statistical investigation can help ensure the maturation of automated driving systems. In so doing, we showcase the relevance of statistical research and practice within the context of this revolutionary technology.

AB In the new era of the U.S.-China strategic rivalry, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is attempting to transform itself into a world class defense unit by constructing a self-organizing system of defense innovation. Translating its global lead in digitization and economic achievements into military power will entail the integration of critical and emerging technology into its existing weapon clusters and processes, the fielding of new and modified equipment, and the reinforcement of industrial applications such as robotics and autonomous vehicles. Building on developments in the PLA's reform and modernization, this study conducts a systemic examination of China's intelligentization strategy to prevail in the 4th Industrial Revolution (4IR). Hard and soft inputs that shape China's ecosystem of defense-innovation, including material, financial, and technological inputs, process factors of plans, strategies, and acquisition, and institutional factors have been examined.

AB Automated warehousing systems need to balance operational efficiency, energy consumption and overall system cost in sustainable supply chains. This paper presents an analytical model-based Decision Support System (DSS) for sustainable system design of Shuttle-Based Storage and Retrieval System (SBS/RS). Multiple system design indicators, namely mean service time, mean energy consumption, and overall system cost, are considered in a mathematical model. A simulation model is developed to validate the accuracy of the mathematical model. Extensive numerical experiments explore the impacts of rack design and equipment operating parameters on various system performance indicators and summarize balanced equipment operating settings. Overall, this study provides an analytical-model based DSS on sustainable SBS/RS configurations for decision-making managers and system designers.

AB A fundamental task for mobile robots is simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Moreover, long-term robustness is an important property for SLAM. When vehicles or robots steer fast or steer in certain scenarios, such as low-texture environments, long corridors, tunnels, or other duplicated structural environments, most SLAM systems might fail. In this paper, we propose a novel robust visual inertial light detection and ranging (LiDaR) navigation (VILN) SLAM system, including stereo visual-inertial LiDaR odometry and visual-LiDaR loop closure. The proposed VILN SLAM system can perform well with low drift after long-term experiments, even when the LiDaR or visual measurements are degraded occasionally in complex scenes. Extensive experimental results show that the robustness has been greatly improved in various scenarios compared to state-of-the-art SLAM systems.

AB For the interaction between marine robots and divers in the underwater environment, a method of diver's gesture recognition and segmentation is proposed. This method first uses the progressive growing training method to optimize the generative adversarial networks, generating high-resolution images with complex content. Then, we use the generative adversarial network model as a data augmentation method and generate high-resolution images. We make the masks of gestures in the new dataset and use the mask R-CNN algorithm for gesture recognition and gesture segmentation. The experimental results show that the generating data improves the accuracy of several object recognition algorithms but cannot completely replace the original data and the mean average precision of gesture recognition is 0.85. The visualization shows the validity and weakness of segmentation.

AB Naive Bayes (NB) is a well-known probabilistic classification algorithm. It is a simple but efficient algorithm with a wide variety of real-world applications, ranging from product recommendations through medical diagnosis to controlling autonomous vehicles. Due to the failure of real data satisfying the assumptions of NB, there are available variations of NB to cater general data. With the unique applications for each variation of NB, they reach different levels of accuracy. This manuscript surveys the latest applications of NB and discusses its variations in different settings. Furthermore, recommendations are made regarding the applicability of NB while exploring the robustness of the algorithm. Finally, an attempt is given to discuss the pros and cons of NB algorithm and some vulnerabilities, with related computing code for implementation.

AB In an intelligent smart city like Sejong city in Korea, automatic and smart software is absolutely necessary for autonomous traffic and vehicles control systems. Therefore, these systems need to have an accurate and timely performance; otherwise, safety issues may arise. To resolve this, we propose our code visualization approach to adapt an object-oriented smart traffic control simulator, which analyzes Java code's complexity and identifies bad codes against performance. To achieve an accurate performance, we must repeatedly perform refactoring until attaining a range of system-defined performances through effective code visualization. As a result, we enhance the code complexity of the cyber-physical system-based software to achieve the exact performance. With this approach, we expect to obtain an accurate performance and complexity improvement of the object-oriented traffic control simulator without significant power consumption.

AB Semantic segmentation using deep neural networks has been widely explored to generate high-level contextual information for autonomous vehicles. To acquire a complete 180. semantic understanding of the forward surroundings, we propose to stitch semantic images from multiple cameras with varying orientations. However, previously trained semantic segmentation models showed unacceptable performance after significant changes to the camera orientations and the lighting conditions. To avoid time-consuming hand labeling, we explore and evaluate the use of data augmentation techniques, specifically skew and gamma correction, from a practical real-world standpoint to extend the existing model and provide more robust performance. The experimental results presented have shown significant improvements with varying illumination and camera perspective changes. A comparison of the results from a high-performance network (PSPNet), and a real-time capable network (ENet) is provided.

DE Path planning for multiple mobile robots or agents; collision avoidance;

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB Safe autonomous navigation of microair vehicles in cluttered dynamic environments is challenging due to the uncertainties arising from robot localization, sensing, and motion disturbances. This letter presents a probabilistic collision avoidance method for navigation among other robots and moving obstacles, such as humans. The approach explicitly considers the collision probability between each robot and obstacle and formulates a chance constrained nonlinear model predictive control problem (CCNMPC). A tight bound for approximation of collision probability is developed, which makes the CCNMPC formulation tractable and solvable in real time. For multirobot coordination, we describe three approaches, one distributed without communication (constant velocity assumption), one distributed with communication (of previous plans), and one centralized (sequential planning). We evaluate the proposed method in experiments with two quadrotors sharing the space with two humans and verify the multirobot coordination strategy in simulation with up to sixteen quadrotors.

AB In this paper, we target solving the data gathering problem in underwater wireless sensor networks. In many underwater applications, it is not quick to retrieve sensed data, which gives us the opportunity to leverage mobile autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) as data mules to periodically collect it. For each round of data gathering, the AUV visits part of the sensors, and the communication between AUV and sensor nodes is a novel high-speed magnetic-induction communication system. The rest of the sensors acoustically transmit their sensed data to the AUV-visit sensors. This paper deploys the HAS(4) (Heuristic Adaptive Sink Sensor Set Selection) algorithm to select the AUV-visited sensors for the purpose of energy saving, AUV cost reduction and network lifetime prolonging. By comparing HAS(4) with two benchmark selection methods, experiment results demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve a better performance.

ID MODEL
AB Underwater gliders, which are profiling autonomous underwater vehicles designed to make oceanographic measurements, are increasingly used in the coastal ocean. As they regularly surface for data transmission, gliders increasingly pose a risk for fast ships. In order to estimate the extent of damage due to collision, 3D finite element simulations of collisions between a glider and a high-speed craft with a glass-fiber reinforced plastic hull are performed. Different collision scenarios such as impact locations, angles of attack and speeds are examined. The results are compared to an analytical solution based on simplifying assumptions. Although both methods reveal consistent results, it is shown that finite element simulations are required to account for the 3D shape of the ship. The results indicate that at ship velocities exceeding 7.5 m/s (14.6 kt) the glider penetrates the ship's hull causing severe damage to its structure.

AB This paper describes one of the challenging issues implied by scientific infrastructures on a mobile robot cognition architecture. For a generally applicable cognition architecture, we study the dependencies and logical relations between several tasks and subsystems. The overall view of the software modules is described, including their relationship with a fault management module that monitors the consistency of the data flow among the modules. The fault management module is the solution of the deliberative architecture for the single point failures, and the safety anchor is the reactive solution for the faults by redundant equipment. In addition, a hardware architecture is proposed to ensure safe robot movement as a redundancy for the cognition of the robot. The method is designed for a four-wheel steerable (4WS) mobile manipulator (iMoro) as a case study.

AB In this paper, a new algorithm for semi-autonomous Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems is proposed for collaborative driving based on the use of agent technology and information sharing. The proposed Effective CACC (ECACC) algorithm consists of speed and distance control algorithms and a combined acceleration/deceleration control law. The efficacy and performance of the algorithm has been evaluated in highways for various flow rates and traffic conditions using microscopic traffic simulation. It is shown that the proposed ECACC algorithm provides superior performance on traffic dynamics than scenarios without it. The results show significance and indicate the potential of ECACC systems to improve traffic characteristics, which can be used to reduce traffic congestion. This impact is higher when the market penetration rate of ECACC-equipped vehicles increases.

AB In this study, a distributed model reference adaptive control architecture is developed to achieve the cooperative tracking of uncertain dynamical multi-agent systems, where the reference model serves as a virtual leader for the group to track. Two adaptive laws, with one adjusting the coupling weights and the other adjusting the neural network weights, are designed based on the relative state information of neighbouring agents. The proposed controller guarantees that the state of each agent synchronizes to that of the reference model over any undirected connected communication graphs, and all signals in the closed-loop network are uniformly ultimately bounded. In contrast to the existing results, the developed controller can be implemented in a fully distributed manner by each agent without using any global information and the accurate model of each agent. An extension to asymptotic stability is further studied.

AB In agriculture, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have shown great potential for plant protection. Uncertain obstacles randomly distributed in the unstructured farmland usually pose significant collision risks to flight safety. In order to improve the UAV's intelligence and minimize the obstacle's adverse impacts on operating safety and efficiency, we put forward a comprehensive solution which consists of deep-learning based object detection, image processing, RGB-D information fusion and Task Control System (TCS). Taking full advantages of both deep learning and depth camera, this solution allows the UAV to perceive not only the presence of obstacles, but also their attributes like category, profile and 3D spatial position. Based on the object detection results, collision avoidance strategy generation method and the corresponding calculation approach of optimal collision avoidance flight path are elaborated detailly. A series of experiments are conducted to verify the UAV's environmental perception ability and autonomous obstacle avoidance performance. Results show that the average detection accuracy of CNN model is 75.4% and the mean time cost for processing single image is 53.33 ms. Additionally, we find that the prediction accuracy of obstacle's profile and position depends heavily on the relative distance between the object and the depth camera. When the distance is between 4.5 m and 8.0 m, errors of object's depth data, width and height are -0.53 m, -0.26 m and -0.24 m respectively. Outcomes of simulation flight experiments indicated that the UAV can autonomously determine optimal obstacle avoidance strategy and generate distance-minimized flight path based on the results of RGB-D information fusion. The proposed solution has extensive potential to enhance the UAV's environmental perception and autonomous obstacle avoidance abilities.

AB In this study, we propose a fuzzy logic-based autonomous car control system and its deployment into the JavaScript Racer game. The main design goal of the self-driving car control system is to end up with an intelligent vehicle control system that is capable to keep the car finish race in the shortest time as possible while keeping the car on the road course regardless the road conditions. To accomplish such a design goal, the proposed intelligent driving system takes up and merges the frameworks of control theory, fuzzy logic and image processing. The proposed structure is composed of vision-based lane detection system, fuzzy logic-based position reference (FPR) generator, fuzzy logic-based velocity reference (FVR) generator, low level position and velocity controllers. The vision-based lane detection system solves the road curve estimation problem in real time and provides this estimation feedback for the FPR and FVR to generate appropriate position and velocity reference signals. The design of the intelligent FPR and FVR generators is accomplished by converting expert knowledge into fuzzy rules. The generated reference signals from the FPR and FVR are then tracked by low level position and velocity controllers. The proposed structure is capable to percept the environment (i.e. road tracking), make decisions (reference signal generation) and control car dynamics (i.e. speed and position) as expected from an autonomous system. The paper presents the structure and design of the intelligent driving system by providing all the design steps in detail. The efficiency of the fuzzy logic-based car control system is shown with results collected from the game environment. It is revealed that the developed intelligent system can successfully operate in various racetracks and different operating points.

AB Space robotics has a substantial interest in achieving on-orbit satellite servicing operations autonomously, e.g. rendezvous and docking/berthing (RVD) with customer and malfunctioning satellites. An on-orbit servicing vehicle requires the ability to estimate the position and attitude in situations whenever the targets are uncooperative. Such situation comes up when the target is damaged. In this context, this work presents a robust autonomous pose system applied to RVD missions. Our approach is based on computer vision, using a single camera and some previous knowledge of the target, i.e. the customer spacecraft. A rendezvous analysis mission tool for autonomous service satellite has been developed and presented, for far maneuvers, e.g. distance above 1 km from the target, and close maneuvers. The far operations consist of orbit transfer using the Lambert formulation. The close operations include the inspection phase (during which the pose estimation is computed) and the final approach phase. Our approach is based on the Lambert problem for far maneuvers and the Hill equations are used to simulate and analyze the approaching and final trajectory between target and chase during the last phase of the rendezvous operation. A method for optimally estimating the relative orientation and position between camera system and target is presented in detail. The target is modelled as an assembly of points. The pose of the target is represented by dual quaternion in order to develop a simple quadratic error function in such a way that the pose estimation task becomes a least square minimization problem. The problem of pose is solved and some methods of non-linear square optimization (Newton, Newton-Gauss, and Levenberg-Marquard) are compared and discussed in terms of accuracy and computational cost.

AB The autonomous shuttle and stacker crane (AC/SC) warehousing system, as a new automated deep-lane unit load storage/retrieval system, has been becoming more popular, especially for batch order fulfilment because of its high flexibility, low operational cost and improved storage capacity. This system consists of a shuttle sub-system that controls motion along the x-axis and a stacker crane sub-system that controls motion along the y-axis and z-axis. The combination of shuttles and a stacker crane performs storage and retrieval tasks. Modelling the parallel motion is an important design tool that can be used to calculate the optimal number of shuttles for a given configuration of the warehousing system. In this study, shuttle movements from one lane to another are inserted into the stock-keeping unit (SKU) task queue, and convert such that they are consistent with the retrieval tasks. The tasks are then grouped according to their starting lane, and converted to an assembly-line parallel job problem by analysing the operating mode with the objectives of minimising the total working time of the stacker crane and the wasted shuttle time. A time sequence mathematical model based on the motion of the shuttles and stacker crane is proposed, and an improved Pareto-optimal elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is used to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. The model is validated via a simulation study, and via a real-world warehousing case study. We go on to describe guidelines for the layout and configuration of AS/SC warehousing systems, including the optimal number of shuttles and number of x-axis storage cells of lanes, which can improve efficiency and minimise both capital investment and operating costs.

AB The coverage path planning (CPP) algorithms play a key role in autonomous robot applications, making area coverage operations efficient and cost-effective. The extension of coverage path planning algorithms to multi-robot operation is still widely unveiled despite the cyclical nature of agricultural operations, i.e., comprising repeated actions. The problem of coverage path planning for multi-robot operations is addressed in this paper. The three possible forms of multi-robot coverage algorithms evolved from the basic single-robot coverage algorithm based on the elementary trapezoidal method or zig-zag movements. Furthermore, an optimized coverage path planning algorithm for multiple in-row robots meant to control the weeding in an agricultural field is proposed. The parameters of the agricultural field are supposed to be known upfront, opening the application of an offline planning algorithm. The proposed algorithm stands tall in terms of distance covered with no repeated coverage compared with other possible solutions, nearing the results of single robot coverage (for which the planning is trivially simpler and there is no coverage repetition). Online adjustments in the multi-robot area coverage are also considered, and the proposed algorithm proves to be effective in simulation in this respect as well. The quantitative evaluation proves that, in the proposed algorithm with a team size of 15(n=15), the average distance consumed by each robot to cover the field taken for the study is only 65% of that of the other two algorithms. Also shows increase in the team size (n) leads to a decrease in consumption. This algorithm provides a solution for the autonomous operation of multi-robots to cover the fields with static obstacles at a regular pattern which is a common demand of many agricultural processes.

ID ANTHROPOMORPHISM; MIND
AB Much research in robotic artificial intelligence (AI) and Artificial Life has focused on autonomous agents as an embodied and situated approach to AI. Such systems are commonly viewed as overcoming many of the philosophical problems associated with traditional computationalist AI and cognitive science, such as the grounding problem (Harnad) or the lack of intentionality (Searle), because they have the physical and sensorimotor grounding that traditional AI was argued to lack. Robot lawn mowers and self-driving cars, for example, more or less reliably avoid obstacles, approach charging stations, and so on-and therefore might be considered to have some form of artificial intentionality or intentional directedness. It should be noted, though, that the fact that robots share physical environments with people does not necessarily mean that they are situated in the same perceptual and social world as humans. For people encountering socially interactive systems, such as social robots or automated vehicles, this poses the nontrivial challenge to interpret them as intentional agents to understand and anticipate their behavior but also to keep in mind that the intentionality of artificial bodies is fundamentally different from their natural counterparts. This requires, on one hand, a "suspension of disbelief " but, on the other hand, also a capacity for the "suspension of belief." This dual nature of (attributed) artificial intentionality has been addressed only rather superficially in embodied AI and social robotics research. It is therefore argued that Bourgine and Varela's notion of Artificial Life as the practice of autonomous systems needs to be complemented with a practice of socially interactive autonomous systems, guided by a better understanding of the differences between artificial and biological bodies and their implications in the context of social interactions between people and technology.

TI Underwater navigation with 2D forward looking SONAR: An adaptive

AB One of the most significant challenges in the underwater domain is to retrieve the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) position within the surrounding environment. Indeed, reliable navigation systems are fundamental to perform complex tasks and missions. Most of the navigation filters for AUVs are based on Bayesian estimators such as the linear Kalman Filter (KF), the extended KF, the unscented KF, or the particle filter where, usually, different instruments including a Doppler velocity log (DVL) contribute to the localization task. The usage of forward-looking SONARs (FLS) in navigation-aiding is, most of the time, devoted to limiting the navigation drift of the AUV by using simultaneous localization and mapping methods. Therefore, these devices are commonly employed with a standard navigation sensors set comprising an attitude heading reference system and a DVL. In this contribution, the authors propose a novel navigation strategy specifically tailored to AUVs based on an adaptive unscented KF, where linear speed estimations are obtained with a 2D FLS instead of with a DVL and therefore promoting the employment of FLSs as an aid for underwater navigation. The marine robotics community could gain significant benefits from reliable navigation achieved with an FLS-based navigation architecture. Most importantly, a single FLS can be used for imaging-related applications (i.e., sonograms acquisition) and navigation, where, instead, different dedicated devices are currently employed for the two tasks. Smaller AUVs usually possess reduced payload carrying capabilities; thus, multitasking use of onboard sensors, which leads to compactness, is a desirable feature. Navigation data obtained during sea trials performed in La Spezia (Italy) at the NATO STO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation has been used for offline validation. Afterward, the online results of real autonomous underwater missions undertaken in La Spezia (Italy) and at Vulcano Island, Messina (Italy), are reported.

AB New Findings What is the central question of this study? 3,5-Diiodothyronine (3,5-T2) administration increases resting metabolic rate, prevents or treats liver steatosis in rodent models, and ameliorates insulin resistance: what are its effects on cardiac electrical and contractile properties and autonomic regulation? What is the main finding and its importance? Chronic 3,5-T2 administration has no adverse effects on cardiac function. Remarkably, 3,5-T2 improves the autonomous control of the rat heart and protects against ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The use of 3,5,3 '-triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) to treat metabolic diseases has been hindered by potential adverse effects on liver, lipid metabolism and cardiac electrical properties. It is recognized that 3,5-diiodothyronine (3,5-T2) administration increases resting metabolic rate, prevents or treats liver steatosis in rodent models and ameliorates insulin resistance, suggesting 3,5-T2 as a potential therapeutic tool. However, a comprehensive assessment of cardiac electrical and contractile properties has not been made so far. Three-month-old Wistar rats were daily administered vehicle, 3,5-T2 or 3,5-T2+T4 and no signs of atrial or ventricular arrhythmia were detected in non-anaesthetized rats during 90 days. Cardiac function was preserved as heart rate, left ventricle diameter and shortening fraction in 3,5-T2-treated rats compared to vehicle and 3,5-T2+T4 groups. Power spectral analysis indicated an amelioration of the heart rate variability only in 3,5-T2-treated rats. An increased baroreflex sensitivity at rest was observed in both 3,5-T2-treated groups. Finally, 3,5-T2 Langendorff-perfused hearts presented a significant recovery of left ventricular function and remarkably smaller infarction area after ischaemia-reperfusion injury. In conclusion, chronic 3,5-T2 administration ameliorates tonic cardiac autonomic control and confers cardioprotection against ischaemia-reperfusion injury in healthy male rats.

AB Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted increasing academic and industrial attention during the last decade. Using drones have broad benefits in diverse areas, such as civil and military applications, aerial photography and videography, mapping and surveying, agriculture, and disaster management. However, the recent development and innovation in the field of drone (UAV) technology have led to malicious usage of the technology, including the penetration of secure areas (such as airports) and serving terrorist attacks. Autonomous weapon systems might use drone swarms to perform more complex military tasks. Utilizing a large number of drones, simultaneously increases the risk and the reliability of the mission in terms of redundancy, survivability, scalability, and the quality of autonomous performance in a complex environment. This research suggests a new approach for drone swarm characterization and detection using RF signals analysis and various machine learning methods. While most of the existing drone detection and classification methods are typically related to a single drone classification, using supervised approaches, this research work proposes an unsupervised approach for drone swarm characterization. The proposed method utilizes the different radio frequency (RF) signatures of the drone's transmitters. Various kinds of frequency transform, such as the continuous, discrete, and wavelet scattering transform, have been applied to extract RF features from the radio frequency fingerprint, which have then been used as input for the unsupervised classifier. To reduce the input data dimension, we suggest using unsupervised approaches such as Principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and the t-distributed symmetric neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithms. The proposed clustering approach is based on common unsupervised methods, including K-means, mean shift, and X-means algorithms. The proposed approach has been evaluated using self-built and common drone swarm datasets. The results demonstrate a classification accuracy of about 95% under additive Gaussian white noise with different levels of SNR.

ID LEVEL CONTROL
AB Transporting suspended payloads is challenging for autonomous aerial vehicles because the payload can cause significant and unpredictable changes to the robot's dynamics. These changes can lead to suboptimal flight performance or even catastrophic failure. Although adaptive control and learning-based methods can in principle adapt to changes in these hybrid robotpayload systems, rapid mid-flight adaptation to payloads that have a priori unknown physical properties remains an open problem. We propose a meta-learning approach that "learns how to learn" models of altered dynamics within seconds of post-connection flight data. Our experiments demonstrate that our online adaptation approach outperforms non-adaptive methods on a series of challenging suspended payload transportation tasks.

AB Predicting pedestrian trajectory is useful in many applications, such as autonomous driving and unmanned vehicles. However, it is a challenging task because of the complexity of the interactions among pedestrians and the environment. Most existing works employ long short-term memory networks to learn pedestrian behaviors, but their prediction accuracy is not good, and their computing speed is relatively slow. To tackle this problem, we propose a multi-information-based convolutional neural network (MI-CNN) to incorporate the historical trajectory, depth map, pose, and 2D-3D size information to predict the future trajectory of the pedestrian subject. After training, we evaluate our model on crowded videos in the public datasets MOT16 and MOT20. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both in prediction accuracy and computing speed.

AB The sectoral system framework has been adopted to study innovation and industrial dynamics in a wide range of sectors. However, recent development of the so-called "fourth industrial revolution" technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, advanced robotics, Internet of Things, smartphones, and autonomous vehicles, has been blurring the boundaries of existing sectors, bringing both opportunities and challenges for sectoral systems research. In this introductory essay, we first provide a quick review on the sectoral systems of innovation literature, clarifying some conceptual and methodological issues. Then, we discuss how the fourth industrial revolution might reshape sectoral systems along three different dimensions (i.e. technological, market, and policy dimensions). Finally, we introduce articles in this special section and call for future research on this intriguing topic.

AB The Deep-sea Autonomous Profile Buoys (DSAPB) are a new type of underwater buoys and they can dive to the deep sea below 4000m. Considering dynamic models of conventional underwater vehicle could not adequately satisfy the motion characteristic of DSAPB, a nonlinear dynamic model for the motion simulation of DSAPB is developed in this paper. In the model, the effect of sea water density change is taken into consideration and a viscous hydrodynamic calculation method satisfying the motion characteristic of DSAPB. The buoyancy variation is introduced into the standard hydrodynamic equation to simplify the DSAPB hydrodynamic equation, and the Motion of Planar Mechanisms (PMM) experiment is simulated by means of Computer Fluids Dynamics (CFD). The hydrodynamic coefficients in the equation are obtained and the DSAPB dynamic model is obtained which provides theoretical basis for effective control of DSAPB.

AB Underwater glider is one of the most promising autonomous observation platforms for long-term ocean observation, which can glide through water columns by adjusting its buoyancy and attitude. In this paper, gliding range of the Petrel-L underwater glider is increased by optimizing the motion parameters according to different observation missions. The optimization is established to maximize the gliding range and minimize the energy consumption for one gliding cycle, which is solved by the inner penalty function method (IPFM). Based on the nonlinear variation rule of the buoyancy loss, a hidden gliding strategy model (HGSM) is proposed and the optimization result indicates that it can increase the gliding range by 24.13% for Petrel-L when the power related with time is 0.2 W. The optimization is applicable to other types of underwater gliders.

AB How do individuals on the battlefield respond to the introduction of new technologies? How will unmanned and increasingly autonomous technologies be received by ground combat personnel? In this paper we explore tactical-level perceptions of one particular technology-armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-by conducting a survey experiment of ground fires controllers. Our findings reveal that these personnel have strong behavioral reactions to the introduction of unmanned technology. Especially in situations with high risk to ground troops, we find a strong preference for manned aircraft with implications for the future use of UAVs and human-machine relationships in war. These results suggest the need to incorporate behavioral variables into future studies of military adoption and innovation and indicate that the future adoption of unmanned systems may be just as much about the "warm fuzzy" of trust as confidence in unmanned capabilities.

AB Sonar imaging is considered the only feasible sensing solution for underwater investigations by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in zero-visibility water conditions. State-of-the-art forward-looking imaging sonars can acquire high resolution images at high frame rates, making the acquired images nearly similar to video images acquired using optical cameras. However, the sonar images are corrupted with speckle noise. In this paper, a speckle noise reduction algorithm is proposed for AUV operation. Unlike the conventional algorithms, the proposed algorithm is adequate for real-time treatment. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, an experiment was conducted by using a forward-looking imaging sonar. Based on the experimental results, it was confirmed that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the noise. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is concerned with the leader-follower flocking problem of networked nonholonomic multi-agent systems with non-identical unknown nonlinear dynamics. The leader motion to be synchronized is also nonlinear and unknown. By employing the graph theory and a pinning control technique, a distributed neural adaptive control design is developed for the agents to achieve motion synchronization with the leader. The design is for a directed communication graph with a fixed topology. A collective potential function is used to maintain cohesion between the agents. On the basis of Lyapunov analysis, the developed neural flocking algorithm guarantees that all the agents' headings and speeds are synchronized with the leader and collisions between the agents can be avoided. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper reports the surface micromachined gyroscopes realized by HSG-IMIT according to the patented decoupling principle decoupled angular velocity detector (DAVED) [1]. The latest DAVED prototypes realized with a special SOI-technology show a RMS noise below 0.025degrees/s (50 Hz bandwidth) and a bias stability of +/-0.3degrees/s over the temperature range. Thus, the target specification (comparable to electronic stability program (ESP) requirements) is met.
   Further, a novel and advanced design concept is presented which can be viewed as a doubly decoupling scheme. The goal of decoupling is to reduce the so-called quadrature signal and thus improve the sensor performance, especially, the temperature sensitivity. This advancement will be necessary to meet the demands of future applications, like, advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) or to partially replace fiber optic gyroscopes, for example, within autonomous guided vehicles.

Yet their tangled cyber-physical-social interactions and new emerging properties induce questions regarding their liability and trustworthiness. Digital simulations and sea trials are launched to assure the safety requirements and social expectations are met a priori. This paper presents the design of realistic testbed scenarios from huge historical data through a high-performance computational method to recommend a complete set of navigation scenarios for autonomy tests. The developed approach integrates traffic big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) with high-resolution digital maps, vessel information registry, and digital nautical charts. All historical vessel-to-ground and vessel-to-vessel interactions are efficiently analyzed through a hierarchical method for collision and grounding conflicts assessment with a 15-minutes prediction horizon. Relative risk is evaluated accurately over full periods of predicted close-quarters situations subject to physical limits and sea-room availability for evasive maneuverers under COLREG rules and traffic separation schemes. Spatial dependencies among multiple conflicts define risky momentary traffic situations modelled through directed graph representation of nested interactions. Their temporal dependencies describe navigation scenarios through dynamic co-behaviors between multiple participating vessels over a period of time. Finally, we analyze negative/positive actions that increase/decrease the complexity. The presented algorithms are computationally very efficient, they scale to several (country*year)s where millions of scenarios are extracted, classified, and scored by their relative risk, complexity, and likelihood for firm post-test conclusions.

AB In this paper we present an original approach applied to autonomous mobile robots navigation integrating localization and navigation using a topological map based on the proposed AFSM (adaptive finite state machine) technique. In this approach, the environment is mapped as a graph, and each possible path is represented by a sequence of states controlled by a FSM-finite state machine. An ANN (artificial neural network) is trained to recognize patterns on input data, where each pattern is associated to specific environment features or properties, consequently representing the present context/state of the FSM. When a new input pattern is recognized by the ANN (changing the current context), this allows the FSM to change to the next state and its associated action/behavior. The input features are related to specific local properties of the environment (obtained from sensors data), as for example, straight path, right and left turns, and intersections. This way, the FSM is integrated to a previously trained ANN, which acts as a key component recognizing and indicating the present state and the state changes, allowing the AFSM to select the current/correct action (local reactive behaviors) for each situation. The AFSM allows the mobile robot to autonomously follow a sequence of states/behaviors in order to reach a destination, first choosing an adequate local reactive behavior for each current state, and second detecting the changes in the current context/state, following a sequence of states/actions that codes the topological (global) path into the FSM (sequence of states/actions). The ANN is also a very important component of this system, since it can be trained/adapted to recognize a complex set of situations and state changes. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach to different situations and sensors configurations, we evaluated the proposed approach for both indoor and outdoor environments, using a Pioneer P3-AT robot equipped with Kinect sensor for indoor environments, and an automated vehicle equipped with a standard RGB camera for urban roads environments. The proposed method was tested in different situations with success and demonstrated to be a promising approach to autonomous mobile robots control and navigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) architectures generally focus on providing consistent performance and reliable communications. The convergence of IoT, edge, fog, and cloud aims to improve the quality of service of applications, which does not typically emphasize energy efficiency. Considering energy in IoT architectures would reduce the energy impact from billions of IoT devices. The research presented in this paper proposes an optimization framework that considers energy consumption of nodes when selecting a node for processing an IoT request in edge-fog-cloud layered architecture. The IoT use cases considered in this paper include smart grid, autonomous vehicles, and eHealth. The proposed framework is evaluated using CPLEX simulations. The results provide insights into mechanisms that can be used to select nodes energy-efficiently whilst meeting the application requirements and other network constraints in multi-layered IoT architectures.

AB With increasing use of infrared imaging in medical diagnostics, military and civilian surveillance, and navigation of autonomous vehicles, there is a need for low-cost alternatives to traditional materials used in infrared optics such as germanium. Sulfur-rich copolymers hold promise, as they are made from low-cost feedstocks and have a high refractive index. In this report, cyclopentadiene is copolymerized with sulfur to provide a plastic with the highest long-wave infrared transparency reported to date for this class of materials. Diverse lens architectures are accessible through melt casting or reactive injection molding. The featured copolymer is black, which enabled its use as an infrared-transparent blind for protection of thermal imaging equipment and clandestine surveillance. These findings portend expanded use of sulfur copolymers in infrared optics.

TI Perception-Aware Tag Placement Planning for Robust Localization of UAVs

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID SLAM
AB Tag-based visual-inertial localization is a lightweight method for enabling autonomous data collection missions of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in indoor construction environments. However, finding the optimal tag configuration (i.e., number, size, and location) on dynamic construction sites remains challenging. This work proposes a perception-aware genetic algorithm-based tag placement planner (PGA-TaPP) to determine the optimal tag configuration using four-dimensional (4D) building information models (BIM), considering the project progress, safety requirements, and UAV's localizability. The proposed method provides a 4D plan for tag placement by maximizing the localizability in user-specified regions of interest (ROIs) while limiting the installation costs. Localizability is quantified using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and encapsulated in navigable grids. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in finding an optimal 4D tag placement plan for the robust localization of UAVs on under-construction indoor sites.

AB With the formulation of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, marine pollution has received widespread attention from various countries. Green navigation is an important requirement for route planning, in which energy consumption is its primary focus. Ships are affected by complex marine meteorological environments, so it is difficult to plan a reasonable route. Some methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but there are some shortcomings, such as no consideration of the effect of wind direction, wind speed and wave. To solve this problem, we introduce a meta-heuristic whale optimization algorithm (WOA), which helps ships find a low-energy-consumption and safe route in a large-scale complex marine environment. The results of our simulation experiments indicate that WOA is more competitive than other state-of-the-art algorithms for route planning.

AB To prevent vehicles running off road, road edge detection is a fundamental function. Current work on road edge detection has not exhaustively tackled all weather and illumination conditions. In this paper, we first sort roads under various illuminations. Then, data mining is applied to a large driving video set to learn the qualitative and statistical distribution of road edge appearances. The corresponding features are selected for robust road edge detection. To visualize road appearance and evaluate the accuracy of detected road, a compact road profile image is generated from video data. Through the examination of all weather and illumination conditions, our road detection methods can locate road edges in good weather, reduce errors in dark illuminations, and report road invisibility in poor illumination.

In this paper, we explore the design and applications of phased multi-camera time-of-flight (ToF) systems. We develop a reproducible hardware system that allows for the exposure times and waveforms of up to three cameras to be synchronized. Using this system, we analyze waveform interference between multiple light sources in ToF applications and propose simple solutions to this problem. Building on the concept of orthogonal frequency design, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results for instantaneous radial velocity capture via Doppler time-of-flight imaging and we explore new directions for optically probing global illumination, for example by de-scattering dynamic scenes and by non-line-of-sight motion detection via frequency gating.

AB In this paper, we consider the containment control problem for a group of autonomous agents modelled by heterogeneous dynamics. The communication networks among the leaders and the followers are directed graphs. When the leaders are first-order integrator agents, we present a linear protocol for heterogeneous multi-agent systems such that the second-order integrator agents converge to the convex hull spanned by the first-order integrator agents if and only if the directed graph contains a directed spanning forest. If the leaders are second-order integrator agents, we propose a nonlinear protocol and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition that the heterogeneous multi-agent system solves the containment control problem in finite time. Simulation examples are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

TI Tracking control of trim trajectories of a blimp for ascent and descent
   flight manoeuvres
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
AB A blimp is a small airship that has no metal framework and collapses when deflated. It belongs to family of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this paper we address the problem of designing tracking feedback control of an underactuated autonomous UAV. The ascent and descent flight conditions as one in which the rate of change (of magnitude) of the airship's state vector is zero and the resultant of the applied forces and moments is constant lead to trimmed flight trajectories. The subject of the tracking control is to stabilize the engine around the planned flight. Using a combined integrator backstepping approach and Lyapunov theory, the stability results are local and overcome the minimum number of actuators (inputs) with respect to the blimp's six degrees of freedom. Considering physic limits in UAVs, other trimmed flights are investigated and compared.

TI Dynamic route planning with uncertain information
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE route planning; uncertainty management; probabilistic reasoning
AB Navigating an autonomous vehicle through a threatening zone whose characteristics may change in an unpredictable manner is an important problem that has received much attention in the recent past. The paper describes the design of a route planning system, called RUTA-100, that works with incomplete information obtained from many unreliable knowledge sources and plans an optimal route by minimizing both danger and distance. The operation of the route planner has two main phases: the initial route planning phase and the dynamic plan execution. Once a point of origin and a point of destination have been identified, the route planner determines the optimal route based on the information available at that time. Should conditions change during plan execution, the route is accordingly recalculated. This is repeated until the destination point is reached. The Dempster-Shafer theory of belief is used as the underlying formalism to pool and represent uncertain information and reason with it.

AB The prediction of pedestrian trajectories in complicated dynamic situations has garnered a great deal of interest among researchers and academics, and it plays a crucial role in numerous domains, including autonomous vehicles, intelligent robotics, and video surveillance. In this study, we offer the IST-PTEPN, a trainable and interpretable end-to-end model for predicting pedestrian trajectory. IST-PTEPN encodes the spatial and temporal characteristics of pedestrian trajectories and surrounding scenes with CNN and Transformer, then feeds the encoded vectors into Endpoint Classify CNN to generate predicted endpoints of the trajectories, and finally combines TCN and GAN to generate high-quality pedestrian trajectories. Experiments on two public datasets, ETH and UCY, demonstrate that our IST-PTEPN pedestrian trajectory prediction and endpoint prediction method outperforms the mainstream state-of-the-art methods.

AB This article presents a novel aerial manipulator (AM) system called the aerial continuum manipulator (AeCoM). The system is comprised of a quadrotor and a tendon-driven continuum robotic manipulator. Compared to current AMs, the AeCoM has the advantages of being lightweight and having high dexterity. The continuum manipulator has two contributions: 1) the development of an IMU-based kinematic model to obtain the precise end-effector pose under external loading and 2) the design of a robust closed-loop kinematic controller that implements fast shape-deformation control and prevents tendon slacking by providing feedback of the configuration space and torque applied on tendons. The article provides a detailed mechanical design of the system and extensive experiments were conducted to validate the system's performance.

AB Smart coordination of production, logistics, transport and governance aims to move, store, supply and use physical objects throughout the world in a manner that is economically, environmentally and socially efficient, secure and sustainable. To achieve this, intelligent Logistics Systems (iLS) are needed, providing for transparency and interoperability in Society 5.0's smart environments by Augmented Logistics (AL) services. iLS are high-quality Autonomous Systems (AS), represented by intelligent agents that can easily take part in and learn from their environments. Smart logistics entities, such as smart facilities, vehicles, intermodal containers and distribution hubs represent the infrastructure of the Physical Internet (PhI). In this article the role of iLS in e-commerce and transportation is discussed. New behavioural, communication and knowledge models of iLS and their AL services in relation to the PhI OSI model are presented.

AB We present a reinforcement learning-based (RL) model predictive control (MPC) method for trajectory tracking of surface vessels. The proposed method uses an MPC controller in order to perform both trajectory tracking and control allocation in real-time, while simultaneously learning to optimize the closed loop performance by using RL and system identification (SYSID) in order to tune the controller parameters. The efficiency of the method is evaluated by performing simulations on the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) ReVolt, as well as simulations and sea trials on the autonomous urban passengers ferry milliAmpere. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to outperform other state of the art methods both in tracking performance, as well as energy efficiency.

AB As a type of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), underwater gliders (UG) are getting increasing attention in ocean exploration. To save energy and satisfy the mission requirements of a longer voyage, shape optimization for UGs has become a key technique and research focus. In this paper, a conventional UG, including its fuselage and hydrofoil, is optimized, which aims to decrease the average resistance in one motion cycle. To operate the optimization progress for the complex object, multiple free form deformation (FFD) volumes are established for geometric parameterization. High-fidelity simulation models are employed for objective function evaluation and gradients calculation. And sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is adopted as an optimization algorithm. The optimization results show that there exists a UG with symmetrical and non-horizontal hydrofoils that has lower resistance.

AB We present a solution to the problem of light scattering by spherical particles, adapted for interpreting the signals of portable lidars for autonomous vehicles. The solution was obtained for typical wavelengths used in laser sensing tasks: 0.355, 0.532, 0.905, 0.940, 1.064, 1.55, 2.15, and 10.6 mu m. The solution was obtained within the framework of the Mie scattering theory for water and ice. The inherent high-frequency oscillations in the backscattering direction are smoothed out by means of a moving average, which allows one to construct fast and efficient algorithms for particle size distributions observed in the atmosphere. The resulting solution is presented in the form of a data bank, which is available in the public domain. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB The present study reports the evaluation of snippet backscatter information gathered with a high-frequency multibeam echosounder system (200-400 kHz) due to their usability to detect ammunition of different sizes in shallow coastal waters. Besides the feasibility of the snippet backscatter data, it was focused on the attainable horizontal accuracy in comparison to side-scan sonar and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys. The data was collected in shallow coastal waters of up to 18 m water depth (Baltic Sea) close to an ammunition dumping site characterized by an almost flat seafloor covered with sand and silt sediments. The analysis of the multibeam compared to sidescan data indicates the snippet backscatter to be a promising prospective method for ammunition detection and being able to improve horizontal position accuracy of up to 0.08 m.

AB High power consumption limits the endurance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). It's necessary to build a docking station to recover and recharge AUVs underwater. Inductive coupling is a commonly used method for contactless power transmission, which demonstrates superiorities in an underwater environment. In this study, a pair of coaxial and cureless coil structure is proposed for battery charging of the AUV. The performance of an inductive contactless power transfer (ICPT) system in SP topology is analyzed considering the loss of eddy-current in sea water, switching elements and diode-bridge. An appropriate frequency is selected to realize a maximum system efficiency. In the laboratory experiment, the selected topology demonstrates stable properties and realizes a maximum charging power of approximately 300 W. The efficiency of the ICPT system varies from 75% to 91% with a total efficiency of 63-77% during the entire charging period.

AB This paper discusses odor source localization (OSL) using a mobile robot in an outdoor time-variant airflow environment. A novel OSL algorithm based on particle filters (PF) is proposed. When the odor plume clue is found, the robot performs an exploratory behavior, such as a plume-tracing strategy, to collect more information about the previously unknown odor source. In parallel, the information collected by the robot is exploited by the PF-based OSL algorithm to estimate the location of the odor source in real time. The process of the OSL is terminated if the estimated source locations converge within a given small area. The Bayesian-inference-based method is also performed for comparison. Experimental results indicate that the proposed PF-based OSL algorithm performs better than the Bayesian-inference-based OSL method.

AB A two-dimensional path following control system for autonomous marine surface vessels is presented. The guidance system is obtained through a way-point guidance scheme based on line-of-sight projection algorithm and the speed controller is achieved through state feedback linearization. A new approach concerning the calculation of a dynamic line-of-sight vector norm is presented which main idea is to improve the speed of the convergence of the vehicle to the desired path. The results obtained are compared with the traditional line-of-sight scheme. It is intended that the complete system will be tested and implemented in a model of the "Esso Osaka" tanker. The results of simulations are presented here showing the effectiveness of the system aiming in to be robust enough to perform tests either in tanks or lakes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The problem of dynamic distributed sensor fusion, where time critical sensor readings are fused concurrently by physically isolated modules, is considered. A large number of critical applications including target tracking, remote sensing, and autonomous vehicle navigation can depend on interpreting sensor readings in real time. Independent sensor modules receive partially contradictory data, but their answers must agree within computed accuracy bounds. Real-time constraints cause additional uncertainty factors. The dynamic nature of this problem requires that the problem be viewed in four dimensions and processed efficiently. We present a new method that robustly tolerates a limited number of component failures. This method has complexity O(f(4)N log N), where N is the total number of modules and f is the number of faulty modules tolerated. Experimental results are given showing the merits of the proposed method, (C) 1997 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

AB With rapid development of aviation technology, materials science and artificial intelligence, aircraft design is pursuing higher requirements both in civil and military fields. The new generation of aircraft should have the autonomous capable of performing a variety of tasks (such as take-off and landing, cruising, maneuvering, hover, attack, etc.) under a highly variable flight environment (height, Mach number, etc.) and meanwhile maintaining good performance. Morphing aircraft can use smart materials and actuators to autonomously deform the shape according to the changes in flight environment and mission, and always maintain an optimal aerodynamic shape, therefore get flourished developments. Based on the ability of birds to stretch wings when flying at low speed and to constrict wings at high speed, a new bionic morphing UAV has been designed and developed as the study model by our team. In order to make this new aircraft be able to complete rapid autonomous morphing and aerodynamic performance optimization under different missions and flight conditions, we developed deep neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques as a control strategy. Considering the continuity of the state and action spaces for model, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on the actor-critic, model-free algorithm was adopted and verified on the classic nonlinear Pendulum model and Cart Pole game. After the feasibility was verified, morphing aircraft model was controlled to complete prescribed deformation using DDPG algorithm. Furthermore, on the condition that the DDPG algorithm can control morphing well, through training and testing on model using simulation data from wind tunnel tests and actual flight, the autonomous morphing control for the shape optimization of the bionic morphing UAV model could be realized.

AB The design of the suspension model of road cars is extremely important for both driver comfort and safety. Road traffic injuries are currently the eighth leading cause of death worldwide and are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Among other factors, road infrastructure is one of the most important factors to consider when designing the suspension model, especially as autonomous driving becomes more popular. In addition, there is a growing need to test and study the impact of road roughness and pavement type on autonomous vehicles (AVs). This work provides the following contributions: a platform for suspension system optimization-flexible, highly parameterizable and rich in applications. Our solution implements, tests and optimises the 2, 3 and 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) quarter-car models (QCM) with linear seat suspension and the 5 DOF half-car model (HCM), respectively, based on random road profiles generated according to ISO 8608 standards. In addition, many multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithms have been implemented and applied in isolation to see their comparative performance (in terms of Pareto fronts, hypervolume, coverage, spread, and epsilon), but most importantly we have also introduced a meta-optimization technique by super-positioning Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, where each of the algorithms, running concurrently, produces a percentage of the total number of individuals in a generation, percentage that is calculated according to the solution quality of the individuals in the previous generation. The experimental results were obtained by simulating the optimal configurations generated by the MOO heuristic algorithms on different categories of cars (small/medium). Finally, the Taguchi method and regression analysis were used to evaluate the effects of specific parameters on system responses such as sprung mass acceleration and displacement. The Taguchi simulation was performed to experimentally validate the results obtained by metaheuristic optimization methods.

TI DAPS3D: Domain Adaptive Projective Segmentation of 3D LiDAR Point Clouds
SO IEEE ACCESS

   projection algorithm; image segmentation
AB LiDARs are one of the key sources of reliable environmental ranging information for autonomous vehicles. However, segmentation of 3D scene elements (roads, buildings, people, cars, etc.) based on LiDAR point clouds has limitations. On the one hand, point- and voxel-based segmentation neural networks do not offer sufficiently high speed. On the other hand, modern labeled datasets primarily consist of street scenes recorded for driverless cars and contain little data for mobile delivery robots or cleaners that must work in parks and yards with heavy pedestrian traffic. This article aims to overcome these limitations. We have proposed a novel approach called DAPS3D to train deep neural networks for 3D semantic segmentation. This approach is based on a spherical projection of a point cloud and LiDARspecific masks, enabling the model to adapt to different types of LiDAR. First of all, we have introduced various high-speed multi-scale spherical projection segmentation models, including convolutional, recurrent, and transformer architectures. Among them, the SalsaNextRecLSTM architecture with recurrent blocks showed the best results. In particular, this model achieved the 83.5% mIoU metric for the SemanticKitti dataset with joint categories. Secondly, we have proposed several original augmentations for spherical projections of LiDAR data, including FoV, flip, and rotation augmentation, as well as a special T-Zone cutout. These augmentations increase the model's invariance when dealing with changes in the data domain. Finally, we introduce a new method to generate synthetic datasets for domain adaptation problems. We have developed two new datasets for validating 3D scene outdoor segmentation algorithms: the DAPS-1 dataset, which is based on the augmentation of the reconstructed 3D semantic map, and the DAPS-2 LiDAR dataset, collected by the on-board sensors of a cleaning robot in a park area. Particular attention is given to the performance of the developed models, demonstrating their ability to function in real-time. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available at: github.com/subake/DAPS3D.

ID ART
AB Remote photogrammetric inspection is a Non-Destructive Testing method used to quantify surface integrity and detect external discontinuities. The mobility and size of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offer the flexibility to quickly deploy remote photogrammetric inspections for large-scale assets. In this paper, the results of a photogrammetric inspection are presented as a 3D profile, reconstructed from UAV captured images. Experiments were conducted indoors using a wind turbine blade section obtained from a recently decommissioned asset. The naturally occurring surface features representative of environmental wear were augmented with a small number of artificial features to aid in the visualisation of inspection quality. An autonomous UAV system for photogrammetric inspections is demonstrated and the influence of image parameters such as environmental light levels, motion blur and focal blur quantified in terms of their impact on the inspection accuracy. Over the range of parameter values studied, the poorest scenario was observed to cause a degradation in reconstruction error by a factor of 13 versus the optimal. Reconstruction quality when employing a laser range scanner to maintain standoff distance relative to the object during flight was also investigated. In this schema, the controller automatically generated a real-time adaptive flight path to follow the outer profile of the wind turbine blade and, consequently, demonstrated improved image quality during close-range inspection of an object with complex geometry. Inspection accuracy was quantified using the error of the photogrammetric reconstruction as compared to a model acquired using independent metrology equipment. While utilising the laser-based adaptive path, error in the reconstructed geometry was reduced by a factor of 2.7 versus a precomputed circular path. In the best case, the mean deviation was below 0.25 mm. Instances of wind turbine blade damage such as edge crushing, surface imperfections, early stage leading edge erosion were clearly observed in the textured 3D reconstruction profiles, indicating the utility of the successful inspection process. The results of this paper evaluate the impact of optical environmental effects on photogrammetric inspection accuracy, offering practical insight towards mitigation of negative effects.

   This work provides details of an integration of a mobile Autonomous Intelligent Vehicle (AIV) with a Manufacturing Execution System (MES), which helps to minimize human intervention requirements in a manufacturing process. Reduction in human intervention in the manufacturing process is one of the key requirements of Industry 4.0. The proposed integration technique helps to ensure efficient production and provides optimum use of the production cells in a smart manufacturing environment.
   Industry 4.0 uses the analysis of real-time data, artificial intelligence, automation, and the interconnection of components of the production lines to improve manufacturing efficiency and quality. Manufacturing Execution Systems (MESs) and Autonomous Intelligent Vehicles (AIVs) are key elements of Industry 4.0 implementations. An MES connects, monitors, and controls data flows on the factory floor, while automation is achieved by using AIVs. The Robot Operating System (ROS) built AIVs are targeted here. To facilitate MES and AIV interactions, there is a need to integrate the MES and the AIVs to help in building an automated and interconnected manufacturing environment. This integration needs middleware, which understands both MES and AIVs. To address this issue, a LabVIEW-based scheduler is proposed here as the middleware. LabVIEW communicates with the MES through webservices and has support for ROS. The main task of the scheduler is to control the AIV based on MES requests. The scheduler developed was tested in a real factory environment using the SAP MES and a Robotnik 'RB-1 ' robot. The scheduler interface provides real-time information about the current status of the MES, AIV, and the current stage of scheduler processing. The proposed scheduler provides an efficient automated product delivery system that transports the product from process cell to process cell using the AIV, based on the production sequences defined by the MES. In addition, using the proposed scheduler, integration of an MES is possible with any low-cost ROS-built AIV.

   space approach
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS

   planning
ID OBSTACLES
AB In this paper, an algorithm incorporating two novel ideas is proposed to improve the time performance of the quad tree-based method for planning the shortest path from a given source to any given destination. One of the novel ideas is to combine the free quads. The strength of this idea lies in the fact that the quads after the total division isolate the free space from the obstacle space. The free quads, which are normally small in size, along the boundary of the obstacles, are combined to form larger free areas. The boundary of every free area is thought of being fenced by a sequence of unit free area cells called frame cells. The size of such a cell is a pixel. The free area together with the frame cells is called framed free space. Thus the entire free space, isolated from the obstacle space, is cognized through the frame cells. The other idea is the adoption of the philosophy of the rectilinear propagation of light rays to trace the shortest path and employ dynamic programming as design strategy to compute the optimal/shortest path through the cognized free area. In the framed free space, all the frame cells hold the information about the shortest distance from it to the source point, computed using the notion of rectilinear propagation of light. The shortest distance from a destination point to a source point is computed using this information. Since the quads are combined to form larger free areas, the number of framed free spaces considered for finding the shortest path is reduced. This in turn reduces the total number of frame cells cognizing the free space so that the total number of frame cells that take part in the computation of the shortest path are drastically reduced. The proposed algorithm works in a 2D static environment with obstacles of any shape and practically unconstrained size of an autonomous vehicle. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, the challenging task of estimating periodically occurring faults (POFs) in sampled-data systems is investigated. One major obstacle faced in this study is the timing misalignments between fault occurrences and observations, which is a common issue in practice. A novel approach to modeling the influence of the POFs is proposed, which utilizes an important auxiliary variable indicating the remaining time to the next fault occurrence. A fault estimation approach is designed based on the particle filtering to address the difficulty caused by the complexity of the proposed model. Moreover, a performance evaluation method is also applied to improve the precision of the estimation. Finally, an experimental study is conducted based on a kind of autonomous underwater vehicle, which illustrates the advantages of the proposed method.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) image sensors are requested by planetary explorers to detect obstacles around landing sites during the landing process and to measure the relative distance and attitude of an orbiting spacecraft during rendezvous docking procedures. Three-dimensional image sensors are also requested in many other fields, including as sensors for autonomous vehicles. In flash LIDAR, a sensor acquires 3D images using the diffuse emission of a pulsed laser, making it suitable for applications like obstacle detection and terrain measurement. We fabricated a prototype 3D image sensor with a temporal resolution of 500 ps and dimensions of 128 x 128 pixels using an InGaAs Geiger mode avalanche photodiode, which is capable of counting photons in the eye-safe band, as the light receiving sensor. This report gives an overview of the prototype sensor and its functions, a detailed evaluation of its time measurement performance, and details of imaging experiments under sunlight.

AB E-hailing services have disrupted how, when, and where people travel in cities. This paper characterizes the attributes of the supply of e-hailing markets that is reflective of the labor characteristics of the drivers (contractors). Based on a clustering analysis of the observed behavior of an e-hailing company's drivers over a month, the analysis identifies three major groups of drivers: (i) part-time drivers working flexible hours, (ii) part-time drivers working in the evenings, and (iii) full-time drivers. The clustering results of the e-hailing market supply is verified to have consistent characteristics over different days. The results of the clustering method are demonstrated to be effective for prediction of supply.

AB This paper investigates a new disturbance observer based non-singular fast terminal sliding mode control technique for the path tracking and stabilization of non-linear second-order systems with compound disturbance. The compound disturbance is comprised of both parametric and non-parametric uncertainties. While warranting fast convergence rate and robustness, it also dominates the singularity and complex-value number issues associated with conventional terminal sliding mode control. Furthermore, due to the estimation properties of the observer, knowledge about the bounds of the uncertainties is not required. The simulation results of two case studies, the velocity and path tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle and the stabilization of a chaotic phi 6-Duffing oscillator, validate the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB Variable displacement vane pumps are used in a variety of applications, most prominently in the context of modern automotive vehicles. They provide a means to react to changing consumer needs for oil flow and thereby to save energy. Despite their great practical relevance, minimal models capturing the main dynamic effects of such pumps have remained scarce. In this paper, a contribution is made in the form of a minimal model taking into account the force effects from line pressure exposure and dead volume compression and expansion. The thus-obtained pump model is autonomous and allows for a simple integration in simulation models. For a classic circuit with pressure regulation, a circuit model featuring the variable displacement vane pump model is developed for which simulation results are presented.

AB Pervasive sensing-the capability to deploy large numbers of sensors, to link them to communication networks, and to analyze their collective data-is transforming many industries. In mining, networked sensors are already used for remote operation, automation, including driverless vehicles, health, and safety, and exploration. In this paper, the state-of-the-art sensing and monitoring technologies are assessed as solutions against the main challenges and opportunities in the mining industry. Localization, mapping, remote operation, maintenance, and health and safety are identified as the main beneficiaries from rapidly developing technologies, such as 3-D visualization, augmented reality, energy autonomous sensor nodes, distributed sensing, smart network protocols, and big data analytics. It is shown that the identification and management of ore grade, in particular, which transcends each stage of the mining process, may critically benefit from certain arising sensing technologies, where major efficiency improvements are possible in exploration, extraction, haulage, and processing activities.

The feedback connections added in the second layer of the DRNFS make the system cope with temporal problems, which allows the robot to memorize the previous environment information. The parameters and structure of the DRNFS can be automatically optimized through the learning process. The parameter optimization is realized by the ordered derivative algorithm, and the structure simplification is completed by the fuzzy rules similarity measure. Simulation results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed system.

ID ROBOT NAVIGATION; NEURAL-NETWORK; SYSTEM
AB A real-time map-building system is proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to build a map of an unknown underwater environment. The system, using the AUV's onboard sensor information, includes a neurodynamics model proposed for complete coverage path planning and an evidence theoretic method proposed for map building. The complete coverage of the environment guarantees that the AUV can acquire adequate environment information. The evidence theory is used to handle the noise and uncertainty of the sensor data. The AUV dynamically plans its path with obstacle avoidance through the landscape of neural activity. Concurrently, real-time sensor data are "fused" into a two-dimensional (2D) occupancy grid map of the environment using evidence inference rule based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. Simulation results show a good quality of map-building capabilities and path-planning behaviors of the AUV.

AB Upcoming landing missions to Mars will require on-board guidance and control systems in order to meet the scientific requirement of landing safely within hundreds of meters to the target of interest. More specifically, in the longitudinal plane, the first objective of the entry guidance and control system is to bring the vehicle to its specified velocity at the specified altitude (as required for safe parachute deployment), while the second objective is to reach the target position in the longitudinal plane. This paper proposes an improvement to the robustness of the constant flight path angle guidance law for achieving the first objective. The improvement consists of combining this guidance law with a novel adaptive control scheme, derived from the so-called Simple Adaptive Control (SAC) technique. Monte-Carlo simulation results are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed guidance and adaptive control system.

AB We study the synthesis problem of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller when the matrix describing the control law is constrained to lie in a particular vector space. Our motivation is the use of such control laws to stabilize networks of autonomous agents in decentralized fashion, with the information flow being dictated by the constraints of a pre-specified topology. In this paper, we consider the finite-horizon version of the problem and provide both a computationally intensive optimal solution and a sub-optimal solution that is computationally more tractable. Then we apply the technique to the decentralized vehicle formation control problem. It is numerically illustrated that while the loss in performance due to the use of the sub-optimal solution is not huge, the topology can have a large effect on performance.

AB Tunas of the genus Thunnus are a group of high-performance pelagic fishes with many locomotor traits that are convergently shared with other high-performance fish groups. Because of their swimming abilities, tunas continue to be an inspiration for both comparative biomechanics and the design of biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite the strong history of studies in tuna physiology and current interest in tuna biomechanics and bio-inspired design, we lack quantitative data on the function of many features of tunas. Here we present data on the morphology, behavior, and function of tunas, focusing especially on experimentally examining the function of tuna lateral keels, finlets, and pectoral fins by using simple physical models. We find that both triangular lateral keels and flexible finlets decrease power requirements during swimming, likely by reducing lateral forces and yaw torques (compared to models either without keels or with rectangular keels, and models with stiff finlets or strip fins of equal area, respectively). However, both triangular keels and flexible finlets generate less thrust than other models either without these features or with modified keels or finlets, leading to a tradeoff between power consumption and thrust. In addition, we use micro computed tomography (mu CT) to show that the flexible lateral keels possess a lateral line canal, suggesting these keels have a sensory function. The curved and fully-attached base of tuna pectoral fins provides high lift-to-drag ratio at low angles of attack, and generates the highest torques across speeds and angles of attack. Therefore, curved, fully-attached pectoral fins grant both better gliding and maneuvering performance compared to flat or curved, partially-attached designs. We provide both 3D models of tuna morphology derived from mu CT scans and conclusions about the performance effects of tuna-like features as a resource for future biological and engineering work for next-generation tuna-inspired AUV designs.

AB Remote passive sonar detection and classification are challenging problems that require the user to extract signatures under low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio conditions. Adaptive line enhancers (ALEs) have been widely utilized in passive sonars for enhancing narrowband discrete components, but the performance is limited. In this paper, we propose an adaptive intrawell matched stochastic resonance (AIMSR) method, aiming to break through the limitation of the conventional ALE by nonlinear filtering effects. To make it practically applicable, we addressed two problems: (1) the parameterized implementation of stochastic resonance (SR) under the low sampling rate condition and (2) the feasibility of realization in an embedded system with low computational complexity. For the first problem, the framework of intrawell matched stochastic resonance with potential constraint is implemented with three distinct merits: (a) it can ease the insufficient time-scale matching constraint so as to weaken the uncertain affect on potential parameter tuning; (b) the inaccurate noise intensity estimation can be eased; (c) it can release the limitation on system response which allows a higher input frequency in breaking through the large sampling rate limitation. For the second problem, we assumed a particular case to ease the potential parameter a(opt)=1. As a result, the computation complexity is greatly reduced, and the extremely large parameter limitation is relaxed simultaneously. Simulation analyses are conducted with a discrete line signature and harmonic related line signature that reflect the superior filtering performance with limited sampling rate conditions; without loss of generality of detection, we considered two circumstances corresponding to H-1 (periodic signal with noise) and H-0 (pure noise) hypotheses, respectively, which indicates the detection performance fairly well. Application verification was experimentally conducted in a reservoir with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method surpasses the conventional ALE method in lower frequency contexts, where there is about 10 dB improvement for the fundamental frequency in the sense of power spectrum density (PSD).

AB Environmental concern regularly leads to the study and improvement of manufacturing processes and the development of new industrial products. The purpose of this work is to optimize the amount of injected plastic and reduce the number of parts used in the production of entrance panels to control features inside the car cabin. It focuses on a particular case study, namely the control of opening and closing windows and rotation of the rear-view mirrors of a car, maintaining all of the functionality and introducing a futuristic and appealing design inline with new autonomous driving vehicles. For this purpose, distinct low-cost touch sensor technologies were evaluated and the performance of several types of sensors that were integrated with plastic polymers of distinct thickness was analyzed. Discrete sensors coupled to the plastic part were tested and integrated in the injected plastic procedure. In the former, sensitivity tests were performed for finding the maximum plastic thickness detectable by the different sensors. For the latter, experiments were carried out on the sensors subject to very high pressure and temperature inside the molds-the two most relevant characteristics of industrial plastic injection in this context-and functional results were observed later. We conclude that, by changing the way the user interacts with the car cabin, the replacement of conventional mechanical buttons-composed of dozens of parts-by a component consisting of a single plastic part that is associated with conventional low-cost electronics allows the control of a more diversified set of features, including many that are not yet usual in the interior of automobiles today, but that will eventually be required in the near future of autonomous driving, in which the user will interact less with driving and more with other people or services around her/him, namely of the multimedia type. Additionally, the economic factor was considered, namely regarding the cost of the new technology as well as its manufacturing, replacement, and subsequent recycling processes.

ID CORAL; REFLECTANCE; REEFS
AB We present a new method for in situ high-resolution hyperspectral mapping of the seafloor utilizing a spectrometer colocated and coregistered with a high-resolution color stereo camera system onboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Hyperspectral imagery data have been used extensively for mapping and distinguishing marine seafloor habitats and organisms from above-water platforms (such as satellites and aircraft), but at low spatial resolutions and at shallow water depths (<10 m). The use of hyperspectral sensing from in-water platforms (such as AUVs) has the potential to provide valuable habitat data in deeper waters and with high spatial resolution. Challenges faced by in-water hyperspectral imaging include difficulties in correcting for water column effects and the spatial registration of point/line-scan hyperspectral sensor measurements. The methods developed in this paper overcome these issues through coregistration with a high spatial resolution, stereo color camera, and precise modeling and compensation of the water column properties that attenuate hyperspectral signals. We integrated two spectrometers into our SeaBED class AUV, and one on-board a support surface vessel to measure and estimate the effects of light passing through the water column. Spatial calibration of the spectrometers/stereo cameras and the synchronized acquisition of both sensors allowed for spatial registration of the resulting hyperspectral reflectance profiles. We demonstrate resulting hyperspectral imagery maps with a spatial resolution of 30 cm over large areas of the seafloor that are not adversely effected by above-water conditions (such as cloud cover) that would typically prevent the use of remote-sensing methods. Results are presented from an AUV mapping survey of a coral reef ecosystem over Pakhoi Bank on the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia, demonstrating the ability to reconstruct hyperspectral reflectance profiles for a diverse range of abiotic and biotic coverage types including sand, corals, seagrass, and algae. Profiles are then used to automatically classify different coverage types with a 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 91.99% using a linear support vector machine (SVM).

TI SNAL: sensitive non-associative learning network configuration for the
   automatic driving strategy
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Nowadays, there is a huge gap between autonomous vehicles and mankind in terms of the decision response against some dangerous scenarios, which would has stressed the potential users out and even made them nervous. To efficiently identify the possible sensitivity scenarios, a new neural network configuration, named sensitive non-associative learning network (SNAL), is proposed. In such structure, the modulated interneurons, excited by abnormal scene stimulation for scene processing, are well processed and utilized to improve the training structure which refers to the sensitization mechanism in non-associative learning in neurobiology and the neural structure of Aplysia. When encountering the sensitivity scenes that the automatic driving agent is not good at or has not seen, the modulated interneuron facilitates the full connection layer neurons for the decision-making process, so as to change the final automatic driving strategy. In the process of constructing the model, a method to measure the similarity of the convolution feature map is proposed, which provides a new investigation tool for the properties of convolution networks after the feature extraction. Based on the Morris-Lecar equation in neurobiology, the dynamic model of modulating interneurons in the network is constructed. The automatic control optimization of the model is carried out by imitating the biological properties. The optimization method provides a reference for introducing neurobiological mechanism into deep learning and automatic control. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulation test are executed and the existing methods are compared accordingly. The results show that the proposed SNAL algorithm can effectively recognize the sensitivity mechanism. Furthermore, compared with the existing algorithms, such as CNN, LSTM, ViT, the proposed algorithm can make better defensive strategies for potentially dangerous scenes rarely seen or not seen in the training stage. This sensitivity mechanism is more in line with the human driving intuition when dealing with abnormal driving scenes, and makes the decision more interpretable, significantly improving the traffic ability of autonomous vehicles under the sensitive scenes. In addition, this configuration can be easily combined with the existing mainstream neural network models and has good expansibility.

AB In this study, a robust H-infinity network observer-based attack-tolerant path tracking control design is proposed for the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) under the effect of external disturbance, measurement noise and actuator/sensor attack signals. At First, a more practical AGV system is applied to describe the interaction among the longitudinal speed, lateral speed and yaw rate. Based on Controller Area Network (CAN), the information of local AGV is transmitted to remote control center through wireless channel and then the control command can be calculated from remote control center. To avoid the corruption of actuator/sensor attack signal from insecure CAN, two novel smoothed signal models are introduced to describe these attack signals and are embedded with the AGV dynamics system as an augmented system. Subsequently these attack signals can be simultaneously estimated with the AGV system state by the conventional Luenberger-type observer of the augmented system. By using the estimated state and attack signals, a robust H-infinity network observer-based attack-tolerant path tracking controller is constructed to attenuate the effect of unknown disturbance on the energy of path tracking error and eliminate the influence of attacks signals. With the help of convex Lyapunov function, the design conditions of robust H-infinity network observer-based attack-tolerant path tracking control design for AGV are derived in terms of a set of nonlinear difference inequalities. To reduce the difficulties in solving these nonlinear difference inequalities, Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy interpolation method is applied to approximate the nonlinear AGV system and the design can be simplified to a set of LMIs, which can be easily solved via LMI TOOLBOX in MATLAB. A double lane change task of AGV in CAN is provided as a simulation example to illustrate the design procedure and validate the effectiveness of proposed design method in comparison with the conventional steering control method.

SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES

DT Article; Early Access
ID PREDICTION; SPEED; FLOW
AB Accurate traffic estimation contributes to safer route planning for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Currently, deep learning methods based on graph convolution networks (GCNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in traffic estimation. However, such methods suffer from spatial over-smoothing and temporal hysteresis, which lead to estimation results deviating from the ground truth. Therefore, a multistream spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (MSGCN) is proposed in this paper to deal with these issues. It integrates local, global and differential spatial-temporal features which are modeled from multiple dimensions to deal with spatially correlation and time-varying evolution of traffic states. Experimental results obtained on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MSGCN. Furthermore, we measure the performance in both usual and unusual traffic states. Compared to baseline models, MSGCN is more accurate and robust in the two states.

An improved genetic algorithm is used to solve the task planning, and an improved A* algorithm is used to solve the path optimization within the shelf level. The conflicts generated by the parallel operation of the four-way shuttle system are classified, and the improved A* algorithm based on the time window method is constructed for path optimization through the dynamic graph theory method to seek safe conflict-free paths.

ID MECHANISM; DESIGN
AB Flapping wings produce lift and thrust in bio-inspired aerial robots, leading to quiet, safe and efficient flight. However, to extend their application scope, these robots must perch and land, a feat widely demonstrated by birds. Despite recent progress, flapping-wing vehicles, or ornithopters, are to this day unable to stop their flight. In this paper, we present a process to autonomously land an ornithopter on a branch. This method describes the joint operation of a pitch-yaw-altitude flapping flight controller, an optical close-range correction system and a bistable claw appendage design that can grasp a branch within 25 milliseconds and re-open. We validate this method with a 700g robot and demonstrate the first autonomous perching flight of a flapping-wing robot on a branch, a result replicated with a second robot. This work paves the way towards the application of flapping-wing robots for long-range missions, bird observation, manipulation, and outdoor flight.

AB Underwater gliders are winged, autonomous underwater vehicles that are broadly applied in physical and biological oceanography. The position of the wing has an important effect on the movement performance of the underwater glider. In this paper, the dynamic motion of a series of underwater glider models with different longitudinal wing positions are simulated, which provides guidance for the design of underwater gliders. The results show that when the net buoyancy is constant, the wing position affects the gliding angle, but does not affect the relationship between the gliding angle and the gliding speed. In addition, the farther the wing position of the glider is from the buoyancy centre, the longer it takes for the attitude of a glider to change, whether the wing is in front of or behind, the buoyancy centre.

AB Plasmid pPvu1 from Proteus vulgaris carries the genes of the PvuII restriction-modification system [Blumenthal et al., J. Bacteriol. 164 (1985) 501-509]. This report focuses on physical and functional features of the 4.84-kb plasmid, which shows a composite genetic architecture. Plasmid pPvu1 has a replication origin and an incompatibility locus that each function in Escherichia coli, and an apparent cer recombination site. The replication origin includes a possible RNAI gene, and the incompatibility locus closely resembles a rom gene. These loci show substantial sequence similarity to corresponding loci from the E. coli plasmids P15A, ColEI and pSC101, and closely flank the PvuII genes. The close association between a recombinational locus and the PvuII genes has implications for their mobility.

AB To achieve high-accuracy formation control of multiple ocean surface vessels, the external disturbance acting on each vessel should be accommodated. In this paper, a novel disturbance estimation scheme is presented to solve this problem, and to provide the future formation controller design with precise estimation information. This approach is developed in the theoretical framework of a terminal slidingmode observer. The proposed observer is able to precisely estimate external disturbance after finite time. It is shown by Lyapunov stability analysis that the estimation error for external disturbance will converge to zero after finite time. A fast and precise estimation for external disturbance is achieved. Numerical example is further presented to validate the effectiveness of the developed disturbance estimation approach.

AB In this paper, a simulation-based performance evaluation of shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) is presented. In comparison with well-known automated storage and retrieval systems, SBS/RSs can substantially increase the throughput capacity of the system. The objective of this study is to exploit the benefits of SBS/RS system design for reducing the mean cycle time of transactions and consequently increasing the throughput capacity of the system. Performance comparison of the studied SBS/RS is contrasted with alternative storage rack configurations, velocity profiles of the shuttle carriers and velocity profiles of the elevators' lifting tables in the system. The results show that SBS/RSs are effective in reducing the mean cycle time and also show large improvement by increasing throughput capacity.

AB We propose a novel lane detection method based on classification in image sequences. Both structural and statistical features of the extracted bright shape are applied to the neural network for finding correct lane marks. The features used in this paper are shown to have strong discriminating power to locate correct traffic lanes. The traffic lanes detected in the current frame is also used to estimate the traffic lane if the lane detection fails in the next frame. The proposed method is fast enough to apply for real-time systems; the average processing time is less than 2msec. Also the scheme of the local illumination compensation allows robust lane detection at nighttime. Therefore, this method can be widely used in intelligence transportation systems such as driver assistance, lane change assistance, lane departure warning and autonomous vehicles.

AB A NASA Mars technology program task is developing a prototype, embedded, real-time navigation system for Mars final approach and entry, descent, and landing using the Mars Network's Electra ultrahigh frequency transceiver. The Mars Network is ideally situated to provide spacecraft-to-spacecraft navigation via the Electra ultrahigh frequency transceiver, which is a versatile telecommunications payload that is capable of providing autonomous on-orbit, real-time trajectory determination using two-way Doppler measurements between a Mars approach vehicle and a Mars Network orbiter. A set of analyses based on the 2010 encounter at Mars between the Mars Science Laboratory and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter demonstrate that the navigation system is capable of achieving a 300 m or better atmosphere entry knowledge error and that the resulting technology is a key component to enabling pinpoint landing. The development approach, software design, and test results from an engineering development unit are presented.

ID ENVIRONMENT
AB Landmark-based navigation of autonomous mobile robots or vehicles has been widely adopted in industry. Such a navigation strategy relies on identification and subsequent recognition of distinctive environment features or objects that are either known a priori or extracted dynamically. This process has inherent difficulties in practice due to sensor noise and environment uncertainty. This paper is to propose a navigation algorithm that simultaneously locates the robots and updates landmarks in a manufacturing environment. A key issue being addressed is how to improve the localization accuracy for mobile robots in a continuous operation, in which the Kalman filter algorithm is adopted to integrate odometry data with scanner data to achieve the required robustness and accuracy. The Kohonen neural networks have been used to recognize landmarks using scanner data in order to initialize and recalibrate the robot position by means of triangulation when necessary.

LA English
DT Article
AB Various position sensing and navigation systems have been proposed for the autonomous control of mobile robots. Some of these systems have been installed with an omnidirectional visual sensor system that proved very useful in obtaining information on the environment around the mobile robot for position reckoning, In this article, this type of navigation system is discussed. The sensor is composed of one TV camera with a fish-eye lens, using a reference target on a ceiling and hybrid image processing circuits. The position of the robot, with respect to the floor, is calculated by integrating the information obtained from a visual sensor and a gyroscope mounted in the mobile robot, and the use of a simple algorithm based on PTP control for guidance is discussed. An experimental trial showed that the proposed system was both valid and useful for the navigation of an indoor vehicle. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.

AB The promise of fully autonomous vehicles to replace the judgment of human drivers with real-time algorithmic decision-making based on optoelectronic systems relies fundamentally on the quality of the available data. Limitations imposed by sensor-resolution, available optical power, and achievable signal-to-noise ratios have been well studied in the light detection and ranging (LIDAR) application space. Additionally, the problem of integrating multiple sources of image data as well as the need to establish and maintain the system calibration over life are critically important to system reliability and safety. These latter concerns will receive even greater attention as self-driving vehicles begin to transition toward fully autonomous operation. Because of the importance of calibration to system performance and safety, the process of validating and recalibrating the system will ideally be integrated into the LIDAR system itself with calibration occurring automatically "anywhere and at any time," without dedicated external infrastructure. Mass-market adoption is also being driven by the systems' size and weight, as well as reliable manufacturability and resilience to environmental stresses. Due to their extreme stability, manufacturability, and small size, diffractive optical elements (DOEs) are well suited for use as optical calibration references. Current three-dimensional (3D) mapping systems based on structured light illumination already rely on DOEs as precision pattern generators to provide 3D depth sensing in a wide array mobile devices. We examine the potential use of DOEs as calibration elements in multicamera or LIDAR systems, including appropriate choices of materials, designs, and fabrication methods to ensure reliable long-term performance under automotive use conditions. We present simulations of the impact of DOE material properties on the accuracy of the generated dot patterns and consequently on the depth accuracy and lateral distortion of the 3D image. Additionally, we present requirements for DOE manufacture using conventional semiconductor fabrication technologies optimized for creating engineered surface nanostructures capable of transforming the output of a laser or other narrow-band source into a precise reference pattern.

AB The monitoring of underwater aquatic habitats and pipeline leakages and disaster prevention are assisted by the construction of an underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN). The deployment of underwater sensors consumes energy and causes delay when transferring the gathered sensed data via multiple hops. The consumption of energy and delays are minimized by means of an autonomous unmanned vehicle (AUV). This work addresses the idea of reducing energy and delay by incorporating an AUVs-assisted, three-dimensional UWSN (3D-UWSN) called DEDG 3D-UWSN. Energy in the sensor nodes is saved by clustering and scheduling; on the other hand, the delay is minimized by the movement of the AUV and inter-cluster routing. In clustering, multi-objective spotted hyena optimization (MO-SHO) is applied for the selection of the best sensor for the cluster head, which is responsible for assigning sleep schedules for members. According to the total number of members, an equal half of the members is provided with sleep slots based on the energy and hop counts. The redundancy in the gathered data is eliminated by measuring the Hassanat distance. Then, the moving AUV is able to predict its movement by the di-factor actor-critic path prediction method. The mid-point among the four heads is determined so that the AUV can collect data from four heads at a time. In cases where the waiting time of the CH is exceeded, three-step, inter-cluster routing is executed. The three steps are the discovery of possible routes, ignoring the longest paths and validating the filtered path with a fuzzy-LeNet method. In this 3D-UWSN, the sensed data are not always normal, and, hence, a weighted method is presented to transfer emergency events by selecting forwarders. This work is implemented on Network Simulator version 3.26 to test the results. It achieves better efficiency in terms of data collection delay, end-to-end delay, AUV tour length, network lifetime, number of alive nodes and energy consumption.

AB Demands for oil and gas are increasing with urbanization and industrialization of the world's increasing population. Giant oil fields are declining in their production worldwide and this situation is creating need for search of new conventional and non-conventional fossil reserves. With steep depletion of major onshore and shallow-water-offshore oil fields new search of fossil fuel is moving towards deep-water and ultra-deep water offshore fields. Obviously new reserves are located in extreme, hostile and hard-to-reach environmental conditions. Exploration, development and production of oil from such difficult offshore fields have many serious challenges to health, safety and environment (HSE) therefore, require sophisticated technological innovations to support increasing energy demand. Biggest oil spill accidents in explosion of Deepwater Horizon offshore oil platform are burning example of such challenges which human society cannot risk to repeat. Therefore, development of advance drilling system, more accurate and intelligent inspection mechanism, faster responsive system in cases of unfortunate incidence and efficient damage control system is need of the safer future. Successful implementation of robotics, in space and manufacturing industry, is an critical example of how robotic assistance and automation is the only option for safe and cost-effective production of oil in foreseeable future. Teleoperation of unmanned drilling and production platforms, remote operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), under-water welding, welding robots for double hulled ships and under-water manipulator are such key robotic technologies which have facilitated smooth transition of offshore rigs from shallow waters to ultra-deep waters in modern time. Considering the sensitivity of product and difficulty of environment, most of these technologies fall under semi-autonomous category, where human operator is in loop for providing cognitive assistance to the overall operation for safe execution. This paper summarizes the key robotic technologies currently used in offshore oil and gas facilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cultivating the arable, highly sloped hills and uneven terrain is challenging and unsafe with large agricultural machines. Therefore, a fleet of small autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) was proposed to farm sloped or uneven terrain. The fleets need a robotic grain drill to operate on varying slopes, and the success of the fleet depends on the performance of the robotic seeder or grain drill. The feed mechanism is the heart of the seeder, and its design and performance influence the plant population and crop yield. In this study, we designed and fabricated an auger-type feed mechanism for robotic wheat drilling. Feed mechanisms with augers having three different pitches were developed as per the ASABE standards. The developed feed mechanism was investigated in a laboratory setup for flow rate and flow uniformity in accordance with ISO standards. The predictor variables were auger type (pitch), auger rotational speed, vibration, and slope. The auger flow rate for flat slopes was a linear function of auger speed and varied from 30 g/min to 170 g/min. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the flow rate ranged from 2% to 10%. The CV was within acceptable limits, which was an excellent indicator of the bulk feed mechanism's flow uniformity. The performance of the feed mechanism was influenced by vibration and slope. However, the auger flow rate remained constant for vibration frequencies of 0, 6, and 14 Hz, suggesting that the feed mechanism was vibration-proof and could tolerate the vibration frequency up to 14 Hz. The flat, downhill (descending), and uphill (ascending) slope levels did not affect the feed mechanism performance. However, the side slopes (right and left slope) significantly affected the feed mechanism flow rate but did not affect the flow uniformity. The study also developed a feed mechanism for a sloped-ground prototype seeder, which can be easily scaled and adopted by small autonomous vehicles or mobile robots.

   FACIES
AB As the product of a variety of sediment sources and sedimentation (and re-sedimentation) and erosion processes, the geomorphology and sedimentology of carbonate slopes are highly variable. The purpose of this study is to describe sub-bottom profiles and side-scan sonar, multibeam and optical data acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle to explore variability in geomorphological and sedimentological character of the present-day platform-marginal, uppermost slope environments (< 240 m water depth) on the north, open-ocean facing flank of Little Bahama Bank, Bahamas. Although at time scales of greater than 100 ka this margin is progradational, the data illustrate a complex juxtaposition of erosional and depositional processes and features. Erosion is evidenced by two prominent escarpments (70 m and 120 m) that expose eroded, bedded rocky outcrops. These escarpments are interpreted to represent relict features, related to past sea-level positions, although they still may be shedding debris. Aside from erosional remnants, sedimentation and active transport is indicated by several features, including active bedforms (especially above the 70 m escarpment, but ripples occur to depths of ca 200 m), several mass transport complexes that overlie and cover the lower escarpment, gravity flow deposits and rare slump features. Similarly, a thick (up to 20 m) onlapping sediment wedge, interpreted to be Holocene in age, suggests lateral accretion of the slope by more than 75 m in this period. Data illustrate that this open-ocean margin is distinct from windward margins in the Bahamas, which typically include near-vertical walls of erosion or bypass, flanked downdip by rubble and talus, and leeward margins, which have onlapping muddy wedges, but that lack marked terraces or escarpments. Collectively, the results provide perspectives into the nature and controls on complex geomorphological patterns of erosion and deposition in Holocene uppermost slope systems, concepts potentially applicable to ancient analogues.

DT Article
AB It is assumed that autonomous driving is the key technology for our future transportation system. However, studies have shown that the incidence of kinetosis, i.e. motion sickness, is significantly higher in autonomous driving cars than in conventional vehicles. Since especially vertical dynamic oscillations (heave) in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to approx. 1 Hz are perceived as particularly disturbing, active spring-damper systems can provide a remedy. The active air spring, which we develop at the Institute for Fluid Systems at TU Darmstadt, is such a system. It combines the advantages of an air spring (level control, load independent body natural frequency, etc.), which result from the separation of the functions "load carrying" and "energy storing", with those of an active system. The actuating force is generated by adjusting the load-carrying (pressure-effective) area of the air spring during operation with an edge frequency of more than 5 Hz. This is realized by adjusting the air spring rolling piston diameter with four radially adjustable segments. For this purpose, a compact hydraulic linear actuator was developed which is integrated into the air spring piston.
   In this article, we describe the concept of the active air spring and introduce the functional prototype. Thereafter, the general optimal vertical dynamic design of an active system is discussed using the example of a quarter car model and the influence of system variables such as actuating force and actuating frequency is addressed. In the next step, a simple modeling of the overall system is carried out with regard to the H-2-optimal controller design and the suitability of the actuator concept for use in an active chassis as well as the robustness of the controller is shown exemplarily. In order to optimally tune the system to reduce oscillations that cause kinetosis and decrease driving comfort, frequency-specific weighting filters in accordance with VDI Guideline 2057 are used for the control design. Finally, the functional performance of the active air spring is demonstrated in hardware-in-the-loop experiments in which the functional prototype is coupled with a virtual quarter vehicle in a real-time simulation environment.

AB Clinicians play an important role in the prevention of unintentional injuries. Falls and MVC have predictable and overlapping antecedents. Systematic screening for and management of vision impairment, frailty, cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, and inappropriate medications will reduce both falls and MVC risks. Fall-prevention measures, such as strength training, need to be more widely prescribed by physicians and implemented by older adults. Technologically tailored approaches are needed to leverage fall-reduction programs at home, as well as education of older adults regarding home hazards. Physicians need to improve screening and management of sarcopenia.Fully autonomous vehicles are still at least 15 years away, so both clinicians and their older patients will need better clinical screening guidelines for driving risk. Society needs to address alternative transportation for older adults and improve self regulation and decision-making support for older drivers.

AB In this paper we present numerical methods for the approximation of nonlinear Ito stochastic differential equations on manifolds. For this purpose, we extend Runge-Kutta- Munthe-Kaas (RKMK) schemes for ordinary differential equations on manifolds to the stochastic case and analyse the strong convergence of these schemes. Since these schemes are based on the application of a stochastic Runge-Kutta (SRK) scheme in a corresponding Lie algebra, we address the question under which circumstances the stochastic RKMK method has the same strong order of convergence as the applied SRK scheme. To illustrate our answer to this question and the effectiveness of our schemes, we show some numerical results of applying these methods to a problem with an autonomous underwater vehicle.& COPY; 2023 IMACS.

AB Scene recovery is a fundamental imaging task with several practical applications, including video surveillance and autonomous vehicles, etc. In this article, we provide a new real-time scene recovery framework to restore degraded images under different weather/imaging conditions, such as underwater, sand dust and haze. A degraded image can actually be seen as a superimposition of a clear image with the same color imaging environment (underwater, sand or haze, etc.). Mathematically, we can introduce a rank-one matrix to characterize this phenomenon, i.e., rank-one prior (ROP). Using the prior, a direct method with the complexity OoNTHORN is derived for real-time recovery. For general cases, we develop ROPthorn to further improve the recovery performance. Comprehensive experiments of the scene recovery illustrate that our method outperforms competitively several state-of-the-art imaging methods in terms of efficiency and robustness.

AB October 2, 2018, marked the fiftieth commemoration of the massacre of a yet-undisclosed number of students, local residents, and other innocent bystanders in Mexico City's Plaza de Tlatelolco. As usual, the annual Memorial 68 organized by the UNAM (National Autonomous University) included several theatre productions, but this time around the plays were primarily and surprisingly farcical in nature. Although the use of a genre commonly considered derisive, irreverent, and unrealistic to commemorate such a painful and pivotal chapter in Mexican history may seem insensitive and perhaps even offensive, the presentation of five farces related to 1968 in the fall of 2018 confirms that farce is ultimately the most realistic and effective vehicle for staging the widespread perception of Mexican history as an absurd, endless cycle in which those who dare to defy or disrupt the established order are simply eliminated with impunity.

AB A vision-based navigation approach using digital terrain elevation data and a monocular camera is addressed for autonomous navigation of unmanned aircraft. Previous vision-based terrain-referenced navigation algorithms use visual measurements to update vehicle position. This study expands the use of the visual measurements and the terrain data by designing the navigation filter to update 3-axis attitude and velocity as well as position. An observation model for updating position and attitude compares height estimates of ground features, computed from the visual measurements, with terrain elevation data. Additionally, the eight-point algorithm is adopted to extract direction of camera movement to update velocity in the navigation filter. A simulation study is conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed method and the effect of visual measurement errors.

AB The application of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is widespread with the development of the activities in deep ocean. For low energy consumption, low resistance and excellent maneuverability, fins are usually used to modify AUV hydrodynamic forces. The underactuated AUV can do gyratory motion by vertical fins and do diving and rising motion by horizontal fins. However, the modeling and performance prediction for the underactuated AUV with fins have not been solved well. We build the dynamics and kinematics model in 6-DOF for the underactuated AUV with fins and analyze the forces and hydrodynamic coefficients in detail, especially the fin effect. Various hull hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained by CFD numerical computation. A series of simulation experiments are conducted to predict AUV hydrodynamic performance, and the feasibility and accuracy are verified by comparing the results on WL-II underactuated AUV in ocean experiments.

AB We present a class of modified circumcenter algorithms that allow a group of agents to achieve "practical rendezvous" when they are only able to take noisy measurements of their neighbors. Assuming a uniform detection probability in a disk of radius sigma about each neighbor's true position, we show how initially connected agents converge to a practical stability ball. More precisely, a deterministic analysis allows us to guarantee convergence to such a ball under r-disk graph connectivity in 1D under the condition that r/sigma be sufficiently large. A stochastic analysis leads to a similar convergence result in probability, but for any r/sigma > 1, and under a sequence of switching graphs that contains a connected graph within bounded time intervals. We include several simulations to discuss the performance of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While modern sampling techniques, such as autonomous underwater vehicles, are increasing our knowledge of the fauna beneath Antarctic sea ice of only a few meters in depth, greater sampling difficulties mean that little is known about the marine life underneath Antarctic ice shelves over 100 in thick. In this study, we present underwater images showing the underside of an Antarctic ice shelf covered by aggregated invertebrate communities, most likely crudarians and isopods. These images, taken at an average depth of 145 m, were obtained with a digital still camera system attached to Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii foraging just beneath the ice shelf. Our observations indicate that, similar to the sea floor, ice shelves serve as an important habitat for a remarkable amount of marine invertebrate fauna in Antarctica.

AB Nfer is a rule-based language for abstracting event streams into a hierarchy of intervals with data. Nfer has multiple implementations and has been applied in the analysis of spacecraft telemetry and autonomous vehicle logs. This work provides the first complexity analysis of nfer evaluation, i.e., the problem of deciding whether a given interval is generated by applying rules. We show that the full nfer language is undecidable and that this depends on both recursion in the rules and an infinite data domain. By restricting either or both of those capabilities, we obtain tight decidability results.We also examine the impact on complexity of exclusive rules and minimality. For the most practical case, which is minimality with finite data, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The human gut microbiome is often described as the collection of bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, and viruses associated with an individual, with no acknowledgement of the plasmid constituents. However, like viruses, plasmids are autonomous intracellular replicating entities that can influence the genotype and phenotype of their host and mediate trans-kingdom interactions. Plasmids are frequently noted as vehicles for horizontal gene transfer and for spreading antibiotic resistance, yet their multifaceted contribution to mutualistic and antagonistic interactions within the human microbiome and impact on human health is overlooked. In this review, we highlight the importance of plasmids and their biological properties as overlooked components of microbiomes. Subsequent human microbiome studies should include dedicated analyses of plasmids, particularly as a holistic understanding of human-microbial interactions is required before effective and safe interventions can be implemented to improve human well-being.

AB Automated driving gradually emerges as a real reality, but it still has to face various challenges, including sophisticated and volatile traffic conditions, human operating faults, etc. Amongst them, accurate understanding of traffic signs by using computer vision and deep learning methods has great significance for driving safety. In recent years, the advent of deep learning has made this issue much effectively. In this article, our major goal is to use deep learning models for conducting traffic-light sign recognition related to autonomous vehicles. As far as we know, this is the first time that the capsule neural network is employed as a method for scene understanding so as to effectively identify a class of traffic-light signs. Compared with the well-known convolutional neural networks, capsule networks diminish the demands for training datasets and tackle the spatial relationship much precisely.

AB This paper discusses the issue of impact angle control of an interceptor against stationary targets. Considering the impact angles problem, guidance laws are derived by using terminal sliding mode and finite-time convergence theory. The sliding mode surface is divided into two parts: singularity and nonsingularity. The singularity issue of the terminal sliding mode surface is tackled with a novel control strategy so that it does not consider the absolute value problem of the sliding mode surface any more. It is shown that the state variables of the autonomous underwater vehicle's guidance system converge to expected states within finite time under the guidance law we proposed. The autopilot dynamics are also taken into account due to its importance. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed guidance laws.

AB This study examines the composition and activity of the planktonic community during the polar night in the high Arctic Kongsfjord, Svalbard. Our results are the first published evidence of bioluminescence among zooplankton during the Arctic polar night. The observations were collected by a bathyphotometer detecting bioluminescence, integrated into an autonomous underwater vehicle, to determine the concentration and intensity of bioluminescent flashes as a function of time of day and depth. To further understand community dynamics and composition, plankton nets were used to collect organisms passing through the bathyphotometer along with traditional vertical net tows. Additionally, using a moored bathyphotometer closed to the sampling site, the bioluminescence potential itself was shown not to have a diurnal or circadian rhythm. Rather, our results provide evidence for a diel vertical migration of bioluminescent zooplankton that does not correspond to any externally detectable changes in illumination.

AB A linear acceleration car-following model has been developed for realistic simulation of traffic flow in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications. The new model provides continuous acceleration profiles instead of the stepwise profiles that are currently used. The brake reaction times of the drivers are simulated effectively and are independent of the simulation time steps. Chain-reaction times of the drivers are also simulated and perception thresholds are incorporated in the model. The preferred time headways are utilized to determine the simulated drivers' separation during car-following. The features of the model and the realistic vehicle simulation in car-following and in stop-and-go conditions make this model suitable to ITS, especially to autonomous intelligent cruise-control systems. The car-following algorithm is validated at microscopic and macroscopic levels by using field data. Simulated versus field trajectories and statistical tests show very strong agreement between simulation results and field data.

AB The biological carbon pump (BCP) contributes to the oceanic CO2 sink by transferring particulate organic carbon (POC) into the deep ocean. The magnitude and efficiency of the BCP is likely to vary on timescales of days to seasons, however characterising this variability from shipboard observations is challenging. High resolution, sustained observations of primary production and particle fluxes by autonomous vehicles offer the potential to fill this knowledge gap. Here we present a 4 month, daily, 1 m vertical resolution glider dataset, collected in the high productivity bloom, downstream of South Georgia, Southern Ocean. The dataset reveals substantial temporal variability in primary production, POC flux and attenuation. During the pre-bloom peak phase we find high export efficiency, implying minimal heterotrophic POC consumption, i.e. productivity is decoupled from upper ocean remineralisation processes. As the bloom progresses from its peak through its declining phase, export flux decreases, but transfer efficiency within the upper 100 m of the mesopelagic increases. Conversely, transfer efficiency in the lower mesopelagic decreases in the post-bloom phase, implying that the flux attenuation processes operating in the upper and lower mesopelagic are effectively decoupled. This finding underscores an important limitation of using a single parameter, such as Martin's 'b', to characterise POC flux attenuation in a given location or season. Frequent pulses of export flux are observed throughout the deployment, indicating decoupling between primary production and the processes driving export of material from the upper ocean. The mechanisms underlying the observed seasonal changes in BCP magnitude and efficiency are unclear, as temperature and oxygen concentration changed minimally, although the nature of the sinking particles changed substantially as the bloom progressed. Our results highlight the difficulty of capturing temporal variability and episodic flux events with traditional shipboard observations, which affects our conceptual understanding of the BCP. The increasing use of autonomous vehicles to observe particle fluxes will be essential to characterising the temporal variability in magnitude and functioning of the BCP.

AB The innovative concept of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has a huge impact in different sectors including a small scientific laboratory, to a medium sized harbor, and to monitor vast undiscovered oceans. Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has become a powerful technology to support various applications such as collecting real-time aquatic information, naval military applications, maritime security, natural disaster prediction and control, archaeological expeditions, oil and gas exploration, shipwrecks discovery, water contamination, marine life observation and smart Ocean. IoUT is referred as smart intricately linked underwater objects to monitor these underwater operations. The IoUT framework incorporates several underwater communication technologies based on magnetic induction, optical signals, radio signals and acoustic waves. It is an emerging communication ecosystem which can reveal a new era of research, business and naval applications. It is a novel and vibrant paradigm for the Blue Economy sector bringing the ability to communicate autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), sensing, actuating and transferring this data to control centers using regular internet speeds through low cost technologies. It is anticipated to support future networking systems which can bring tremendous improvement in previous generations in terms of stable networking, high coverage, massive connectivity, low latency, high data rate and low power consumption. This study introduces the possible network framework of IoUT which is naturally heterogeneous and must be flexible enough to work under unpredicted ocean conditions. In this study, we examine channel models, routing protocols, networking topologies and simulation tools. Furthermore, we discussed recent advancements in IoUT in terms of smart devices, consumer electronics, communication and role of AUVs. In addition, edge computing, optical wireless communication (OWC), data analytics, blockchain, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and machine learning were viewed as promising techniques to support IoUT. We have dedicated a complete section to applications of IoUT. Finally, numerous open research challenges and future directions were presented. We believe this survey will be helpful to aggregate the research efforts and eliminate the technical uncertainties towards breakthrough novelties of IoUT.

AB Monitoring of aquatic ecosystems has been historically accomplished by intensive campaigns of direct measurements (by probes and other boat instruments) and indirect extensive methods such as aero-photogrammetry and satellite detection. These measurements characterized the research in the last century, with significant but limited improvements within those technological boundaries. The newest advances in the field of smart devices and increased networking capabilities provided by emerging tools, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), offer increasing opportunities to provide accurate and precise measurements over larger areas. These perspectives also correspond to an increasing need to promptly respond to frequent catastrophic impacts produced by drilling stations and intense transportation activities of dangerous materials over ocean routes. The shape of coastal ecosystems continuously varies due to increasing anthropic activities and climatic changes, aside from touristic activities, industrial impacts, and conservation practices. Smart buoy networks (SBNs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and multi-sensor microsystems (MSMs) such as smart cable water (SCW) are able to learn specific patterns of ecological conditions, along with electronic "noses", permitting them to set innovative low-cost monitoring stations reacting in real time to the signals of marine environments by autonomously adapting their monitoring programs and eventually sending alarm messages to prompt human intervention. These opportunities, according to multimodal scenarios, are dramatically changing both the coastal monitoring operations and the investigations over large oceanic areas by yielding huge amounts of information and partially computing them in order to provide intelligent responses. However, the major effects of these tools on the management of marine environments are still to be realized, and they are likely to become evident in the next decade. In this review, we examined from an ecological perspective the most striking innovations applied by various research groups around the world and analyzed their advantages and limits to depict scenarios of monitoring activities made possible for the next decade.

AB This letter discusses pointing errors in underwater optical communication caused by environmental disturbances and uncertainties that cannot be well measured and controlled in previous optical alignment methods. The bore-sight and jitter effects are identified in the motion model of the mobile platform. We propose to use the sensor suite that includes a pressure sensor, super short baseline (SSBL) acoustic system, Doppler velocity log (DVL), and fiber optic gyro (FOG) to observe and estimate pointing errors during communication. The pointing errors updated by the particle filter can be shared with the pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) system and thruster system. The sea experiments reveal that the proposed method can measure pointing errors and limit error growth by maneuvering the mobile platform.

AB Intelligent transportation is becoming integral part of future smart cities where driverless operations may provide hassle free conveyance. Photonic radar technology is one such contender to deliver attractive applications in autonomous vehicle sector. In this paper we have discussed the basic principle of frequency modulated continuous wave photonic radar and their possible advantages. Further the basic detection scheme that is direct detection and coherent detection is explained mathematically as well as numerical simulations to understand the working is also carried out. The obtained result concludes that direct detection scheme provides minimal complexity in its architecture and is sensitive to received signal strength at the cost of thermal noise and poor sensitivity. On the other hand, coherent detection offers higher target range estimation as well as velocity measurement at the expense of increased system complexity.

AB This paper investigates the control problem of the buoyancy regulation system for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). There are some problems to be considered in the oil-water conversion-based buoyancy regulation system, including the external seawater pressure, the pressure fluctuations, and the slow switching speed of the ball valve. The control accuracy of the buoyancy regulation under the traditional PID controller cannot meet the requirements of the project. In this paper, a fuzzy sliding mode control scheme is developed for the buoyancy regulation system to solve the abovementioned problems. At first, a mathematical model of the buoyancy regulation system is established, and the stability of the system is analyzed. Then, the sliding mode control algorithm is combined with the fuzzy system to improve the control accuracy. Finally, the pool-experiment results on a prototype show that the developed control scheme can meet the requirements of the control accuracy for the buoyancy regulation system.

AB New trends in the automotive industry such as autonomous driving and Car2X require a large amount of data to be exchanged between different devices. Radar sensors are key components in developing vehicles of the future, therefore these devices are used in a large spectrum of applications, where data traffic is of paramount importance. As a result, communication traffic volumes have become more complex, leading to the research of optimization approaches to be applied at the AUTOSAR level. Our paper offers such an optimization solution at the AUTOSAR communication level. The radar sensor is accessed in a remote manner, and the experiments aimed at performance measurements revealed that our solution is superior to the Full AUTOSAR implementation in terms of memory usage and runtime measurements.

AB Innovative applications in rapidly evolving domains such as robotic navigation and autonomous (driverless) vehicles rely on motion planning systems that meet the shortest path and obstacle avoidance requirements. This article proposes a novel path planning algorithm based on jump point search and Bezier curves. The proposed algorithm consists of two main steps. In the front end, the improved heuristic function based on distance and direction is used to reduce the cost, and the redundant turning points are trimmed. In the back end, a novel trajectory generation method based on Bezier curves and a straight line is proposed. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides a complete motion planning solution from the front end to the back end, which can realize an optimal trajectory from the initial point to the target point used for robot navigation.

AB Merging in congested freeway traffic is a significant challenge toward realizing fully automated (level 4) driving. Merging vehicles need to decide not only how to merge safely into a spot, but also where to merge. We present a method for freeway merge based on multipolicy decision making coupled with a reinforcement learning technique called passive actor-critic (pAC), which learns with less knowledge of the system and without active exploration. The multipolicy decision making selects a candidate spot formerging by using the state value learned by pAC. Together, these techniques yield a method that first decides where to merge and then realizes safe merging. We evaluate our method using real traffic data. Our experiments show that pAC achieves an overall success rate of 92% for merging into a predetermined spot on a freeway, which is comparable to human decision making.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS
AB This paper describes a genetic algorithm planning method for autonomous robots in unstructured environments, It presents the approach and demonstrates its application to a laboratory planetary exploration problem. The method represents activities of the robot with discrete actions, or action modules. The action modules are assembled into an action plan with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). A successful plan allows the robot to complete the task without violating any physical constraints. Plans are developed that explicitly consider constraints such as power actuator saturation, wheel slip, and vehicle stability. These are verified using analytical models of the robot and environment, The methodology is described in the Context of planetary exploration similar to the NASA Mars Pathfinder mission. More aggressive missions are planned where rovers will explore scientifically important areas that are difficult to reach (e.g., ravines, craters, dry riverbeds, and steep cliffs). The proposed approach is designed for such areas.

TI Mini-UAV attitude estimation using an inertially stabilized payload
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB A novel method is introduced for autonomous attitude estimation of a mini unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying an inertially stabilized payload. The method is based on utilizing the outputs of rate gyros normally used to inertially stabilize the payload, and other data that is normally available from conventional aircraft-mounted sensors. A decentralized estimation algorithm is developed, which uses the aircraft/payload mathematical models to bound the estimation errors. Exploiting modern multiprocessor computer technology, the new estimation algorithm comprises two parallel extended Kalman filters (EKFs) and a data fusion algorithm. Real-time experimental tests, incorporating a payload model with real rate gyros mounted on a three-axis flight table, have validated the feasibility of the concept. The theoretical and experimental investigation demonstrates that the estimation algorithm is capable of estimating the attitude angles with an estimation error not exceeding 1 deg, at output rates of 13 Hz, thus constituting a viable substitute for the conventional vertical gyroscope.

AB Emissions of particulate matter into the atmosphere are essential to characterize, in terms of properties such as particle size, morphology, and composition, to better understand impacts on public health and the climate. However, there is no currently available technology capable of measuring individual particles with such high detail over the extensive domains associated with events such as wildfires or volcanic eruptions. To solve this problem, we present an autonomous measurement system involving an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) coupled with a digital inline holographic microscope for in situ particle diagnostics. The flight control uses computer vision to localize and then trace the movements of particle-laden flows while sampling particles to determine their properties as they are transported away from their source. We demonstrate this system applied to measuring particulate matter in smoke plumes and discuss broader implications for this type of system in similar applications.

AB This paper presents an efficient method for securing navigation performance by suppressing divergence risk of LiDAR SLAM through a newly proposed geometric observability analysis in a three-dimensional point cloud map. For this, observability characteristics are introduced that quantitatively evaluate the quality of the geometric distribution of the features. To be specific, this study adapts a 3D geometric observability matrix and the associated condition number for developing numerical benefit. In an extensive application, we implemented path planning in which the enhanced SLAM performs smoothly based on the proposed method. Finally, to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a simulation study was performed using the high-fidelity Gazebo simulator, where the path planning strategy of a drone depending on navigation quality is demonstrated. Additionally, an indoor autonomous vehicle experimental result is presented to support the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB LiDAR sensors can produce point clouds with precise 3D depth information that is essential for autonomous vehicles and robotic systems. As a perception task, point cloud clustering algorithms can be applied to segment the points into object instances. In this brief, we propose a novel, hardware-friendly fast channel clustering (FCC) algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance when evaluated using KITTI panoptic segmentation benchmark. Furthermore, an efficient, pipeline hardware architecture is proposed to implement the FCC algorithm on an FPGA. Experiments show that the hardware design can process each LiDAR frame with 64 channels, 2048 horizontal resolution at various point sparsity in 1.93 ms, which is more than 471.5 times faster than running on the CPU. The code will be released to the public via GitHub.

DE Stereopsis; LiDAR; Stereo matching; Epipolar constraint; Segmentation;

AB The paper proposes a light-weighted stereo frustums matching module for 3D objection detection. The proposed framework takes advantage of a high-performance 2D detector and a point cloud segmentation network to regress 3D bounding boxes for autonomous driving vehicles. Instead of performing traditional stereo matching to compute disparities, the module directly takes the 2D proposals from both the left and the right views as input. Based on the epipolar constraints recovered from the well-calibrated stereo cameras, we propose four matching algorithms to search for the best match for each proposal between the stereo image pairs. Each matching pair proposes a segmentation of the scene which is then fed into a 3D bounding box regression network. Results of extensive experiments on KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed Siamese pipeline outperforms the state-of-the-art stereo-based 3D bounding box regression methods.

ID PROBABILITY; SAMPLES; SAFETY
AB Most people struggle to understand probability which is an issue for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) researchers who need to communicate risks and uncertainties to the participants in their studies, the media and policy makers. Previous work showed that even the use of numerical values to express probabilities does not guarantee an accurate understanding by laypeople. We therefore investigate if words can be used to communicate probability, such as "likely" and "almost certainly not". We embedded these phrases in the context of the usage of autonomous vehicles. The results show that the association of phrases to percentages is not random and there is a preferred order of phrases. The association is, however, not as consistent as hoped for. Hence, it would be advisable to complement the use of words with numerical expression of uncertainty. This study provides an empirically verified list of probabilities phrases that HRI researchers can use to complement the numerical values.

ID TRACKING CONTROL; STABILIZATION
AB In the literature of control theory, tracking control of port controlled Hamiltonian systems is generally achieved using canonical transformation. Closed form evaluation of state-feedback for the canonical transformation requires the solution of certain partial differential equations which becomes very difficult for nonlinear systems. This paper presents the application of neural networks for the canonical transformation of port controlled Hamiltonian systems. Instead of solving the partial differential equations, neural networks are used to approximate the closed-form state-feedback required for canonical transformation. Ultimate boundedness of the tracking and neural network weight errors is guaranteed. The proposed approach is structure preserving. The application of neural networks isdirectand off-line processing of neural networks is not needed. Efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the examples of a mass-spring system, a two-link robot arm and an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).

ID ALGORITHM
AB Future electrified autonomous vehicles demand higly accurate knowledge of their system states to guarantee a high-fidelity and reliable control. This constitutes a challenging task-firstly, due to rising complexity and operational safeness, and secondly, due to the need for embedded service oriented architecture which demands a continuous development of new functionalities. Based on this, a novel model based Kalman filter framework is outlined in this publication, which enables the automatic incorporation of multiphysical Modelica models into discrete-time estimation algorithms. Additionally, these estimation algorithms are extended with nonlinear inequality constraint handling functionalities. The proposed framework is applied to a constrained nonlinear state of charge lithium-ion cell observer and is validated with experimental data.

AB With the emergence of unmanned plane, autonomous vehicles, face recognition, and language processing, the artificial intelligence (AI) has remarkably revolutionized our lifestyle. Recent studies indicate that AI has astounding potential to perform much better than human beings in some tasks, especially in the image recognition field. As the amount of image data in imaging center of ophthalmology is increasing dramatically, analyzing and processing these data is in urgent need. AI has been tried to apply to decipher medical data and has made extraordinary progress in intelligent diagnosis. In this paper, we presented the basic workflow for building an AI model and systematically reviewed applications of AI in the diagnosis of eye diseases. Future work should focus on setting up systematic AI platforms to diagnose general eye diseases based on multimodal data in the real world.

AB The stixel world is a simplification of the world in which obstacles are represented as vertical instances, called stixels, standing on a surface assumed to be planar. In this paper, previous approaches for stixel tracking are extended using a two-level scheme. In the first level, stixels are tracked by matching them between frames using a bipartite graph in which edges represent a matching cost function. Then, stixels are clustered into sets representing objects in the environment. These objects are matched based on the number of stixels paired inside them. Furthermore, a faster, but less accurate approach is proposed in which only the second level is used. Several configurations of our method are compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach to show how our methodology outperforms it in several areas, including an improvement in the quality of the depth reconstruction.

AB This paper aims to describe the design of a robot dolphin with a voluntary movement function. First, a motion mechanism is described based on 3D motion analysis to determine the length of each link and the swing angle of each joint in the robot dolphin. Two microchips are used to control the swing angle of the actuator in each joint. In order to understand the motion characteristics of the robot dolphin, a microcomputer is installed in order to obtain various motion data. The experimental data for three-axis accelerations and three-axis angles are found to be the same as the oscillatory frequency of the robot dolphin in the swing forward motion. The robot dolphin is designed to possess an avoidable collision function and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence consists of the preprocessing image and back-propagation learning to implement specific motion identification.

AB Drone images from an experimental field cropped with sugar beet with a high diffusion of weeds taken from different flying altitudes were used to develop and test a machine learning method for vegetation patch identification. Georeferenced images were combined with a hue-based preprocessing analysis, digital transformation by an image embedder, and evaluation by supervised learning. Specifically, six of the most common machine learning algorithms were applied (i.e., logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, neural network, and support-vector machine). The proposed method was able to precisely recognize crops and weeds throughout a wide cultivation field, training from single partial images. The information has been designed to be easily integrated into autonomous weed management systems with the aim of reducing the use of water, nutrients, and herbicides for precision agriculture.

AB This paper enhanced the autonomy of a mobile agricultural robot in a structured environment to find an optimal path to perform selective and variable spraying of pesticides. To materialize these, a robust VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem) scheme with deterministic variable demand and nonlinear travel time is designed to navigate the robot while making decisions to fulfill the pesticide demand at each node. The nonlinear time function obtained from experiments necessitates the consideration of three objectives simultaneously. The NSGA (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm)-III algorithm is adopted to determine the optimal path for the robot. To achieve this, the mixed integer algorithm is modified to handle the full integer complex routing problem to optimize three test case scenarios. Finally, the NSGA-III has shown the capability to solve the full integer constraint problem based on the proposed modifications.

AB Lane detection is one of the most basic and essential tasks for autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the fast and accurate recognition of lanes has become a hot topic in industry and academia. Deep learning based on a neural network is also a common method for lane detection. However, due to the huge computational burden of the neural network, its real-time performance is often difficult to meet the requirements in the fast-changing actual driving scenes. A lightweight network combining the Squeeze-and-Excitation block and the Self-Attention Distillation module is proposed in this paper, which is based on the existing deeplabv3plus network and specifically improves its real-time performance. After experimental verification, the proposed network achieved 97.49% accuracy and 60.0% MIOU at a run time of 8.7 ms, so the network structure achieves a good trade-off between real-time performance and accuracy.

AB Automated driving has attracted intense attention in the media and among the general public, based on extremely optimistic predictions from some industry participants, but these have started to become more realistic in the last couple of years, after the "hype cycle" for automation peaked. This paper explains the opportunities for Automated Driving System (ADS) technology to improve the urban transport of people and goods, together with the challenges that will limit the scope and timing of the deployment of urban ADS. The discussion emphasizes the diversity of ADS applications and services, each of which has its own opportunities, challenges, and uncertainties, leading to diverse deployment scopes and schedules. The associated challenges are sufficiently daunting that ADS deployment will lag behind electrification and connectivity, leaving more time for cities to prepare for it.

AB The utilization of edge-enabled cloud computing in unmanned aerial vehicles has facilitated advances in autonomous control by employing computationally intensive algorithms frequently related to traversal among different locations in an environment. A significant problem remains in designing an effective strategy to offload tasks from the edge to the cloud. This work focuses on creating such a strategy by employing a network evaluation method built on the mean opinion score metrics in concoction with machine learning algorithms for path length prediction to assess computational complexity and classification models to perform an offloading decision on the data provided by both network metrics and solution depth prediction. The proposed system is applied to the A* path planning algorithm, and the presented results demonstrate up to 94% accuracy in offloading decisions.

AB Both path and speed planning play key roles in automated driving, specially when a certain comfort level is required. This paper proposes a human-like speed planning method for already defined paths while minimizing travel time. The proposed method is able to compute a time-optimal speed profile that meet the given constrains with regard to speed, acceleration and jerk. For this purpose, an initial acceleration-limited approach is introduced. This algorithm serves as a starting point for the subsequent jerk-limited speed planning. Moreover, fallback strategies are included to manage critical driving situations where initial or final conditions cannot be met. The proposed approach has been tested and validated in an experimental platform through extensive trials in real environments.

AB In order to apply control theory in small autonomous vehicles, mathematical models with small numbers of states are required for using the limited computational power in embedded programming. In this paper, we consider an artificial fishtail as an example for a complex mechanical system with a second-order large-scale model, which is derived by using the finite element method. To meet the above limitations, the several hundreds of thousands of degrees of freedom need to be reduced to merely a handful of surrogate degrees of freedom.
   We seek to achieve this task by various second-order model order reduction methods. All methods are applied on the fishtail's matrices and their results are evaluated and compared in the frequency domain as well as in the time domain.

AB Safety analysis of resting on the seafloor of the AUV with mooring system mainly includes two parts, stability analysis and chain impact analysis. In order to analyze this problem, mathematical model of 6-DOF motion of the AUV is established. Stability analysis model is established and an example is presented to verify its correctness. Combined with the characteristics of this AUV, mathematic models of chain impact analysis are established. Based on this, simulation system of motion and chain impact under disturbance is established using MATLAB. Based on the simulation system, the motion and forces of chain of the AUV when resting on the seafloor under disturbance are analyzed and the safety of AUV is verified. Conclusions in this paper will provide theoretical basis to mooring system design and improvement of the AUV.

AB We suggest a novel algorithm that tracks given shapes in real time from a low-quality video stream. The algorithm is based on a careful selection of a small subset of pixels that suffices to obtain an approximation of the observed shape. The shape can then be extracted quickly from the small subset. We implemented the algorithm in a system for mutual localization of a group of low-cost toy-quadcopters. Each quadcopter carries only a single 8-g RGB camera, and stabilizes itself via real-time tracking of the other quadcopters in similar to 30 frames/s. Existing algorithms for real-time shape fitting are based on more expensive hardware, external cameras, or have significantly worse performance. We provide full open source to our algorithm, experimental results, benchmarks, and video that demonstrates our system. We then discuss generalizations to other shapes and extensions for more robotics applications.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveys of temperature, salinity, and velocity in the upper 10 m of the ocean were carried out in low-wind conditions near the North Atlantic surface salinity maximum as part of the Salinity Processes in the Upper Ocean Regional Study (SPURS) project. Starting from a well-mixed state, the development, deepening, and decay of a warm salty diurnal surface layer was observed at <1-h resolution. The evaporation rate deduced from the freshwater anomaly of the layer corroborates measurements at a nearby flux mooring. Profiles within a few hundred meters of the stationary research vessel showed evidence of mixing, highlighting the effectiveness of AUVs for collecting uncontaminated time series of near-surface thermohaline structure. A two-dimensional horizontal subsurface survey within the diurnal warm layer revealed coherent warm and cool bands, which are interpreted as internal waves on the diurnal thermocline.

AB With an ultimate range up to 1000 km, a maximum operating depth of 6000 in, and a generous payload capacity, Autosub6000 is well placed to become one of the world's most capable deep diving Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Recently, Autosub6000 successfully completed its first deep water engineering trials, and in September 2008, fitted with a multibeam sonar, will carry out its first science missions. This paper will describe how we are tackling the design issues that specifically affect a deep diving AUV which must be capable of operating with true autonomy, independently of the mother ship, namely: carrying adequate energy for long endurance and range, coping with varying buoyancy, and maintaining accurate navigation throughout missions lasting up to several days. Results from the recent engineering trails are presented, and future missions and development plans are discussed.

AB This paper introduces a model-based approach to estimating longitudinal wheel slip and detecting immobilized conditions of autonomous mobile robots operating on outdoor terrain. A novel tire traction/braking model is presented and used to calculate vehicle dynamic forces in an extended Kalman filter framework. Estimates of external forces and robot velocity are derived using measurements from wheel encoders, inertial measurement unit, and GPS. Weak constraints are used to constrain the evolution of the resistive force estimate based upon physical reasoning. Experimental results show the technique accurately and rapidly detects robot immobilization conditions while providing estimates of the robot's velocity during normal driving. Immobilization detection is shown to be robust to uncertainty in tire model parameters. Accurate immobilization detection is demonstrated in the absence of GPS, indicating the algorithm is applicable for both terrestrial applications and space robotics.

AB Autonomous vehicle systems have been the topic of much research owing to their ability to perform dangerous, repetitive and automated tasks in remote or hazardous environments. The potential for multivehicle systems cooperating together to accomplish given tasks is starting to draw together researchers from several fields, including robotics, control systems, and computer science. Using selected case studies as a motivation, this paper examines emerging results in networked multivehicle systems. Recent work has taken many different directions, such as hybrid systems, distributed control, differential games, control architectures, and artificial intelligence. The focus of this paper is on the control systems perspective. An attempt is made to present some current issues common to networked multivehicle systems, and to show how they have been solved to date in the perspective of the case studies.

AB This paper presents a nonsingular terminal sliding mode and active disturbance rejection decoupling control (NTSM-ADRDC) scheme for the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). Firstly, the AUV model is decoupled into five independent single input-single output (SISO) channels using ADRDC technology. Secondly, the NTSM-ADRDC controller is designed. The linear extended state observer (LESO) is used to observe the AUV state variables, and estimate the total disturbance of the system. In addition, to improve the system error convergence rate, the combination of exponential reaching rate and NTSM constitutes a nonlinear states error feedback control law for the controller. Finally, the stability of the proposed control law is proved using the Lyapunov theory. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the designed NTSM-ADRDC trajectory tracking approach.

IoT applications and services are widely adopted in environments such as smart cities, smart industry, autonomous vehicles, and eHealth. As such, IoT devices are ubiquitously connected, transferring sensitive and personal data without requiring human interaction. Consequently, it is crucial to preserve data privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent Machine Learning (ML)- and Deep Learning (DL)-based solutions for privacy in IoT. First, we present an in depth analysis of current privacy threats and attacks. Then, for each ML architecture proposed, we present the implementations, details, and the published results. Finally, we identify the most effective solutions for the different threats and attacks.

AB This letter describes a means to produce emergent collaboration between a human driver and an artificial co-driver agent. The work exploits the hypothesis that human-human cooperation emerges from a shared understanding of the given context's affordances and emulates the same principle: the observation of one agent's behavior steers another agent's decision-making by favoring the selection of the goals that would produce the observed activity. Specifically, we describe how to steer the decision-making of a special self-driving agent via weighting the agent's action selection process with input from a dummy human driving activity. In this way, human input maps onto the safe and affordable actions recognized by the agent. We demonstrate an emergent and efficient driving, collaboration, and rejection of unsafe human requests.

ID DYNAMICS
AB Reinforcement learning has been intensively investigated and developed in artificial intelligence in the absence of training data, such as autonomous driving vehicles, robot control, internet advertising, and elastic optical networks. However, the computational cost of reinforcement learning with deep neural networks is extremely high and reducing the learning cost is a challenging issue. We propose a photonic on-line implementation of reinforcement learning using optoelectronic delay-based reservoir computing, both experimentally and numerically. In the proposed scheme, we accelerate reinforcement learning at a rate of several megahertz because there is no required learning process for the internal connection weights in reservoir computing. We perform two benchmark tasks, CartPole-v0 and MountanCar-v0 tasks, to evaluate the proposed scheme. Our results represent the first hardware implementation of reinforcement learning based on photonic reservoir computing and pave the way for fast and efficient reinforcement learning as a novel photonic accelerator.

AB Human action recognition using various sensors is a mandatory component of autonomous vehicles, hu-manoid robots, and ambient living environments. A particular interest is the detection and recognition of falls. In this paper, we propose the use of temporal convolution networks guided by knowledge distilla-tion for detecting falls and recognizing types of falls using accelerometer data. Tri-axial accelerometers attached to the body measure the acceleration of the body joints when an action occurs. These data are used for pattern analysis and body action recognition. We demonstrate the existence of biases caused by soft biometrics when recognizing human body actions. We introduce a causal network to capture the influences of biases on system performance and illustrate how knowledge distillation can be applied to mitigate the bias effect.

ID CONSTELLATION
AB Radio frequency (RF) relative measurement provides an effective means of communication and autonomous navigation for the spacecraft formation flying. Multipath and Doppler are two main factors that affect the accuracy of RF relative measurement. In this study, a framework that exploits joint multipath-Doppler diversity is proposed to reduce multipath errors and improve the measurement accuracy. The proposed framework first utilizes an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) estimator to estimate the parameters of Doppler and multipath. Different from existing research, the proposed framework reconstructs the received signal according to the estimated parameters, so as to mitigate multipath signals and enhance the direct signal. Numerical results demonstrate that the framework is suitable for both multipath and multipath-Doppler scenarios, and has a significant performance improvement over existing multipath mitigation methods.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), which are becoming more and more important in ocean exploitation tasks, needs energy conservation urgently when sailing the complex mission path in long time cruise. As hull lines optimization design becomes the key factor, which closely related with resistance, in AUV preliminary design stage, uncertainty parameters need to be considered seriously. In this research, Myring axial symmetry revolution body with parameterized expression is assumed as AUV hull lines, and its travelling resistance is obtained via modified DATCOM formula. The problems of AUV hull lines design for the minimum travelling resistance with uncertain parameters are studied. Based on reliability-based optimization design technology, Design For Six Sigma (DFSS) for high quality level is conducted, and is proved more reliability for the actual environment disturbance.

AB The ionosphere has been the most challenging source of error to mitigate within the community of global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based safety-critical systems. Users of those systems should be assured that the difference between an unknown true position and a system-derived position estimate is bounded with an extremely high degree of confidence. One of the major concerns for meeting this requirement, known as integrity, is ionosphere-induced error or discontinuity of GNSS signals significant enough to threaten the safety of users. The potentially hazardous ionospheric anomalies of interest in this article are ionospheric spatial decorrelation and ionospheric scintillation under disturbed conditions. As the demand of safety-critical navigation - applications increases with the rapid growth of the autonomous vehicle sector, ionospheric monitoring and mitigation techniques become more important to support such systems.

AB This paper presents a method for simultaneous segmentation and modeling of objects, detected in range data gathered by a laser scanner mounted onboard ground-robotic platforms. Superquadrics are used as model for both segmentation and object shape fitting. The proposed method, which we name Simultaneous Segmentation and Superquadrics Fitting, relies on a novel global objective function that accounts for the size of the object and the distance of range points, and for partial occlusions. Results on experimental 2-D range data, which are collected from indoor and outdoor environments, are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Results are compared with those from popular and state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Moreover, we present results on 3-D data obtained from an in-house setup and also from a Velodyne LIDAR. This paper finds applications in areas of mobile robotics and autonomous vehicles, namely object detection, segmentation, and modeling.

AB In this note, we introduce the framework of partial difference equations (PdEs) over graphs for analyzing the behavior of multi-agent systems equipped with decentralized control schemes. Both leaderless and leader-follower models are considered. PdEs mimic partial differential equations (PDEs) on graphs and can be studied by introducing concepts of functional analysis strongly inspired to the corresponding ones arising in PDEs theory. We generalize different models proposed in the literature by introducing errors in the agent dynamics and analyze agent coordination through the joint use of PdEs and automatic control tools. Moreover, for the simplest control schemes, we show that the resulting PdEs enjoy properties that are similar to those of well-known PDEs like the heat equation, thus allowing to exploit physical-based reasoning for conjecturing formation properties.

AB In [1], we modeled the problem of safe site visitation sequencing for an unmanned reconnaissance aerial vehicle (URAV) in graph-theoretic language. Our goal was to uncover several alternative flight paths along which the URAV can fly safely, no more than once, to all sites of interest. We offered a solution to a simpler abstraction of this problem using GAs - if we could not uncover any Hamiltonian cycles we reported maximally long paths between any two vertices. This work reports two orthogonal extensions of [1]-a. In addition to possibly reporting Hamiltonian cycles, the GA reports several alternative long paths that begin at the airbase. b. A randomized version of the gene migration scheme is used. The randomization does not appear to affect the quality of the best plan. However it raises the average quality of the best k plans. We give a modified gene encoding scheme and report simulation results.

TI 3D measurement using rotating line-scan sensors
SO MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes work which has been carried out to investigate a rotating stereoscopic imaging system consisting of two line-scan cameras for measurement. Algorithms have been proposed and experimentally tested which allow three-dimensional co-ordinates to be derived from a defined object workspace. The use of stereoscopic imaging is not new; however, what is novel in this approach is the method used to produce panoramic images of the workspace surrounding the rotating line-scan camera. This system is particularly suited to applications which require the 'all-round' observation of a scene. These include autonomous vehicle guidance and path-planning for complex manipulator manoeuvres. The results indicate that the positions of targets can be determined, at best, to a measurement accuracy of within +/-0.5 mm in the X axis (horizontal), +/-0.6 mm in the Y axis (vertical) and +/-1.2 mm in the Z axis (range) at a camera-to-object range of 1.5 m.

AB Complete streets scheme makes seminal contributions to securing the basic public right-of-way (ROW), improving road safety, and maintaining high traffic efficiency for all modes of commute. However, such a popular street design paradigm also faces endogenous pressures like the appeal to a more balanced ROW for non-vehicular users. In addition, the deployment of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) mobility is likely to challenge the conventional use of the street space as well as this scheme. Previous studies have invented automated control techniques for specific road management issues, such as traffic light control and lane management. Whereas models and algorithms that dynamically calibrate the ROW of road space corresponding to travel demands and place-making requirements still represent a research gap. This study proposes a novel optimal control method that decides the ROW of road space assigned to driveways and sidewalks in real-time. To solve this optimal control task, a reinforcement learning method is introduced that employs a microscopic traffic simulator, namely SUMO, as its environment. The model was trained for 150 episodes using a four-legged intersection and joint AVs-pedestrian travel demands of a day. Results evidenced the effectiveness of the model in both symmetric and asymmetric road settings. After being trained by 150 episodes, our proposed model significantly increased its comprehensive reward of both pedestrians and vehicular traffic efficiency and sidewalk ratio by 10.39%. Decisions on the balanced ROW are optimised as 90.16% of the edges decrease the driveways supply and raise sidewalk shares by approximately 9%. Moreover, during 18.22% of the tested time slots, a lane-width equivalent space is shifted from driveways to sidewalks, minimising the travel costs for both an AV fleet and pedestrians. Our study primarily contributes to the modelling architecture and algorithms concerning centralised and real-time ROW management. Prospective applications out of this method are likely to facilitate AV mobility-oriented road management and pedestrian-friendly street space design in the near future.

AB The marine self-potential (SP) method is used to explore for hydrothermal venting and associated seafloor mineralization. Measurements are commonly made in deep water using instruments towed close to the seafloor, which requires dedicated ship time, is limited to slow speeds, and is subject to navigation errors. Instead, we mounted a three-axis electric field receiver on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and tested the method with data collected in the Iheya area of the Okinawa Trough, off Japan. Parts of this prospect have documented hydrothermal venting and seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits. An International Submarine Engineering Limited explorer-class AUV was fitted with a controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) amplifier and logging system, modified to collect DC SP data using silver chloride electrodes on approximately 1 m dipoles. A 1 km x 1 km area was surveyed with a flight pattern of six lines, collected three times to assess repeatability and noise levels. The entire data set was collected in a single day on station with a 10 hr AUV deployment. Flying height was 70 m, navigation errors were less than 3 m, collection speed was 1.1 m s(-1) and electric field noise levels were less than 5 mu V m(-1). Localized anomalies of 0.3 mV m(-1) were observed, from which potentials were estimated using regularized inversion, yielding negative SP anomalies of 15-25 mV. Modelling electric field data as dipoles shows that the negative poles causing the anomalies are localized near the seafloor with a diffuse return current deeper than 1000 m below seafloor. Apparent conductivities as high as 30 S m(-1) were derived from CSEM data collected during the same deployment, which strongly suggests that SMS mineralization is associated with one of the SP anomalies, although the localization near the seafloor and the lack of a dipolar signal suggest that the causative mechanism for the SP anomalies is due to hydrothermal venting. In either case, we have demonstrated that AUV-mounted instrument systems are an efficient, effective and low noise means of collecting marine SP data.

AB Semantic segmentation as one of the most popular scene perception techniques has been studied for autonomous vehicles. However, deep learning-based solutions rely on the volume and quality of data, and knowledge from specific scene might not be incorporated. A novel knowledge-driven semantic segmentation method is proposed for waterway scene perception. Based on the knowledge that water is irregular and dynamically changing, a life time-of feature (LToF) detector is designed to distinguish water region from surrounding scene. Using a Bayesian framework, the detector as the likelihood function is combined with U-Net-based semantic segmentation to achieve an optimized solution. Finally, two public datasets and typical semantic segmentation networks, FlowNet, DeepLab, and DVSNet are selected to evaluate the proposed method. Also, the sensitivity of these methods and ours to the dataset is discussed.

AB Drones are used increasingly for agricultural surveillance. The limited flight range of drones poses a problem for surveillance of large, inaccessible areas. One possible solution is to place autonomous, solar-powered charging stations within the area of interest, where the drone can recharge during its mission. This paper designs and implements a software system for planning low-cost drone coverage of large areas. The software produces a feasible, cost-minimizing charging station placement, as well as a drone path specification. Multiple optimizations are required, which are formulated as integer linear programs. In extensive simulations, the resulting drone paths achieved 70-90 percent of theoretical optimal performance in terms of minimizing mission time for a given number of charging stations, for a variety of field configurations.

AB In this paper, a novel nonsingular finite-time backstepping controller is constructed for trajectory tracking of marine vessel subject to unknown external disturbances. Firstly, in the presence of disturbances, a disturbance observer (DO) is proposed to estimate and compensate the disturbances exactly in finite time. Secondly, a finite-time tracking controller is designed in the classical backstepping procedure, however, the inevitable singularity appears in calculating the derivative of virtual control. Furthermore, for overcoming this singularity, a nonsingular finite-time backstepping controller is designed by adopting a finite-time command filter to estimate the derivative, instead of calculating it directly. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. Finally, simulation results and comparisons illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB U-CAT is a highly maneuverable biomimetic four-fin underwater robot for operating in confined spaces. Because of its novel mechanical design and specialized purpose, the traditional autonomous underwater robot controlmethods are not directly applicable on U-CAT. This paper proposes a novel modular control architecture that can be adopted for different application scenarios. Within this framework, we implement and test several 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) controllers and discuss the test results. Further-more, we describe and implement an actuation coupling method by prioritizing the selection of DOF with fuzzy membership functions and demonstrate the approach for 3-DOF control. The results show that the proposed DOF prioritization approach helps us to improve tracking both in the case of human in the loop and automatic control. Finally, we describe long-duration field experiments in realistic environmental conditions.

AB This paper presents a hybrid controller that combines sliding-mode control (SMC) with a fuzzy strategy to regulate the vertical displacement of a bioinspired robotic dolphin. The structure of the robot and a simplified mathematical model for depth control are described. An SMC based on the line-of-sight guidance law and the slidingmode observer is developed to overcome systematic uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to analyze the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system. Depth control in the physical robot is realized by utilizing a fuzzy logic controller, which is represented as the mapping of the input propulsion forces/ moments and output control parameters. Numerical and experimental results show that the proposed control strategy successfully steers the robot toward and along the desired depth.

DE Multi-AUV cooperative system; Reliability; Mutative topology structure;
   Interactive Markov chains model
AB In the real practice of multi-AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) cooperative systems, tasks or malfunctions will change the topology. The process of mutative topology structure will affect the reliability of multi-AUV cooperative system. The interactive Markov chains model, which is an intercurrent model of functional action and capability index, is selected to reflect the reliability of topology-changed multi-AUV cooperative systems. In this model, multi-AUV cooperative systems are described by the conception-"Action". The concept of "action transfer" is used to describe the topology-changed multi-AUV cooperative system, and model checking is used to solve the interactive Markov chains, giving the probability of reliability within a certain time for the system. The result shows that the method proposed in this paper has a practical value.

AB There is a persistent need for high resolution photographic images of the sea floor and associated biota for marine habitat classification and fisheries stock assessment. This paper presents a novel low cost Lagrangian imaging platform that offers high quality images with reduced operational demands in comparison to existing methodologies such as diver surveys, drop cameras, ship towed systems and dedicated remote or autonomous underwater vehicles. The platform consists of a recently developed bottom following Lagrangian float fit with down looking stereo cameras and strobe lighting. The float can use active ballasting to perform constant altitude photographic drift surveys in coastal waters over varying bathymetry. Images from the float can be used to create large photomosaics, stereographic bathymetry estimates and image-derived current measurements. Test data are presented to demonstrate the operation of the Lagrangian float and summarize the data products. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SENSOR MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHMS
AB This paper discusses the application of the theory of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to the design of guidance algorithms for controlling the motion of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with onboard sensors to improve tracking of multiple ground targets. While POMDP problems are intractable to solve exactly, principled approximation methods can be devised based on the theory that characterizes optimal solutions. A new approximation method called nominal belief-state optimization (NBO), combined with other application-specific approximations and techniques within the POMDP framework, produces a practical design that coordinates the UAVs to achieve good long-term mean-squared-error tracking performance in the presence of occlusions and dynamic constraints. The flexibility of the design is demonstrated by extending the objective to reduce the probability of a track swap in ambiguous situations. Copyright (C) 2009 Scott A. Miller et al.

AB Experimental research in biology has uncovered a number of different ways in which flying insects use cues derived from optical flow for navigational purposes, such as safe landing, obstacle avoidance and dead reckoning. In this study, we use a synthetic methodology to gain additional insights into the navigation behavior of bees. Specifically, we focus on the mechanisms of course stabilization behavior and visually mediated odometer by using a biological model of motion detector for the purpose of long-range goal-directed navigation in 3D environment. The performance tests of the proposed navigation method are conducted by using a blimp-type flying robot platform in uncontrolled indoor environments. The result shows that the proposed mechanism can be used for goal-directed navigation. Further analysis is also conducted in order to enhance the navigation performance of autonomous aerial vehicles.

AB Analogic CNN-based road boundary detection algorithm for fast and optimal driving of autonomous vehicle is proposed. The CNN is a massively connected analog parallel array processor. In the previous study, the dynamic programming which is an efficient algorithm to find the optimal path is implemented with the CNN algorithm [1]. Due to the parallelism of the CNN structure, the processing speed of the CNN-based dynamic programming is expected to be very fast. The proposed study is an extension of previous optimal path finding algorithm for high speed road-boundary detection. If the road-edge images are utilized as the space variant weights and if the goal and the start lines are positioned at the top and the bottom of the image, respectively, the optimal path finding concept can be exploited for the road boundary detection. The proposed road boundary algorithm is described and simulation results are included.

AB Sample-based computation of the joint-time probability of collision motivates developing the Mahalanobis Shell Sampling (MSS) algorithm, which samples nondegenerate normal random variables, enabling rare event simulation without unduly penalizing sample size. The MSS method has unbiased estimators in sample mean and covariance, and it may achieve arbitrary precision when approximating probability measures. For Clohessy-Wiltshire relative orbital dynamics, computational MSS exponential rates of error convergence (in the mean-square-error sense) are shown to improve by one order of magnitude (for sample mean and covariance) over Monte Carlo; when reproducing the instantaneous probability of collision, MSS has a comparable mean-square-error convergence rate performance to Monte Carlo.

AB In this letter, we investigate the problem of remote spectrum mapping with inaccessible areas, whose goal is to estimate the spatial power of the unreachable area with a small amount of sampled data in the reachable area. First, we establish a remote compressed spectrum mapping (RCSM) model considering the constraint of unreachable areas. Then, in contrast with traditional random or fixed sampling, we propose an optimization algorithm for sampling location selection within the accessible area, by directly optimizing from the perspective of matrix determination maximization. Its computational complexity is further reduced without loss of performance. Finally, we develop a spatial power estimation algorithm for inaccessible areas based on alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical results verify the superiority of our RCSM algorithm in estimation performance and computational efficiency.

AB We present a modified velocity-obstacle (VO) algorithm that uses probabilistic partial observations of the environment to compute velocities and navigate a robot to a target. Our system uses commodity visual sensors, including a mono-camera and a 2D Lidar, to explicitly predict the velocities and positions of surrounding obstacles through optical flow estimation, object detection, and sensor fusion. A key aspect of our work is coupling the perception (OF: optical flow) and planning (VO) components for reliable navigation. Overall, our OF-VO algorithm using learning-based perception and model-based planning methods offers better performance than prior algorithms in terms of navigation time and success rate of collision avoidance. Our method also provides bounds on the probabilistic collision avoidance algorithm. We highlight the realtime performance of OF-VO on a Turtlebot navigating among pedestrians in both simulated and real-world scenes.

Based solely on a local gradient measurement from the airflow sensors, we propose and analyze a projected gradient ascent algorithm to solve the source-seeking problem. In the case of partial sensor failure, we propose a combination of extremum-seeking control with our projected gradient ascent algorithm. For both control laws, we prove the asymptotic convergence of the robot to the source.

   Squeeze-and-excitation network; Soft non-maximum suppression
AB Computer vision systems are major research items for autonomous vehicles. However, it is often challenging to understand the road scene, especially when objects are small and overlapping. To address these problems, this paper proposes a deep learning-based pedestrian detection method for small and overlapping objects. The proposed method adopts a parallel feature pyramid network with multi-scale feature layers, and the multi-scale squeeze-and-excitation (MSSE) module is proposed for better selection of multi-scale features. The proposed MSSE module helps to detect small objects by increasing the final feature resolution. In addition, channel-wise feature representation emphasizes important channels with reduced influence of weakly related features. Finally, the object's proposals are regressed using soft non-maximum suppression to differentiate the overlapped objects. The experiments show significant performance enhancement with the proposed method in an ablation study.

AB The location, velocity, and flight path angle of an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landing on a moving vessel are key factors for an optimal landing trajectory. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a method for calculating the optimal approach landing trajectory between an UAV and a small vessel. A numerical approach (iterative method) is used to calculate the optimal approach landing trajectory, and the initial lead is introduced in the calculation process of the UAV trajectory for the inclination and heading angle for accuracy improvement, so that the UAV can track and calculate the optimal landing trajectory with high precision. Compared with the variational method, the proposed method can calculate an optimal turning direction angle for the UAV during the landing. Simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and give optimal initialization values.

AB Computer vision has achieved impressive progress in recent years. Meanwhile, mobile phones have become the primary computing platforms for millions of people. In addition to mobile phones, many autonomous systems rely on visual data for making decisions, and some of these systems have limited energy (such as unmanned aerial vehicles also called drones and mobile robots). These systems rely on batteries, and energy efficiency is critical. This paper serves the following two main purposes. First, examine the state of the art for low-power solutions to detect objects in images. Since 2015, the IEEE Annual International Low-Power Image Recognition Challenge (LPIRC) has been held to identify the most energy-efficient computer vision solutions. This paper summarizes the 2018 winners' solutions. Second, suggest directions for research as well as opportunities for low-power computer vision.

DE Uncertainty optimization; AUV; Speed perturbation; Hull lines
AB The paper presents a new design method for uncertainty shape optimization of an axially symmetric body influenced by speed perturbations. Four types of perturbation parameters (constant, interval, probability and interval probability) are addressed, and applicable methods for each type are investigated. First, two uncertainty optimization methods are introduced: interval optimization and distributionally robust optimization under moment uncertainty. Shape formulae of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with a revised method for calculating resistance are then described. Finally, a model for AUV hull form optimization is provided, and several case studies that use different uncertainty optimization methods and parameters are presented. The case studies verify the feasibility and superiority of the novel approach. The results show that the new uncertainty optimization design method is very adaptable and useful in the design of an axially symmetric body, such as an AUV.

AB Assistive care robots operate in cluttered, complex environments, akin to human residences, and need to face sensor and actuator faults during their operation without compromising safety. In these situations, the system must foresee and provide reactions that are beyond robust in addition to compensating for uncertainty and volatility in its functioning. We propose a new control design framework based on the principles of antifragility. In this work, we provide a formal concept of antifragile control and outline the design procedures for creating a mobile robot trajectory-tracking antifragile controller. An extended comparative evaluation against other controllers and a methodical investigation of the performance under parametrizable uncertainty and errors is also provided. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of antifragile closed-loop control in volatile and unanticipated circumstances.

AB This paper presents a modified Sage-Husa adaptive Kalman filter-based SINS/DVL integrated navigation system for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), where DVL is employed to correct the navigation errors of SINS that accumulate over time. When negative definite items are large enough, different from the positive definiteness of noise matrices which cannot be guaranteed for the conventional Sage-Husa adaptive Kalman filter, the proposed modified Sage-Husa adaptive Kalman filter deletes the negative definite items of adaptive update laws of the noise matrix to ensure the convergence of the Sage-Husa adaptive Kalman filter. In other words, this method sacrifices some filtering precision to ensure the stability of the filter. The simulation tests are implemented to verify that expected navigation accuracy for AUV can be obtained using the proposed modified Sage-Husa adaptive Kalman filter.

AB The "Zero-G" is designated as a new class of underwater robot that is capable of unrestricted attitude control. A novel control scheme based on internal actuation using control moment gyros (CMGs) is developed to provide Zero-G class autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with this unique freedom in control. This is implemented in the CMG-actuated Zero-G class, internal kinematic underwater robot actuation (IKURA) system that was developed as part of this research. A series of experiments are performed to demonstrate the practical application of CMGs and verify the associated theoretical developments. The ability to actively stabilize the translational dynamics of the robot is assessed and unrestricted attitude control is demonstrated in an experiment that involves vertically pitched diving and surfacing in surge. Finally, potential applications for Zero-G class AUVs are discussed.

AB The problem of finding an automatic thresholding technique is well known in applications involving image differencing like visual-based surveillance systems, autonomous vehicle driving, etc. Among the algorithms proposed in the past years, the thresholding technique based on the stable Euler number method is considered one of the most promising in terms of visual results. Unfortunately its high computational complexity made it an impossible choice for real-time applications. The implementation here proposed, called fast Euler numbers, overcomes the problem since it calculates all the Euler numbers in just one single raster scan of the image. That is, it runs in O(hw), where h and w are the image's height and width, respectively. A technique for determining the optimal threshold, called zero crossing, is also proposed.

AB The operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imposes various challenges on radio spectrum management to achieve safe operation, efficient spectrum utilization, and coexistence with legacy wireless networks. Current spectrum schemes have limitations when applied to UAV networks due to the dynamic nature of UAV networks that require adaptive spectrum decisions and robust schemes that provide seamless and reliable services. Existing surveys mostly focus on UAV applications, channel models, and security challenges, with a lack of studies on spectrum management in the context of UAV networks. Further, current spectrum efforts focus on terrestrial networks that feature fixed infrastructure and less dynamicity as compared to UAV networks. This motivates the need to revisit existing approaches and identify suitable schemes that allow for the rapid integration of UAVs with existing wireless technologies. Motivated by this observation, this article presents a comprehensive survey on spectrum management for UAV operations. It identifies suitable management schemes that align with UAV features and requirements to enable safe and efficient usage of the radio spectrum. The article assumes coexistence with prevalent wireless technologies that occupy the spectrum. It first presents the ruling from policymakers and regulators and discusses operation bands and radio interfaces. It then introduces deployment scenarios (applications and architectures) as standalone or heterogeneous networks. This is followed by a systematic structure for the management tools that employ deterministic, opportunistic, and competitive schemes. In addition, network monitoring, patrolling, and enforcement schemes are identified. The survey also specifies key tools that can be leveraged for spectrum management solutions such as optimization and blockchain. Finally, it recognizes open research directions and challenges that need to be tackled to advance UAV communications.

AB Diapycnal mixing in the deep ocean is known to be much stronger in the vicinity of rough topography of mid-ocean ridges than above abyssal plains. In this study a horizontally profiling microstructure probe attached to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is used to infer the spatial distribution of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy (epsilon) in the central valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first successful realization of a horizontal, deep-ocean microstructure survey. More than 22 h of horizontal, near-bottom microstructure data from the Lucky Strike segment (37 degrees N) are presented. The study focuses on a channel with unidirectional sill overflow. Density was found to decrease along the channel following the mean northward flow of 3 to 8 cm/s. The magnitude of the rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation was distributed asymmetrically relative to the position of the sill. Elevated dissipation rates were present in a segment 1-4 km downstream (north) of the sill with peak values of 1 x 10(-7) W/kg. Large flow speeds and elevated density finestructure were observed within this segment. Lowered hydrographic measurements indicated unstable stratification in the same region. The data indicate that hydraulic control was established at least temporarily. Inside the channel at wavelengths between 1 m and 250 m the slopes of AUV-inferred horizontal temperature gradient spectra were found to be consistent with turbulence in the inertial-convective subrange. Integrated temperature gradient variance in this wavelength interval was consistent with an epsilon(2/3) dependence. The results illustrate that deep-reaching AUVs are a useful tool to study deep ocean turbulence over complex terrain where free-falling and lowered turbulence measurements are inefficient and time-consuming.

AB This paper presents a Sigmoid-like event-triggered scheme (Sigmoid-like ETS) for security cruise control systems (CCSs) under stochastic false data injection (FDI) attacks. In order to improve the sensitivity of the ETS, a Sigmoid-like function is first proposed to adjust the event-triggered threshold, dynamically. In what follows, by considering a class of stochastic FDI attacks which obey Bernoulli distribution, the Sigmoid-like event-triggered security control strategy is proposed to ensure both the security and resource saving of the CCSs. Thus, a sufficient stability and stabilization criterion is well derived to present the co-design of an H infinity control and event-triggered parameter. Finally, some simulation experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed Sigmoid-like event-triggered security cruise control for networked vehicles.

AB The inherent limitations of the network keep on going to be revealed with the continuous deployment of cellular networks. The next generation 6G is motivated by these drawbacks to properly integrate important rate-hungry applications such as extended reality, wireless brain-computer interactions, autonomous vehicles, and so on. Also, to support significant applications, 6G will handle large amounts of data transmission in smart cities with much lower latency. It combines many state-of-the-art trends and technology to provide higher data rates for ultra-reliable and low latency communications. By outlining the system requirements, potential trends, technologies, services, applications, and research progress, this article comprehensively conceptualized the 6G cellular system. Open research issues and current research groups in their field of research are summarized to provide readers with the technology road-map and the potential challenges to consider in their 6G research.

AB This letter presents an invariant Rauch-Tung-Striebel (IRTS) smoother applicable to systems with states that are an element of a matrix Lie group. In particular, the extended Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother is adapted to work within a matrix Lie group framework. The main advantage of the invariant RTS (IRTS) smoother is that the linearization of the process and measurement models is independent of the state estimate resulting in state-estimate-independent Jacobians when certain technical requirements are met. A sample problem is considered that involves estimation of the three dimensional pose of a rigid body on SE(3), along with sensor biases. The multiplicative RTS (MRTS) smoother is also reviewed and is used as a direct comparison to the proposed IRTS smoother using experimental data. Both smoothing methods are also compared to invariant and multiplicative versions of the Gauss-Newton approach to solving the batch state estimation problem.

AB Spoofing attacks are one of the most dangerous threats for the application of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), especially for autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicles. In this paper, we present a more robust spoofing mitigation algorithm based on subspace projection that is independent of the number of antennas and that can be utilized in single-antenna GNSS receivers. During a spoofing attack, authentic signals are contaminated by spoofing signals. We demonstrate that all spoofing signals can be eliminated by projecting the received signal onto the orthogonal null space of the spoofing signals. Moreover, two types of receiver structures are designed: a centralized structure that has the ability to suppress cross-correlation interference and a distributed structure with lower computational complexity and lower projection power losses. The proposed algorithm is verified by the Beidou B1I signals for improving the security of the receiver.

AB Reconstruction of 3D scene geometry is an important element for scene understanding, autonomous vehicle and robot navigation, image retrieval, and 3D television. We propose accounting for the inherent structure of the visual world when trying to solve the scene reconstruction problem. Consequently, we identify geometric scene categorization as the first step toward robust and efficient depth estimation from single images. We introduce 15 typical 3D scene geometries called stages, each with a unique depth profile, which roughly correspond to a large majority of broadcast video frames. Stage information serves as a first approximation of global depth, narrowing down the search space in depth estimation and object localization. We propose different sets of low-level features for depth estimation, and perform stage classification on two diverse data sets of television broadcasts.

TI ACMENet:: an underwater acoustic sensor network protocol for real-time
   environmental monitoring in coastal areas
SO IEE PROCEEDINGS-RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Owing to the recent advances in subsea acoustic communication technology, there is a growing interest in underwater acoustic sensor networks. The most obvious applications of such networks are environmental and military observation of coastal and ocean areas, control of autonomous underwater vehicles, fish detection, collision avoidance and long-term geological surveys. In comparison to radio frequency wireless links, underwater acoustic channels have very limited bandwidth, much longer propagation delays and higher error rates. A new network protocol, ACMENet, that provides highly efficient use of the scarce network resources - bandwidth and sensor battery lifetimes - for an underwater acoustic sensor network is proposed. The protocol was developed and tested in sea trials within the framework of the ACME project sponsored by the European Union. The objective of this research is to present the ACMENet protocol and the results of the Second and Third ACME sea trials in which ACMENet was implemented.

AB In this paper, we present a discrete-time predictive control strategy for the supervision of networked dynamic systems subject to coordination constraints. Such a network paradigm is characterized by a set of spatially distributed systems, possibly dynamically coupled and connected via communication links, which need to be controlled and coordinated in order to accomplish their overall objective. The network latency is modeled abstractly as a time-varying time-delay, which is allowed to become unbounded for taking into account data-loss. The method can be specialized to deal more efficiently either with random, possibly unbounded, time-delays, such as the case over the Internet, or constant/bounded time-delays, typically encountered in space and underwater applications. An example of coordination of two autonomous vehicles under input-saturation and formation accuracy constraints is presented.

AB Integrating terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks has the potential of connecting the unconnected and enhancing the user experience for the already-connected, with technological and societal implications of the greatest long-term significance. A convergence of ground, air, and space wireless communications also represents a formidable endeavor for the mobile and satellite communications industries alike, as it entails defining and intelligently orchestrating a new 3D wireless network architecture. In this article, we present the key opportunities and challenges arising from this revolution by presenting some of its disruptive use cases and key building blocks, reviewing the relevant standardization activities, and pointing to open research problems. By considering two multi-operator paradigms, we also showcase how terrestrial networks could be efficiently re-engineered to cater for aerial services, or opportunistically complemented by non-terrestrial infrastructure to augment their current capabilities.

AB In this study, optical multispectral sensors based on perovskite semiconductors have been proposed, simulated, and characterized. The perovskite material system combined with the 3D vertical integration of the sensor channels allow for realizing sensors with high sensitivities and a high spectral resolution. The sensors can be applied in several emerging areas, including biomedical imaging, surveillance, complex motion planning of autonomous robots or vehicles, artificial intelligence, and agricultural applications. The sensor elements can be vertically integrated on a readout electronic to realize sensor arrays and multispectral digital cameras. In this study, three- and six-channel vertically stacked perovskite sensors are optically designed, electromagnetically simulated, and colorimetrically characterized to evaluate the color reproduction. The proposed sensors allow for the implementation of snapshot cameras with high sensitivity. The proposed sensor is compared to other sensor technologies in terms of sensitivity and selectivity.

AB This article involves the problems of stabilization and guaranteed cost control for a class of delayed continuous-time nonlinear systems. The sufficient conditions for the existence of stabilization controllers and guaranteed cost controllers are investigated by constructing a new Lyapunov matrix-based Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. These conditions can be easily verified by using standard compute software (e.g., the toolbox YALMIP of MATLAB), since they are expressed as simple linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, the feasible solutions of these linear matrix inequalities are used to describe the explicit forms of stabilization controllers and guaranteed cost controllers. Finally, the validity of the proposed Lyapunov matrix-based LKF method is tested by two numerical examples.

AB 3D object recognition is an generic task in robotics and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a 3D object recognition approach using a 3D extension of the histogram-of-gradients object descriptor with data captured with a depth camera. The presented method makes use of synthetic objects for training the object classifier, and classify real objects captured by the depth camera. The preprocessing methods include operations to achieve rotational invariance as well as to maximize the recognition accuracy while reducing the feature dimensionality at the same time. By studying different preprocessing options, we show challenges that need to be addressed when moving from synthetic to real data. The recognition performance was evaluated with a real dataset captured by a depth camera and the results show a maximum recognition accuracy of 81.5%.

AB This paper presents a runtime assurance (RTA) framework for an unmanned aerospace application. RTA systems hold the promise of protecting feedback systems that contain advanced or experimental elements that cannot be completely tested at design time to their required levels of assurance. This inability of fully trusting such advanced systems is due to their inherent complexity and that current analysis, verification, and validation protocols cannot address such complexity. The necessary structure of RTA frameworks for multilevel interacting feedback systems is investigated. A challenge problem is constructed for a fleet of unmanned aircraft systems performing complex missions. The complete study involves integrating RTA systems for the inner-loop control, outer-loop guidance, vehicle flight management, and runtime mission planning elements. The RTA interactions between these feedback levels are explored in this effort. General required RTA checks are presented and the critical reversionary switching conditions defined. More detailed system design is presented for the outer-loop guidance feedback level.

AB This study proposed the 3D path planning of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) by using the hierarchical deep Q network (HDQN) combined with the prioritized experience replay. The path planning task was divided into three layers, which realized the dimensionality reduction of state space and solved the problem of dimension disaster. An artificial potential field was used to design the positive rewards of the algorithm to shorten the training time. According to the different requirements of the task, this study modified the rewards in the training process to obtain different paths. The path planning simulation and field tests were carried out. The results of the tests corroborated that the training time of the proposed method was shorter than that of the traditional method. The path obtained by simulation training was proved to be safe and effective.

AB This work presents the development and construction of an adaptive street lighting system that improves safety at intersections, which is the result of applying low-power Internet of Things (IoT) techniques to intelligent transportation systems. A set of wireless sensor nodes using the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.4 standard with additional internet protocol (IP) connectivity measures both ambient conditions and vehicle transit. These measurements are sent to a coordinator node that collects and passes them to a local controller, which then makes decisions leading to the streetlight being turned on and its illumination level controlled. Streetlights are autonomous, powered by photovoltaic energy, and wirelessly connected, achieving a high degree of energy efficiency. Relevant data are also sent to the highway conservation center, allowing it to maintain up-to-date information for the system, enabling preventive maintenance.

AB In many of the military applications, path planning is one of the crucial decision-making strategies in an unmanned autonomous system. Many intelligent approaches to pathfinding and generation have been derived in the past decade. Energy reduction (cost and time) during pathfinding is a herculean task. Optimal path planning not only means the shortest path but also finding one in the minimised cost and time. In this paper, an intelligent gain based ant colony optimisation and gain based green-ant (GG-Ant) have been proposed with an efficient path and least computation time than the recent state-of-the-art intelligent techniques. Simulation has been done under different conditions and results outperform the existing ant colony optimisation (ACO) and green-ant techniques with respect to the computation time and path length.

AB This paper concerns the finite-time trajectory tracking control problem for an underactuated marine surface vessel (MSV) suffering from the external disturbance and parameter uncertainties. First, the virtual velocity command is proposed based on a novel piecewise function. It will be illustrated that the position tracking error can be stabilized to small regions in finite time once the desired velocity commands are tracked. Then, an adaptive tracking controller is developed such that sway and yaw velocities can converge to the desired ones in finite time. Utilizing the proposed control strategy, global finite-time stability can be ensured for the position and velocity tracking errors even in the presence of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated by numerical simulation.

AB The availability of compact, low-cost, and high-speed MEMS-based spatial light modulators has generated widespread interest in alternative sampling strategies for imaging systems utilizing single-pixel detectors. The development of compressed sensing schemes for real-time computational imaging may have promising commercial applications for high-performance detectors, where the availability of focal plane arrays is expensive or otherwise limited. We discuss the research and development of a prototype light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system via direct time of flight, which utilizes a single high-sensitivity photon-counting detector and fast-timing electronics to recover millimeter accuracy three-dimensional images in real time. The development of low-cost real time computational LiDAR systems could have importance for applications in security, defense, and autonomous vehicles.

AB In this paper, we develop a novel extended state observer (ESO), in terms of tracking error only, for output tracking of a class of multi-input multioutput systems with mismatched uncertainty. A novel ESO is constructed from the nonsmooth function "fal" to estimate both uncertainty and state of the system. An ESO-based output feedback controller is then designed to compensate (cancel) the uncertainty and to achieve the output tracking. The convergence of the closed-loop system is proved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical results of trajectory tracking for a practical autonomous underwater vehicle model. We show that in the presence of measurement noise, this novel ESO leads to better performance than the linear ESO. Moreover, this type of ESO has much smaller peaking value than the linear ESO under the same tuning gain.

DT Article
AB This issue of IEEE Control Systems includes two feature articles and one "Applications of Control" column article. The first feature article, "Microscale 2D Particle Position Control," is authored by Ion Matei, Maksym Zhenirovskyy, Johan de Kleer, and Anne Plochowietz [A1]. The authors have designed a method for moving small objects immersed in a dielectric fluid, using an array of thousands of electrodes. For a single micro-object, they use a "micromodel," a nonlinear differential equation that describes the position of a single particle, to generate the control policy. This policy can be derived either analytically or numerically and has been tested experimentally. Additionally, the authors have developed a method using numerical optimization to find the appropriate control inputs (electrode potentials) for assembling particles into a specific density. This method uses a "macromodel," a partial differential equation that describes the overall density of particles when the electrode potentials are varied. The method involves formulating a stochastic control problem that minimizes the difference between the desired and actual particle densities and using spectral methods to convert this problem into a form that can be solved numerically. The control methods will enable building a device that is similar to a printer and can arrange very small objects (from less than a micrometer to hundreds of micrometers) into specific patterns. The second feature article, "The REEF Autonomous Vehicles Laboratory," is authored by Michael Anderson, J. Humberto Ramos, Benjamin Dickinson, Kevin Brink, and Prashant Ganesh [A2]. It results from a joint initiative from the Air Force Research Laboratory and the University of Florida's Research and Engineering Education Facility (REEF) Autonomous Vehicles Laboratory (AVL) to mentor and assist researchers seeking to initiate research in aerial robotics. The article provides a tutorial on how to begin flight research using the REEF Quadrotor and its REEF Estimator (a vision-enabled flight control enhancement). A GitHub repository provides resources and mentors collaborators in assembling hardware and software platforms for flight-based research. This includes a catalog of Robotic Operating System code, assembly and installation guides, and even shopping lists. Finally, a recent collaborative project between the AVL and undergraduate researchers is described. In short, this article aims to help aspiring researchers launch their aerial robotics experiments.

AB Smart cities need energy-efficient and low-emission transportation for people and goods. Most studies focus on sustainable urban-transportation systems for passengers. Freight transportation in cities has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to greenhouse gases emissions and negative externalities, such as traffic congestion. The purpose of this paper is to identify through a systematic literature review which innovations (hardware and software) applied by logistics service providers (LSPs) in sustainable urban freight (SUF) are suitable to support the transition to energy-efficient smart cities. We propose to classify the existing innovations in last-mile delivery for SUF into categories: (1) urban freight consolidation and/or trans-shipment; (2) the Consumer as a Service Provider (CaaSP); (3) choice of transportation modes. We introduce the concept of CaaSP as an innovative solution in last-mile delivery (LMD), where customers take over some transport operations with the use of smart technologies, and thus reduce the energy demand. We consider the modes of transportation, such as: drones, autonomous delivery robots, autonomous vehicles, cargo bikes (including e-cargo bikes, e-tricycles), electric vehicles (mainly vans), and combined passenger-and-cargo transportation rapid-transit systems. From the analyzed dataset, we find that energy-efficiency in smart cities can be improved by the consolidation of parcels in micro-depots, parcel lockers, and mobile depots. We analyze smart technologies (the Internet of things, big data, artificial intelligence, and digital twins), which enable energy efficiency by reducing the energy demand (fuel) of SUF, due to better operational planning and infrastructure sharing by logistics service providers. We propose a new IEE matrix as an actionable tool for the classification of innovations applied by LSPs in SUF, according to the level of their interconnectivity and energy efficiency. Additionally, this paper contributes to the theory by exploring possible future research directions for SUF in energy-efficient smart cities.

TI How should autonomous vehicles drive? Policy, methodological, and social
   considerations for designing a driver
SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being developed, tested, and commercialized around the world. While skilled human drivers can rely on their experience and common sense to navigate complex driving situations that involve trade-offs between competing objectives, AVs are engineered systems, which may handle complex scenarios based on driving principles articulated at the time of system design. This raises the question of what constitutes proper driving behavior in a complex driving scenario. Many jurisdictions point to existing rules of the road as a description of good driving and, by requiring AVs to follow such rules, hope to improve the safety and efficiency of the transportation system. This paper discusses the desirability of a comprehensive definition of AV behavior, reviews subnational, national, and international regulatory developments that seek to define how AVs might drive, and discusses the tensions between safe, lawful, and efficient driving. Locally defined rules of the road can serve as a guide to a comprehensive driving behavior specification. However, translating rules of the road, which are legal documents written in natural language, to formal rules for use by computers deployed on AVs is a challenging task. In particular, the pervasive appeals to judgment that are present in many rules of the road do not easily lend themselves to the precise formalization of conditions and quantification of values that computers use to make decisions. This work also considers the effect that formalizing behavior for adoption by AVs might have on the general driving culture, and especially on the relationship between existing classes of road users. To highlight the challenges associated with formalizing the rules of the road, this work reports on an experiment where two teams independently translated two rules of the road into formal rules to instruct AVs or to verify the correctness of AV behavior. The study results emphasize the desirability of new technical and political structures to mediate a shared understanding of the rules of the road. The harmonization of behavioral expectations has the potential to improve the safety and efficiency of AV deployments, as well as the broader transportation system.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB The identification problem incorporated in feedback control of uncertain nonlinear systems exhibiting complex behavior has been solved in different ways. Some of these solutions have used artificial intelligence methods like fuzzy logic and neural networks. However, their individual implementation suffers from certain drawbacks, such as the black-box nature of neural network and the problem of finding suitable membership functions for fuzzy systems. These weaknesses can be avoided by implementing a hybrid structure combining these two approaches, the so-called neuro-fuzzy system. In this paper, a neuro-fuzzy system that implements differential neural networks (DNNs) as consequences of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy inference rules is proposed. The DNNs substitute the local linear systems that are used in the common T-S method. In this paper, DNNs are used to provide an effective instrument for dealing with the identification of the uncertain nonlinear system, while the T-S rules are used to provide the framework of previous knowledge of the system. The main idea is to carry out an online identification process of an uncertain nonlinear system with the aim to design a closed-loop trajectory tracking controller. The methodology developed in this study that supports the identification and trajectory control designs is based on the Lyapunov formalism. The DNN implementation results in a time-varying T-S system. As a consequence, the solution of two time-varying Riccati equations was used to adjust the learning laws in the DNN as well as to adjust the gains of the controller. Two results were provided to justify the existence of positive-definite solutions for the class of Riccati equations used in the learning laws of DNNs. A complete description of the learning laws used for the set of DNN identifiers is also obtained. An autonomous underwater vehicle system is used to demonstrate the performance of the controller on tracking a desired 3-D path by this combination of the DNN and the T-S system.

AB Autonomous underwater manipulation is very important for the robotic and intelligence operations of oceanic engineering. However, a small target often involves limited features and results in inaccurate visual matching. In order to improve visual measurement accuracy, this paper has proposed an improved unsharp masking algorithm to further enhance the weak texture region of blurred and low contrast images. Moreover, an improved ORB feature-matching method with adaptive threshold, non-maximum suppression and improved random sample consensus has also been proposed. To overcome unknown underwater disturbances and uncertain system parameters in the underwater robotic manipulations, an adaptive non-singular terminal sliding mode controller has been proposed with a quasi-barrier function to suppress the chattering problem and improve grasp accuracy for small target. Oceanic experiments have been conducted to prove the performance of the proposed method.

AB The development of driver assistance and autonomous driving systems for vehicles has started to revolutionize the transportation sector, offering comfort and safety. While significant technological progress has already been made in this area, the road ahead is littered with many challenges. Among these challenges, ensuring driver safety has become even more critical due to the increasing use of complex, communicating and reconfigurable embedded software. Current approaches to document-based safety analysis have reached their limit and the time has come to rethink them. To this end, we propose to rely on model driven engineering to conduct safety analyses. This paper makes a methodological proposal that improves current practices in terms of time, analysis quality and reusability, and that has been validated on the study of an automotive software component.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI DE-SLAM: SLAM for highly dynamic environment
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
DE localization; SLAM
AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial for autonomous mobile robots. Most of the current SLAM systems are based on an assumption: the environment is static. However, the real environment is full of dynamic elements, such as pedestrians or vehicles, as well as changes in illumination and appearance over time. In this paper, DE-SLAM, a visual SLAM system that can deal with short-term and long-term dynamic elements at the same time is proposed. A novel dynamic detection and tracking module that utilizes both semantic and metric information is proposed, and the localization accuracy is highly improved by eliminating features falling on the dynamic objects. A unified loop detection, loop check and global optimization module is used to perform loop closure. Experimental results on datasets and real environments show that DE-SLAM outperforms other state-of-the-art SLAM systems in dynamic environments.

AB This article investigates the problem of the decentralized adaptive output feedback saturated control problem for interconnected nonlinear systems with strong interconnections. A decentralized linear observer is first established to estimate the unknown states. Then, an auxiliary system is constructed to offset the effect of input saturation. With the aid of graph theory and neural network technique, a decentralized adaptive neuro-output feedback saturated controller is designed in a nonrecursive manner. A sufficient criterion is established to achieve the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop system. An application example of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.

AB Distance estimation and pedestrian detection are critical for safe driving operation decision-making and autonomous vehicle intelligent control strategies. This paper proposes a novel multi-task Faster R-CNN detector which simultaneously realizes distance estimation and pedestrian detection using an improved ResNet-50 ar-chitecture. Images were acquired using a near-infrared camera with two near-infrared fill-lights devices during real road nighttime scenarios. Ground truth pedestrian distances used for training were obtained using LIDAR. The data used to optimize the multi-task Faster R-CNN detector were approximately 20 k high-quality near-infrared images with marked pedestrians and tagged distance values. The proposed algorithm including the distance estimation runs at a speed exceeding 7 fps. Pedestrian detection accuracy reached nearly 80% with a total average absolute distance estimation error rate of less than 5%.

ID PROTOCOL
AB The past years have seen a rapid development of autonomous underwater vehicle-aided (AUV-aided) data-gathering schemes in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). The use of AUVs efficiently reduces energy consumption of sensor nodes. However, all AUV-aided solutions face severe problems in data collection delay, especially in a large-scale network. In this paper, to reduce data collection delay, we propose a prediction-based delay optimization data collection algorithm (PDO-DC). On the contrary to the traditional delay optimization algorithms, Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) is utilized via cluster member nodes to obtain the corresponding prediction models. Then, the AUV can obtain all cluster data by traversing less cluster head nodes, which can effectively reduce the collection delay of the AUV. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is both feasible and effective.

AB The proliferation of wireless devices and appliances is facilitating the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Numerous state-of-the-art applications are being used in, for example, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and biocomputing. With the popularization of IoT, new challenges are emerging with respect to privacy issues. In this article, we first summarize privacy constraints and primary attacks based on new features of IoT. Then we present three case studies to demonstrate principal vulnerabilities and classify existing protection schemes. Built on this analysis, we identify three key challenges: a lack of theoretical foundation, the trade-off optimization between privacy and data utility, and system isomerism over-complexity and high scalability. Finally, we illustrate possible promising future directions and potential solutions to the emerging challenges facing wireless IoT scenarios. We aim to assist interested readers in investigating the unexplored parts of this promising domain.

AB In this paper, the output consensus problem of multiple nonlinear systems on directed graph with a fixed topology is studied. It is assumed that all followers are subject to saturation and dead-zone input. Using the function approximation capability of neural networks together with the backstepping design technique, a distributed adaptive control scheme is proposed to guarantee that all the outputs of the followers in the graph asymptotically synchronize to the output of a leader with synchronization errors converging to the origin regardless of the system unknown dynamics and external disturbances. Based on the algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov theory, stability analysis of the resulting closed-loop system is conducted. Finally, simulation results of autonomous underwater vehicles illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the new approach developed in the paper.

AB A method for the control of autonomously and slowly moving agricultural machinery is presented. Special emphasis is on offline reference trajectory generation tailored for high precision closed-loop tracking within agricultural fields using linear time-varying model predictive control. When optimisation is carried out, high-level logistical processing can result in edgy reference paths for field coverage. Subsequent trajectory smoothing can consider specific actuator rate constraints and field geometry. The latter step is the subject of this paper. Focussing on forward motion only, the role of non-convexly shaped field geometry, repressed area minimisation and spraying gap avoidance is analysed. Three design methods for generating smooth reference trajectories are discussed: circle segments, generalised elementary paths, and bi-elementary paths. (c) 2016 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fruitflies regulate flight speed by adjusting their body angle. To understand how low-level posture control serves an overall linear visual speed control strategy, we visually induced free-flight acceleration responses in a wind tunnel and measured the body kinematics using high-speed videography. Subsequently, we reverse engineered the transfer function mapping body pitch angle onto flight speed. A linear model is able to reproduce the behavioural data with good accuracy. Our results show that linearity in speed control is realized already at the level of body posture-mediated speed control and is therefore embodied at the level of the complex aerodynamic mechanisms of body and wings. Together with previous results, this study reveals the existence of a linear hierarchical control strategy, which can provide relevant control principles for biomimetic implementations, such as autonomous flying micro air vehicles.

ID LATERAL-LINE; DESIGN
AB Blind cave fish are capable of sensing flows and movements of nearby objects even in dark and murky water conditions with the help of arrays of pressure-gradient sensors present on their bodies called lateral-lines. To emulate this functionality of lateral-lines for autonomous underwater vehicles, an array of polymer MEMS pressure sensors have been developed that can transduce underwater pressure variations generated by moving objects. Individual sensors are fabricated using liquid crystal polymer as a membrane material, which gives high robustness and reliability, and higher sensitivity compared with its silicon counterparts. The individual sensor in the array achieves a sensitivity of 90 mV/(m/s) with a high resolution of 25 mm/s. The underwater object detection capability of the array is demonstrated through proof-of-concept experiments. The array is capable of determining the velocity and distinguishing various distances of an underwater stimulus with high accuracy and repeatability.

AB This paper proposes a novel multiple clue-based filtration algorithm (MCFA), which is developed to detect lane markings on roads using camera vision images for autonomous mobile robot navigation. The main goal of the algorithm is the robust estimation of the relative position and angle of the lane in the image by using multiple clues based on different characteristics of the lane. In particular, robustness against environmental changes is enhanced greatly since a dynamic model of the lane, besides static features of the lane such as color, intensity, etc., is incorporated for reliable estimation. The efficiency of the algorithm is verified through mobile robot experiments under various extreme illumination conditions in outdoor environments. The increased robustness performance enables reliable closed-loop control of a mobile robot that operates in a variety of navigation-related missions.

AB Sliding-m ode control laws for controlling multiple unmanned surface vessels in arbitrary formations are proposed. The presented formation control method uses local information as well as the planned gross motion of the formation to achieve mesh stability. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model has been used for the surface vessels. It is assumed that each vessel only has two actuators and the vessels are underactuated. Mesh stability and parameter uncertainty in the dynamic model and wave disturbance are considered in designing the controllers. It is shown that the internal dynamics of the underactuated system is also stable. The effectiveness and robustness of these control laws in the presence of parameter uncertainty in the dynamic model and wave disturbances and the mesh stability of the formation are demonstrated by computer simulation.

AB In this paper, a method is proposed for the interpretation of outdoor natural images. It fastly constructs a basic 2-D scene model that can be used in the visual systems onboard of autonomous vehicles. It is composed of several processes: color image segmentation, principal areas detection, classification and verification of the final model. The regions provided by the segmentation phase are characterized by their color and texture. These features are compared and classified into predefined classes using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. An Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is used to reduce redundancy from the database and improve the recognition stage. Finally, a global scene model is obtained by merging the small regions belonging to the same class. The extraction of useful entities for navigation (like roads) from the final model is straightforward. This system has been intensively tested through experiments on sequences of countryside scenes color images.

AB High-resolution geophysical mapping operations were conducted from a survey vessel and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the Daiichi-Amami Knoll, Ryukyu island arc. For the first time, both the detailed morphology and the extent of the bubble plume in this region are revealed. The knoll is a conical edifice rising 500-700 m from the surrounding seafloor with a peak depth at 247 m. The summit region of the knoll has a complex structure and is divided into three parts: the Northeastern Rim, Central Caldera, and Southern Cones. Among the three parts, the Southern Cones has characteristic morphological features such as cones and a depression. Two cones, cone A and cone B, rise similar to 30 m above the surrounding basement, and have fissure-like linear features. The depression, depression Dl, faces the steep slope of cone A and is bounded by cone A and B. The horizontal dimensions are similar to 500 m x 200 m and it is 10-40 m lower than the surrounding basement. Water column anomalies detected on side-scan sonar images, which are thought to be bubble plumes, were intensively distributed in and around depression D1 and cone B with horizontal dimensions of similar to 300 m x similar to 800 m. The volcanic morphology and bubble plumes, indicators of hydrothermal activity, suggest that the Daiichi-Amami Knoll is an active volcanic knoll. This result proposes a new insight that dual volcanic chains exist in the north to central Ryukyu Arc. The Daiichi-Amami Knoll is located behind the volcanic front, not on the front. The knoll, surrounding volcanoes, and volcanic edifice behind the front are aligned with one straight line similar to 20 km behind and parallel to the front, making a rear arc volcanic chain. The presence of dual volcanic chains in the north to central Ryukyu Arc, revealed by our detailed geophysical survey, provides valuable information to consider toward the subduction processes and magma generation in the Ryukyu Arc.

AB In this letter, we study the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) scheme in the uplink cellular-connected UAV network. By considering the LoS and NLoS components in air-to-ground (A2G) transmission, we adopt the strongest average received signal strength (RSS)-based CoMP scheme. We then develop an analytical framework to evaluate the network performance in terms of coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE) for the case of two cooperative base stations (BSs), followed by an extension to a generalized number of cooperative BSs. Compared to the CoMP scheme with single UAV tier and Non-CoMP baseline, the considered CoMP scheme is able to leverage favored Line-of-Sight (LoS) transmission, lower path loss and BS cooperation gain.

AB The Milky Way is used by nocturnal flying and walking insects for maintaining heading while navigating. In this study, we have explored the feasibility of the method for machine vision systems on autonomous vehicles by measuring the visual features and characteristics of the Milky Way. We also consider the conditions under which the Milky Way is used by insects and the sensory systems that support their detection of the MilkyWay. Using a combination of simulated and real MilkyWay imagery, we demonstrate that appropriate computer vision methods are capable of reliably and accurately extracting the orientation of the Milky Way under an unobstructed night sky. The technique presented achieves angular accuracy of better then +/- 2 degrees under moderate light pollution conditions but also demonstrates that higher light pollution levels will adversely effect orientation estimates by systems depending on the Milky Way for navigation.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) odometry plays a crucial role in autonomous mobile robots and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). This paper presents a deep learning-based odometry system using two successive three-dimensional (3D) point clouds to estimate their scene flow and then predict their relative pose. The network consumes continuous 3D point clouds directly and outputs their scene flow and uncertain mask in a coarse-to-fine fashion. A pose estimation layer without trainable parameters is designed to compute the pose with the scene flow. We also introduce a scan-to-map optimization algorithm to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the system. Our experiments on the KITTI odometry data set and our campus data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning-based point cloud odometry.

TI Learning to Drive: End-to-End Off-Road Path Prediction
SO IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous driving is a field currently gaining a lot of attention, and recently `end to end' approaches, whereby a machine learning algorithm learns to drive by emulating a human driver, have demonstrated significant potential. However, recent work has focused on the on-road environment, rather than the more challenging off-road environment. In this work we propose a new approach to this problem, whereby instead of learning to predict immediate driver control inputs, we train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the future path that a vehicle will take through an off-road environment visually, addressing several limitations inherent in existing methods. We combine a novel approach to automatic training data creation, making use of stereoscopic visual odometry, with a state- of-the-art CNN architecture to map a predicted route directly onto image pixels, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using our own off-road data set.

AB China completed the construction of more than 1.15 million kilometers of transmission lines with conventional voltage levels spanning its vast territory in 2014. This large and complicated power grid structure relies mainly on manual operation and maintenance of lines. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-definition digital video cameras and cameras and GPS positioning systems can conduct autonomous patrols along the grid. However, the presence of electromagnetic fields around high-voltage transmission lines can affect the UAV's magnetometer, resulting in a wrong heading and thus unsafe flight. In this paper, the traditional method of UAV heading calculation using a magnetometer was analyzed, and a novel method for calculating UAV heading based on dual antennas was proposed. Experimental data showed that the proposed method improves the anti-magnetic interference characteristics of UAVs and increases UAV security and stability for power inspection applications.

AB In this paper we present a stereo visual odometry system developed for autonomous underwater vehicle localization tasks. The main idea is to make use of only highly reliable data in the estimation process, employing a robust keypoint tracking approach and an effective keyframe selection strategy, so that camera movements are estimated with high accuracy even for long paths. Furthermore, in order to limit the drift error, camera pose estimation is referred to the last keyframe, selected by analyzing the feature temporal flow. The proposed system was tested on the KITTI evaluation framework and on the New Tsukuba stereo dataset to assess its effectiveness on long tracks and different illumination conditions. Results of a live archaeological campaign in the Mediterranean Sea, on an AUV equipped with a stereo camera pair, show that our solution can effectively work in underwater environments.

AB Tractor-trailer wheeled robot (TTWR) is a modular robotic system that consists of a tractor module towing a trailer. Control of these systems started from motion aid facilities in human-driven vehicles, to fully autonomous mobile robots in recent years. The mobility of such highly nonlinear systems is restricted due to the presence of nonholonomic constraints of wheels, also the system severe underactuated nature. Trajectory tracking is one of the challenging problems focused in the context of Wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) that has been discussed in this paper. First, kinematic equations of TTWR are obtained. Then, reference trajectories for tracking problem are produced. Subsequently, a non-model-based controller based on Modified transpose jacobian (MTJ) method is designed to steer the TTWR asymptotically follow reference trajectories. Obtained simulation and experimental comparison results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB Considering the energy constraint for fixed sensor nodes and the unacceptable long propagation delay, especially for latency sensitive applications of underwater acoustic sensor networks, we propose a MAC protocol that is latency-optimized and energy-efficient scheme and combines the physical layer and the MAC layer to shorten transmission delay. On physical layer, we apply convolution coding and interleaver for transmitted information. Moreover, dynamic code rate is exploited at the receiver side to accelerate data reception rate. On MAC layer, unfixed frame length scheme is applied to reduce transmission delay, and to ensure the data successful transmission rate at the same time. Furthermore, we propose a network topology: an underwater acoustic sensor network with mobile agent. Through fully utilizing the supper capabilities on computation and mobility of autonomous underwater vehicles, the energy consumption for fixed sensor nodes can be extremely reduced, so that the lifetime of networks is extended.

AB Crowd flow in an underwater scene is used to study fish schooling characteristics. The hydromechanics of fish schooling is quite complicated because it varies in-the types of fish underwater. Fish schooling detection contributes toward the study of their locomotion, perception and behavior. For this scenario, we opted to use Lagrangian particle dynamics had been applied to examine the trajectories of an individual particle in the flow. The mathematical algorithm of the Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS) is the Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) field the divergence of the particles. The FTLE field is a boundary that divides the flow with respect to its distinct flow dynamics. The algorithm can also do real-time video analyses which can easily be implemented in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The system is efficient enough to perform the detection of fish schooling as a group flow.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent developments from 2012-2021 in 3D object detection covering the full pipeline from input data, over data representation and feature extraction to the actual detection modules. We introduce fundamental concepts, focus on a broad range of different approaches that have emerged over the past decade, and propose a systematization that provides a practical framework for comparing these approaches with the goal of guiding future development, evaluation, and application activities. Specifically, our survey and systematization of 3D object detection models and methods can help researchers and practitioners to get a quick overview of the field by decomposing 3DOD solutions into more manageable pieces.

TI Multistage Stabilized Continuation for Indirect Optimal Control of
   Three-Dimensional Hypersonic Trajectories
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID INDIRECT OPTIMIZATION; HOMOTOPY METHODS; ENTRY; GENERATION
AB This work presents the development of a multistaged stabilized continuation for the three-dimensional unpowered hypersonic trajectory planning problem using indirect optimal control methods. The stabilized continuation method is noniterative and guaranteed to terminate within a finite number of floating point operations, thereby making it well suited for onboard autonomous implementations. We present a multistage formulation of the stabilized continuation scheme that involves starting with a "loose" integration tolerance during the first stage and ramping up toward a "strict" integration tolerance through subsequent stages. An important benefit of this approach is that even when the solution to the underlying optimal control problem is numerically unstable, such as with the hypersonic vehicle footprint generation problem, the stabilized continuation algorithm is shown to be successful in finding a solution while providing some additional insights into the underlying cause of the numerical instability.

AB Aiming at the difficult problem of motion control of robotic manta with pectoral fin flexible deformation, this paper proposes a control scheme that combines the bioinspired Central Pattern Generator (CPG) and T-S Fuzzy neural network (NN)-based control. An improved CPG drive network is presented for the multi-stage fin structure of the robotic manta. Considering the unknown dynamics and the external environmental disturbances, a sensor-based classic T-S Fuzzy NN controller is designed for heading and depth control. Finally, a pool test demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller: the robotic manta can track the depth and heading with an error of +/- 6 cm and +/- 6 degrees, satisfying accuracy requirements.

AB This study proposes a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm based on optimized sample pools and average motion critic network (OSAM-DDPG) to realize the path following control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The ideas of optimizing the sampling mode and the evaluation of motion are proposed to improve the efficiency of algorithm. OSAM-DDPG is used to train the force-to-state mapping of an AUV's dynamical model to realize its control. In the simulation test, the OSAM-DDPG algorithm only needs some episodes to obtain the complete control strategy. Based on the experience gained from the training, the problems of various paths following in the interference environment can be addressed, and the results demonstrate that the effect of path following control based on OSAM-DDPG is better than S-plane.

ID AUTOMOTIVE RADAR
AB We investigate characteristics and impacts of the mutual interference to a LiDAR using an analog true-random signal, for autonomous vehicle applications. Various LiDAR signals with a continuous-wave, a pulse light from a directly modulated laser, and a frequency-modulated continuous-wave light, were generated as the mutual interference signals. The signal patterns of the interference signal formats at the receiver of the victim LiDAR were characterized by measurement results. There exist two major impacts of the mutual interference, causing a false alarm that induces ghost targets and/or images in 3-D scanning LiDARs, and reducing the SNR that degrades detection probability of an echo signal. For quantitative analysis, we estimate the cross-correlation related to the two influences. From the results, it is confirmed that the proposed LiDAR using the random signal has the mutual interference immunity regardless of the signal formats of the interference.

AB With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that should guide machine behaviour. To address this challenge, we deployed the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents' demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits. We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global, socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this article are publicly available.

Software agents are a programming paradigm that allows for providing intelligence to devices leveraging context awarness, reasoning techniques and communication mechanisms. In this paper we present the design and development of a social network of intelligent agents, which interact with the users and among them using common services and P2P overlay. The emergent behavior of users and agents, that is the optimal charging schedule of e-cars, is achieved recommending the cheapest charging station that does not affect the global distance to be covered for recharging. It optimizes the waiting time reducing the length of the queue at the charging station and global distance covered by all e-cars.

AB In order to assure the stability of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems, the linear matrix inequality (LMI) should be applied. However, the LMI method cannot be applied online, because its computational complexity. In this paper, the T-S fuzzy control is transformed into a time-varying system. By using Riccati differential equation (RDE) and a special optimal-like controller, the T-S fuzzy control can be applied online. We prove that the T-S fuzzy control is stable and the trajectory tracking error converges to a bounded zone. Since RDE can be solved online, the novel T-S fuzzy control is adaptive and more simple and effective than LMI-based methods. We apply successfully this online fuzzy control to an autonomous underwater vehicle.

ID COLLOCATION
AB Of the many direct numerical methods, the pseudospectral method serves as an effective tool to solve the reentry trajectory optimization for hypersonic vehicles. However, the traditional pseudospectral method is time-consuming due to large number of discretization points. For the purpose of autonomous and adaptive reentry guidance, the research herein presents a multistage trajectory control strategy based on the pseudospectral method, capable of dealing with the unexpected situations in reentry flight. The strategy typically includes two subproblems: the trajectory estimation and trajectory refining. In each processing stage, the proposed method generates a specified range of trajectory with the transition of the flight state. The full glide trajectory consists of several optimal trajectory sequences. The newly focused geographic constraints in actual flight are discussed thereafter. Numerical examples of free-space flight, target transition flight, and threat avoidance flight are used to show the feasible application of multistage pseudospectral method in reentry trajectory optimization.

AB In this paper, we present the systematic design and implementation of a robust real-time embedded vision system for an unmanned rotorcraft for ground target following. The hardware construction of the vision system is presented, and an onboard software system is developed based on a multithread technique capable of coordinating multiple tasks. To realize the autonomous ground target following, a sophisticated feature-based vision algorithm is proposed by using an onboard color camera and navigation sensors. The vision feedback is integrated with the flight control system to guide the unmanned rotorcraft to follow a ground target in flight. The overall vision system has been tested in actual flight missions, and the results obtained show that the overall system is very robust and efficient.

AB This paper presents an innovative method for estimating the attitude of airborne electro-optical cameras with respect to the onboard autonomous navigation unit. The procedure is based on the use of attitude measurements under static conditions taken by an inertial unit and carrier-phase differential Global Positioning System to obtain accurate camera position estimates in the aircraft body reference frame, while image analysis allows line-of-sight unit vectors in the camera based reference frame to be computed. The method has been applied to the alignment of the visible and infrared cameras installed onboard the experimental aircraft of the Italian Aerospace Research Center and adopted for in-flight obstacle detection and collision avoidance. Results show an angular uncertainty on the order of 0.1 degrees (rms).

AB The state of practice of investigating traffic safety and operation is primarily based on traditional data sources, such as spot sensors, loop detectors, and historical crash data. Recently, researchers have utilized transportation data from instrumented vehicles, driving simulators, and microsimulation modeling. However, these data sources might not represent the actual driving environment at a trajectory level and might introduce bias due to their experimental control. The shortcomings of these data sources can be overcome via Naturalistic Driving Studies (NDSs) considering the fact that NDS provides detailed real-time driving data that would help investigate the safety and operational impacts of human behavior along with other factors related to weather, traffic, and roadway geometry in a naturalistic setting. With the enormous potential of the NDS data, this study leveraged the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) approach to shortlist the most relevant naturalistic studies out of 2304 initial studies around the world with a focus on traffic safety and operation over the past fifteen years (2005-2020). A total of 117 studies were systematically reviewed, which were grouped into seven relevant topics, including driver behavior and performance, crash/near-crash causation, driver distraction, pedestrian/bicycle safety, intersection/traffic signal related studies, detection and prediction using NDSs data, based on their frequency of appearance in the keywords of these studies. The proper deployment of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) require an appropriate level of human behavior integration, especially at the intimal stages where both CAV and human-driven vehicles will interact and share the same roadways in a mixed traffic environment. In order to integrate the heterogeneous nature of human behavior through behavior cloning approach, real-time trajectory-level NDS data is essential. The insights from this study revealed that NDSs could be effectively leveraged to perfect the behavior cloning to facilitate rapid and safe implementation of CAV.

AB This article investigates the autonomous spacecraft rendezvous and docking problem in the presence of space obstacle, path constraints, and thrust limitation constraint. By introducing the frame of explicit reference governor (ERG), a combination scheme of guidance and control is proposed to guarantee the system stabilization and constraints satisfaction. Specifically, an artificial potential function (APF) method is employed to guide a collision-free trajectory, and then the constraints are satisfied via limiting the states within the safe invariant set. Furthermore, a simplified method is proposed to obtain the maximum bound of the Lyapunov-based invariant sets, which ensures input bounded and collision avoidance. System convergence under the potential field is proved through the Lyapunov stability analysis. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the comprehensive validation and good performance of the proposed method.

ID METASURFACE; METALENSES
AB Three-dimensional (3D) imaging is a crucial information acquisition technology for light detection, autonomous vehicles, gesture recognition, machine vision, and other applications. Metasurface, as a subwavelength scale two-dimensional array, offers flexible control of optical wavefront owing to abundant design freedom. Metasurfaces are promising for use as optical devices because they have large field of view and powerful functionality. In this study, we propose a flat optical device based on a single-layer metasurface to project a coded point cloud in the Fourier space and explore a sophisticated matching algorithm to achieve 3D reconstruction, offering a complete technical roadmap for single-shot detection. We experimentally demonstrate that the depth accuracy of our system is smaller than 0.24mm at a measurement distance of 300mm, indicating the feasibility of the submillimetre measurement platform. Our method can pave the way for practical applications such as surface shape detection, gesture recognition, and personal authentication.

AB High-speed optoelectronics is central to many important developments in the communication, computing, sensing, imaging, and autonomous vehicle industries. With a sharp rise of attention on energy efficiency, researchers have proposed and demonstrated innovative materials, high-speed devices, and components integrated on a single platform that exhibit ultralow power consumption and ultrawide bandwidth. Recently reported material growth and device fabrication techniques offer the potential for high-density integration of optoelectronics close to the capability and cost of conventional electronics. A tremendous synergy can be attained by integrating multiple materials with superior properties on the same chip using heterogeneous integration, heteroepitaxy, nano-heteroepitaxy, and other co-packaging strategies within the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) ecosystem. This issue of MRS Bulletin offers an overview of the field and covers the latest developments on various ultraefficient materials, high-speed devices, their physical properties, current trends, and future directions in optoelectronics and their integration on a silicon platform.

AB Object tracking has been widely used in various intelligent systems, such as pedestrian tracking, autonomous vehicles. To solve the problem that appearance changes and occlusion may lead to poor tracking performance, we propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) based method for object tracking. To achieve this task, we first manually label the first several frames of video stream in image level, which can indicate that whether a target object in the video stream. Then, we leverage a pre-trained convolutional neural network that has rich prior information to extract deep representation of target object. Since the location of the same object in adjacent frames is similar, we introduce a particle filter to predict the location of target object within a specific region. Comprehensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Importantly, our study indicates the limitations of the conventional performance evaluation criteria for maritime vision and proposes new performance evaluation criteria that is better suited to this problem. This paper provides insight into the specific challenges of BS in maritime vision. We identify four open challenges that plague BS methods in maritime scenario. These include spurious dynamics of water, wakes, ghost effect, and multiple detections. Poor recall and extremely poor precision of all the 23 methods, which have been otherwise successful for other challenging BS situations, allude to the need for new BS methods custom designed for maritime vision.

We present an approach where lightweight sensory and processing techniques, requiring very limited memory and processing power, can be successfully applied to the task of object retrieval using sensors of different modalities. We use the Hough framework to fuse optical and orientation information of the different views of the objects. In the presented spatio-temporal perception technique, we apply active vision, where, based on the analysis of initial measurements, the direction of the next view is determined to increase the hit-rate of retrieval. The performance of the proposed methods is shown on three datasets loaded with heavy noise.

AB This paper introduces a custom experimental test bed for the evaluation of autonomous flight controllers for unmanned helicopters. The development of controllers for unmanned helicopters is a difficult procedure which involves testing through simulation at first, and then actual experimentation on real vehicles. As simulation cannot accurately represent the exact real flight conditions and the dangers involved in them, the suggested test bed fills the gap between simulation runs and experimental flights. The developed system involves a small helicopter mounted on a flying stand, equipped with a set of sensors for real-time flight monitoring and control. For demonstration purposes, the test bed has been used for design and validation of a fuzzy logic based autopilot, able to perform hovering and altitude control. Experimental results are presented and commented for various test cases.

DT Article
AB Recent seminal studies of national ocean policy have focused the attention of the marine science and technology communities on the possibility of outcomes in the near future, The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy offered over two hundred recommendations, and has raised expectations for a period of heightened ocean interest. In response to the policy recommendations of the Commission, the President has set certain policies through his December 2004 Executive Order on Ocean Policy and through the issuance of the U.S. Ocean Action Plan. This Plan holds promise for the technology community. With the opportunities of technology advancement, however, come the uncertainties of change. Using the Integrated Ocean Observing System as an example of beneficial change, both in collection methodologies and integration of science data, and in proposing the legal complexities of Autonomous Undersea Vehicle strandings and unwanted recovery, the authors demonstrate examples of the benefits and uncertainties ahead, all of which comprise opportunity.

AB In the natural evolutionary process, biological creatures have developed diverse visual structures apt for their habitational environments. These natural vision structures have inspired the development of artificial vision systems. These systems have numerous advantages in image acquisition compared to conventional imaging devices, including high visual acuity, motion sensitivity, simple accommodation, and low optical aberration. These advantages have contributed to the advances of various imaging devices for autonomous vehicles, mobile electronics, visual prostheses, and machine vision systems. Here, we reviewed recent advances in bio-inspired artificial vision systems that have mimicked the optical and retinal advantages of natural vision structures. These artificial vision systems have overcome many critical challenges in conventional image systems and presented potential for the next-generation image acquisition systems. The remaining challenges and the future outlook are also briefly described in the conclusion section.

ID PERSPECTIVE
AB A good understanding driver behavior is significant in the development of chassis control system and autonomous vehicles. To better simulate human drivers, the driver model with the local path rolling planning decision is developed based on model predictive control algorithm. Firstly, three local path planning methods of straight-line driving, circular-arc driving and B-spline curve driving are designed to describe the different steering styles. Secondly, the linear time-varying (LTV) MPC controller is established to follow the local planned path. Finally, the two typical simulations are carried out and compared with the single-point preview driver model and the optimal preview driver model. And, the results indicate that the proposed driver model is suitable for simulating diversity of the human driver's driving characteristics.

AB This article presents an online local path planning approach for autonomous drone navigating a 2D plane in an unknown, indoor corridor-like environment. The proposed method utilizes a reinforcement learning approach for training a local path planner for navigation in the said environment. With a continuous actor-critic learning automaton (CACLA) applied for continuous action spaces, the proposed algorithm uses a reward structure that formulates a balancing function that gives reward based on balancing the vehicle between artificial potential hills. The drone thereby learns steering control and obstacle avoidance while maintaining a central aligned position with respect to the unknown hallways or corridors. A novel CACLA algorithm and incorporation of a special experience replay memory for the better converging tendency of drone toward the balancing point have been introduced in this article. The proposed reinforcement learning-based online local path planner has been tested on a simulated drone in Gazebo environment.

The maintenance of PV plants represents a key aspect for the profitability in energy production and autonomous inspection of such systems is a promising technology especially for large utility-scale plants where manned techniques have significant limitations in terms of time, cost and performance. In this light, an ad hoc flight control solution is investigated to exploit available UAV sensor data to enhance flight monitoring capability and correct GNSS position errors with respect to final target needs. The proposed algorithm has been tested in a simulated environment with a software-in-the loop (SITL) approach to show its effectiveness and final comparison with state of the art solutions.

AB Accounting for all operating conditions of a system at the design stage is typically infeasible for complex systems. Monitoring and verifying system requirements at runtime enable a system to continuously and introspectively ensure the system is operating correctly in the presence of dynamic execution scenarios. In this article, we present a requirements-driven methodology enabling efficient runtime monitoring of embedded systems. The proposed approach extracts a runtime monitoring graph from system requirements specified using UML sequence diagrams. Non-intrusive, on-chip hardware dynamically monitors the system execution, verifies the execution adheres to the requirements model, and in the event of a failure provides detailed information that can be analyzed to determine the root cause. Using case studies of an autonomous vehicle and pacemaker prototypes, we analyze the relationship between event coverage, detection rate, and hardware requirements

AB The purpose of this work is to estimate target coordinates and velocity. Target tracking is performed by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The observer is equipped with the direction finder that measures the azimuth and elevation angles of the target and the target range. Such problems are normally solved with the aid of non-linear filters due to nonlinearity of measurements. However, most filters produce estimations with unknown bias in the absence of estimations of accuracy. An important problem is related to unobservability of the target. A pseudomeasurement method is proposed to transform the problem of estimation into a linear problem. Such an approach makes possible to estimate coordinates and velocity of a moving target and solve the problem of unobservability. Results of computer simulation prove efficiency of the proposed algorithm in the problem of passive target tracking when only angles are measured.

AB In this paper we present a new visuo-haptic interaction mechanism for human-robot formation control. The formation setup consists of a human leader and multiple follower robots. The mobile robots are equipped only with RGB-D cameras, and they should maintain a desired distance and orientation to the leader at all times. Mechanical limitations common to all the robots limit the possible trajectories that the human can take. In this regard, vibrotactile feedback provided by a haptic bracelet guides the human along trajectories that are feasible for the team by warning her/him when the formation constraints are being violated. Psychophysical tests on the bracelet together with real-world experiments conducted with a team of Pioneer robots show the effectiveness of the proposed visuo-haptic paradigm for the coordination of mixed human-robot teams.

AB A consensus problem is investigated for a group of second-order agents with an active leader where the velocity of the leader cannot be measured, and the leader as well as all the agents is governed by the same non-linear intrinsic dynamics. To achieve consensus in the sense of both position and velocity, a neighbour-based estimator design approach and a pinning-controlled algorithm are proposed for each autonomous agent. It is found that all the agents in the group can follow the leader, and the velocity tracking errors of estimators converge to zero asymptotically, without assuming that the interaction topology is strongly connected or contains a directed spanning tree. In terms of the switching topologies between the leader and the followers, similar results are obtained. Finally, these theoretical results are demonstrated by the numerical simulations.

AB Public acceptability of automated vehicles (AVs) is critical to gauge in order to understand the factors that are likely to encourage drivers to utilise the technology and realise its predicted safety and other benefits. Willingness to pay (WTP) is a particularly important facet of acceptability as AVs will only penetrate the market in so much as people are willing to purchase it. However, there currently exists a lack of research that has examined how attitudes and opinions towards AVs may impact WTP for the technology. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the predictive utility of AV-related attitudes and opinions in identifying individuals who are, and those who are not, willing to pay for the technology. The study employed a sample of 6133 Australian and New Zealand respondents who responded to a comprehensive online survey (including over 50 items specific targeting aspects of AV acceptability). Survey items gauged attitudes and opinions closely related to the acceptability of AVs including (but not limited to) (a) perceived benefits and concerns, (b) likely conditions of use, (c) engagement in secondary activities when supported by automation, and (d) WTP for the technology. Results showed that attitudes and opinions relating to perceived benefits, level of comfort with an AV undertaking certain driving functions, and engagement in secondary activities were among the strongest predictors of WTP, over and above key sociodemographic variables (e.g., age, salary), while the weakest were associated with awareness of AV technologies and perceived concerns. As such, the study makes a novel contribution to the existing literature by highlighting specific attitudes and opinions that may be crucial to consider when attempting to better understand, and predict, peoples' WTP for AV technology prior to system use. Given this, we believe the information derived from this study will be useful for industry and government stakeholders. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents a new depth-and semantics-aware conditional generative model, named TITAN-Next, for cross-domain image-to-image translation in a multi-modal setup between LiDAR and camera sensors. The proposed model leverages scene semantics as a mid-level representation and is able to translate raw LiDAR point clouds to RGB-D camera images by solely relying on semantic scene segments. We claim that this is the first framework of its kind and it has practical applications in autonomous vehicles such as providing a fail-safe mechanism and augmenting available data in the target image domain. The proposed model is evaluated on the large-scale and challenging Semantic-KITTI dataset, and experimental findings show that it considerably outperforms the original TITAN-Net and other strong baselines by 23.7% margin in terms of IoU.

AB This paper proposes a new robust fault tolerant control architecture based on a disturbance observer. The control architecture is composed of a nominal controller and a rotor's fault observer capable to identify and estimate motors' degradation performance. Besides, is designed for a quadrotor vehicle and validated in critical and noncritical motors' failures. For both failure cases, each motor performance is analyzed to counteracted the failure and restore the system stability. If the practical stability is not recovered (critical case) a control reconfiguration is performed for safe landing. Experimental tests are carried out in real time to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture when confronting the stability of the system with aggressive disturbances or uncertainties.

AB Image sensors used in consumer cameras only detect intensity of light. Spectral, angular, and phase information of incident light is largely lost. For conventional applications like photography, the intensity information with three color bands (RGB) is sufficient. However, for advanced sensing applications, such as autonomous vehicles, biomedical imaging, and robotics, extracting more information from the incident light could help machines to make better decisions. It is expected that, in the future, more cameras will be built for machines than for people, which will be further accelerated by the rapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We envision that these applications will substantially benefit from multimodal measurement of light fields by advanced imaging sensors. In this Perspective, we discuss recent progress in image sensors with multimodal capabilities. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

ID INVERSE RESPONSE; ZEROS
AB One of the most striking phenomena in systems and control theory is initial undershoot, where the initial direction of the response of a system to a step input or setpoint command is opposite to the direction of the asymptotic response. As mentioned in "Summary," initial undershoot represents a fundamental limitation on the performance of a control system, and it has potentially serious consequences, especially when the initially "wrong" direction violates constraints on the output of the system. For example, in motion control applications, such as robotics or autonomous vehicles, initial undershoot may result in a collision. In any event, initial undershoot is an intriguing, visual example of a system-theoretic phenomenon that occurs in electrical, mechanical, and cyberphysical systems, and it is one of the many deleterious effects of nonminimum-phase zeros on the achievable performance of feedback control systems [1]-[3].

AB In this paper, a turning circle based trajectory planning method (TCBTPM) is proposed to conduct trajectory planning of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for mobile docking mission. Firstly, the six degrees of freedom kinematics and dynamics model of underactuated AUV is acquired. Following this, the simulation of horizontal turning circle trial is studied and the overview of mobile docking mission is introduced. Furthermore, TCBTPM is used to predict the relative position of AUV and the mobile docking station (MDS) in advance and generate a feasible trajectory for the mobile docking mission. Finally, a mobile docking guidance system containing TCBTPM, pure pursuit (PP) guidance law and line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is employed to obtain desired guidance commands and guides the underactuated AUV to dock efficiently and reliably.

AB In autonomous driving vehicles, the emergency braking system uses lidar or radar sensors to recognize the surrounding environment and prevent accidents. The conventional classifiers based on radar data using deep learning are single input structures using range-Doppler maps or micro-Doppler. Deep learning with a single input structure has limitations in improving classification performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-input classifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to reduce the amount of computation and improve the classification performance using the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The proposed multi-input deep learning structure is a CNN-based structure using a distance Doppler map and a point cloud map as multiple inputs. The classification accuracy with the range-Doppler map or the point cloud map is 85% and 92%, respectively. It has been improved to 96% with both maps.

AB The navigation system of a mobile robot is usually a combination of different sensors. In order to align these measurements, the intrinsic parameters of each sensor and the spatio-temporal extrinsic parameters among them are required to be precisely calibrated. In this paper, a simultaneous intrinsic and extrinsic calibration algorithm of a visual-odometric system is proposed. An initialization process is designed to generate rough estimation of the camera intrinsics, the odometric parameters, and the spatio extrinsic parameters. Then, a joint optimization problem is iteratively solved to obtain a refined calibration result. By taking temporal delay into consideration during the calibration process, the estimation accuracy is highly improved. Experiments are conducted with simulation datasets and also an industrial autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) system. The results are presented to validate the efficiency of our algorithm.

AB Communications and routing protocols for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are affected by dynamic vehicular constraints like high mobility, efficient delivery, reliable path, and trustworthiness. We propose a novel "VAR(2)" scheme that enables autonomous trust and selects routes with the longest connectivity time to efficiently deliver messages. In multi-hop and multi-path VANETs, the proposed scheme ensures reliability by selecting compatible and trustworthy routes with minimum additional communications. Our Python simulations on sparse and dense SUMO traffic traces show that the proposed VAR(2) routes have 100 similar to 400s connectivity with only 3 similar to 4 hops and achieve 6 similar to 15% PDR, which are comparatively more efficient results than that of existing schemes.

ID FACE RECOGNITION
AB Automatic classification of terrain surfaces from an aerial image is essential for an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landing at an unprepared site by using vision. Diverse terrain surfaces may show similar spectral properties due to the illumination and noise that easily cause poor classification performance. To address this issue, a multi-stage classification algorithm based on low-rank recovery and multi-feature fusion sparse representation is proposed. First, color moments and Gabor texture feature are extracted from training data and stacked as column vectors of a dictionary. Then we perform low-rank matrix recovery for the dictionary by using augmented Lagrange multipliers and construct a multi-stage terrain classifier. Experimental results on an aerial map database that we prepared verify the classification accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America.

AB A new unsupervised approach for characterizing seafloor in side-looking sonar imagery is proposed. The approach is based on lacunarity, which measures the pixel-intensity variation, of through-the-sensor data. No training data are required, no assumptions regarding the statistical distributions of the pixels are made, and the universe of (discrete) seafloor types need not be enumerated or known. It is shown how lacunarity can be computed very quickly using integral-image representations, thereby making real-time seafloor assessments on-board an autonomous underwater vehicle feasible. The promise of the approach is demonstrated on high-resolution synthetic-aperture-sonar imagery of diverse seafloor conditions measured at various geographical sites. Specifically, it is shown how lacunarity can effectively distinguish different seafloor conditions and how this fact can be exploited for target-detection performance prediction in mine-countermeasure operations.

AB Automatic Design of Algorithms through Evolution (ADATE) is a program synthesis system that creates recursive programs in a functional language with automatic invention of recursive help functions and self-adaptive optimization of numerical values. We implement a neuron in a pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) as a recursive function in the ADATE language and then use ADATE to automatically evolve better PCNN neurons for image segmentation.
   Our technique is generally applicable for automatic improvement of most image processing algorithms and neural computing methods. It may be used either to generally improve a given implementation or to tailor that implementation to a specific problem, which with respect to image segmentation for example can be road following for autonomous vehicles or infrared image segmentation for heat seeking missiles that are to distinguish the heat source of the target from flares.

AB A communication system which attains an efficient amalgamation of base station (BS) type cellular communication and non-BS type direct communication for mobile terminals (MTs), "cellular-ad-hoc united communication system," is proposed. In this system, whether a cellular system or an ad-hoc communication system is chosen by distance and whether the condition is good or not between communicating MTs. In other words, when two terminals are relatively near each other and are in sufficient conditions to communicate directly, they select the ad-hoc communication, while for other cases they use the cellular system. The proposed system was confirmed to have effective channel usage and low battery consumption from the simulation results. It can be also said that this system is suited especially for MTs which tend to communicate with closer partners such as operational mobile robots and autonomous carrier vehicles.

AB The automotive industry is set to face a series of fundamental changes in the following years. Along with the transition to electric vehicles or production of autonomous cars, companies are also expected to better address sustainability issues, usually divided into environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects. The present paper aims to explore the relationship between non-financial sustainability, measured by ESG scores, and firm value in the automotive industry, where empirical evidence is scarce. A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach has been taken on a novel dataset of 131 listed companies worldwide across 6 years. Our results indicate a mixed influence of the E, S, G scores on firm value in the analyzed period, with some inconclusive effects, especially from the social score. The findings are beneficial for investors, fund managers and automotive companies' executives. Further research directions are also provided.

AB Emerging Technologies Have always challenged traditional regulatory regimes [1]. This is not new nor is this tension likely to change anytime soon given the increasing speed at which embryonic technologies are emerging into the market [2]. Some of these technologies, such as autonomous vehicles or drones, can be effectively regulated at the national level due to clearly defined jurisdictional boundaries and the existence of relevant national and state/provincial regulatory agencies that oversee their conventional counterparts. While the entry of these technologies into the market will challenge regulators and policymakers and may require tweaking of existing regimes, we argue that these technologies, and the products that they enable, will not require a sui generis response at the national and supranational levels. The same cannot be said for artificial intelligence (AI) and the myriad of interconnected and interwoven applications made possible by AI.

AB Over the last several years, the Air-Sea Interaction Laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography has developed a fleet of wave-powered, uncrewed Wave Gliders (Liquid Robotics) specifically designed and instrumented for state-of-the-art air-sea interaction and upper ocean observations. In this study, measurement capabilities from these platforms are carefully described, compared, and validated against coincident measurements from well-established, independent data sources. Data collected from four major field programs from 2013 to 2020 are considered in the analysis. Case studies focusing on air-sea interaction, Langmuir circulations, and frontal processes are presented. We demonstrate here that these novel, instrumented platforms are capable of collecting observations with minimal flow-structure interaction in the air-sea boundary layer, a region of crucial current and future importance for models of weather and climate.</p>

AB Exploration vehicles need accurate localization for performing tasks such as autonomous navigation. Images captured from stereo cameras allow to estimate both the robot's motion and the environment structure. This task is referred to as Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). With this work we evaluate some of the most famous solutions for Visual SLAM compatible with the ROS (Robot Operating System) middleware. The main contributions of this work to current literature are twofold: first we evaluate the algorithm performances respectively to a nVidia Jetson TX2 board instead of a common workstation-grade computer. Secondly, we delegate image processing tasks to the embedded GPU showing significant performance gains in terms of robustness, resource utilization and processed frames per second.

AB In the development of autonomous driving, decision-making has become one of the technical difficulties. Traditional rule-based decision-making methods lack adaptive capacity when dealing with unfamiliar and complex traffic conditions. However, reinforcement learning shows the potential to solve sequential decision problems. In this article, an independent decision-making method based on reinforcement Q-learning is proposed. First, a Markov decision process model is established by analysis of car-following. Then, the state set and action set are designed by the synthesized consideration of driving simulator experimental results and driving risk principles. Furthermore, the reinforcement Q-learning algorithm is developed mainly based on the reward function and update function. Finally, the feasibility is verified through random simulation tests, and the improvement is made by comparative analysis with a traditional method.

AB In this paper, we propose two schemes; position-aware mobility pattern (PAMP) and cooperative PAMP (Co PAMP). The first one is an optimization scheme that avoids void hole occurrence and minimizes the uncertainty in the position estimation of glider's. The second one is a cooperative routing scheme that reduces the packet drop ratio by using the relay cooperation. Both techniques use gliders that stay at sojourn positions for a predefined time, at sojourn position self-confidence (s-confidence) and neighbor-confidence (n-confidence) regions that are estimated for balanced energy consumption. The transmission power of a glider is adjusted according to those confidence regions. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes outperform the compared existing one in terms of packet delivery ratio, void zones and energy consumption.

AB In this paper, the COMPASS (or BeiDou) navigation satellite system is utilized for the autonomous flight control of a micro quadrotor helicopter. The CEP (circular error probable) of the COMPASS system is up to 10 m, which is about 10 times higher than the widely used GPS system (Global Positioning System). To overcome limited position accuracy associated with the COMPASS system, an onboard vision system is employed to provide high accuracy translational velocity estimations. By fusing the COMPASS system with the vision based velocity measurement, accurate and drift-free position estimation can be obtained. In addition, a nonlinear flight controller is utilized to improve the trajectory tracking ability. Finally, the validity and practicability are verified by the real-time experimental results.

TI Path Following Control of an AUV under the Current Using the SVR-ADRC
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID ADAPTIVE ROBUST-CONTROL
AB A novel active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) controller is proposed based on support vector regression (SVR). The SVR-ADRC is designed to force an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to follow a path in the horizontal plane with the ocean current disturbance. It is derived using SVR algorithm to adjust the coefficients of the nonlinear state error feedback (ELSEF) part in ADRC to deal with nonlinear variations at different operating points. The trend of change about ELSEF coefficients in the simulation proves that the designed SVR algorithm maintains the characteristics of astringency and stability. Furthermore, the path following errors under current in simulation has proved the high accuracy, strong robustness, and stability of the proposed SVR-ADRC. The contributions of the proposed controller are to improve the characteristics of ADRC considering the changing parameters in operating environment which make the controller more adaptive for the situation.

AB The feasibility of using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) sensor nodes is studied in a distributed network, aiming at dynamic surveillance and tracking of ground targets. Data acquisition by low-cost (<$50 US) miniature low-power radar through a wireless mote is described. We demonstrate the detection, ranging and velocity estimation, classification and tracking capabilities of the mini-radar, and compare results to simulations and manual measurements. Furthermore, we supplement the radar output with other sensor modalities, such as acoustic and vibration sensors. This method provides innovative solutions for detecting, identifying, and tracking vehicles and dismounts over a wide area in noisy conditions. This study presents a step towards distributed intelligent decision support and demonstrates effectiveness of small cheap sensors, which can complement advanced technologies in certain real-life scenarios.

Exploration pressure will intensify as sea ice thinning and retreat continue, and the subsequent production could involve spills or blowouts under various kinds of sea ice. Existing models for the spread of oil under ice are inadequate because they are unable to replicate the complexity or uniqueness of different ice regimes. Through the novel combination of 3- D under-ice imagery from an autonomous under water vehicle ( AUV) and oil- trajectory modelling we demonstrate that it is possible to overcome these deficiencies. Results suggest that we are presently underestimating the spread of oil under sea ice by an order of magnitude. This is an important result with wide ranging ramifications as it suggests that our present ability to contain and recover oil under ice is limited.

AB In this work we study the motion control problem of an industrial autonomous tricycle mobile nonholonomic robot called Hercule, with particular interest in two cases of industrial use, the path-tracking and the parking-like manoeuvre. For the path-tracking application, we study and implement two control algorithms on the Hercule robot. The first algorithm is based on the linearization of the feedback state, and the second is based on the Lyapunov approach. Results of the outdoor navigation of this robot are displayed and compared to those resulting from the simulation. For the parking-like manoeuvre, we develop and implement a fuzzy logic controller that allows the final destination to be reached with the required orientation. Experimental results on the Hercule robot demonstrate the efficiency of the developed digital control system.

AB In this paper we present our novel Fuzzy-Genetic techniques for the online learning and adaptation of an intelligent robotic navigator system. Such a system could be used by autonomous mobile vehicles navigating in unstructured and changing environments. In this work we focus on the online learning of the obstacle avoidance behaviour, which is an example of a behaviour that receives delayed reinforcement. We show how this behaviour can be co-ordinated with other behaviours that receive immediate reinforcement (such as goal seeking and edge following) learnt during our previous work to generate an intelligent reactive navigator that can deal with unstructured and changing outdoor environments. The system described uses a life long learning paradigm whereby it is able to dynamically adapt to new environments and update its knowledge base. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work in limited communication control is directed towards bringing together classical control theory and communication theoretical issues that are of practical importance in the design of control systems. It is common to "decouple" the communication aspects from the underlying dynamics of a system, as this simplifies the analysis and generally works well for classical models. However, in situations where a single decision maker controls many subsystems over a communication channel of a finite capacity, the computation of control signals and their transmission to each system may take significant amounts of time. To address such cases, we consider a class of discrete-time models that jointly optimize over control and communication goals. Real-world examples where these models play a role include remotely controlled unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), planetary revers, arrays of microactuators and power control in mobile communication.

AB In urban computing composed of various Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data is collected from IoT as learning data for other IoT devices in a circular structure. Therefore, data are shared resources and crucial in urban computing. In particular, group communication is essential for effective data sharing and for updating software in an IoT system. However, changing the group key is imperative for data security in group communication whenever the group member changes. When the movement of IoTs is high, group key redistribution must be repeated because the group membership keeps changing. In changing and redistributing the group keys, overhead occurs, inevitably degrading system performance. In addition, since much data traffic generates in IoT devices' crowded areas, transmission delay and data loss could degrade system performance. Due to IoT's low-power and low-capacity characteristics, one-to-one communication is inefficient, requiring efficient group management and group key management. This work proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based group and group key management scheme to establish an efficient communication environment in urban computing. We adopted blockchains to track the movement and density of IoT and secure node authorization. Using the upper layer blockchain, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) determines the movement and density of IoTs. Using the lower-layer blockchain, base stations (BSs) identify the IoT's movement of information in each group. We included only nodes determined to be safe in the group. Through the hierarchical blockchain, while protecting the IoT's privacy, we can record the information in the blockchain to determine the mobility of nodes and the node density of a group. We set several experimental environments, and analyzed the efficiency by simulating the addition of secondary gateways and group integration. As a result, we showed that our proposal establishes an efficient communication environment and reduces computational and communication overhead.

AB Jitter effects caused by airflow and vibrations could be harmful to UAV communications, e.g., it may cause mismatch between the transmit beam and actual user direction. However, jitter introduces additional randomness to the channel, which may have merit in sparse channels that are relatively static and deep faded. For this consideration, we pick the commonly used air-to-sea two ray propagation model and investigate the impact of UAV jitter on the channel fading statistics. Assuming a Gaussian random model for the jitter angle, we derive analytical expressions for the jitter-beneficial probability (the probability that UAV jitter increases the receive power), and the average receive power under jitter, respectively. Accordingly, the jitter-beneficial conditions are analyzed and verified via simulations.

AB Recently, self-supervised learning of depth and ego-motion from thermal images shows strong robustness and reliability under challenging scenarios. However, the inherent thermal image properties such as weak contrast, blurry edges, and noise hinder to generate effective self-supervision from thermal images. Therefore, most research relies on additional self-supervision sources such as well-lit RGB images, generative models, and Lidar information. In this letter, we conduct an in-depth analysis of thermal image characteristics that degenerates self-supervision from thermal images. Based on the analysis, we propose an effective thermal image mapping method that significantly increases image information, such as overall structure, contrast, and details, while preserving temporal consistency. The proposed method shows outperformed depth and pose results than previous state-of-the-art networks without leveraging additional RGB guidance.

AB Object detection and segmentation algorithms evolved significantly in the last decade. Simultaneous object detection and segmentation paved the way for real-time applications such as autonomous driving. Detection and segmentation of (partially) flooded roadways are essential inputs for vehicle routing and traffic management systems. This paper proposes an automatic floodwater detection and segmentation method utilizing the Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask-R-CNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) algorithms. To train the model, manually labeled images with urban, suburban, and natural settings are used. The performances of the algorithms are assessed in accurately detecting the floodwater captured in images. The results show that the proposed Mask-R-CNN-based floodwater detection and segmentation outperform previous studies, whereas the GAN-based model has a straightforward implementation compared to other models.

AB Aiming at the problem of autonomous underwater vehicle navigation trajectory optimization using single beacon location under direct route condition, a nonlinear system model for AUV single beacon navigation is established, and the linearized system model with error states is constructed by polar coordinate transformation and simplification. Then, current disturbance is considered. To find out the optimum path to utilize range-only measurements, a novel observability degree-based analysis method is proposed, which gives a quantitative insight into convergence characteristics of the error states by using the eigenvalues of the normalized error covariance matrix. Simulation experiments are done to test convergence characteristics of AUV integrated navigation error states with single beacon range-only measurements under direct route control conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed control method is effective, and it has an important engineering application value and provides us with an optimized path.

AB Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operate under uncertain environmental conditions and can have to face unexpected obstacles, weather changes and sensor or hardware/software component failures. In such situations, the UAV must be able to detect and locate the failure and to take adequate recovery actions. In this paper, we focus on the Health Management of the system depending on the context of the mission. The task of this Health Management is to monitor the status of the system components based on observations from sensors and appearance contexts, and it is designed by means of Bayesian Networks arising from the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis. We jointly introduce a framework to generate embedded software and hardware implementations for online and real-time observations, which are demonstrated on a Hybrid CPU/FPGA Zynq platform.

TI Localization for anchor-free underwater sensor networks
SO COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB For Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN), identifying the location of each sensor node is an important issue, which is also a challenging task. Most of the existing localization schemes assume that the network has a plurality of anchor nodes to assist positioning. Usually, they make use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) or node with special equipment as anchor node, because Global Positioning System (GPS) is invalid in underwater environment. High cost and poor flexibility make them not well suitable for UWSN. In order to overcome this disadvantage, we propose an Anchor-Free Localization Algorithm, called AFLA. It is designed for active-restricted underwater sensor networks. AFLA does not need anchor node's information, and makes use of the relationship of adjacent nodes. It could be used in both static and dynamic networks. The obtained simulation results indicate that AFLA is an effective localization scheme for UWSN. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a simple, yet very effective filtering method to suppress short-term broadband noise in micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) gyros for yaw angle measurement with minimized drift. This method is suitable for autonomous indoor mobile robots that use two low-cost sensors: an inertial one, which uses a gyroscope, and an odometric one, which uses encoders mounted on the vehicle's wheels. The main idea of the proposed approach is consists of two phases: (1) a threshold filter for translational motions, and (2) a moving average filter for rotational motions to reject the broadband noise component that affects short-term performance. Experimental results with the proposed phased method applied to an Epson XV3500 MEMS gyro demonstrate that it effectively suppresses short-term broadband noise and yields accurate yaw angle with minimized drift.

AB The Wyoming Information, Signal Processing, and Robotics Laboratory is developing a wide variety of bio-inspired vision sensors. We are interested in exploring the vision system of various insects and adapting some of their features toward the development of specialized vision sensors. We do not attempt to supplant traditional digital imaging techniques but rather develop sensor systems tailor made for the application at hand. We envision that many applications may require a hybrid approach using conventional digital imaging techniques enhanced with bio-inspired analogue sensors. In this specific project, we investigated the apposition compound eye and its characteristics commonly found in diurnal insects and certain species of arthropods. We developed and characterized an array of apposition compound eye-type sensors and tested them on an autonomous robotic vehicle. The robot exhibits the ability to follow a pre-defined target and avoid specified obstacles using a simple control algorithm.

AB The navigation of Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in industrial environments is often controlled by positioning systems based on landmarks or artificial beacons. In these systems, the position of an AGV navigating in an interior space is determined by the calculation of its relative distance to beacons, whose location is known in advance. A fundamental design problem associated with landmark navigation systems consists in determining the optimal location of the minimum number of beacons necessary to achieve a desired level of accuracy and reliability. A local search procedure Coupled with a diversification strategy is developed for this problem. Comparisons with an earlier solution method based on genetic algorithms are provided and it is shown that the proposed procedure finds better designs in a Fraction of the computational time employed by the genetic algorithm.

AB This paper deals with the optimal design of deep submarine exploration housings and autonomous underwater vehicles. The structures under investigation are thin-walled laminated composite unstiffened vessels. Structural buckling failure due to the high external hydrostatic pressure is the dominant risk factor at exploitation conditions. The search of fiber orientations of the composite cylinders that maximize the stability limits is investigated. A genetic algorithm procedure coupled with an analytical model of shell buckling has been developed to determine numerically optimized stacking sequences. Characteristic lamination patterns have been obtained. FEM analyses have confirmed the corresponding significant increases of buckling pressures with respect to initial design solutions. Experiments on thin glass/epoxy and carbon/epoxy cylinders have been performed. The measured buckling pressures appear to be in good agreement with numerical results and demonstrate the gains due to the optimized laminations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the development of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) and communication technology, collaborative operation among vehicles will become the trend of the future. Thus, traffic flow will be mixed with manual driving vehicles and ICVs. A mixed traffic flow is a traffic flow state lying between autonomous and manual traffic flows. In order to describe the car-following characteristics in a mixed traffic flow, the cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) car-following model and the intelligent driver model (IDM) were adopted. The car-following characteristics of different platoons from these two car-following models were analyzed. The CACC mixing ratio was used to describe the mixed traffic flow. The fixed states and disturbance states of the car-following platoons were simulated. The fixed states can be divided into three categories: the steady state, acceleration state, and deceleration state. The effects of different car-following cases and different mixing ratios on mixed traffic flow in different states were discussed. The results show that (1) in the steady state with a smaller mixing ratio, the operating speed and traffic volume of the mixed traffic flow were positively correlated. The overall traffic volume decreased with the increase in the mixing ratio, and the gap gradually narrowed. At a larger mixing ratio, the operating speed and traffic volume were negatively correlated. The overall traffic volume increased with the increase in the mixing ratio. (2) In the acceleration state, the maximum traffic volume in the platoon and the optimal mixing ratio were linearly related to the acceleration. (3) In the deceleration state with a fixed mixing ratio, the traffic volume decreased with the increase in the deceleration, with slight differences in the changing trend of the volume of the mixed flow. Under disturbances, the mixed traffic volume was positively correlated with the mixing ratio, i.e., at a larger mixing ratio, the anti-interference ability of the mixed traffic flow was higher.

AB The ability to avoid shorelines, reefs and moving ships or obstacles is the premise of automatic navigation. For achieving the goal, conventional A star algorithm is improved to plan route globally. The safety distance is set between planning route and obstacles. Additionally, the planning route is further optimized to remove unnecessary waypoints, and only vital waypoints are retained for conforming to navigation practice and track keeping control. Besides, minimum course alteration algorithm (MCA) is proposed to avoid moving ships or obstacles constrained by COLREGs. The proposed algorithms are validated in simulation. The results show that the algorithms are credible in two and multi ships encounter situations, even the targets ships take unexpected course alteration and the own ship could well avoid collision with shorelines, reefs and moving ships or obstacles under external disturbance.

AB Likened to the discovery of electricity and the introduction of the internet, the arrival of 5G network technology has been met with great enthusiasm and high expectations for its futuristic potential uses. Envisioned 5G-enabled applications include autonomous vehicle fleets; fully immersive, continuous virtual reality; a tactile, sensor-based internet; and billions of peer-to-peer connected Internet-of-Things devices. Despite the hype, a recent survey suggests that most business managers and executives do not understand the technology and its transformative potential nor how to assess its appropriateness for their existing operations. In this article, we explore the potential future applications of 5G, where we are today with the technology, its adoption challenges, and how managers should evaluate investing resources into 5G.

AB Designed to outperform conventional computers when performing machine-learning tasks, neuromorphic computation is the principle whereby certain aspects of the human brain are replicated in hardware. While great progress has been made in this field in recent years, almost all input signals provided to neuromorphic processors are still designed for traditional (von Neumann) computer architectures. Here, we show that a simple photosensitive capacitor will inherently reproduce certain aspects of biological retinas. We found that capacitors based on metal halide perovskites will output a brief voltage spike in response to changes in incident light intensity, but output zero voltage under constant illumination. Such a sensor is not only optimized for use with spiking neuromorphic processors but also anticipated to have broad appeal from fields such as light detection and ranging, autonomous vehicles, facile recognition, navigation, and robotics.

AB In the last years Autonomous vehicle navigation has had considerable improvements; however, this technology has not yet been able to effectively be integrated with mobile systems that work inside buildings, houses or without the influence of absolute references such as GPS. It is for this reason that this paper provides a methodological proposal that allows the integration of the use of object detection methods such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or R-CNN (Region Convolutional Neural Networks), with laser scanning systems for the measurement of spatial coordinates and an INS system to obtain spatial positioning through relative references. This method integrates the principle of dynamic triangulation and the methodological proposal IKZ (Inertial Navigation with Kalman and Zero Update) that allow to obtain acceptable mobile autonomy times in which the sector of interest is re-scanned.

ID SCATTERING DETECTION; ACOUSTIC BARRIER; MATRIX; LOCALIZATION
AB The underwater surveillance of harbors is challenging, as the reverberation-limited environment means that intruders with a weak target strength, such as autonomous underwater vehicles and frogmen, may be overlapped or even overwhelmed by reverberations. In recent years, developments in low-rank and sparsity theory have presented an innovative idea for intruder detection. This paper describes a method in which multi-frame data containing echoes of an intruder and reverberations are arranged in a matrix, and then the data matrix is decomposed to achieve detection. Based on this idea, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is applied to the problem of intruder detection. The key parameters of ADMM are discussed and recommended values are given. The proposed method is validated and evaluated through a series of experiments. (C) 2019 Acoustical Society of America.

AB Achieving computer vision on microscale devices is a challenge. On these platforms, the power and mass constraints are severe enough for even the most common computations (matrix manipulations, convolution, etc.) to be difficult. This paper proposes and analyzes a class of miniature vision sensors that can help overcome these constraints. These sensors reduce power requirements through template-based optical convolution, and they enable a wide field-of-view within a small form through a refractive optical design. We describe the tradeoffs between the field-of-view, volume, and mass of these sensors and we provide analytic tools to navigate the design space. We demonstrate milliscale prototypes for computer vision tasks such as locating edges, tracking targets, and detecting faces. Finally, we utilize photolithographic fabrication tools to further miniaturize the optical designs and demonstrate fiducial detection onboard a small autonomous air vehicle.

AB A technique of gradual approximation of the domain of attraction in the case of nonlinear continuous and discrete analytical dynamical systems is presented. The technique is based on the gradual extension of the "embryo" of the optimal Lyapunov function and gives, at each step, a new, open and non-empty piece of the domain of attraction. For a nonlinear dynamical system with control, defined by an analytical autonomous system of differential equations or difference equations, using domains of attraction, it is shown that two steady states, which belong to an analytic path of asymptotically stable steady states, can be transferred gradually one in the other by successive changes of the values of the control parameters. Numerical examples are given for the ALFLEX reentry vehicle and for a discrete dynamical system considered recently in the literature. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID REGISTRATION
AB The simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method estimates vehicles' pose and builds maps established on the collection of environmental information primarily through sensors such as LiDAR and cameras. Compared to the camera-based SLAM, the LiDAR-based SLAM is more geared to complicated environments and is not susceptible to weather and illumination, which has increasingly become a hot topic in autonomous driving. However, there has been relatively little research on the LiDAR-based SLAM algorithm in rugged scenes. The following two issues remain unsolved: on the one hand, the small overlap area of two adjacent point clouds results in insufficient valuable features that can be extracted; on the other hand, the conventional feature matching method does not take point cloud pitching into account, which frequently results in matching failure. Hence, a LiDAR SLAM algorithm based on neighborhood information constraints (LoNiC) for rugged terrain is proposed in this study. Firstly, we obtain the feature points with surface information using the distribution of the normal vector angles in the neighborhood and extract features with discrimination through the local surface information of the point cloud, to improve the describing ability of feature points in rugged scenes. Secondly, we provide a multi-scale constraint description based on point cloud curvature, normal vector angle, and Euclidean distance to enhance the algorithm's discrimination of the differences between feature points and prevent mis-registration. Subsequently, in order to lessen the impact of the initial pose value on the precision of point cloud registration, we introduce the dynamic iteration factor to the registration process and modify the corresponding relationship of the matching point pairs by adjusting the distance and angle thresholds. Finally, the verification based on the KITTI and JLU campus datasets verifies that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of mapping. Specifically in rugged scenes, the mean relative translation error is 0.0173%, and the mean relative rotation error is 2.8744 degrees/m, reaching the current level of the state of the art (SOTA) method.

AB The development of intelligent connected technology provides a platform for multidimensional information interaction and makes the recognition of a specific lane change strategy become a reality. Intelligent driving systems cannot make human-like decisions by only recognizing left or right lane change behaviors; in fact, poor environmental cognitive competence is the main cause of accidents of intelligent driving systems during road tests. Therefore, the recognition of specific lane change strategies can provide support for safety performance improvement. This research aims to identify the different lane change strategies of a subject vehicle with a rear approaching vehicle in the target lane. For the purpose of acquiring different strategies, a total of 42 experienced drivers including 37 males and 5 females participated in the on-road vehicle experiments, and we divided lane change strategies into three categories: mandatory, yielding, and waiting for lane change. The lane change duration time, lane crossing time, and characteristic parameters including distance to lane line, steering wheel angle, relative distance, and relative speed under different lane change strategies were compared and analyzed. Then the random forest classifier was employed to construct a lane change strategy identification model. Results indicated that the maximum value of global recognition accuracy under three input parameters reached 88.78% when the time window was 1.2 s, which was higher than the maximum value of recognition accuracy under four input parameters, but the identification time was 0.1 s later than the model with four input parameters. In addition, the recognition performance of the random forest model, attention-bidirectional long short-term memory (Atten-BiLSTM) model and genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) model was compared. The results demonstrated that the global recognition accuracy and identification time of the proposed model were better than that of GA-SVM model under different input parameters, and the performance was comparable to the Atten-BiLSTM model. The findings provide the basis for the intelligent driving system to make more human-like decisions and improve safety performance.

AB As an anthropologist, I have worked with people in both developing new technologies and managing existing ones. Based on this experience, I suggest that although anthropologically informed perspectives can contribute to technology development-from providing insights on particular cases to raising broader questions about a product's impact on society-the route to doing so is sometimes indirect. In this endeavor, anthropology matters by engaging not just the finished product, when critique is so easily possible, but the process of development, as the work is yet underway. Such engagement is enabled by how people leverage their commitments, stances, and manner of being there along the way and over time. To better enable the impact of anthropology in this work, anthropologists would be well served by engaging more with these kinds of applied questions as a part of their training and knowledge production.

AB In the field of robotics engineering and autonomous driving vehicles, precise estimation of positions through visual place recognition (VPR) is crucial not only for reducing localization errors caused by visual odometry but also for preventing the creation of ambiguous maps in unfamiliar environments. Despite numerous research efforts aimed at improving VPR performance by addressing challenges such as illumination variation, occlusions, and dynamic objects, contemporary approaches have primarily focused on model-based methods, with limited attention given to data augmentation (DA) methods. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the impact of DA on the generalization ability of VPR. To achieve this objective, this study compares VPR learning approaches, conducts a comprehensive empirical analysis, and presents crucial insights. The results of this study can provide useful guidance for the design of future VPR systems and contribute to the advancement of computer vision and robotics research.

ID VISUAL ODOMETRY
AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous navigation requires access to translational and rotational positions and velocities. Since there is no single sensor to measure all UAV states, it is necessary to fuse information from multiple sensors. This paper proposes a deterministic estimator to reconstruct the scale factor of the position determined by a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm onboard a quadrotor UAV. The position scale factor is unknown when the SLAM algorithm relies on the information from a monocular camera. Only onboard sensor measurements can feed the estimator; thus, a deterministic observer is designed to rebuild the quadrotor translational velocity. The estimator and the observer are designed following the immersion and invariance method and use inertial and visual measurements. Lyapunov's arguments prove the asymptotic convergence of observer and estimator errors to zero. The proposed estimator's and observer's performance is validated through numerical simulations using a physics-based simulator.

AB There is a dilemma regarding the accuracy and reality of vehicle trajectory prediction. Balancing and predicting the effective trajectory is a topic of debate in autonomous driving. We investigated this issue using knowledge-driven and data-driven methods to estimate the performance of the two most common methods and found that improving the accu-racy, in reality, is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel trajectory prediction frame-work for heterogeneous traffic agents, where knowledge residuals are associated with data-driven methods and correct the results to make them more consistent with actual traffic conditions on the premise of high accuracy. Experiments on six public datasets showed that the proposed framework outperforms benchmarks. With an ablation study, we further verified that our method has a good generalisability for new scenarios and high generality in data-driven model selection. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB The multi-AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) formation trajectory tracking control methods in the case of weak communication environment under discrete-time collection are studied in this paper. First, the discrete-time dynamic expression of the AUV model is given. Considering the environment disturbance, the communication structure with time-varying characteristics is divided into bounded and unbounded communication delay (packet losses) conditions. Then, the proposed coordinated trajectory tracking controller is discussed based on the leader-followers and the virtual leader method, and its convergence has been derived respectively. In addition, the switching topology communication structure caused by packet losses is discussed and analyzed. Finally, the simulation experiment verifies that the discrete-time multi-AUV system can form a fixed formation and achieve stable trajectory tracking under the bounded and unbounded communication delay in the underwater three-dimensional space.

Furthermore, a new chi-square test-based robust Kalman filter (CSTRKF) is also proposed in order to improve the robustness of the INS/SRS/CNS navigation system. In the CSTRKF, the chi-square test (CST) not only detects measurements with outliers and in non-Gaussian distributions, but also estimates the statistical characteristics of measurement noise. Finally, the results of our simulations indicate that the INS/SRS/CNS integrated navigation system with the CSTRKF possesses strong robustness and high reliability.

AB Determination of hydrodynamic coefficients is a vital part of predicting the dynamic behavior of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The aim of the present study was to determine the drag and lift related hydrodynamic coefficients of a research AUV, using Computational and Experimental Fluid Dynamics methods. Experimental tests were carried out at AUV speed of 1.5 m s-1 for two general cases: I. AUV without control surfaces (Hull) at various angles of attack in order to calculate Hull related hydrodynamic coefficients and II. AUV with control surfaces at zero angle of attack but in different stern angles to calculate hydrodynamic coefficients related to control surfaces. All the experiments carried out in a towing tank were also simulated by a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from the numerical simulations were in close agreement with those obtained from the experiments.

Moreover, new opportunities are being also presented since systems trend to be more reliable and autonomous. In this paper, a self-learning embedded system for object identification based on adaptive-cooperative dynamic approaches is presented for intelligent sensor's infrastructures. The proposed system is able to detect and identify moving objects using a dynamic decision tree. Consequently, it combines machine learning algorithms and cooperative strategies in order to make the system more adaptive to changing environments. Therefore, the proposed system may be very useful for many applications like shadow tolls since several types of vehicles may be distinguished, parking optimization systems, improved traffic conditions systems, etc.

In this paper, a hierarchical Independent Component Analysis (ICA) framework has been established to explore and understand the functional roles of the higher order statistical structures towards the visual stimulus in the underwater artificial vision system. The model is inspired by characteristics such as the modality, the redundancy reduction, the sparseness and the independence in the early human vision system, which seems to respectively capture the Gabor-like basis functions, the shape contours or the complicated textures in the multiple layer implementations. The simulation results have shown good performance in the effectiveness and the consistence of the approach proposed for the underwater images collected by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).

AB Future military and civilian unmanned systems will be extensively used on land, under the sea, in air, and in space. Evaluation of their autonomy is critical to realize the autonomous operation ability of unmanned systems. This paper discussed the basic concepts of autonomy and the significance of autonomy evaluation, and then surveys and describes existing evaluating methods. Based on analyses of key technologies and these technologies' technical readiness levels, a cobweb evaluation model as a universal evaluation model has been used to evaluate unmanned systems. If the technology warps (aspects of autonomy) and wefts (levels of those aspects) of unmanned systems can be determined for the cobweb model, the model can handle the mutual coupling, high dimensions, and diversity of warp lines. This model potentially has wide application in evaluating various unmanned systems.

AB We address the problem of global sensor fusion for the purpose of distributed decision-making, from a control-theoretic perspective. In particular, we introduce a quasi-linear stochastic distributed protocol, using which a network of sensing agents can reach agreement in order to take a collective action. Using control-theoretic methods, we design the parameters of our protocol - which include weights in the local update rules used by the agents and a finite stopping time - to achieve agreement in a fair and rapid manner. We show analytically that the developed protocol achieves fair agreement with certainty in the noise-free case and achieves fair agreement with high probability even in the presence of communication noise and assuming very little information storage capability for the agents. Our development is illustrated throughout with a canonical example motivated by autonomous vehicle control.

AB An electrostatic potential field (EPF) path planner is combined with a two-layered fuzzy logic inference engine and implemented for real-time mobile robot navigation in a 2-D dynamic environment. The environment is first mapped into a resistor network; an electrostatic potential field is then created through current injection into the network. The path of maximum current through the network corresponds to the approximately optimum path in the environment. The first layer of the fuzzy logic inference engine performs sensor fusion from sensor readings into a fuzzy variable, collision, providing information about possible collisions in four directions,front, back, left, and right. The second layer guarantees collision avoidance with dynamic obstacles while following the trajectory generated by the electrostatic potential field. The proposed approach is experimentally tested using the Nomad 200 mobile robot.

AB Flywheels are proving to be an ideal form of energy storage on account of their high power density, cycle life and storage efficiency. This paper describes an energy storage system comprised of a steel flywheel and mechanical variator, designed to provide the main drive power for a hybrid railcar which can be charged either rapidly at stops on the route, or continuously at a constant rate from an on-board primary low power source. By operation on rails at urban speeds, with brake energy recovery, energy losses and consumption are minimised. A further application of the system is in load matching in autonomous wind diesel systems, as a means of load levelling and absorbing fluctuations in wind power. The results of laboratory tests on the energy storage unit are presented, along with the analysis of performance tests on a hybrid flywheel-battery rail vehicle. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Smart management of urban space is an important way to achieve the goal of sustainable urban development. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in urban space management work and have greatly improved the level of it. UAV technology assisting urban space management involves many technical details and has generated a number of problems. Therefore, a systematic review of the applications of UAVs in urban spatial management work is very necessary and can provide a comprehensive reference for relevant researchers. This is conducive to the generation of more new insights, methods, and applications. However, according to our research, there is a lack of relevant systematic investigation. We screened and researched a large number of relevant literature works (about 230) with the help of search tools, such as Web of Science and IEEE Xplore, and combined with our own working experience to review and summarize the field in an all-round way. Taking the definition, needs, and challenges of urban spatial management as an entry point, this article systematically summarizes the task flow, working paradigm, technical system, and application direction of UAV-assisted urban spatial management. It also takes our recently developed UAV urban management system as an example to provide an introduction on how to integrate advanced technologies such as UAV and artificial intelligence. Finally, this article summarizes several concluding findings and proposes several future research directions. The research in this article shows that UAV technology has already played a great role in urban spatial management work, but it is still far from realizing automation and intelligence, and it needs to continue to make efforts in terms of methods, systems, applications, and policies. In order to achieve these goals, UAV technology can be further integrated with advanced technologies such as deep learning, more types of UAV industry applications can be carried out, a more functional unmanned aircraft system can be developed, and better management policies can be formulated.

AB Objective: Prehospital spinal motion restriction as a prevention technique for secondary neurological injury is a key principle in emergency medicine. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of different cervical spinal cord motion restriction techniques of awake and cooperative healthy volunteers during extrication. Methods: Twenty-three healthy volunteers were asked to exit a car (unassisted) with a rigid cervical collar (CC condition) or without it (autonomous exit: AE; instructed exit: IE); they were also extricated by two rescuers after setting a rigid cervical collar and by using an extrication device (CC + XT condition). Eight 3 D infrared cameras were calibrated around the vehicle to measure cervical spine angle, angular speed and acceleration in the sagittal plane. Surface wireless EMG electrodes were used to record superior trapezius, erector spinae and rectus abdominis muscle activity. All measures were recorded during two phases: device positioning (maneuver) and vehicle exiting. Results: The lowest range of motion was observed in CC during maneuver and exit (about 17 degrees), the greatest in AE and IE (about 45 degrees); when the extrication device was utilized along with the cervical collar (CC + XT) an increase, rather than a further decrease, in the range of motion was observed (about 25 degrees during maneuver and exit). Larger values of angular speed and acceleration were observed in CC + XT when compared to CC, both during maneuver and exit (p < 0.001). The lowest EMG activity was observed during maneuver in CC and CC + XT; during exit a lower EMG activity was observed in CC + XT compared to CC (p < 0.001). Thus, when an extrication device is utilized (CC + XT), a lower active control of the cervical spine region is associated with faster and more brisk movements of the cervical spine compared to CC alone. Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that spinal motion restriction via rigid cervical collar of awake and cooperative trauma patients is effective in reducing cervical spine motion in the sagittal plane during vehicle extrication.

AB We study the problem of automatic configuration of the initial position, the so-called waypoint, from which to initiate a robust and accurate docking maneuver using nonholonomic (car-like) robotic forklifts in the context of automated manufacturing. The proper selection of these positions is of paramount importance to operate with the industrial grade of accuracy, repeatability, and reliability required by load transfer operations in industrial settings. An unconstrained optimization method coupled with probabilistic techniques is proposed to solve this problem. The proposed method permits to increase significantly the flexibility and adaptability of the autonomous robotic forklifts.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the problem of how to automatically configure the guidance system of a flexible Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) operating as part of a Flexible Material Handling System (FMHS). The automatic guide-path design consists of calculating the shortest paths to supply material to or from warehouse and production lines. These routes are configured by defining positions from which to perform navigation and docking maneuvers. This work is focused on the automatic and robust configuration of the initial position from which to perform a safe and reliable load transfer operation. Adopting the Continuous-Curvature (CC) Steer method to generate high-quality drive-paths for accurate and precise docking operations, the problem consists of the automatic selection of the initial position from which to initiate the load transfer operation given a target position (docking station) and the representation of obstacles in the workplace. The most problematic issue is that while CC Steer method generates routes particularly appropriate to be followed by car-like vehicles, such trajectories can differ significantly from the expected ones under slight modifications of the initial position. This problem makes the selection of reliable waypoints that generate collision-free trajectories a demanding task. We use an unconstrained optimization method coupled with probabilistic techniques to perform a robust and automatic configuration of waypoints for load transfer operations.

AB This paper describes the design and construction of a magnetically coupled modular bio-inspired underwater robot named the Modular Magnetic Bio-Inspired Underwater Vehicle (MMBAUV). Designed to form a traveling wave to mimic efficient Body Caudal Fin (BCF) swimming and manoeuvring, its modularity allows for flexible system setup and offers an opportunity for redundancy and cost reduction through a common design structure. The specific feature of this design presents a novel application of a permanent synchronous magnetic coupling between neighbouring modules with a rotational degree of freedom (DoF). The actuated magnetic coupling provides a reliable and low maintenance solution to the fundamental issues of water tightness of flexible underwater structures. When encountering extreme conditions, the magnetic coupling allows the safe decoupling of the modules increasing the survivability of the robotic system. Presented lab testing results demonstrate the function of the design and provide initial evidence of its thrust generation and manoeuvrability.

AB In recent decades, the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) algorithm is widely used for the AGV local path panning because of its convenient and efficiency. However, it may make a local detour when encountering a curve turn and cause excessive energy consumption. To solve this problem, this paper proposed an improved TEB algorithm to make the AGV walk along the wall when turning, which shortens the planning time and saves energy. Experiments were implemented in the Rviz visualization tool platform of the robot operating system (ROS). Simulated experiment results reflect that an amount of 5% reduction in the planning time has been achieved and the velocity curve implies that the operation was relatively smooth. Practical experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method that the robots can avoid obstacles smoothly in the unknown static and dynamic obstacle environment.

AB Robots have the potential to assist and complement humans in the study and exploration of extreme and hostile environments. For example, valuable scientific data have been collected with the aid of propeller-driven autonomous and remotely operated vehicles in underwater operations. However, because of their nature as swimmers, such robots are limited when closer interaction with the environment is required. Here, we report a bioinspired under-water legged robot, called SILVER2, that implements locomotion modalities inspired by benthic animals (organisms that harness the interaction with the seabed to move; for example, octopi and crabs). Our robot can traverse irregular terrains, interact delicately with the environment, approach targets safely and precisely, and hold position passively and silently. The capabilities of our robot were validated through a series of field missions in real sea conditions in a depth range between 0.5 and 12 meters.

AB This research investigates travelers' trust in intelligent autonomous technologies based on two studies involving self-driving transportation and robot bartenders. Targeting travelers residing in the United States, online questionnaire was distributed to test the relationships between trusting beliefs in intelligent robots, its antecedents, and its outcomes. The results demonstrate that the cognitive trust formation process holds in situations involving intelligent robots as objects of trust. Trust in intelligent machines is influenced by negative attitude toward technology and propensity to trust technology. Surprisingly, the physical form of robots does not affect trust. Finally, trust leads to adoption intention in both studies. The contribution of this research is in elucidating consumer trust in intelligent robots designed for socially-driven interactions in travel settings.

DE Object detection; remote sensing; machine learning
AB Nowadays, the object detection techniques have been developed rapidly for different applications, ranging from remote sensing to autonomous vehicles. We demonstrate identification of object open angle and direction using machine learning (ML) algorithms based on received light beam's intensity profiles. Compared with previous optical orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) spectrum system and other related works, our proposed technique only uses a single-shot image, and can efficiently reduce the complexity of hardware implementation. Specifically, we verify the reliability of the simulation results experimentally for 14 open angles and 32 directions. Experimental result shows that convolutional neural network (CNN) outperforms the other traditional ML algorithms, such as decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM). As one of the variant of CNN, MobileNet (MN) has relatively simplified iteration algorithm than VGG-like net. It reduces the computational power, while still maintaining high accuracy for identification issues.

ID PUBLIC VALUE; MANAGEMENT; PERSPECTIVE; INFORMATION
AB This paper discusses how local governments can team up for joint service provision, be more adaptive towards new technological and organisational changes and introduce novel services following main industry trends (e.g. predictive analytics, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence). The conceptual approach is to use Public Value (PV) as the framework for the organisation and management of government performance, one of the most important successor 'paradigmettes' of the New Public Management (NPM). Based on the PV concept, the 'adaptive model' for local governments is introduced according to which each procured ICT solution is preceded by agile, open, bottom-up and experimental trial. This model is corroborated via recent empirical evidence from the case of Helsinki and Tallinn which was obtained by observing how city governments collaborate on joint innovation-lab-type structures and conduct agile trials in the field of smart mobility before traditional procurement.

AB The study of a marine environment is a challenging task because of the spatio-temporal variations of ocean phenomena and the disturbances caused by ocean currents. As such, we must collect data over long time periods to better assess and understand marine environments. To achieve this, we investigate the long-term trajectories of inexpensive and underactuated drifting vehicles called drifters. These vehicles drift passively with ambient ocean currents. Vertical actuation (buoyancy) enables them to alter their depth and achieve controllability by the use of different current layers in the ocean. We aim to utilize these persistent assets to explore oceanic regions exhaustively; patrolling the surface, covering a 3-D phenomenon (e.g., algal bloom), or examining the seafloor with downward-facing cameras. In this article, we present a data-driven deployment and planning approach for the drifters. We extract the generalized flow pattern within a given region from ocean model predictions, develop a Markov chain-based motion model, and analyze the water flow behavior. Given an initial deployment location of the drifter on the water surface and the flow patterns within the region, our approach finds attractors and their transient groups at different depths as the persistent behavior of the environment. We then determine a minimum number of deployment locations for the drifters using these attractors and their transient groups. All possible reachable locations from the initial deployment location of the drifter are determined as its planned, long-term drifter trajectory based on the computed attractors and transient groups. An optimal navigation policy is developed to demonstrate the best possible action from any location to a goal location in the environment. Our simulation results based on data from ocean model predictions validate the variability in the persistent behavior of the environment and the long-term trajectory of the drifter over space and time. Preliminary results from field trials also validate the practical application of our approach for persistent, large-scale ocean monitoring.

ID PATH TRACKING; VEHICLES; SYSTEMS
AB As world population growth requires an increasing level of farm production at the same time that environmental preservation is a priority, the development of new agricultural tools and methods is required. In this framework, the development of robotic devices can provide an attractive solution, particularly in the field of autonomous vehicles. Accurate automatic guidance of mobile robots in farming constitutes a challenging problem for researchers, mainly due to the low grip conditions usually found in such a context. From assisted-steering systems to agricultural robotics, numerous control algorithms have been studied to achieve high-precision path tracking and have reached an accuracy within 10 cm, whatever the ground configuration and the path to be followed. However, most existing approaches consider classical two-wheel-steering vehicles. Unfortunately, by using such a steering system, only the lateral deviation with respect to the path to be followed can be satisfactorily controlled. Indeed, the heading of the vehicle remains dependent on the grip conditions, and crabwise motions, for example, are systematically observed on a slippery slope, leading to inaccurate field operations. To tackle this drawback, a four-wheel-steering (4WS) mobile robot is considered, enabling servo of both lateral and angular deviations with respect to a desired trajectory. The path tracking control is designed using an extended kinematic representation, allowing account to be taken online of wheel skidding, while a backstepping approach permits management of the 4WS structure. The result is an approach taking advantage of both rear and front steering actuations to fully compensate for sliding effects during path tracking. Moreover, a predictive algorithm is developed in order to address delays induced by steering actuators, compensating for transient overshoots in curves. Experimental results demonstrate that despite sliding phenomena, the mobile robot is able to automatically and accurately achieve a desired path, with lateral and angular errors, respectively, within +/- 10 cm and +/- 2 deg, whatever its shape and whatever the terrain conditions. This constitutes a promising result in efforts to define efficient tools with which to tackle tomorrow's agriculture challenge. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   Disassemble-reassemble-merge Algorithm for Autonomous Driving

AB To ensure the safe operation of self-driving cars, it is necessary to identify the location and layout of the road around the vehicle. Moreover, because road accidents pose a considerable risk to human life, accurate environmental awareness is paramount in autonomous driving, especially under unfavorable ambient conditions. Various sensors have been employed to realize road area recognition under such conditions. Among these sensors, multi-channel LiDAR has recently attracted attention as it is robust against illumination changes and can obtain accurate distance information. However, this system requires a large amount of data, rendering real-time processing difficult. To overcome this limitation, feature extraction methods have been used that can extract meaningful implicit information from a large amount of data. However, the application of feature extraction to small areas of the road for real-time processing can result in reduced accuracy. To enhance the level of accuracy, an algorithm was adopted in this study that can apply feature extraction to large areas of the road. This algorithm disassembles the LiDAR data for prompt processing at a low level and then reassembles the data to manage the exceptional parts in each scan line. Subsequently, the algorithm merges the road area parts in each scan line and distinguishes the road areas, sidewalks, and obstacles in real-time. To realize these three computational processes, the algorithm is termed a disassemble-reassemble-merge (DRM) algorithm. The DRM algorithm is unique as it only uses the LiDAR sensor, which differs from existing algorithms that employ LiDAR sensors for road boundary detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted an experiment using the KITTI Road Benchmark authorized dataset. Using the proposed method, accuracy was 10% higher compared to other algorithms. To validate the developed algorithm and its utility, we applied it to the Complex Yolo and obstacle-dependent Gaussian (ODG) algorithm. The ODG risk maps, which can eventually be extended to the control part of subsequent studies, were derived by applying the ODG algorithm to the outcomes and could be applied as a guideline map for actual vehicle driving.

AB Underwater acoustic target detection with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has the advantage of scalable aperture, however, it depends on the accurate estimation of the shape and structure of the swarm. In this study, a method based on an active sound source is proposed for geometry estimation of distributed nodes. Pulses or chirp signals, transmitted by the source, arrive AUV nodes with different time delays and are collected by the hydrophones, from which the formation geometry could be estimated. Firstly, the frequency-sliding generalised cross-correlation (FS-GCC) feature matrix between the signals received by each node and the reference node is extracted. Secondly, an autoencoder network is employed to enhance the time delay line implied in the FS-GCC matrix, from which a time delay between two nodes is obtained. A time delay vector could be constructed by concatenating the delays between the reference node and all other nodes when the source lies at different orientations. Lastly, the time delay matrix, which is composed of time delay vectors in a time window when AUV circularly moves around the detection nodes, is further decomposed by singular value decomposition to obtain the formation geometry. The feasibility and effectiveness are verified by the simulation dataset, anechoic pool experiment, and lake trial. The root mean square error of the proposed geometry estimation method drops by 9% and 54% for two typical geometries when compared with ref. [1] for the simulation dataset, which becomes 45% and 37% for the anechoic pool experiment. Though the estimation error increases in lake trials, the proposed method achieved a relatively better precision. It is found that the proposed method has better performance when the formation geometry of AUVs approaches a regular polygon and when the source works in a stop-and-go mode. Furthermore, when the source distance meets the far-field assumption, the azimuthal span of source movement relative to AUVs should be larger than 30 degrees.

AB Measuring ocean physics and atmospheric conditions at the sea-surface has been taking place for decades in our world's oceans. Enhancing R&D technologies developed in Federal and academic institutions and laboratories such as WHOI's Vector Averaging Current Meter (VACM, 1970s) and NOAA - PMEL's: Autonomous Temperature Line Acquisition System (ATLAS, 1980s) as example, in situ ocean measurements and real-time telemetry for data processing and dissemination from remote areas of oceans and seas are now common place. A transition of this "ocean monitoring" technology has occurred with additional support from individual and group innovative efforts in the field of ocean instrumentation. As a result, long-term monitoring of ocean processes and changes has become more accessible to the research community at large. Here; we discuss a "Hybrid" air-sea interaction deep-sea monitoring system that has been developed in the private sector to mirror ocean-climate community data streams and has been successfully deployed on three basin-scaled programs in the Indian Ocean (RAMA, First Institute of Oceanography, FIO, China), the Andaman Sea (MOMSEI, Monsoon Onset Monitoring, FIO) and the Pacific Ocean (China's Institute of Oceanology, Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) research in the western tropical Pacific). This application is a base to build upon as new sensors are developed and increased sampling at higher resolutions is required. Surface vehicles measure the surface, with some profiling available. Water column density sampling is still a much-needed measurement within the Ocean Climate Monitoring community. The "Hybrid" is a multidisciplinary tool to integrate new biological and biogeochemical sensors for continued interaction studies of the physical processes of our oceans. This application can also be used at FLUX sites to enhance the Argo Program, telemetry applications and docking stations for autonomous vehicles such as sail-drones, gliders and wave riders for enhancement and contribution to the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array (GTMBA), Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOS).

AB Fast and efficient global localization is a critical problem for autonomous systems. Existing sequence based visual place recognition requires a storage-intensive image database for robust localization, while more storage-efficient odometry-based place recognition approaches can require a long travel distance to obtain an accurate localization. In this paper, we present a novel particle filter-based localization system that adapts to varying degrees of map image densities, road layout ambiguity and visual appearance change. The base system combines a geometric place recognition capability utilizing odometry and roadmaps with a visual place recognition system. When using a sparse image database, particles could exist at visually unknown places, which introduces difficulties in performing sequential visual place recognition. To address this challenge, we propose to make use of effective visual observations to enable the system to accumulate visual belief sequentially, even when reference images are very sparse. Furthermore, we develop a vision reliability estimation method, which analyses the relationship between the visual component and the particle filter convergence, to calibrate the optimal contribution of vision to particle weighting in different visual environments and conditions. To evaluate our approach, we perform extensive experiments using four benchmark localization datasets, and control the reference image density by subsampling these datasets. Results show that the proposed technique is able to consistently and correctly localize the vehicle over a range of reference image densities, and to consistently outperform a particle filter-enhanced version of an existing state-of-the-art SeqSLAM system, which fails when image spacing exceeds 30 m. In particular, for a 600% increase in database image sparsity (from 10 m to 70 m), we show that the proposed method is able to maintain localization performance with only a 40% increase in localization latency (from 250 m to 350 m). We also provide an analysis of the results and a characterization of the system's computational requirements. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Poleward range shifts of species as a result of global climate change are being increasingly documented. As species extend into new ranges their ecological impacts and the niches that they occupy may be unpredictable. We use benthic imagery obtained from the broad-scale deployment of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to quantify the depth distribution of barrens habitat formed by a recent range extension of the sea urchin species, Centrostephanus rodgersii, a known ecosystem engineer. AUV transects covering similar depths from both the historical range of New South Wales, Australia, and from the range extension area of the east coast of Tasmania were examined for the presence of barrens. We find that C. rodgersii occupies a different realised niche in its extended range, with barrens habitat occurring significantly deeper in Tasmanian waters (16-58 m) compared to NSW waters (7-27 m). The expansion of barrens habitat has devastating impacts on biodiversity, with flow-on effects to ecosystem services and local fisheries, and in Tasmania this threat extends to deeper, invertebrate-dominated habitats. This finding has important management implications, in particular the need to incorporate deeper reef systems into planning, with increased barrens expected under future climate change predictions. One conservation management approach is the use of no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to prevent barren establishment in representative habitats by rebuilding viable populations of urchin predators. We also examine the correlation between MPA status and the occurrence of barrens within a small, no-take Tasmanian reserve and adjacent control sites. We find that there is suggestive, but inconclusive, evidence for fewer barrens in the MPA (p = 0.07). Our study highlights the utility of a novel technology for conducting large-scale benthic surveys and monitoring the impacts of range extending species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research proposes an integrated behavioral and motion planner with proactive right-of-way acquisition capability. The proposed planner overcomes the shortcomings of conventional planner and is able to: (i) integrate both behavioral and motion planning for enhanced optimal maneuver; (ii) support real-time implementation; (iii) proactively acquire right-of-way for improved travel efficiency; (iv) take a person-by-person driving countermeasure for strengthened safety. In order to realize the proactive right-of-way acquisition, the game-based interaction-aware decision-making is designed, and Stackelberg competition is adopted as the game rule. The problem is formulated as a differential-game-based Receding Horizon Control (RHC) to integrate both behavioral and motion planning. An online Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) is leveraged to identify the individual driving behavior of the competing vehicle in order for the enabling of person-by-person countermeasures. The problem is solved by a highly-efficient quadratic programming algorithm. A simulation evaluation is conducted on the proposed planner. The results demonstrate that the proposed planner is with millisecond-level computational efficiency. It improves travel efficiency by 4.78-25.77% with the proactive right-of-way acquisition, and enhances driving safety by 5.22-36.08% via taking person-by-person countermeasures. The range is caused by different congestion levels.

AB The sixth-generation (6G) wireless network is conceptualized to provide ubiquitous and reliable network access through effective inter-networking among space, air, and terrestrial networks, while posing considerable pressure on dynamic network orchestration. Digital twin (DT) provides an alternative approach to proactively make real-time resource allocation by mapping and learning the complex network topology. However, the dual challenges of limited energy capacity and insufficient computing power of unmanned aerial vehicles make it difficult to establish digital twin on aerial networks. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a lightweight DT empowered air-ground network architecture, where the DT modelling task is distributed to diverse ground devices based on federated learning. To improve the efficiency of DT modelling, we design a distributed incentive mechanism that incentivizes high-performance ground devices to take part in federated learning. Considering the computing burden and possible private disclosure caused by the incentive, we further solve the incentive scheme with a new distributed algorithm. The optimal solution, such as the local training rounds and required accuracy of terminal devices, could be calculated in parallel on ground devices. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight DT scheme in terms of energy consumption and model accuracy.

AB Recent advances in learning for control allow to synthesize vehicle controllers from learned system dynamics and maintain robust stability guarantees. However, no approach is well-suited for training robustly-stabilizing linear time-invariant (LTI) controllers using arbitrary learned models of the dynamics. This article introduces a method to do so. It uses a robust control framework to derive robust stability criteria. It also uses simulated policy rollouts to obtain gradients on the controller parameters, which serve to improve the closed-loop performance. By formulating the stability criteria as penalties with computable gradients, they can be used to guide the controller parameters toward robust stability during gradient descent. The approach is flexible as it does not restrict the type of learned model for the simulated rollouts. The robust control framework ensures that the controller is already robustly stabilizing when first implemented on the actual system and no data is yet collected. It also ensures that the system stays stable in the event of a shift in dynamics, given the system behavior remains within assumed uncertainty bounds. We demonstrate the approach by synthesizing a controller for simulated autonomous lane-change maneuvers. This work thus presents a flexible approach to learning robustly stabilizing LTI controllers that takes advantage of modern machine learning techniques.

AB Digital terrain models based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) are widely used in ground robots to achieve autonomous navigation. Very few studies have been conducted on terrain modelling for preview information, which acts as an input for a vehicle's active suspension system. In this study, we proposed an algorithm to construct a real-time terrain model from multi-frame LiDAR points according to the applications for preview control. The terrain model consisted of an elevation map with confidence intervals and feature detection. First, the statistical confidence interval of the elevation map represented the reliability of the mean height. Further, we used spatial signal processing techniques to detect the uneven geometric features of the terrain. The key point feature on the trajectory was detected by the Laplacian of Gaussian method. Finally, the raw point cloud data processing procedure was based on parallel multi-thread techniques combined with GPU programming, which significantly promotes computation efficiency to enable real-time implementation. Thus, the proposed terrain model integrates reliability issues and geometric features, which act as inputs for preview controllers or motion planning. Experimental results proved that our method has a competitive performance (in terms of precision and efficiency) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and runs in real-time at 50 Hz.

AB Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) allows multiple users to share link resource for higher spectrum efficiency. It can be applied to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) networks to provide convenient offloading computing service for ground users (GUs) with large-scale access. However, due to the line-of-sight (LoS) of UAV transmission, the information can be easily eavesdropped in NOMA-based UAV-MEC networks. In this paper, we propose a secure communication scheme for the NOMA-based UAV-MEC system towards a flying eavesdropper. In the proposed scheme, the average security computation capacity of the system is maximized while guaranteeing a minimum security computation requirement for each GU. Due to the uncertainty of the eavesdropper's position, the coupling of multi-variables and the non-convexity of the problem, we first study the worst security situation through mathematical derivation. Then, the problem is solved by utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods with respect to channel coefficient, transmit power, central processing unit (CPU) computation frequency, local computation and UAV trajectory. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to the benchmarks in terms of the system security computation performance.

AB As a key environment perception technology of autonomous driving or driver assistance systems, lane detection is to ensure vehicles to drive safely in corresponding lane. However, existing lane detection algorithms for two-lane detection focus on using various filtering methods to reduce the impact of useless information, resulting in low accuracy and low efficiency. In this paper, a novel Adaptive Region of Interest (A-ROI) extraction method is proposed to improve the accuracy and real-time performance of the two-lane detection algorithm. Three key technologies are introduced to solve the problems. First, A-ROI, which only focuses on the lane where the vehicle is located, is applied to the Bird's-Eye-View image obtained by using Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM). Next, based on Bayesian framework and Likelihood models, a lane feature extraction method with a lane-like feature filter is used for edge detection. Finally, an improved Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is introduced by using a filter that can remove noisy lane data. The performance of the proposed A-ROI method together with the improved lane detection method is evaluated via simulation of various scenarios. Experimental results show the proposed method has better accuracy and real-time performance than the traditional lane detection methods.

ID HYDRODYNAMIC INTERACTION; DESIGN
AB Due to increase in demand of autonomous vehicles in underwater applications, the modelling and control of underwater robots became primary importance in the design and development to improve their efficiency. In this article, a robotic underwater vehicle (RUV) is proposed for oceanographic purpose. First, the RUV model is developed using the Myring profile to produce the least drag force which supports the RUV to operate for a longer time with minimum force on the thruster. Second, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is carried out to calculate the hydrodynamic effects of the proposed RUV. The k-epsilon standard turbulence model is chosen for CFD analysis due to its good prediction capabilities. The ITTC 1957 correlation line equation is used to validate the CFD-simulated drag values of the RUV. Similarly, the lift and drag of the NACA0015 profile fin is calculated and validated. Third, a scaled-down model of the RUV is fabricated by considering the buoyancy, stability, pressure, propulsion, submerging and fineness ratio (L/D). The developed RUV is tested in a linear motion profile at velocities ranging from 0 to 1.25 m/s. The experimental results are compared with CFD and ITTC correlations, and it is found to be a minimum error band of 10%. Further, balancing and leakage test are conducted and the developed RUV displayed neutrally buoyant characteristics with good stability.

TI Assessing the Impact of App-Based Ride Share Systems in an Urban
   Context: Findings from Austin
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB App-driven ridesharing platforms are gaining popularity and are transforming urban movement patterns in cities throughout the world. Because of privacy and business considerations, their owners have released little information about riders' trip-making characteristics. This lack of data prevents planners and modelers from understanding and quantifying the impact of these new modes on regional travel patterns. In 2016, RideAustin, a not-for-profit company, was established to provide mobility-on-demand services in the Austin region. RideAustin released its dataset of over one million trips to researchers to support transportation planning through a better understanding of urban travel flows. This paper presents findings from an in-depth analysis of this dataset and summarizes key aspects of interest to the transportation research community such as the number of riders, drivers, and trips; total vehicle miles including deadhead miles; and terminal times. The paper also presents findings from two case studies that show the competitiveness of RideAustin versus transit and the utilization of the RideAustin system during the South by Southwest festival. While some of the metrics cannot be readily transferred to other regions, several findings can be used by planners and modelers as they integrate rideshare systems within their planning and modeling frameworks. We also believe that some of the research findings may provide insights into a future system of autonomous and shared vehicles.

AB Marine archaeological surveying in deep waters has so far been challenging, mainly due to operational and technological constraints. The standard tool has been Side Scan Sonar (SSS) towed behind a surface vessel. Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) technology is not subject to the traditional range/resolution tradeoff, and produces results of considerably higher quality than traditional SSS. In 2015 and 2016 a comprehensive mapping of wrecks in Skagerrak, a large deepwater area off the south coast of Norway was undertaken, using an interferometric SAS system deployed on an autonomous underwater vehicle. By examining data from two passes of one of the many historical wrecks that were detected in the survey area, we demonstrate how SAS can be used to produce very high resolution imagery and bathymetry of wreck sites. Furthermore, post processing techniques are applied to exploit the high information content inherent in SAS data, enhancing aspects of the data for relevant archaeological analysis and interpretation. We show in this paper how SAS technology represents significant improvements in our abilities to conduct high quality and high resolution seabed mapping. The adoption of this technology will both benefit archaeological research and provide knowledge for better decision making in underwater cultural heritage management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Determination of failure causes of the control systems and navigation electronic elements of space flying vehicles (SFV), observed in the process of long-time flights, is of current importance. Failures of the control systems in the process of long-time flights considerably reduce their reliability and, consequently, raise expenses in this field. In particular, this requires an additional backup of satellites-retransmitters, which results in an increase of the number of SFV launches. At present, experts are actively elaborating the hypothesis that one of the most probable causes of the SFV electronic system failures are the flows of the space dust particles, moving in the near-Earth and interplanetary space, and possessing velocities from 7.8 km/sec to 16 km/sec. The flows of the high energy (Galactic) ions, for a number of cases, are considered to be the basic cause of the destruction of electronic control systems. This, in particular, makes it possible to explain the failures in flights to Mars of the autonomous space modules performed by the European and American space agencies. The optimum flight route to Mars passes through agglomerations of dust clouds, which necessitates a high probability of collision for the flying vehicles with dust clots. Therefore, the success of the American research module is quite logical, which was done with the highest deviation from the optimum route.

DT Article
DE autonomous road vehicle; intersection models; image sequence analysis;
   Kalman filtering
AB Vision-based automatic driving along innercity roads and across complex innercity intersections requires to detect and track road markings and lane boundaries in order to determine the position and orientation of the vehicle relative to the ground. The complexity of intersection scenes and the disturbances in the detected contours enforce the use of model-based state estimation techniques. We recorded monocular image sequences of complex innercity road intersections from a moving small experimental truck in order to track intersection models using a Kalman filter. A scalar distance measure for the distance between image contour points and model edge segments turned out to be advantageous for the estimation process. This scalar measure is based on the simultaneous exploitation of edge element location and direction,;thus using more information about the image gray value variation than previously when only the perpendicular distance between the edge element and the model segment was taken into account.
   We report about the theoretical foundation of this approach, its implementation and experimental results from several intersection sequences,;as well as detailed comparisons with a previous, less sophisticated approach. These examples demonstrate the kind of problems which are likely to occur more frequently at intersection scenes than at those road scenes encountered while following a, more or less straight, uninterrupted highway lane with clearly marked boundaries.

AB Nowadays, advanced communication technologies are being utilized to develop intelligent transportation management and driving assistance. Through the ability to exchange traffic and infotainment information between road infrastructure and vehicles, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) promise to improve transport efficiency, accident prevention, and pedestrians comfort. The deployment of VANETs in the real world is based on the message's correctness and timely delivery and assuredness of privacy protection and data security. In this regard, many researchers have conducted surveys and studies that present models and solutions related to the improvement of VANET from different aspects such as architectural design, networking, and data security. Motivated by these influences, this study presents a detailed survey of VANETs to provide a complete picture of particular VANET applications, networking, and challenges. None of them collected all data in one survey. VANET communication techniques and their improvements are the focus of this study. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, a complete taxonomy of VANET wireless access techniques has been provided based on various parameters. Second, a detailed discussion and classification VANET services and applications are provided. Third, the challenges related to VANET according to the applicability area, data networking, and resource management are explored in detail. Based on this classification, a complete description of the challenges for each category, including the proposed solutions and development models, is provided to overcome such challenges. Finally, the integration of evolutionary technologies with VANET is comprehensively presented. In this regard, a thorough explanation is provided for each technology, including the challenges, solutions, and suggestions for further improvements. This study enables various users working in the vehicular networking domain to select one of the proposals based on its relative advantages.

AB Decision-making on numerous aspects of our daily lives is being outsourced to machine-learning (ML) algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI), motivated by speed and efficiency in the decision process. ML approaches-one of the typologies of algorithms underpinning artificial intelligence-are typically developed as black boxes. The implication is that ML code scripts are rarely scrutinised; interpretability is usually sacrificed in favour of usability and effectiveness. Room for improvement in practices associated with programme development have also been flagged along other dimensions, including inter alia fairness, accuracy, accountability, and transparency. In this contribution, the production of guidelines and dedicated documents around these themes is discussed. The following applications of AI-driven decision-making are outlined: (a) risk assessment in the criminal justice system, and (b) autonomous vehicles, highlighting points of friction across ethical principles. Possible ways forward towards the implementation of governance on AI are finally examined.

AB The development and testing of automotive (sub) systems, particularly for Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC), usually requires expensive test facilities. This paper describes the use of electromagnetic simulation to demonstrate the level of confidence that can be placed in measurements taken in more general laboratories, thus giving an estimate of the accuracy these facilities can provide. This is important in order to enable/allow more developments in automotive systems from research and development teams without standards compliant test facilities. This is, itself, important because of current developments in all-electric and autonomous vehicles. This paper demonstrates, through the use of full wave simulation representing a theoretically ideal environment compared with two different practical approaches, that EMC analysis can be undertaken with a reasonable estimation of accuracy and provides a framework for pre-compliance or developmental testing.

ID SIMULATION
AB A formation flight control system that addresses the unique environment encountered by aircraft flying in formation and in the upwash of the leading aircraft that leads to a scenario with minimum induced drag at the trailing aircraft (sweet spot) has been designed. To test the control system, a simulation environment that adequately represents the aerodynamic coupling effects between aircraft flying in formation and implements an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion-based formation flight control system has been created. Since the exact position of the sweet spot is not known or measured, the research presented in this paper uses an advanced extremum-seeking algorithm that uses an extended Kalman filter to estimate the wind gradients to automatically steer the trailing vehicle toward the sweet spot. Monte Carlo simulations for two and three aircraft formations have shown that the algorithm has the ability to consistently find the sweet spot and is robust to errors due to turbulence.

ID ATTITUDE; ALGORITHM
AB In this work a new algorithm is derived for the onboard calibration of three-axis strapdown magnetometers. The proposed calibration method is written in the sensor frame, and compensates for the combined effect of all linear time-invariant distortions, namely soft iron, hard iron, sensor nonorthogonality, and bias, among others. A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is formulated to iteratively find the optimal calibration parameters that best fit to the onboard sensor readings, without requiring external attitude references. It is shown that the proposed calibration technique is equivalent to the estimation of a rotation, scaling and translation transformation, and that the sensor alignment matrix is given by the solution of the orthogonal Procrustes problem. Good initial conditions for the iterative algorithm are obtained by a suboptimal batch least squares computation. Simulation and experimental results with low-cost sensors data are presented and discussed, supporting the application of the algorithm to autonomous vehicles and other robotic platforms.

AB This paper describes new results with a Reactive Shared-Control system that enables a semi-autonomous navigation of a wheelchair in unknown and dynamic environments. The purpose of the reactive shared controller is to assist wheelchair users providing an easier and safer navigation. It is designed as a fuzzy-logic controller and follows a behaviour-based architecture. The implemented behaviours are three: intelligent obstacle avoidance, collision detection and contour following. Intelligent obstacle avoidance blends user commands, from voice or joystick, with an obstacle avoidance behaviour. Therefore, the user and the vehicle share the control of the wheelchair. The reactive shared control was tested on the RobChair powered wheelchair prototype [6] equipped with a set of ranging sensors. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the controller.

AB Undulating fins are an excellent propulsion model for highly maneuverable underwater vehicles, due to their rich locomotor capabilities and high efficiency at moderate speed. In this study, we designed, developed, and tested a self-contained, free-swimming robotic device, the KnifeBot, to emulate the locomotor behaviors of knifefish, a typical fish that excels in using this type of propulsion. This novel biomimetic underwater vehicle uses an elongated ribbon-like fin composed of 16 fin rays interconnected by a compliant membrane as the propulsor. It features a slender 3D printed hull, 16 DC motors for actuating the fin rays, 2 Li-Ion batteries for providing power, wireless radio communication, and various sensors to measure acceleration, orientation, inside temperature, pressure and to detect leakage. We used this robotic device in two experimental sets: (1) the robot without pectoral fins to perform forward swimming, reversed swimming, and hovering maneuvers and (2) the robot with a pair of pectoral fins with fixed angle of attack (-5 degrees) to perform forward swimming. In this paper, we focus on the design, implementation, and control of the robot. We also present the results of forward swimming velocity, power consumption, and Euler orientation angles of the robot with and without pectoral fins. Our results show that the cost of transport follows a V-shape trend with the lowest point at low swimming speed, indicating the undulating fin propulsion is more efficient at low speeds. For the cases studied, the Strouhal number, St, ranges from 0.5 to 0.2 with the best cost-of-transport corresponding to St = 0.2. We found that the airfoil-like pectoral fins at small negative angles of attack slightly slow down the speed of the robotic vessel and reduce its pitch angle. The robot can take advantage of the pectoral fins to control its maneuver from swimming at the water surface to rapid diving. Our findings demonstrate that undulating fin-based propulsion has the potential to enhance the mobility and performance of underwater vehicles navigating in complex environments.

AB Purpose - With various challenges in the digital era, stakeholders are expressing growing interests in understanding the impact of emerging and disruptive technologies on freight transportation. This paper provides a systematic literature review of the current state of affairs as well as future trends and aims to support stakeholders' decision-making in logistics management in the era of disruptive technologies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Several recent and representative articles from academic, industrial and governmental perspectives were investigated to set the scene for this research and to serve as a baseline for electing nine emerging technologies, which were then used to conduct a systematic literature review covering the literature within the area during the past twelve years.
   Findings - 3D printing, artificial intelligence, automated robots, autonomous vehicles, big data analytics, blockchain, drones, electric vehicles and the Internet of Things were identified as the emerging technologies. The current state of existing research and potential future opportunities were analyzed.
   Research limitations/implications - Since the potential literature body is almost impossible to fully cover, a tradeoff between the number of emerging technologies and the related literature reviewed has been performed. However, the paper provides a novel approach to select the emerging and disruptive technologies and a systematic literature review to fill the identified research gap in the related literature.
   Practical implications -The research support various stakeholders to better capture the current status of and the future opportunities in freight transportation and gain a clearer understanding of the disruptive technologies as well as to guide them in how to deploy these initiatives in future decision-making.
   Originality/value - By providing a systematic literature review on the trends, themes and research opportunities in the era of disruptive technologies, the papers bring about broad and comprehensive review on the impact of disruptive technologies on logistics and transportation as well as opportunities to support management decision support in the logistics industry.

ID EXPLORATION
AB The estimation of the geometric structure of objects located underwater underpins a plethora of applications such as mapping shipwrecks for archaeology, monitoring the health of coral reefs, detecting faults in offshore oil rigs and pipelines, detection and identification of potential threats on the seabed, etc. Acoustic imaging is the most popular choice for underwater sensing. Underwater exploratory vehicles typically employ wide-aperture Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) imaging sensors. Although their wide aperture enables scouring large volumes of water ahead of them for obstacles, the resulting images produced are blurry due to integration over the aperture. Performing three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from this blurry data is notoriously difficult. This challenging inverse problem is further exacerbated by the presence of speckle noise and reverberations. The state-of-the-art methods in 3D reconstruction from sonar either require bulky and expensive matrix-arrays of sonar sensors or additional narrow-aperture sensors. Due to its low footprint, the latter induces gaps between reconstructed scans. Avoiding such gaps requires slow and cumbersome scanning by the vehicles that carry the scanners. In this paper, we present two reconstruction methods enabling on-site 3D reconstruction from imaging sonars of any aperture. The first of these presents an elegant linear formulation of the problem, as a blind deconvolution with a spatially varying kernel. The second method is a simple algorithmic approach for approximate reconstruction, using a nonlinear formulation. We demonstrate that our simple approximation algorithms perform 3D reconstruction directly from the data recorded by wide-aperture systems, thus eliminating the need for multiple sensors to be mounted on underwater vehicles for this purpose. Additionally, we observe that the wide aperture may be exploited to improve the coverage of the reconstructed samples (on the scanned object's surface). We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on simulated as well as real data acquired using two sensors, and we compare our work to the state of the art in sonar reconstruction. Finally, we show the employability of our reconstruction methods on field data gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB Micro-Doppler signals refer to Doppler scattering returns produced by the motions of the target other than gross translation. The small micro-motions of a subject, and even just parts of a subject, can be observed through the micro-Doppler signature it creates in response to an active emitter such as a radar, laser, and even acoustic emitters. These micro-Doppler signatures are produced by the kinematic properties of the subject's motion and can be used to extract the salient features of the subject's motion, and often, identify the subject. The rapidly declining cost of micro-Doppler-capable active sensors like radar with their dramatically improving capabilities, provide significant motivation in developing micro-Doppler techniques that can improve the exploitation of these sensors. Micro-Doppler techniques aim at extracting the micro-motion of the subject that may be unique to a particular subject class or activity in order to distinguish probable false alarms from real detections, as well as to increase the value of the information extracted from the sensor. The source of micro-motion depends on the subject and can be a rotating propeller on a fixed-wing aircraft, the multiple spinning rotor blades of a helicopter, or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); the vibrations of an engine shaking a vehicle; an antenna rotating on a ship; the flapping wings of birds; the swinging arms and legs of a walking person; and many other sources. Confuser detections, such as birds for UAVs or animals for humans, can be interpreted as false alarms for a sensor system, so using the available micro-Doppler returns for classification can significantly reduce the sensor false alarm rate, thereby improving the utility of the sensor system. This study reviews the current research in micro-Doppler based on subject type, sensor capabilities, as well as environmental effects, and then proposes future research areas for micro-Doppler.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be a vital part of the massive Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in the 5G and 6G paradigms. The UAVs are required to collaborate with each other to deal with some computation-intensive IIoT applications in an autonomous UAV system. However, due to the limited processing capacity of UAVs, they are occasionally unable to handle certain tasks adequately (e.g., crowdsensing). Therefore, it is an important issue to realize efficient offloading of these computation-intensive IIoT applications. In this article, we first partition the computation-intensive IIoT application into a directed acyclic graph with multiple collaborative tasks. Then, we establish a joint optimization problem based on the models of the processor resources and energy consumption for the task offloading scheme. Third, we propose a cooperative resource allocation approach to optimize the joint optimization problem under the constraints of resource and communication latency, and then can migrate more computation-intensive tasks to the edge clouds. Finally, we build an aerial computing simulation system and make a comparative evaluation and analysis of our proposed cooperative resource allocation approach in terms of effectiveness and performance. The experimental results show that our proposed approach performs better than other related approaches.

AB As a novel technology, simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) provides users with full spatial coverage communication by modulating reflected and refracted signals. This study proposes a novel UAV equipped with STAR-RIS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access system that jointly optimized the cluster correlations with the power allocation coefficients and positions of STAR-RIS to maximize the user system sum rate. However, the application of this technique is limited by the complex nonconvex optimization problem, which was addressed by developing an alternating optimization iteration algorithm. The joint optimization problem related to cluster association and the power allocation coefficients and positions of STAR-RIS was solved by alternating iterations. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm delivered a superior user system sum rate compared to single-power optimization, ultimately achieving near-optimal system performance. At the same time, we verified that the NOMA system equipped with STAR-RIS on UAV can achieve the best performance than the OMA system. Therefore, the proposed algorithm contributes to the optimization of STAR-RIS-assisted systems, which will benefit applications in wireless communications, IoT, and smart city infrastructure.

AB The phase calibration of distributed multi-node receiving system is required considering the phase synthesis working mode of distributed radar system for echo signals. Whereas, in respect to the traditional calibration tower and unmanned aerial vehicle scheme, there are many disadvantages. The wide range distributed multi-node receive chain calibration method based on GNSS software receiver was proposed in this paper, taking advantage of the software receiver to calculate and obtain the actual phase difference among the receiving nodes as well as the coordinate information of satellites in transmitting signal. Therefore, the phase difference resulted from different transmit path can be deleted, and the phase inconsistencies among the receiving nodes can be obtained. Besides, the fingerprint maps database regarding inconsistencies among nodes and two-dimensional angle of relative receiving node for satellites was constructed in this paper, the correspondence between the omnidirectional two-dimensional angle and the inconsistencies among different nodes was established by the actual results and two-dimensional fitting, and the phase inconsistency results among nodes can be obtained only by solving the satellite coordinate information. There are many advantages for the method proposed in this paper, such as slight influence of multipath effect, capability of all-weather all-day calibration, low costs.

AB Pesticides are essential for removing plant pests and sustaining good yields on agricultural land. Excessive use has detrimental repercussions, such as the depletion of soil fertility and the proliferation of immune insect species, such as Nilaparvata lunges and Nezara viridula. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) variable-rate spraying offers a precise and adaptable alternative strategy for overcoming these challenges. This study explores research trends in the application of semi-automatic approaches and land-specific platforms for precision spraying. The employment of an autonomous control system, together with a selection of hardware such as microcontrollers, sensors, pumps, and nozzles, yields the performance necessary to accomplish spraying precision, UAV performance efficacy, and flexibility in meeting plant pesticide requirements. This paper discusses the implications of ongoing and developing research. The comparison of hardware, control system approaches, and data acquisition from the parameters of each study is presented to facilitate future research. Future research is incentivized to continue the precision performance of the variable rate development by combining it with cropland mapping to determine the need for pesticides, although strict limits on the amount of spraying make it difficult to achieve the same, even though the quality is very beneficial.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables users to offload their computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks to edge servers. Based on MEC, users can reduce their energy consumption and guarantee latency in executing computational tasks. However, current terrestrial MEC networks have some disadvantages, such as fixed deployed infrastructure and severe signal attenuation. Recently, a new paradigm of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless networks has drawn extensive attention due to its low cost but high spectral and energy efficiencies. This article introduces the use of aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) into MEC, which achieves three-dimensional signal reflections in the uplink computation offloading. The network performance can be improved by designing the communication and computation resource allocation, the ARIS's trajectory, and the amplitudes and phase shifts of passive reflecting elements. However, there are some issues that must be addressed for the ARIS-assisted MEC, including resource allocation and trajectory design, ARIS beamforming design with imperfect channel state information, and the trade-off between the non-line-of-sight excessive path loss and the doubled path loss. This article presents the motivation, applications, challenges, and opportunities of introducing ARISs into MEC. Moreover, numerical results are provided to showcase potential performance enhancement using ARISs in MEC networks.

AB We present a sustainable multimodal transit system that integrates taxi-sharing with subways to alleviate traffic congestion and restore the cooperative relationship between taxis and subways. This study proposes a two-phase matching model based on optimization theory, in which pick-up/drop-off sequences for participants, as well as their motivation to shift to a TSS service, were considered. For the transportation system, achieving a reduction in vehicle miles is considered to be the matching objective. We tested the matching model using empirical taxi global positioning system (GPS) data for a typical morning rush hour in Beijing. The optimization model performs well for large-scale data and the optimal solution can be calculated quickly, which is ideal in a dynamic system. Furthermore, several sensitive analysis experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the TSS system. We found that approximately 23.13% of taxi users can be served by TSS transit, total taxi mileage can be reduced by 20.17%, and carbon dioxide emissions may be reduced by 15.16%. The proposed model and findings demonstrate that the TSS service considered here is a feasible multimodal transit mode, with the advantages of flexibility and sustainability, and has great potential for improving social benefits.

AB This letter presents an approach for accurately dropping a relatively large amount of fire retardant, water or some other extinguishing agent onto a wildfire from an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in close proximity to the epicenter of the fire. The proposed approach involves a risky maneuver outside of the safe flight envelope of the UAV. This maneuver exploits the expected weight reduction resulting from the release of the payload, enabling the UAV to recover without impacting the terrain. The UAV is tilted to high pitch angles, at which the thrust may be pointed almost horizontally. The vehicle can therefore achieve higher horizontal speeds than would be allowed by conventional motion planners. This high speed allows the UAV to significantly reduce the time spent close to the fire. As a result, the overall high heat exposure is reduced, and the payload can be dropped closer to the target, minimizing its dispersion. A constrained optimal control problem (OCP) is solved taking into account environmental parameters such as wind and terrain gradients, as well as various payload releasing mechanisms. The proposed approach was verified in simulations and in real experiments. Emphasis was put on the real time recalculation of the solution, which will enable future adaptation into a model predictive controller (MPC) scheme.

AB Vehicles with dual clutch transmissions (DCT) are well known for their comfortable drivability since gear shifts can be performed jerklessly. The ability of blending the torque during gear shifts from one clutch to the other, making the type of automated transmission a perfect alternative to torque converters, which also comes with a higher efficiency. Nevertheless, DCT also have some drawbacks. The actuation of two clutches requires an immense control effort, which is handled in the implementation of a wide range of software functions on the transmission control unit (TCU). These usually contain control parameters, which makes the behavior adaptable to different vehicle and engine platforms. The adaption of these parameters is called calibration, which is usually an iterative time-consuming process. The calibration of the embedded software solutions in control units is a widely known problem in the automotive industry. The calibration of any vehicle subsystem (e.g., engine, transmission, suspension, driver assistance systems for autonomous driving, etc.) requires costly test trips in different ambient conditions. To reduce the calibration effort and the accompanying use of professionals, several approaches to automize the calibration process are proposed. Due to the fact that a solution is desired which can optimize different calibration problems, a generic metaheuristic approach is aimed. Regardless, the scope of the current research is the optimization of the launch behavior for vehicles equipped with DCT since, particularly at low speeds, the transmission behavior must meet the intention of the driver (drivers tend to be more perceptive at low speeds). To clarify the characteristics of the launch, several test subject studies are performed. The influence factors, such as engine sound, maximal acceleration, acceleration build-up (mean jerk), and the reaction time, are taken into account. Their influence on the evaluation of launch with relation to the criteria of sportiness, comfort, and jerkiness, are examined based on the evaluation of the test subject studies. According to the results of the study, reference values for the optimization of the launch behavior are derived. The research contains a study of existing approaches for optimizing driving behavior with metaheuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, etc.). Since the existing approaches have different drawbacks (in scope of the optimization problem) a new approach is proposed, which outperforms existing ones. The approach itself is a hybrid solution of reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) and is applied in a software in the loop environment, and in a test vehicle.

ID ALLOCATION
AB When unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are carrying out missions, they are faced with complex task environments. To enhance the adaptability of UAV applications, it is required that they possess fast path-planning capabilities. This article takes the execution of complex tasks by multiple UAVs in a 3-D environment as background and transforms the path-planning problem into a multiconstraint optimization problem. Innovatively combining the hunter-prey optimizer (HPO) algorithm and task allocation mechanism, this study achieves collaborative path planning for multiple UAVs for complex tasks. In order to improve the optimization speed of the HPO algorithm, the following improvements have been made: first, introducing the chaotic mapping model to improve the performance of population initialization; second, adopting the golden sine strategy to change the population update strategy and accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm. Then, the single-peak and multipeak benchmark functions are used to test the average, standard deviation, and optimal values of the algorithm. Finally, path planning experiments are carried out in a 3-D map with multiple task points and obstacles, and the results show that the adapt golden sine HOP (AGSHPO) algorithm improves the robustness and real-time performance of the UAVs when executing complex tasks to a certain extent.

AB The advancement of autonomous technology makes electric-powered drones an excellent choice for flexible logistics services at the last mile delivery stage. To reach a balance between green transportation and competitive edge, the collaborative routing of drones in the air and trucks on the ground is increasingly invested in the next generation of delivery, where it is particularly reasonable to consider customer time windows and time-dependent travel times as two typical time-related factors in daily services. In this paper, we propose the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones under Time constraints (VRPD-T) and focus on the time constraints involved in realistic scenarios during the delivery. A mixed-integer linear programming model has been developed to minimize the total delivery completion time. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of standard solvers in handling large-scale complex issues, a space-time hybrid heuristic-based algorithm has been developed to effectively identify a high-quality solution. The numerical results produced from randomly generated instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.(c) 2022 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

AB In recent years there has been an increase in the number of research and developments in deep learning solutions for object detection applied to driverless vehicles. This application benefited from the growing trend felt in innovative perception solutions, such as LiDAR sensors. Currently, this is the preferred device to accomplish those tasks in autonomous vehicles. There is a broad variety of research works on models based on point clouds, standing out for being efficient and robust in their intended tasks, but they are also characterized by requiring point cloud processing times greater than the minimum required, given the risky nature of the application. This research work aims to provide a design and implementation of a hardware IP optimized for computing convolutions, rectified linear unit (ReLU), padding, and max pooling. This engine was designed to enable the configuration of features such as varying the size of the feature map, filter size, stride, number of inputs, number of filters, and the number of hardware resources required for a specific convolution. Performance results show that by resorting to parallelism and quantization approach, the proposed solution could reduce the amount of logical FPGA resources by 40 to 50%, enhancing the processing time by 50% while maintaining the deep learning operation accuracy.

AB Accurate remote determination of the object coordinates in 3D space is one of the main questions in many applications. In one of the most popular methods, such determination of the location of an object uses the measurement by receiving an electromagnetic signal transmitted by several spatially distributed base stations (BS). The main problem is that it is necessary to reduce errors and computation time. To overcome these difficulties, an analytical method for determining the position of an object based on the analysis of time difference of arrival (TDoA) of signals from the transmitter of the object to the receivers of the BS is proposed. One of the main advantages of this method is that it is possible to eliminate the ambiguity in determining the coordinates of the object in space and to increase the accuracy of determining the coordinates when the TDoA measurement between base stations fluctuates. Applications for autonomous automotive vehicles and space-based positioning systems are analyzed. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithm has an accuracy of determining coordinates several times higher than the method of linearization of hyperbolic equations and is less sensitive to TDoA fluctuations at base stations.

AB Underwater vehicle propulsion performed by exploiting electrical motor is in general the most flexible solution and it is growing in popularity because of its high efficiency both at high and at low advance speed, quick and simple deployment, low costs, and encumbrance. In the present work, permanent magnet synchronous motors for underwater propulsion are proposed. In particular, advanced sensorless control techniques of permanent magnet synchronous motors permit reduced costs, high reliability, and performances. When dealing with small autonomous underwater vehicle propulsion, such devices are hard to find in the market. Hence, the authors focused the research in the development of a system able to perform a reliable rotational speed and torque sensorless estimation. The design and implementation of a complete solution for underwater propulsion are presented as well as a novel rotor polarity identification technique exploiting a high-frequency injection control. Pool tests for the identification of the performances and of the dynamic parameters of the propulsion system are presented. Finally, the possibility of operating a sensorless estimation of the thrust and torque exerted by the propeller and pool test measurements are presented. These features could be exploited to improve navigation accuracy and involves obvious benefits in terms of cost reduction and reliability of the system.

The hardware platform used to test the developed algorithms is the AscTec Firefly equipped with a RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect): the sensor output is used to incrementally build a map of the environment and generate a collision-free path. Specifically, we introduce a novel approach to analytically compute the path in an efficient and effective manner. An initial path, given by the intersection of two 3D surfaces, is shaped around the obstacles by adding to either of the two surfaces a radial function at every obstacle location. The intersection between the deformed surfaces is guaranteed not to intersect obstacles, hence it is a safe path for the robot to follow. The entire computation runs on-board and the path is computed in real-time. In this article we present the developed algorithms, the software architecture as well as the results of our experiments, showing that the method can adapt in real time the robot's path in order to avoid several types of obstacles, while producing a map of the surroundings.

AB Due to the rapid expansion of heterogeneous mobile networks, there has been a significant increase in the need for a network, processing, and caching resources. A dynamic vehicular network requires the ability to effectively and efficiently manage multiple resources. This is in accord with the majority of previous research on resource management. Due to this, it is imperative to focus on dynamic networks that change rapidly over time and require a large number of connections. Using curiosity-enabled learning, this study investigates how distributed resource allocation mechanisms for mobile vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications can be applied to medium and dense traffic scenarios. By utilizing the distributed resource allocation mechanism, an autonomous "agent" such as a vehicle can determine the optimal sub-band and power level for transmission without relying on global information. It is believed that the environment learns from extrinsic rewards because they can provide high levels of repetition and heavy fluctuations in decisions. We model curiosity in accordance with exit locations in mobility models. In addition to providing intrinsic rewards to the environment, a variety of curiosities will improve the performance of the system. We find that each agent can satisfy latency constraints with resource allocation for V2I links with a minimum prediction error when learning from intrinsic rewards.

AB Ongoing research and industrial exploitation of SDN and NFV technologies promise higher flexibility on network automation and infrastructure optimization. Choosing the location of Virtual Network Functions is a central problem in the automation and optimization of the software-defined, virtualization-based next generation of networks such as 5G and beyond. Network services provided for autonomous vehicles, factory automation, e-health and cloud robotics often require strict delay bounds and reliability constraints influenced by the location of its composing Virtual Network Functions. Robots, vehicles and other end-devices provide significant capabilities such as actuators, sensors and local computation which are essential for some services. Moreover, these devices are continuously on the move and might lose network connection or run out of battery, which further challenge service delivery in this dynamic environment. This work tackles the mobility, and battery restrictions; as well as the temporal aspects and conflicting traits of reliable, low latency service deployment over a volatile network, where mobile compute nodes act as an extension of the cloud and edge computing infrastructure. The problem is formulated as a cost-minimizing Virtual Network Function placement optimization and an efficient heuristic is proposed. The algorithms are extensively evaluated from various aspects by simulation on detailed real-world scenarios.

AB Many jurisdictions globally have adopted a zero road trauma target by 2050 and an interim target of a 50% reduction by 2030. The objective of this study was to investigate what the road system will need to look like in order to achieve these respective targets. Utilising human tolerance to injury as the key design factor, this study defined the combination of vehicle, infrastructure, and travel speed requirements to manage crash energy in order to: 1. prevent all fatalities and serious injuries by 2050 in an Ultimate Safe System scenario; and 2. significantly reduce fatalities and severe injuries by 2030 in an Interim Safe System scenario. Victoria, Australia and its Movement and Place (M&P) framework was employed as a case study. With the vehicle and infrastructure countermeasures currently available coupled with appropriate travel speeds it is possible to construct an Ultimate Safe System that can manage crash forces to achieve zero trauma and an Interim Safe System that can significantly reduce the most severe injuries in Victoria. This study has demonstrated a potential pathway from the current situation to 2030 and then 2050 that can achieve safety targets while meeting the core objectives of the transport system.

AB We propose a novel formation control method considering the challenges of formation keeping, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control, and position adjustment in UAV Base Station (UAV-BS) formation control scenarios. The method is based on a loose coupling structure inspired by the traditional virtual structure method. Firstly, a type of new formation is designed for UAV-BS group. When the UAV-BS group keep a stable network, the centers of all UAV-BS moving trajectory, e.g., circular, are treated as virtual points to form a rigid body. When the UAV-BS group transforms between different formations, the real positions of the UAV-BS group are used to form a rigid body. Secondly, we redesign a trajectory tracking method for UAV-BS to control the flight direction. A flight direction controller is designed for UAV-BS, based on nonlinear guidance logic. According to the empirical model of error feedback, an error corrector is designed to control the position error between the UAV-BS and the virtual point. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can satisfactorily complete the formation and control of UA-BS. Besides, the algorithm can reduce the difficulty of formation control of UAV-BS and the requirements of formation control for computing power and network communication.

AB Road surface wetness is a contributing factor in traffic accidents. As the amount of friction reduction correlates with the water film height covering the road surface, a quantification is of high relevance in order to improve traffic safety. Both drivers and autonomous vehicles would benefit from additional information. This paper presents a novel concept for road wetness quantification. It is based on a 2 x 4-planar capacitive transducer array, capable to detect water spray ejected by the tires and its wetness-related dependencies. The reliable assessment of these dependencies by a proposed capacitive sensor system is shown in an experimental study on an asphalt circuit for various wheel speeds. Besides the spray's correlation with speed, the results reveal significant differences in transducer positions and designs confirming the array's relevance regarding wetness quantification. In addition, a 1-nearest neighbor classifier capable of automatically distinguishing between eight wetness levels is proposed. The classifier is optimized by an extended version of balanced accuracy and reaches similar performance as binary classifiers from related research. A balanced ratio between capacitance increase-, standard deviation- and speed-related feature types is one key aspect of classifier performance. Furthermore, up to a certain extent, the array's individual transducers can significantly contribute to classifier performance with design- and position-related advantages.

AB This paper addresses a state-of-the-art navigation system aided by an intelligent velocity model for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). It's critical to obtain a precise navigation for the safety and effectiveness of AUV missions. The reliability of AUV navigation-related sensors becomes particularly important, while the accuracy of sensors, especially the Doppler velocity log (DVL), which is easy to be interfered, affects navigation accuracy directly. However, standard AUV does not have redundant velocity sensors. Once DVL is invalid caused by fish movement, sound scattering, or DVL overrange, it will have a catastrophic effect on AUV missions. To improve navigation robustness and avoid the effects of DVL dropouts, an intelligent velocity model is proposed to assist navigation by using optimally pruned extreme learning machine. The performance of model-aided navigation system is evaluated on data from our research platform Sailfish 210 AUV during sea trials on the high seas of yellow sea, which achieve 0.5% navigation accuracy. In addition, the intelligent velocity model without modifying the model parameters is more flexible in model acquisition than the traditional vehicle dynamic model when AUV sensor distribution and AUV mass change. Results show that it is possible to improve accuracy and robustness of navigation as a redundant velocity information for standard AUV.

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; dynamic occupancy grids; environment perception;
   mapping; object detection; tracking
AB Modeling and estimating the current local environment by processing sensor measurement data is essential for intelligent vehicles. Static obstacles, dynamic objects, and free space have to be appropriately represented, classified, and filtered. Occupancy grids, known for mapping static environments, provide a common low-level representation using occupancy probabilities with an implicit data association through the discrete grid structure. Extending this idea toward dynamic environments with moving objects requires a static/dynamic classification of measured occupancy and a tracking of the dynamic state of grid cells. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic grid mapping approach. An evidential representation using the Dempster-Shafer framework is used to model hypotheses for static occupancy, dynamic occupancy, free space, and their combined hypotheses. These hypotheses are consistently estimated and accumulated in a dynamic grid map by an adapted evidential filtering, allowing one to distinguish static and dynamic occupancy. The evidential grid mapping is combined with a low-level particle filter tracking that is used to estimate cell velocity distributions and predict dynamic occupancy of the grid map. Static occupancy is directly modeled in the grid map without requiring particles, increasing efficiency, and improving the static/dynamic classification due to the persistent map accumulation. Experimental results with real sensor data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in challenging scenarios with occlusions and dense traffic.

ID ASSIGNMENT
AB During operation, maintenance inside the reactor building at ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) has to be performed by remote handling, due to the presence of activated materials. Maintenance operations involve the transportation and storage of large, heavyweight casks from and to the tokamak building. The transportation is carried out by autonomous vehicles that lift and move beneath these casks. The storage of these casks face several challenges, since (1) the cask storage area is limited in space, and (2) all casks have to be accessible for transportation by the vehicles. In particular, casks in the storage area may block other casks, so that the former has to be moved to a temporary position to give way to the latter. This paper addresses the challenge of managing the logistics of cask storage, where casks may have different typologies. In particular, we propose an approach to (1) determine the best position of the casks inside the storage area, and to (2) obtain the sequence of operations required to retrieve and store an arbitrary cask from/to a given storage place. A combinatorial optimization approach is used to obtain solutions to both these problems. Simulation results illustrate the application of the proposed method to a simple scenario.

AB Our research has investigated the feasibility of directly sourcing autonomous operations data from a construction-vehicle positioning system, so as to enable productivity analysis and simulation modeling in the practical context of ready mixed concrete production and delivery. In this paper, we first review research efforts related to applying radio frequency identification tags and global positioning system for tracking construction resources and acquiring operations data in the field. We then describe the technical design and system components of an automated data collection (ADC) solution to accumulating concrete delivery operations data, which is extended from a construction-vehicle positioning system tailored for highly dense urban areas. We further elaborate on how our ADC system captures, transforms, and analyzes data of mixer truck operations. Truck-tracking experiment results based on field trials are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of data sourced from our ADC system with respect to: (1) analyzing truck-waiting time versus truck-unloading time on site; and (2) predicting truck's plant-to-site travel time. In conclusion, the ADC solution resulting from this research not only allows sophisticated analysis of mixer truck resource utilization at concreting sites situated in highly dense urban areas, but also provides an accumulation of input data that will enable concrete plant operations simulation modeling.

AB The increasing demand for optimizing the use of agricultural resources will require the adoption of cutting-edge technologies and precision farming management. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sprayers seem promising due to their potential to perform precision or spot spraying, particularly in woody crop environments where total surface spraying is unnecessary. However, incorporating this technology is limited by the lack of scientific knowledge about the environmental risks associated with UAV sprayers and the strict legal framework. Nonetheless, these spraying systems' characteristic downwash airflow and the limited swath width can potentially mitigate drift in hedgerow crops. During our study we performed comparative studies aimed to compare the airborne drift, soil, and crop depositions between a conventional orchard sprayer and a UAV sprayer in a commercial superhigh-density orchard in the South Iberian Peninsula in 2022. Our findings reveal that, in superhigh-density olive orchards, the UAV sprayer presents a substantial reduction in airborne drift, while soil depositions showed no significant differences compared to those of a conventional terrestrial orchard sprayer. Crop depositions were significantly lower when utilizing the UAV sprayer. These results suggest that introducing UAV spraying technology in Mediterranean agricultural systems, under specific scenarios, can effectively reduce the environmental impact of crop spraying and encourage the responsible use of plant protection products (PPPs).

AB The automotive trend towards autonomous driving and advanced connected services increases both complexity of the vehicle internal network and the connections to its environment. This introduced complexity further broadens the vehicle cyberattack surface.As mitigation strategy, state-of-the-art security mechanisms utilize so-called hardware trust anchors (HTAs) to protect security-sensitive data and processes in shielded locations that are isolated utilizing hardware security mechanisms. However, there is a variety of different HTAs with different functionality and security guarantees and there is currently no work done that compares and evaluates them against current and emerging automotive requirements.In this work, we evaluate the applicability of various HTAs to secure modern as well as upcoming future automotive applications. For this, we analyze and evaluate HTAs that are already established in the automotive field as well as promising HTAs from other domains. We extend our preliminary work (Plappert et al., 2022b) by increasing the range of the analyzed HTAs with solutions that are feasible for the most resource constrained automotive controllers and technologies that become feasible to be utilized by the introduction of highperformance controllers in future automotive architectures. We assess the different HTAs based on the evaluation criteria and in accordance to automotive requirements.

AB Featured Application This work combines a decentralized multi-agent system working form, using a similar approach to associative memory, focusing on the dynamic association of motion processes, to achieve clustered recognition of motion behavior by designing a multilayer structured multi-agent system. Multi-agent systems are suitable for handling complex problems due to their high parallelism and autonomous evolution ability. In this paper, we propose an adaptive clustering multi-agent learning system for intelligent applications with continuously changing requirements. Each agent model changes temporal sequences using the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. Multiple agents collaborate in a multilayer decentralized approach to enhance learning adaptability and achieve self-supervised behavioral clustering. The system is constructed using a "memory-like" method and operates primarily on memory access and comparison, avoiding extensive matrix operations of artificial neural networks while achieving learning and prediction functions. We chose an unsupervised vehicle behavioral clustering scenario for feasibility validation in which the system's cognitive objective is to cluster and recognize vehicle behaviors. In a low computational environment, the system can complete clustering functions and exhibit continuous learning capabilities when new behavioral changes occur. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 97.4% while processing at a speed 1-5 times faster than similar clustering algorithms. The verification results indicate that this system has excellent potential to enhance intelligent sensing front ends.

AB Sustainable operations management will appeal to the post-pandemic world. As the economy recovers, the surging demand for low-carbon bike-sharing has led to exacerbated mismatch in urban transportation. It is a serious challenge to optimize the reallocation schedule of sharing bikes among multiple positions in a network. To address the problem, we develop a novel predict-then-optimize method consisting of a data-driven robust optimization model and a branch-and-price algorithm. The optimization model derives the predicted demand surplus of each position based on historical data, enabling the optimal reallocation schedule in the network at minimum operational costs. Based on the prediction, the branch-and-price algorithm can find out the best routes of assigning bikes to specific positions that further improves transportation efficiency. Finally, we deploy the predict-then-optimize method to a realistic bike-sharing network in one major city of China. The computational results demonstrate that our method can significantly save the cost of operations and reduce the waste of resources. Therefore, the novel predict-then-optimize method has a great potential to facilitate the sustainable development of bike-sharing systems in urban transportation.

AB In recent years, the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has involved the input of various kinds of heterogeneous data in real time and from multiple sources, which presents several additional challenges. Studies on Data Fusion (DF) have delivered significant enhancements in ITS and demonstrated a substantial impact on its evolution. This paper introduces a systematic literature review on recent data fusion methods and extracts the main issues and challenges of using these techniques in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). It endeavors to identify and discuss the multi-sensor data sources and properties used for various traffic domains, including autonomous vehicles, detection models, driving assistance, traffic prediction, Vehicular communication, Localization, and management systems. Moreover, it attempts to associate abstractions of observation-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and decision-level fusion with different methods to better understand how DF is used in ITS applications. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to review DF methods used for ITS studies to extract its trendy challenges. The review outcomes are (i) a description of the current Data fusion methods that adopt multi-sensor sources of heterogeneous data under different evaluation strategies, (ii) identifying several research gaps, current challenges, and new research trends.

AB The growing maturity and sophistication of autonomous vehicles incorporate increasing numbers of sensors to produce multiple data streams detailing vehicle surroundings. As part of the continuous and reliable transmission of data, protection of lenses and windows for sensors from environmental damage is necessary across bands including visible (400-750 nm), near IR (0.75 to 1.5 mu m), and thermal wavelengths (8-15 mu m). Here, we report a cross-linked poly(oxalamide) based on aliphatic amine monomers and dioxalate species, resulting in transparency in both visible (400-750 nm) and multiple IR bands (0.75-1.5 mu m, 3.5-5.5 mu m, and 8-12 mu m). Mechanical toughness (epsilon = similar to 200%, sigma = 35 MPa) and network resiliency toward fluids and thermal exposure are reflective of the cross-linked network and contribute to durability and the potential to protect brittle substrates. This was demonstrated by casting free-standing films bonded onto a germanium window using the identical poly(oxalamide) resin as an adhesive. Imaging through a thermal IR camera with the coated window before and after exposure to an abrasive sand stream showed the ability to protect the underlying substrate and maintain image quality while the unprotected window was severely degraded.

AB The sensor technology for water quality monitoring (WQM) has improved during recent years. The cost-effective sensorised tools that can autonomously measure the essential physical-chemical-biological (PCB) variables are now readily available and are being deployed on buoys, boats, and ships. Yet, there is a disconnect between the data quality, data gathering, and data analysis due to the lack of standardized approaches for data collection and processing, spatiotemporal variation of key parameters in water bodies and new contaminants. Such gaps can be bridged with a network of multiparametric sensor systems deployed in water bodies using autonomous vehicles, such as marine robots and aerial vehicles to broaden the data coverage in space and time. Furthermore, intelligent algorithms [e.g., artificial intelligence (AI)] could be employed for standardized data analysis and forecasting. This article presents a comprehensive review of the sensors, deployment, and analysis technologies for WQM.

AB Autonomously searching for hazardous radiation sources requires the ability of the aerial and ground systems to understand the scene they are scouting. In this paper, we present systems, algorithms, and experiments to perform radiation search using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) by employing semantic scene segmentation. The aerial data are used to identify radiological points of interest, generate an orthophoto along with a digital elevation model (DEM) of the scene, and perform semantic segmentation to assign a category (e.g., road, grass) to each pixel in the orthophoto. We perform semantic segmentation by training a model on a dataset of images we collected and annotated, using the model to perform inference on images of the test area unseen to the model, and then refining the results with the DEM to better reason about category predictions at each pixel. We then use all of these outputs to plan a path for a UGV carrying a LiDAR to map the environment and avoid obstacles not present during the flight, and a radiation detector to collect more precise radiation measurements from the ground. Results of the analysis for each scenario tested favorably. We also note that our approach is general and has the potential to work for a variety of different sensing tasks.

AB Fin-based propulsion systems perform well for both high-speed cruising and high maneuverability in fishes, making them good models for propulsors of autonomous underwater vehicles. Labriform locomotion in fishes is actuated by oscillation of the paired pectoral fins. Here, we present recent research on fin structure, fin motion, and neural control in fishes to outline important future directions for this field and to assist engineers in attempting biomimicry of maneuverable fin-based locomotion in shallow surge zones. Three areas of structure and function are discussed in this review: 1) the anatomical structure of the fin blade, skeleton, and muscles that drive fin motion; 2) the rowing and flapping motions that fins undergo for propulsion in fishes; and 3) the neuroanatomy, neural circuitry, and electrical muscle activity that are characteristic of pectoral fins. Research on fin biomechanics, muscle physiology and neural control is important to the comparative biology of locomotion in fishes and application of fin function for aid in aquatic vehicle design. Recommendations are made regarding fin propulsor designs based on the fin shape, activation pattern, and motion. Research on neural control of fins is a key piece in the puzzle for a complete understanding of comparative fin function and may provide important principles for engineers designing control systems for fin-like propulsors.

AB Hydrothermal vent fields located in the gap between known sites in Guaymas Basin and 21 degrees N on the East Pacific Rise were discovered on the Alarcon Rise and in southern Pescadero Basin. The Alarcon Rise spreading segment was mapped at 1-m resolution by an autonomous underwater vehicle. Individual chimneys were identified using the bathymetric data. Vent fields were interpreted as active from temperature anomalies in water column data and observed and sampled during remotely operated vehicle dives. The Ja Sit, Pericu, and Meyibo active fields are near the eruptive fissure of an extensive young lava flow. Vent fluids up to 360 degrees C from Meyibo have compositions similar to northern East Pacific Rise vents. The Tzab-ek field is 850m west of the volcanic axis, and active chimneys rise up to 33m above a broad sulfide mound. The inactive field is 10km north-northeast along the rift axis, and most sulfide chimneys are enriched in Zn and associated elements that are transported at lower temperature compared to the more Cu-rich active fields. In southern Pescadero Basin, the Auka field is on the margin of a sediment-filled graben at 3,670-m depth. Discharging fluids are clear, contain hydrocarbons, and have neutral pH, elevated salinity, and temperatures up to 291 degrees C. They have deposited massive mounds of calcite with minor sulfide. The fluids are compositionally similar to those in Guaymas Basin, produced by high-temperature basalt-seawater interaction followed by reaction with sediment. The paucity of sulfide minerals suggests subsurface deposition of metals.
   Plain Language Summary Hydrothermal chimneys on two previously unexplored spreading ridges, the Alarcon Rise and southern Pescadero Basin, were discovered on Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute expeditions to the Gulf of California. Autonomous underwater vehicles were used to map the region, followed by dives with remotely operated vehicles to observe and sample features on the seafloor. Many of the chimneys on the Alarcon Rise were found to be high-temperature black smokers, so-called because of the particles of metal-sulfide that precipitate from the hot fluid as it cools. Deposited precipitates have built chimneys up to 33m tall, composed of iron, copper, and zinc sulfides, and include some precious metals. The venting fluid was seawater that has been heated by, and interacted with, underlying basalt lavas through which it circulated. In the southern Pescadero Basin, hydrothermal fluids are clear and somewhat cooler than at the Alarcon Rise, and the chimneys are composed of calcite with little sulfide. These fluid and deposit compositions are most similar to those at the Guaymas Basin, located farther north in the Gulf of California, where the heated vent fluids pass through, and react with, thick sediments before exiting the seafloor.

AB Numerous real-time object detection frameworks have been evaluated using publicly available datasets, demonstrating commendable performance. However, there is a growing need for improved performance when these frameworks are applied to custom datasets. This manuscript aims to address the dual objectives of achieving high accuracy while maintaining lightweight efficiency in the context of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) power inspection algorithm development. The newly introduced GDiBlock (Group Dimensionality-increase Convolution Block) effectively reduces channel redundancy, allowing for the extraction of rich, high-dimensional feature information with fewer parameters. Simultaneously, the PAM (Pooling Attention Mechanism) accurately distinguishes between background and target entities without introducing additional parameters, making it particularly advantageous for addressing complex background scenarios commonly encountered in UAV imagery. We meticulously explore a design paradigm guided by the receptive field principle to determine the optimal number of blocks within each processing stage. In conclusion, our proposed network architecture reduces the parameter count by 28% to 40%, while improving the mAP@.5 metric by a margin of 1.7 to 5.4 points when compared to YOLOv5. When compared to state-of-the-art real-time object detection frameworks, our study demonstrates superior performance in terms of both model accuracy and size.

AB This paper introduces a novel methodology to the transport sector to foster dialogue between actors holding different perspectives on issues pertinent to the future of mobility that might be termed 'wicked'. The case of driverless cars is considered. The paper points to a dearth of interaction between actors holding different and sometimes polar opposite views on what driverless cars could mean for the future of transport and society. It examines the role of bringing diverse perspectives together in a collaborative setting to address this wicked problem. The importance of creating task conflict is highlighted in the facilitation of engagement and achievement of shared learning. The Emulsion Methodology brings together into constructive dialogue (the emulsion) people with alternative perspectives on driverless cars (evangelists, opponents and agnostics) that may not typically mix (oil and water). The one-day workshop format (the emulsifier) involves co creation, in mixed-perspective groups, of plausible utopias and plausible dystopias for a driverless cars future in 2050. The Three Horizons method is then used to identify significant issues at play in the transition to such futures. In turn, this enables guiding principles for present day policy to be identified. Application of the methodology to driverless cars resulted in new learning, changed perspectives and specific insights of relevance to policymaking.

AB The evolution and popular adaptation of drone technology in diverse applications has necessitated advancement of UAV communication framework. UAVs inherently support features like mobility, flexibility, adaptive altitude, which make them a preferable option for dynamic surveillance of remote locations. Multiple UAVs can cooperatively work to accomplish surveillance missions more efficiently. However, the intermittent network connectivity and the limited onboard energy storage impose a great challenge on UAV-assisted remote surveillance. This paper presents an Energy-efficient Collaborative Multi-UAV Surveillance (ECMS) system for surveillance of inaccessible regions. The system employs an optimal Multi-UAV Collaborative Monocular Vision (MCMV) topology to facilitate the surveillance with zero blind spot using minimum number of drones. We also propose an application-aware Multi-Path Weighted Load-balancing (MWL) routing protocol for handling congestion by distributing traffic among all available resources in UAV network and adaptively selecting the of source datarate (i.e. switching video resolution). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed surveillance system achieves coverage with lesser number of UAVs compared to the existing systems. It also achieves higher throughput, higher packet-delivery ratio, higher residual energy of UAVs, and lower end-to-end delay.

AB To prevent terror attacks in which trucks are used as weapons as happened in Nice or Berlin in 2016, the European Project Autonomous Emergency Maneuvering and Movement Monitoring for Road Transport Security (TransSec) was launched in 2018. One crucial point of this project is the development of a map-aiding approach for the localization of vehicles on digital maps, so that the information in digital map data can be used to detect prohibited driving maneuvers, such as off-road or wrong-way drivers. For example, a lane-level map-aiding approach is required for wrong-way driver detection. Navigation Data Standard (NDS) is one of the worldwide map standards developed by several automobile manufacturers. So far, there is no lane-level NDS map covers a large area, therefore, it was decided to use the latest available NDS map without lane level accuracy. In this paper, a lane-level map-aiding approach based on a non-lane-level NDS map is presented. Due to the inaccuracy of vehicle position and digital map the map-aiding does not always provide the correct results, so probabilities of off-road and wrong-way diver detection are estimated to support risk estimation. The performance of the developed map-aiding approach is comprehensively evaluated with both real and simulated trajectories.

AB Big construction enterprises, such as electrical power generation dams and mining slopes, demand continuous visual inspections. The sizes of these structures and the necessary level of detail in each mission requires a conflicting set of multi-objective goals, such as performance, quality, and safety. It is challenging for human operators, or simple autonomous path-following drones, to process all this information, and thus, it is common that a mission must be repeated several times until it succeeds. This paper deals with this problem by developing a new cognitive architecture based on a collaborative environment between the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other agents focusing on optimizing the data gathering, information processing, and decision-making. The proposed architecture breaks the problem into independent units ranging from sensors and actuators up to high-level intelligence processes. It organizes the structures into data and information; each agent may request an individual behavior from the system. To deal with conflicting behaviors, a supervisory agent analyzes all requests and defines the final planning. This architecture enables real-time decision-making with intelligent social behavior among the agents. Thus, it is possible to process and make decisions about the best way to accomplish the mission. To present the methodology, slope inspection scenarios are shown.

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention. However, we face two major drawbacks when working with UAVs: high nonlinearities and unknown position in 3D space since it is not provided with on-board sensors that can measure its position with respect to a global coordinate system. In this paper, we present a real-time implementation of a servo control, integrating vision sensors, with a neural proportional integral derivative (PID), in order to develop an hexarotor image based visual servo control (IBVS) that knows the position of the robot by using a velocity vector as a reference to control the hexarotor position. This integration requires a tight coordination between control algorithms, models of the system to be controlled, sensors, hardware and software platforms and well-defined interfaces, to allow the real-time implementation, as well as the design of different processing stages with their respective communication architecture. All of these issues and others provoke the idea that real-time implementations can be considered as a difficult task. For the purpose of showing the effectiveness of the sensor integration and control algorithm to address these issues on a high nonlinear system with noisy sensors as cameras, experiments were performed on the Asctec Firefly on-board computer, including both simulation and experimenta results.

AB The connectivity-aware path design is crucial in the effective deployment of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have become the popular approach to solving this type of complex problem, but RL algorithms suffer slow convergence. In this article, we propose a transfer learning (TL) approach, where we use a teacher policy previously trained in an old domain to boost the path learning of the agent in the new domain. As the exploration processes and the training continue, the agent refines the path design in the new domain based on the subsequent interactions with the environment. We evaluate our approach considering an old domain at sub-6 GHz and a new domain at millimeter-wave (mmWave). The teacher path policy, previously trained at the sub-6 GHz path, is the solution to a connectivity-aware path problem that we formulate as a constrained Markov decision process ( CMDP). We employ a Lyapunov-based model-free deep Q-network (DQN) to solve the path design at sub-6 GHz that guarantees connectivity constraint satisfaction. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for different urban environment scenarios. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of reducing the training time considerably at mmWave.

AB This paper proposes an adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) based on disturbance observer (DOB) for trajectory tracking problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Due to sensitivity of the SMC to mismatched disturbances, this paper presents an adaptive SMC based on a new exponential reaching law. The controller uses a DOB to estimate both matched and mismatched time-varying disturbances. The stability of DOB in the presence of time-varying disturbances is proved via the Lyapunov stability theorem. To design the controller, sliding surfaces containing estimation of the matched and mismatched disturbances are defined. In order to increase the speed of reaching to the surfaces and avoid chattering, the gains of the proposed reaching law have been adapted based on the sliding surfaces. It has been proved that the proposed reaching law converges to the sliding surfaces in a finite time. The stability of the overall system with DOB and controller has also been proved using the Lyapunov technique. A simulation study has conducted to test how the proposed method controls the AUVs to track a desired trajectory when the vehicles are exposed to both matched and mismatched disturbances. The results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed controller is superior to the controllers previously reported in the literature.

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant popularity and are used for many applications, from entertainment to surveillance and the modern battlefield. As regulation demands arose worldwide, controling and reacting to unauthorized flights of UAVs became a pressing issue. In this work, we present an algorithm to accelerate the training of a reinforcement learning drone agent for a counter unmanned aerial system (C-UAS). The main objective of this C-UAS is to guide an invading drone to a safe-killing zone (SZ) using a hunter quadrotor drone. The hunter quadrotor launches a spoofing, or meaconing, attack on the GNSS receiver of the invading drone. The proposed algorithms employ an abstraction of the C-UAS problem to accelerate the training step and enable training during the mission. Results for different SZ radii are discussed using a software-in-the-loop simulation for ground truth based on a detailed model of the UAV embedded system and flight dynamics, including error metrics and action time. We show that a 99% probability of successful target steering to the SZ can be achieved considering a SZ radius of 75 meters and a Q-table trained with the proposed accelerated training model.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications exploiting millimeter wave (mmWave) can satisfy the increasing data rate demands for future wireless networks owing to the line-of-sight (LoS) dominated transmission and flexibility. In reality, the LoS link can be easily and severely blocked due to poor propagation environments such as tall buildings or trees. To this end, we introduce a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which passively reflects signals with programmable reflection coefficients, between the transceivers to enhance the communication quality. Specifically, in this paper we generalize a three-dimensional (3D) non-stationary wideband end-to-end channel model for RIS auxiliary UAV-to-ground mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. By modeling the RIS as a virtual cluster, we study the power delivering capability of RIS as well as the fading characteristic of the proposed channel model. Important channel statistical properties are derived and thoroughly investigated, and the impact of RIS reflection phase configurations on these statistical properties is studied, which provides guidelines for the practical system design. The agreement between theoretical and simulated as well as measurement results validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model.

AB The bus transit system is promising to enable electric and autonomous vehicles for massive urban mobility, which relies on high-level automation and efficient resource management. Besides the on-road automation, the in-depot automated scheduling for battery recharging has not been adequately studied yet. This paper presents an integrated in-depot routing and recharging scheduling (IDRRS) problem, which is modeled as a constraint programming (CP) problem with Boolean satisfiability conditions (SAT). The model is converted to a flexible job-shop problem (FJSP) and is feasible to be solved by a CP-SATsolver for the optimal solution or feasible solutions with acceptable performance. This paper also presents a case study in Shanghai and compares the results from the FJSP model and the first-come first-serve (FCFS) method. The result demonstrates the allocation of routes and chargers under multiple scenarios with different numbers of chargers. The results show that the FJSP model shortens the delay and increases the time conservation for future rounds of operation than FCFS, while FCFS presents the simplicity of programming and better computational efficiency. The multiple random input test suggests that the proposed approach can decide the minimum number of chargers for stochastic charging requests.The proposed method can conserve the investment by increasing the utilization of automated recharging devices, improving vehicles' in-depot efficiency.

AB This article describes the Blackbird unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Dataset, a large-scale suite of sensor data and corresponding ground truth from a custom-built quadrotor platform equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), rotor tachometers, and virtual color, grayscale, and depth cameras. Motivated by the increasing demand for agile, autonomous operation of aerial vehicles, this dataset is designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of high-performance UAV perception algorithms. The dataset contains over 10 hours of data from our quadrotor tracing 18 different trajectories at varying maximum speeds (0.5 to 13.8 ms(-1)) through 5 different visual environments for a total of 176 unique flights. For each flight, we provide 120 Hz grayscale, 60 Hz RGB-D, and 60 Hz semantically segmented images from forward stereo and downward-facing photorealistic virtual cameras in addition to 100 Hz IMU, 190 Hz motor speed sensors, and 360 Hz millimeter-accurate motion capture ground truth. The Blackbird UAV dataset is therefore well suited to the development of algorithms for visual inertial navigation, 3D reconstruction, and depth estimation. As a benchmark for future algorithms, the performance of two state-of-the-art visual odometry algorithms are reported and scripts for comparing against the benchmarks are included with the dataset. The dataset is available for download at http://blackbirddataset.mit.edu/..

AB In this study, a FPGA based, mobile, fully autonomous, 5-DOF robot arm, which can distinguish objects according to their dimensions using an ultrasonic sensor module is designed and implemented. Digital hardware design of speed and position control of the vehicle carrying the robot arm and the position control of the robot arm are implemented on a single FPGA chip. The driver circuits of the DC motors and the RC motors mounted on the mobile robot arm system are also realized, and the motor speed and position controls are handled through the PWM signals obtained by a specific VHDL module. Frequency division technique is used to produce the PWM signals. The concurrent controls of the units mounted on the arm are possible due to parallel execution ability offered by FPGA based designs. The Modelsim program is used for VHDL code simulations. The real FPGA implementations are done on a Spartan-3 FPGA evaluation board using Xilinx ISE tools. This evaluation board is also mounted on the vehicle platform as a part of the mobile robot arm system. The test results show that the robot arm is able to accomplish all expected functions successfully. Finally, the designed robot arm is only categorically compared to some robot arm designs exist in the literature due to mismatch with design technology, robot type and DOF in all aspects.

DE UAV routing problem; Multicriteria optimization; VRP with soft time

AB Aerial robotics can be very useful to perform complex tasks in a distributed and cooperative fashion, such as localization of targets and search of point of interests (Pots). In this work, we propose a distributed system of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), able to self-coordinate and cooperate in order to ensure both spatial and temporal coverage of specific time and spatial varying Pols. In particular, we consider an UAVs system able to solve distributed dynamic scheduling problems, since each device is required to move towards a certain position in a certain time. We give a mathematical formulation of the problem as a multi-criteria optimization model, in which the total distances traveled by the UAVs (to be minimized), the customer satisfaction (to be maximized) and the number of used UAVs (to be minimized) are considered simultaneously. A dynamic variant of the basic optimization model, defined by considering the rolling horizon concept, is shown. We introduce a case study as an application scenario, where sport actions of a football match are filmed through a distributed UAVs system. The customer satisfaction and the traveled distance are used as performance parameters to evaluate the proposed approaches on the considered scenario. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a human detection system that can be employed on board a mobile platform for use in autonomous surveillance of large outdoor infrastructures. The prediction is based on the fusion of two detection modules, one for the laser and another for the vision data. In the laser module, a novel feature set that better encapsulates variations due to noise, distance and human pose is proposed. This enhances the generalization of the system, while at the same time, increasing the outdoor performance in comparison with current methods. The vision module uses the combination of the histogram of oriented gradients descriptor and the linear support vector machine classifier. Current approaches use a fixed-size projection to define regions of interest on the image data using the range information from the laser range finder. When applied to small size unmanned ground vehicles, these techniques suffer from misalignment, due to platform vibrations and terrain irregularities. This is effectively addressed in this work by using a novel adaptive projection technique, which is based on a probabilistic formulation of the classifier performance. Finally, a probability calibration step is introduced in order to optimally fuse the information from both modules. Experiments in real world environments demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method.

AB A key technical challenge for high-altitude, or near-space concepts is autonomous station keeping, or the ability to remain fixed over a geolocation in the presence of winds. Although at 65,000 ft altitude and above, one is above weather (i.e., storms, rain), winds still exist. And to station keep in the presence of these winds requires propulsive power. This paper focuses on the analysis of the station-keeping performance of a notional solar-powered airship operating at an altitude around 65,000. The vehicle has a lifting-gas volume of 6.1 x 10(6) ft(3), and is solar electric powered with the entire upper surface covered by solar cells. Electric motors and propellers provide propulsion, additional on-board power is required for the payload and auxiliary equipment, and batteries are used for power storage. In this paper, the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle is estimated, the wind environment is characterized, and the solar power available is determined for several geolocations and time of year. This power available is then compared to the power required for station keeping in the presence of winds. It is shown that due to diurnal solar variations and season winds,a large airship may be unable to meet station-keeping performance requirements in certain months of the year due to power limitations.

AB Purpose - Describes a dual-arm mobile manipulator that can autonomously scan natural terrain using a typical handheld landmine detector in a manner similar to a human operator.
   Design/methodology/approach - Presents a terrain-scanning robot that consists of two articulated arms mounted on an off-road remotely operated vehicle. One arm carries a laser and four ultrasonic rangefinders to build a terrain map. The map is used in real time to generate an obstacle-free path for the second arm that manipulates the landmine detector autonomously. The arms are mounted on the vehicle that is controlled by an operator from a safe distance. Motion planning and control of the robot is carried out using an embedded computer that is linked to a host computer to transmit the detector data and operator commands.
   Findings - Finds that the terrain-scanning robot can effectively manipulate a relatively large landmine detector on rugged terrain with undulations and obstacles.
   Research limitations/implications - Proposes real-time motion planning that may be equally applicable to other mobile manipulators.
   Practical implications - Provides a technology that together with state-of-the-art landmine sensors will offer a safe solution for detecting hidden landmines and clearing them from the postwar countries.
   Originality/value - Introduces the concept of a dual-arm mobile terrain scanning robot for landmine detection in off-road missions and civilian areas where truck-mounted detectors are inefficient.

AB Edge intelligence, a new paradigm to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) applications by leveraging computing resources on the network edge, can be used to improve intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, due to physical limitations and energy-supply constraints, the computing powers of edge equipment are usually limited. High altitude platform station (HAPS) computing can be considered to be a promising extension of edge computing. HAPS is deployed in the stratosphere to provide wide coverage and strong computational capabilities. It is suitable to coordinate terrestrial resources and store the fundamental data associated with ITS-based applications. In this work, three computing layers, i.e., vehicles, terrestrial network edges, and HAPS, are integrated to build a computation framework for ITS, where the HAPS data library stores the fundamental data needed for the applications. In addition, the caching technique is introduced for network edges to store some of the fundamental data from the HAPS so that large transmission delays can be reduced. We aim to minimize the delay of the system by optimizing computation offloading and caching decisions as well as bandwidth and computing resource allocations. The simulation results highlight the benefits of HAPS computing for mitigating delays and the significance of caching at network edges.

AB It is promising to detect or maintain subsea X-trees using a remote operated vehicle (ROV). In this article, an efficient recognition model for the subsea X-tree component is proposed to assist in the autonomous operation of unmanned underwater maintenance vehicles: an efficient network module, SX(subsea X-tree)-DCANet, is designed to replace the CSPBlock of YOLOv4-tiny with ResBlock-D and combine with the ECANet attention module. In addition, two-stage transform learning is used for the insufficiency of underwater target recognition samples as well as the overfitting caused by the subsea target recognition model, thereby providing an effective learning strategy for traditional subsea target recognition. A mosaic data augment algorithm and cosine annealing algorithm are also utilized for better accuracy of network training. The results of ablation studies show that the mean Average Precision (mAP) and speed of the improved algorithm are increased by 1.58% and 10.62%, respectively. Multiple field experiments on the laboratory, experimental pool, and the hydro-electric station prove that the recognition algorithm and training strategy present in this article can be well applied in subsea X-tree component recognition, and can effectively promote the development of intelligent subsea oil extraction projects.

AB The deep-sea autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is equipment of vital importance for ocean exploration, monitoring, and surveying. With a variable buoyancy system (VBS), AUV can achieve rising, diving, and hovering in the water column. This paper proposes a deep-sea AUV with an oil bladder type hydraulic VBS, which controls the oil flow rate with a proportional valve. However, the implementation of accurate depth control for AUV faces various challenges due to the varying water density with depth, the non-linear feature of the hydraulic system, and the disturbance from sea flows and currents. To tackle these problems, a third-order linear active disturbance rejection controller (LADRC) and its fuzzy adaptive version were designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink based on the state-space function of the proposed AUV system. Compared with the conventional PID controller, the simulation results indicate that the proposed LADRC controller shows strong robustness to disturbance, with other advantages including smaller steady-state error, overshoot, settling time, and response time. Moreover, the proposed fuzzy LADRC controller could further decrease the overshoot caused by the increasing target distance. The results prove that the designed depth controllers can meet the control requirements of the proposed deep-sea AUV.

AB The conventional direction of arrival (DOA) estimation methods are performed with multiple receiving channels. In this paper, a changeling DOA estimation problem is addressed in a different scenario with only one full-functional receiving channel. A new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm system using multiple lifted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is proposed for the DOA estimation. The UAV movement degrades the DOA estimation performance significantly, and the existing atomic norm minimization (ANM) methods cannot be used in the scenario with array perturbation. Specifically, considering the position perturbation of UAVs, a new atomic norm-based DOA estimation method is proposed, where an atomic norm is defined with the parameter of the position perturbation. Then, a customized semi-definite programming (SDP) method is derived to solve the atomic norm-based method, where different from the traditional SDP method, an additional transforming matrix is formulated. Moreover, a gradient descent method is applied to refine the estimated DOA and the position perturbation further. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves much better DOA estimation performance in the RIS-aided UAV swarm system with only one receiving channel than various benchmark schemes.

AB High-resolution bathymetry collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) along the flanks of three ridges of the accretionary prism offshore southwestern (SW) Taiwan revealed more than 650 elongated depressions in water depths ranging from 1155 to 1420 m. The depressions are between 12 and 129 m long, 5 to 70 m wide, and up 9 m deep at their center and shallowing downslope to about 1-m depth. Due to their shape in downslope cross section, they are termed comet-shaped depressions (CSD). The CSD occur in patches of more than 100 with densities of 53 to 98 CSD/km(2). In addition, seven topographic mounds were mapped and interpreted as pingos, which remotely operate vehicle (ROV) observations and sampling show to be covered with authigenic carbonate. These features overlie areas where multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) profiles show bottom simulating reflectors (BSR) and dipping strata extending from below the BSR to near the seafloor. We consider comet-shaped depression, a new type of pockmark, forms on a sloping seafloor where fluids expulsion occurred. We also suggest that the two types of distinctive geomorphic features are attributed to fluid venting which occurs at different rates, with the mounds developing slowly over time, but the CSD forming in discrete events perhaps associated with large earthquakes.

AB Recently, the problem of intent and trajectory prediction of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in urban traffic environments has got some attention from the intelligent transportation research community. One of the main challenges that make this problem even harder is the uncertainty exists in the actions of pedestrians in urban traffic environments, as well as the difficulty in inferring their end goals. In this paper, we are proposing a data-driven framework based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and the bidirectional recurrent neural network architecture (B-LSTM) for long-term prediction of VRUs' intention. We evaluated our framework on real-life datasets for agent behavior modeling in traffic environments, and it has achieved an overall average displacement error of only 2.93 and 4.12 pixels over 2.0 and 3.0 s ahead prediction horizons, respectively. In addition, we compared our framework against other baseline models based on sequence prediction models and planning-based approaches. We have outperformed these approaches with the lowest margin of average displacement error of more than 5 pixels. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed framework was evaluated on an additional vehicle-based video sequence dataset for path prediction of pedestrians and it continued to achieve robust results with higher generalization capabilities.

AB In visual-inertial odometry (VIO), inertial measurement unit (IMU) dead reckoning acts as the dynamic model for flight vehicles while camera vision extracts information about the surrounding environment and determines features or points of interest. With these sensors, the most widely used algorithm for estimating vehicle and feature states for VIO is an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The design of the standard EKF does not inherently allow for time offsets between the timestamps of the IMU and vision data. In fact, sensor-related delays that arise in various realistic conditions are at least partially unknown parameters. A lack of compensation for unknown parameters often leads to a serious impact on the accuracy of VIO systems and systems like them. To compensate for the uncertainties of the unknown time delays, this study incorporates parameter estimation into feature initialization and state estimation. Moreover, computing cross-covariance and estimating delays in online temporal calibration correct residual, Jacobian, and covariance. Results from flight dataset testing validate the improved accuracy of VIO employing latency compensated filtering frameworks. The insights and methods proposed here are ultimately useful in any estimation problem (e.g., multi-sensor fusion scenarios) where compensation for partially unknown time delays can enhance performance.

AB In this work, a virtual submerged floating operational system (VSFOS) based on parallel and serial robotic platforms is proposed. The primary aim behind its development lies in carrying out simulated underwater manipulation experiments in an easier and safer way. This VSFOS is consisted of a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) parallel platform, an ABB serial manipulator, an inertial sensor, and a real-time industrial computer. The 6-DOF platform is used to simulate the movement of an underwater vehicle, whose attitude is measured by the inertial sensor. The ABB manipulator, controlled by the real-time industrial computer, works as an operational tool to perform underwater manipulation tasks. In the control system architecture, software is developed to receive the data collected by the inertial sensor, to communicate and send instructions. Furthermore, the real-time status of the manipulator is displayed in this software. To validate the proposed system, two experiments have been conducted to test its performance. In the first experiment, the test is carried out to check the communication function of VSFOS, while in the second one, the manipulator is intended to follow the movement of the parallel platform and perform simulated operational task in the space. The obtained results from these two experiments show clearly the effectiveness and the performance of the proposed VSFOS.

AB The micro-morphological characteristics of PM2.5, collected in the Kuitun-Dushanzi petrochemical area of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, were studied using a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX). The individual particle types of PM2.5 were identified, including mineral particles (regular minerals and irregular minerals), spherical particles (coal-fired fly ash and some secondary particles), soot aggregates, and other particles (some particles remained unclassified). Factories, power plants, vehicle emissions, and road dust were major sources of PM2.5 in the Kuitun-Dushanzi petrochemical area. Vehicle exhaust and waste gas from a power plant were defined as primary sources of mineral particles. Wind speed in September which was higher than July during the sampling time leads to the lower concentration of regular mineral particles since high wind speeds would reduce the chance of secondary particle generation. As a high wind speed would also easily diffuse the fine particles, the coarse-grained mineral particles had the highest percentages in September; the chain-like soot aggregates and the compact soot aggregates were the majority of all kinds of particles. The sizes of various particles in July and September primarily ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mu m.

AB Low-cost GPS receivers provide geodetic positioning information using the NMEA protocol, usually with eight digits for latitude and nine digits for longitude. When these geodetic coordinates are converted into Cartesian coordinates, the positions fit in a quantization grid of some decimeters in size, the dimensions of which vary depending on the point of the terrestrial surface. The aim of this study is to reduce the quantization errors of some low-cost GPS receivers by using a Kalman filter. Kinematic tractor model equations were employed to particularize the filter, which was tuned by applying Monte Carlo techniques to eighteen straight trajectories, to select the covariance matrices that produced the lowest Root Mean Square Error in these trajectories. Filter performance was tested by using straight tractor paths, which were either simulated or real trajectories acquired by a GPS receiver. The results show that the filter can reduce the quantization error in distance by around 43%. Moreover, it reduces the standard deviation of the heading by 75%. Data suggest that the proposed filter can satisfactorily preprocess the low-cost GPS receiver data when used in an assistance guidance GPS system for tractors. It could also be useful to smooth tractor GPS trajectories that are sharpened when the tractor moves over rough terrain.

AB Driven by the rapid development of autonomous vehicles,ultrasensitivephotodetectors with high signal-to-noise ratio and ultraweak lightdetection capability are urgently needed. Due to its intriguing attributes,the emerging van der Waals material, indium selenide (In2Se3), has attracted extensive attention as an ultrasensitivephotoactive material. However, the lack of an effective photoconductivegain mechanism in individual In2Se3 inhibitsits further application. Herein, we propose a heterostructure photodetectorconsisting of an In2Se3 photoactive channel,a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) passivation layer, and a CsPb(Br/I)(3) quantum dot gain layer. This device manifests a signal-to-noiseratio of 2 x 10(6) with responsivity of 2994 A/W anddetectivity of 4.3 x 10(14) Jones. Especially, it enablesthe detection of weak light as low as 0.03 & mu;W/cm(2). These performance characteristics are ascribed to the interfacialengineering. In2Se3 and CsPb(Br/I)(3) with type-II band alignment promote the separation of photocarriers,while h-BN passivates the impurities on CsPb(Br/I)(3) andpromises a high-quality carrier transport interface. Furthermore,this device is successfully integrated into an automatic obstacleavoidance system, demonstrating promising application prospects inautonomous vehicles.

AB In this article, the single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) interception problem is analyzed and studied, and a new improved elastic potential field (EPF)-particle swarm-sliding window fusion strategy is proposed to achieve fast interception of underwater moving targets. First, the Sliding Window Fitting Prediction Method is used to fit and predict the trajectory of the target object. To improve the interception efficiency, the Elastic Predictive Interception Method is used to predict the position of the target object at the next moment, and the tracking point is replaced by the prediction point to intercept moving targets. Second, an expansion potential field method is proposed to replace the gradient potential field in the artificial potential field (APF), and the relatively appropriate influence range of the obstacle is found through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Then, the AUV converges gradually from the starting point to the target point through the stepping interception scheme. This method can make up for some shortcomings of the APF method and find a better interception path while making a rapid path planning decision. Simulation results show the interception effect of improved EPF under elastic prediction conditions, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a comparative analysis.

ID STRATEGY
AB To solve the problems of autonomous decision making and the cooperative operation of multiple unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) in beyond-visual-range air combat, this paper proposes an air combat decision-making method that is based on a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm. Firstly, the model of the unmanned combat aircraft is established on the simulation platform, and the corresponding maneuver library is designed. In order to simulate the real beyond-visual-range air combat, the missile attack area model is established, and the probability of damage occurring is given according to both the enemy and us. Secondly, to overcome the sparse return problem of traditional reinforcement learning, according to the angle, speed, altitude, distance of the unmanned combat aircraft, and the damage of the missile attack area, this paper designs a comprehensive reward function. Finally, the idea of centralized training and distributed implementation is adopted to improve the decision-making ability of the unmanned combat aircraft and improve the training efficiency of the algorithm. The simulation results show that this algorithm can carry out a multi-aircraft air combat confrontation drill, form new tactical decisions in the drill process, and provide new ideas for multi-UCAV air combat.

AB Millimeter-wave rotary-wing (RW) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) air-to-ground (A2G) links face unpredictable Doppler effect arising from the inevitable wobbling of RW UAV. Moreover, the time-varying channel characteristics during transmission lead to inaccurate channel estimation, which in turn results in the deteriorated bit error probability performance of the UAV A2G link. This paper studies the impact of mechanical wobbling on the Doppler effect of the millimeter-wave wireless channel between a hovering RW UAV and a ground node. Our contributions of this paper lie in: i) modeling the wobbling process of a hovering RW UAV; ii) developing an analytical model to derive the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF) for the millimeter-wave RW UAV A2G link in a closed-form expression; and iii) investigating how RW UAV wobbling impacts the Doppler effect on the millimeter-wave RW UAV A2G link. Numerical results show that different RW UAV wobbling patterns impact the amplitude and the frequency of ACF oscillation in the millimeter-wave RW UAV A2G link. For UAV wobbling, the temporal ACF decreases quickly and the impact of the Doppler effect is significant on the millimeter-wave A2G link.

AB Online time-optimal trajectory planning exists in a wide range of applications such as computer numerical control (CNC) manufacturing, robotics and autonomous vehicles. Generally, the methods to generate such time-parameterized trajectory can be categorized as offline methods and online methods. Offline methods tend to generate time-optimal trajectory while it is computationally prohibitive for high frequency real-time applications. Current online methods are computationally efficient but either deal with the sparse waypoint trajectories or sacrifice the time optimality a lot. This letter innovatively proposed a time-optimal switching trajectory index coordination (TOS-TIC) strategy to solve the online time-optimal planning problem for continuous multi-axis trajectories. The proposed method is able to generate time-optimal trajectory for continuous geometric paths while considering high order kinematic constraints. The time-optimality of the trajectory planned by TOS-TIC is nearly the same as the offline planned optimal results. Meanwhile, the proposed method is computationally efficient for online applications. The proposed TOS-TIC planning strategy is an universal approach and firstly able to solve the online time-optimal trajectory planning problem for constrained continuous multi-axis trajectories, which has excellent application prospect in modern automatic industry and intelligent robots/vehicles.

AB Autonomous selection of landing sites is an important capability of a mission when unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) face technical difficulties or adverse weather, especially in unknown environments. In order to build a better decision-making system for swarm UAVs landing, besides terrain safety, the global flight cost among individuals should be also considered during descent. However, the existing methods cannot solve these problems elegantly due to terrain uncertainty and optimization complexity. In this paper, we present an optimization method to tackle this issue based on point cloud integrating the coarse-to-fine manner and swarm intelligence model. Specifically, our method starts with a point cloud preprocessing module for sparse elevation estimation and robust path planning. In the coarse stage, a novel cost map is constructed by extracting only low-level features from the elevation map. Based on the optimum results of the coarse selection, the final landing sites are automatically generated and finely evaluated in terms of multiple 3D terrain factors. Finally, the landing model of swarm-UAVs is treated as an unbalanced assignment problem, which minimizes flight costs by incorporating terrain safety, fuel consumption, and path planning. Experimental evaluations on three different realworld scenario datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both normal operations and emergency situations.

TI Accuracy and Speed Improvement of Event Camera Motion Estimation Using a
   Bird's-Eye View Transformation

AB Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that have a high dynamic range and temporal resolution. This property enables motion estimation from textures with repeating patterns, which is difficult to achieve with RGB cameras. Therefore, motion estimation of an event camera is expected to be applied to vehicle position estimation. An existing method, called contrast maximization, is one of the methods that can be used for event camera motion estimation by capturing road surfaces. However, contrast maximization tends to fall into a local solution when estimating three-dimensional motion, which makes correct estimation difficult. To solve this problem, we propose a method for motion estimation by optimizing contrast in the bird's-eye view space. Instead of performing three-dimensional motion estimation, we reduced the dimensionality to two-dimensional motion estimation by transforming the event data to a bird's-eye view using homography calculated from the event camera position. This transformation mitigates the problem of the loss function becoming non-convex, which occurs in conventional methods. As a quantitative experiment, we created event data by using a car simulator and evaluated our motion estimation method, showing an improvement in accuracy and speed. In addition, we conducted estimation from real event data and evaluated the results qualitatively, showing an improvement in accuracy.

AB We investigate proactive eavesdropping with one half-duplex legitimate monitor (E) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled suspicious relaying systems, which consist of a suspicious transmitter (ST), a suspicious UAV-based relay (SU) and a suspicious destination (SD). Under this setup, we propose two jamming-assisted eavesdropping strategies, namely, "Eavesdrop-Then-Jam" (ETJ) and "Jam-Then-Eavesdrop" (JTE), to maximize the eavesdropping throughput of E. Specifically, for ETJ, E first eavesdrops the suspicious signal of the ST in the ST-SU phase and then jams the SD in the SU-SD phase; for JTE, E first jams the SU in the ST-SU phase and then eavesdrops the suspicious signal of the SU in the SU-SD phase. However, in both strategies, as the jamming power of E (independent variable) changes, the SU can also adaptively adjust its deployment (dependent variable) to maximize the benefit of the suspicious system. Facing this challenge, we can only employ the undesirable exhaustive search over both the independent and dependent variables to achieve the optimal solution. To decrease the complexity, we further derive a tight approximation of the Lambert function and then develop easy-to-implement algorithms to find the sub-optimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies compared to conventional passive eavesdropping.

AB This study presents a three dimensional guidance control to intercept a manoeuvring evader. In this study, the authors introduce passive sensing systems, which can move to track the evader, so that the evader cannot escape from the mobile sensing systems. Passive sensing systems composed of multiple aerial vehicles, called leaders, are considered. This study utilizes multiple leaders and one interceptor, which can localize themselves. The interceptor is guided to chase the evader, so that the line connecting the interceptor and the evader does not rotate. The leaders acquire 3-D angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements of the evader to estimate the evader's 3-D global coordinate in real time. The leaders are controlled, so that they maximize the information gain from AOA measurements of the evader. The leaders approach the estimated evader, while decreasing the estimate error by changing the formation adaptively. Based on the estimated evader, the interceptor's guidance law is calculated utilizing a leader's on-board computer and is transmitted to the interceptor in almost real time. To the best of our knowledge, this study is novel in developing multi-agent control to chase a manoeuvring evader based on leaders' AOA measurements. The effectiveness of the multi-agent control is shown under computer simulations.

AB Autonomous navigation of unmanned vehicles in forests is a challenging task. In such environments, due to the canopies of the trees, information from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can be degraded or even unavailable. Also, because of the large number of obstacles, a previous detailed map of the environment is not practical. In this paper, we solve the complete navigation problem of an aerial robot in a sparse forest, where there is enough space for the flight and the GNSS signals can be sporadically detected. For localization, we propose a state estimator that merges information from GNSS, Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRS), and odometry based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors. In our LiDAR-based odometry solution, the trunks of the trees are used in a feature-based scan matching algorithm to estimate the relative movement of the vehicle. Our method employs a robust adaptive fusion algorithm based on the unscented Kalman filter. For motion control, we adopt a strategy that integrates a vector field, used to impose the main direction of the movement for the robot, with an optimal probabilistic planner, which is responsible for obstacle avoidance. Experiments with a quadrotor equipped with a planar LiDAR in an actual forest environment is used to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB The decision-making behavior of drivers during the driving process is influenced by various factors, including road conditions, traffic situations, weather conditions, and so on. However, our understanding and quantification of the driving environment are still very limited, which not only increases the risk of driving but also hinders the deployment of autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, this study attempts to transform drivers' visual perception into machine vision perception. Specifically, the study provides a detailed decomposition of the elements constituting weather and proposes three environmental quantification indicators: visibility brightness, visibility clarity, and visibility obstruction rate. These indicators help us to describe and quantify the driving environment more accurately. Based on these indicators, a visual-based environmental quantification method is further proposed to better understand and interpret the driving environment. Additionally, based on drivers' visual perception, this study extensively analyzes the impact of environmental factors on driver behavior. A cognitive assessment model is established to evaluate drivers' cognitive abilities in different environments. The effectiveness and accuracy of the model are validated through driver simulation experiments, thereby establishing a communication bridge between the driving environment and driver behavior. This research achievement enables us to better understand the decision-making behavior of drivers in specific environments and provides some references for the development of intelligent driving technology.

AB This paper presents a combinable wireless power transfer (WPT) system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with autonomous and adaptive charging of extensible capacity. By combining multiple transmission modules in parallel to power the UAV, the charging capacity of the system is dramatically enhanced and is adaptive to multiple power ratings with more flexibility. Meanwhile, the combination provides an approach for the system to improve reliability as each module can be operated independently. The mapping relationship between the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver (Rx) is investigated to estimate the amplitude and phase of output currents from the primary side. An active current ripple mitigation scheme based on real-time current estimation is proposed to regulate the Rx currents from the primary side and mitigate the synthetic current ripple without massive sensors onboard, by utilizing the interleaving technique, the output can achieve current ripple cancellation. And the experiment of a scaled-down prototype verifies that the output power of the combinable configuration is boosted up by 145.5% compared with that of a single module, meanwhile, the active ripple mitigation can indeed ameliorate the charging performance and prolong the battery life, the synthetic ripple amplitude is weakened remarkably by 79.06% whereas the efficiency is measured 5% higher than the system without ripple mitigation.

AB As the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) continue to be deployed for various mission-critical data acquisition, localized computing on the drone-acquired data for efficient analysis, without significantly impacting the limited resources on board the drone, has emerged as a formidable research challenge. In this article, we address this issue with a natural resource management use-case whereby early forest-fire detection using the popular convolutional neural network (CNN)-based inference models are considered in the drone. This can lead to resource exhaustion. To alleviate this, we propose a lightweight hierarchical artificial intelligence (AI) framework, which adaptively switches between a simple machine learning-based model and an advanced deep learning-based CNN model. Then, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to model the trade-off between forest-fire detection accuracy and computational performance. We obtain the Pareto-optimal solution of the formulated problem by optimizing a new hyperparameter (i.e., the confidence score threshold) by employing the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for the whole model. Thus, we alleviate the computational burden while retaining a high level of detection accuracy. Finally, based on a real dataset, empirical results are reported to evaluate the performance of our proposal in terms of its lightweight features.

In the last few years, the usage of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has eased the workload and risks of such interventions. To automate these tasks, the AUVs have to gather the information of their surroundings, interpret it and make decisions based on it. The two main perception modalities used at close range are laser and video. In this paper, we propose the usage of a deep neural network to recognise pipes and valves in multiple underwater scenarios, using 3D RGB point cloud information provided by a stereo camera. We generate a diverse and rich dataset for the network training and testing, assessing the effect of a broad selection of hyperparameters and values. Results show F1-scores of up to 97.2% for a test set containing images with similar characteristics to the training set and up to 89.3% for a secondary test set containing images taken at different environments and with distinct characteristics from the training set. This work demonstrates the validity and robust training of the PointNet neural in underwater scenarios and its applicability for AUV intervention tasks.

AB Understanding traffic scene images taken from vehicle mounted cameras is important for high-level tasks, such as advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. It is a challenging problem due to large variations under different weather or illumination conditions. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic scene understanding from a cross-domain perspective. We attempt to understand the traffic scene from images taken from the same location but under different weather or illumination conditions (e.g., understanding the same traffic scene from images on a rainy night with the help of images taken on a sunny day). To this end, we propose a dense correspondence-based transfer learning (DCTL) approach, which consists of three main steps: 1) extracting deep representations of traffic scene images via a fine-tuned convolutional neural network; 2) constructing compact and effective representations via cross-domain metric learning and subspace alignment for cross-domain retrieval; and 3) transferring the annotations from the retrieved best matching image to the test image based on cross-domain dense correspondences and a probabilistic Markov random field. To verify the effectiveness of our DCTL approach, we conduct extensive experiments on a challenging data set, which contains 1 828 images from six weather or illumination conditions.

AB This paper deals with the interesting problem of trajectory tracking of an underactuated hovercraf. This system is difficult to control because it exhibits second order nonholonomic restrictions on its movement. In order to solve the control problem the dynamics of the system is discomposed in two subsystems (one for position and another for orientation) and a nonlinear control law based on two nonlinear cascaded controllers is designed. On one hand the outer, loop computes the forces that are necessary to track the spatial trajectory F-x and F-y, in the inertial frame. Based on this forces, the reference for the orientation psi(c) is computed and it is feedback to the inner loop. On the other hand, the inner loop tries to converge the orientation to the reference psi(c) given by the outer loop. Both controllers are designed taking into account saturation of the actuators. In fact the main result of this paper shows that if the reference trajectory is given properly it is possible to avoid saturation of the actuators. With adequate selection, global asymptotic stability of the tracking error under the proposed control law is theoretically demonstrated. In addition simulations are made in order to analyze the performance of the control law and the practical meaning of the theoretical results.

AB As part of a NASA dryden autonomous formation flight program for improved drag reduction of multiple F/A-18 aircraft, a new instrument, the formation flight instrumentation system (FFIS), for the precise estimation of the relative position, velocity, and attitude between two moving aircraft without the aid of ground-based instruments, was developed. The FFIS uses a global position system (GPS) receiver and an inertial navigation sensor (INS) instrumentation package on each aircraft combined with a wireless communication system for sharing measurements between vehicles. An extended Kalman filter structure blends the outputs of each GPS/INS in a distributed manner so as to maximize the accuracy of the relative state estimates. Differential carrier phase GPS measurements are used to provide high accuracy relative range measurements to the filtering algorithm. A multiple hypothesis Wald test for estimating the integer ambiguity between the two moving vehicles was developed as part of this project. The FFIS was tested in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HIL Sim) before being tested in actual F-18 flight tests. Test results validated the FFIS performance. Flight test results showed that the Wald test accurately estimates the integer ambiguity and that relative range estimates using least squares provide accurate position estimates with a mean of approximately 7 cm and a standard deviation of 13 cm.

AB Reliable and flexible emergency communication is a crucial challenge for search and rescue in the circumstance of disasters, specifically for the situation when base stations (BS) are no longer functioning. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided networking is becoming a prominent solution to establish emergency networks, which also should be energy-efficient. The Terahertz (THz) frequency-enabled communication system is also envisioned as enabling technology for Sixth-Generation (6G) communication systems. To this end, we consider a THz UAV network for our investigation. In this article, we study energy-efficiency (EE) analysis for UAV-Aided Terahertz-Enabled 6G Networks. The metric coverage probability (CP) is adopted as EE analysis given the QoS requirement. Using stochastic geometry tools, we derive a CP. Afterward, considering that CP, we study a network EE optimization method. Borrowing the idea from the existing literature, we reformulate the actual EE optimization problem into a solvable Dinkelbach nonlinear fractional programming. However, the optimization problem turns into a nondeterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard) problem. Eventually, we transform that NP-hard problem into a convex optimization problem using the ConCave-Convex procedure (CCCP), which is more tractable and feasible to find a solution for the optimization.

ID RECOGNITION; LOCATION
AB The DIFIS project has proposed a new solution for the immediate intervention directly on tanker wrecks so as to contain any leakages and prevent eventual pollution. The method could be extended also to oil well-blow-out cases such as the recent accident in the Gulf of Mexico. The DIFIS deployment typically requires the use of ROVs and dedicated dynamic-positioning ships that increase the cost significantly and make the operations weather-dependent. Eventual AUV use would result in much more efficient and flexible deployment procedures. The scenario studied here consists of a hook-grasping task that is part of the DIFIS mooring procedure. The overall objective is to automate certain processes enabling the use of AUVs or, at least, enhancing the currently foreseen ROV operations. A two-step method is presented consisting of a genetic algorithm for the determination of the optimum docking pose for the vehicle, and a particle filter algorithm that runs on a later stage for the tactile localisation of the hook. The method proposed is rather generic and can be extended to several steps of the DIFIS Deployment procedure, or even to other AUV intervention missions in a semi-structured environment. Results from the two algorithms are also presented and discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The real-time high-resolution target detection in radar applications has increased the demand for photonic radar systems due to their higher bandwidth and faster processing capabilities over conventional microwave radar. Additionally, photonic-based radar technology can revolutionize the limited performance of conventional microwave radar caused by various atmospheric attenuations. This article presents a frequency-modulated continuous-wave photonic radar system using coherent detection. The performance of the proposed system is theoretically investigated under the effect of various real-time atmospheric weather attenuations and the influence of solar background noise, which is further verified on the simulation platform. This study is conducted under different atmospheric weather conditions, such as clear, haze, and fog, to highlight the practical limitation of free-space links in the presence of solar background noise. The detected signal at different target ranges with and without solar noise is measured and then compared in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the impact of solar noise on the system performance when the Sun is under different sky conditions and zenithal angles is also analyzed. The results presented here provide insights into designing photonic radar systems for practical applications like autonomous vehicle radar systems, self-traffic control, and navigation.

AB Maneuverability is one of the most important performance characteristics of submarines. Before constructing a designed AUV, the hydrodynamic model can be used to determine its inherent motion behavior. Standard submarine motion equations (SSME) are the most widely used hydrodynamic model in which more than 100 coefficients must be estimated. These coefficients are usually determined through conventional experimental and analytical methods. The most common method today is captive model tests, but the separately determining approach is time-consuming and makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the model. This paper proposes an efficient approach for estimating hydrodynamic coefficients (HCs) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Instead of captive model tests, the proposed virtual free-running test can provide all the information required to determine all the HCs in only one simulation. Kalman filter estimation methods are used to determine the HCs. Sensitivity analysis and statistical results show that in a typical AUV maneuvering, SSME can be simplified. The final simplified equations of motion have much fewer components than the original model while fitting accuracy remains. Using the experimental data of the well-known DARPA-SUBOFF underwater vehicle, it is shown the proposed virtual free-running and the simplification approaches are effective and reliable.

These biomimetic devices are able to operate very efficiently, offering desirable levels of thrust required for the propulsion of small vessels or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and can be used for the standalone propulsion of small vessels or for augmenting ship propulsion in waves, alleviating the generation of noise and its adverse effects on sea life, particularly on marine mammals. In this work, we consider the generation of noise by flapping foils arranged in the neighborhood of the above vessels including the scattering effects by the hull, which, in addition to free-surface and seabed effects, significantly contribute to the modification of the characteristics of the acoustic field. A Boundary Element Method (BEM) is developed to treat the 3D scattering problem in the frequency domain forced by monopole and dipole source terms associated with the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) equation. Numerical results are presented in selected cases illustrating that the hull geometry and acoustic properties, as well as the sea surface and seabed effects, are important for the determination of the directionality of the generated noise and significantly affect the propagation in the underwater ocean environment.

AB In the near future, it's expected that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will become ubiquitous surrogates for human-crewed vehicles in the field of border patrol, package delivery, etc. Therefore, many three-dimensional (3D) navigation algorithms based on different techniques, e.g., model predictive control (MPC)-based, navigation potential field-based, sliding mode control-based, and reinforcement learning-based, have been extensively studied in recent years to help achieve collision-free navigation. The vast majority of the 3D navigation algorithms perform well when obstacles are sparsely spaced, but fail when facing crowd-spaced obstacles, which causes a potential threat to UAV operations. In this paper, a 3D vision cone-based reactive navigation algorithm is proposed to enable small quadcopter UAVs to seek a path through crowd-spaced 3D obstacles to the destination without collisions. The proposed algorithm is simulated in MATLAB with different 3D obstacles settings to demonstrate its feasibility and compared with the other two existing 3D navigation algorithms to exhibit its superiority. Furthermore, a modified version of the proposed algorithm is also introduced and compared with the initially proposed algorithm to lay the foundation for future work.

AB Possibilities to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly growing. With the development of battery technologies, communication, navigation, surveillance, and autonomous systems in general, many UAVs are expected to operate at relatively low altitudes. Thus, the problem of UAV noise impact on human health and well-being will be more pronounced. In this paper, we conducted noise measurements of two UAVs of different performance (quadrotor and hexarotor) in flying up and down, hovering, and overflight procedures. Respondents of good hearing who were confirmed by audiogram measurement and had participated in the survey during UAV noise measurement gave their subjective assessments on the UAV noise perception. UAV noise measurements and subjective respondents' assessments were analysed and related. UAV noise analysis showed that the parameters measured at the same measurement point for the hexarotor were higher than those for the quadrotor in flying up and down and flying-over procedures. Low frequency noise was present in the noise spectrum of both drones. Participants were able to distinguish between the noise of UAVs and had a generally more negative experience with the hexarotor. Regardless of the noise perception, more than 80% of the respondents believe there are more pros than cons for UAV introduction into everyday life.

DE Active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC); authority allocation;

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; INTERFACE
AB Due to the critical defects of techniques in fully autonomous vehicles, man-machine cooperative driving is still of great significance in today's transportation system. Unlike the previous shared control structure, this paper introduces a double loop structure which is applied to indirect shared steering control between driver and automation. In contrast to the tandem indirect shared control, the parallel indirect shared control put the authority allocation system of steering angle into the framework to allocate the corresponding weighting coefficients reasonably and output the final desired steering angle according to the current deviation of vehicle and the accuracy of steering angles. Besides, the active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) is also added in the frame in order to track the desired steering angle fleetly and accurately as well as restrain the internal and external disturbances effectively which including the steering friction torque, wind speed and ground interference etc. Eventually, we validated the advantages of double loop framework through three sets of double lane change and slalom experiments, respectively. Exactly as we expected, the simulation results show that the double loop structure can effectively reduce the lateral displacement error caused by the driver or the controller, significantly improve the tracking precision and keep great performance in trajectory tracking characteristics when driving errors occur in one of driver and controller.

ID ASYMPTOTIC TRACKING; SYSTEMS
AB A position tracking control system is developed for a rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV) using robust integral of the signum of the error (RISE) feedback and neural network (NN) feedforward terms. While the typical NN-based adaptive controller guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded stability, the proposed NN-based adaptive control system guarantees semi-global asymptotic tracking of the RUAV using the RISE feedback control. The developed control system consists of an inner-loop and outer-loop. The inner-loop control system determines the attitude of the RUAV based on an adaptive NN-based linear dynamic model inversion (LDI) method with the RISE feedback. The outer-loop control system generates the attitude reference corresponding to the given position, velocity, and heading references, and controls the altitude of the RUAV by the LDI method with the RISE feedback. The linear model for the LDI is obtained by a linearization of the nonlinear RUAV dynamics during hover flight. Asymptotic tracking of the attitude and altitude states is proven by a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, and a numerical simulation is performed on the nonlinear RUAV model to validate the effectiveness of the controller.

AB A speedy and reliable system detecting safe waters is essential to enable autonomous navigation of unmanned surface vessels (USVs). However, existing detection methods are prone to misidentifying trees and buildings on river banks as water and blurring water boundaries due to reflections from the water surface. This study proposes a dual-task network architecture for boundary-aware and waters segmentation(BAWS network) to address the above issues. The BAWS network consists of an encoder module, a decoder module and a boundary-aware module. The attention refinement module (ARM) focuses on water information to improve water detection. A feature fusion module (FFM) is introduced better to integrate visual features with boundary features in the decoder. In addition, boundary-aware modules and boundary loss functions are proposed to force the network to focus on detailed information about the boundary of the waters. To validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, this study was tested using three different types of typical inland river datasets. The results show that the method achieves a maximum of 97.19% mean intersection ratio (MIoU) and 0.776 root mean square error (RMSE) of the boundary on the USVInland dataset. This indicates that the method can produce clearer predictions at the watershed boundary and improve the performance of watershed segmentation with good generalisation performance.

AB In this paper, we aim to design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based control solution to navigating a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fly around an unexplored target area under partial observation, which serves as Mobile Base Stations (MBSs) providing optimal communication coverage for the ground mobile users. To handle the information loss caused by the partial observability, we introduce a novel network architecture named Deep Recurrent Graph Network (DRGN), which could obtain extra spatial information through graph-convolution based inter-UAV communication, and utilize historical features with a recurrent unit. Based on DRGN and maximum-entropy learning, we propose a stochastic DRL policy named Soft Deep Recurrent Graph Network (SDRGN). In SDRGN, a heuristic reward function is elaborated, which is based on the local information of each UAV instead of the global information; thus, SDRGN reduces the training cost and enables distributed online learning. We conducted extensive experiments to design the structure of DRGN and examine the performance of SDRGN. The simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms four state-of-the-art DRL-based approaches and three heuristic baselines, and demonstrate the scalability, transferability, robustness, and interpretability of SDRGN.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) maps are used extensively in a variety of applications, from air and noise pollution modelling to location-based services such as 3D mapping-aided Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), and positioning and navigation for emergency service personnel, unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous vehicles. However, the financial cost associated with creating and updating 3D maps using the current state-of-the-art methods such as laser scanning and aerial photogrammetry are prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, researchers have proposed using GNSS signals to create 3D maps. This paper advances that family of methods by proposing and implementing a novel technique that avoids the difficult step of directly classifying GNSS signals into line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight classes by utilising edge detection techniques adapted from computer vision. This prevents classification biases and increases the range of environments in which GNSS-based 3D mapping methods can be accurately deployed. Being based on the patterns of blockage and attenuation of GNSS signals that are freely and globally available to receive by many mobile phones, makes the proposed technique a free, scalable and accessible solution. This paper also identifies some key indicators affecting data collection scalability and efficiency of the 3D mapping solution.

AB Deep Q-network (DQN) is one of the standard methods to solve the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning problem. However, the way agent deepens its cognition of the environment through frequent random trial-and-error leads to slow convergence. This paper proposes an optimized DQN with Artificial Potential Field (APF) as prior knowledge called B-APFDQN for path planning. Replacing the traditional neural network which has only one Q-value output with a multi-output neural network to promote the training process in combination with APF. Furthermore, a SA- $\varepsilon $ -greedy algorithm that can automatically adjust the stochastic exploration frequency with steps and successes is proposed in order to prevent the agent from falling into local optimum. We remove the nodes that do not affect the path connectivity and apply the B-spline algorithm to make the path shorter and smoother. Simulation experiments show that the proposed B-APFDQN algorithm performs better than the classical DQN, has a strong ability to avoid falling into local optimum, and the obtained paths are smooth and shorter, which proves the effectiveness of B-APFDQN in the UAV path planning problem.

AB Service caching refers to caching the necessary programs or/and the related databases for performing computational tasks at edge servers, which has been considered to save both computation and communication resources in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. In this paper, we investigate computation service caching in a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled MEC system, where each UAV equipped with an edge server acts as an aerial computing platform to serve the ground devices. Furthermore, the UAVs can serve the devices cooperatively through the provided computing and caching resources. Aiming at minimizing the maximum task completion latency among all devices, we formulate a joint service caching, task offloading, communication and computation resource allocation, as well as UAV placement optimization problem, while guaranteeing the energy budget of all devices and UAVs. The problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem, and we decompose it into four sub-problems, and then propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to obtain near-optimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve lower task completion latency than other baselines while guaranteeing better fairness among all devices.

AB Limited computing resources of internet-of-things (IoT) nodes incur prohibitive latency in processing input data. This triggers new research opportunities toward task offloading systems where edge servers handle intensive computations of IoT devices. Deploying the computing servers at existing base stations may not be sufficient to support IoT nodes operating in a harsh environment. This requests mobile edge servers to be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that provide on-demand mobile edge computing (MEC) services. Time-varying offloading demands and mobility of UAVs need a joint design of the optimization variables for all time instances. Therefore, an online decision mechanism is essential for UAV-aided MEC networks. This article presents an overview of recent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches where decisions about UAVs and IoT nodes are taken in an online manner. Specifically, joint optimization over task offloading, resource allocation, and UAV mobility is addressed from the DRL perspective. For the decentralized implementation, a multi-agent DRL method is proposed where multiple intelligent UAVs cooperatively determine their computations and communication policies without central coordination. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed decentralized learning strategy is superior to existing DRL solutions. The proposed framework sheds light on the viability of the decentralized DRL techniques in designing self-organizing IoT networks.

   Underwater vehicle control surfaces motor control.
   Adaptive and learning methods are proposed and compared to control DC motors actuating control surfaces of unmanned underwater vehicles. One type of adaption method referred to as model-following is based on algebraic design, and it is analyzed in conjunction with parameter estimation methods such as recursive least squares, extended least squares, and batch least squares. Another approach referred to as deterministic artificial intelligence uses the process dynamics defined by physics to control output to track a necessarily specified autonomous trajectory (sinusoidal versions implemented here). In addition, one instantiation of deterministic artificial intelligence uses 2-norm optimal feedback learning of parameters to modify the control signal, while another instantiation is presented with proportional plus derivative adaption. Model-following and deterministic artificial intelligence are simulated, and respective performance metrics for transient response and input tracking are evaluated and compared. Deterministic artificial intelligence outperformed the model-following approach in minimal peak transient value by a percent range of approximately 2-70%, but model-following achieved at least 29% less error in input tracking than deterministic artificial intelligence. This result is surprising and not in accordance with the recently published literature, and the explanation of the difference is theorized to be efficacy with discretized implementations.

ID TIDAL CURRENTS; AUV NAVIGATION
AB The prediction of ocean currents is essential for the path planning and control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. Regional physics-based forecast models provide valid predictions but are too computationally expensive for real-time prediction necessary for AUV navigation. While vehicle sensors can measure the spatial evolution of currents, temporal prediction remains an open problem as existing data-driven models with real-time capabilities have only been shown to work at locations where data have been used to develop the model. We propose in this paper two predictive tools using deep learning techniques, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network and a Transformer, to perform real-time in-situ prediction of ocean currents at any location. A data set from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is split in two distinct sets to train and test the models. We show that the LSTM and the Transformer have an averaged Normalized Root Mean Squared Error respectively of 0.10 and 0.11 over all test sites with a standard deviation respectively of 0.024 and 0.031. Comparisons with Harmonic Method predictions at various locations in the territorial sea of the United States show that both models provide state-of-the-art accuracy without having been trained with data from these sites.

AB With the exponential increase in the number of smart devices and the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) over the last two decades, a huge demand for computational and storage resources has been observed. This trend has supported a vision toward exploring a novel set of resources beyond the traditional distributed computing paradigms. To deliver this vision, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have garnered a great deal of attention due to a number of vehicles on the roads that can be served as the prospective computational resources in the form of processing and storage units. Given the perspective of resources not being used collectively, we propose volunteer computing based VANET (VCBV) architecture, aimed at utilizing the surplus vehicular resources to deal with the future computational requirements of varied applications including autonomous driving, infotainment systems, healthcare services, and complex simulations. In this context, this study investigates the different aspects of possible integration of VANET and volunteer computing (VC). For this purpose, we describe the system model of VCBV by identifying the major components and their roles. Furthermore, a comprehensive taxonomic classification of VCBV is presented. Moreover, some prospective applications and multiple VCBV scenarios are also envisioned. Finally, a set of challenges is indicated that must be addressed by future studies to fully realize the potential of the proposed architecture.

AB We propose an innovative, integrated solution to path planning, path following, and obstacle avoidance that is suitable both for 2D and 3D navigation. The proposed method takes as input a generic curve connecting a start and a goal position, and is able to find a corresponding path from start to goal in a maze-like environment even in the absence of global information, it guarantees convergence to the path with kinematic control, and finally avoids locally sensed obstacles without becoming trapped in deadlocks. This is achieved by computing a closed-form expression in which the control variables are a continuous function of the input curve, the robot's state, and the distance of all the locally sensed obstacles. Specifically, we introduce a novel formalism for describing the path in two and three dimensions, as well as a computationally efficient method for path deformation (based only on local sensor readings) that is able to find a path to the goal even when such path cannot be produced through continuous deformations of the original. The article provides formal proofs of all the properties above, as well as simulated results in a simulated environment with a wheeled robot, an underwater vehicle, and a multicopter.

AB The ability of an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle to navigate and fly precisely determines its utility and performance. The current navigation systems are highly dependent on the global positioning system and are prone to error because of global positioning system signal outages. However, advancements in onboard processing have enabled inertial navigation algorithms to perform well during short global positioning system outages. In this article, we propose an intelligent optical flow-based algorithm combined with Kalman filters to provide the navigation capability during global positioning system outages and global positioning system-denied environments. Traditional optical flow measurement uses block matching for motion vector calculation that makes the measurement task computationally expensive and slow. We propose the application of an artificial bee colony-based block matching technique for faster optical flow measurements. To effectively fuse optical flow data with inertial sensors output, we employ a modified form of extended Kalman filter. The modifications make the filter less noisy by utilizing the redundancy of sensors. We have achieved an accuracy of similar to 95% for all non-global positioning system navigation during our simulation studies. Our real-world experiments are in agreement with the simulation studies when effects of wind are taken into consideration.

AB A electric vehicle (EV) needs high drive system efficiency, low motor noise and limp-home capability of the traction drive when there is a component failure. A dual inverter fed open winding interior permanentmagnet synchronousmotor (DIF-OWIPMSM) drive system satisfied all the above needs. In this paper, new algorithms for the inverter power device fault detection and fail-safe action strategy for the DIF-OW-IPMSM drive system in the entire speed region of the EV are proposed to prove its high reliability. The new algorithms for the inverter power device fault detection are derived from the sensed three phase fault currents and their subsequent analytical and logical processing within the micro-computer. The fail-safe action strategy is derived such that the unbalanced three phase fault currents using the dual inverters are quickly restored to balanced three phase currents using a single inverter and hence, the effect of the vibration of the traction motor due to undesired torque ripple during inverter device fault condition is kept minimum. The proposed new algorithms are verified by suitable simulation and experimental results, and the safe limp-home capability of the DIF-OW-IPMSM drive system is demonstrated.

AB In recent years, safety operation issues related to the autonomous flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular research and development topics worldwide. Among all UAV applications, multiple UAV-related applications are emerging due to the integration of UAVs into 6G networks, which is an important topic for next-generation wireless communication systems. For multiple UAV applications, flight safety among UAVs is the most significant issue. Therefore, collision avoidance for UAVs has become an emerging topic in UAV-related research. In the past, although many UAV collision avoidance methods have been proposed, there is still a probability of other problems, such as no possible avoidance route and unmanaged UAVs that are without centralized control, which both result in an unpredictable risk of collisions. In this study, we investigate the current existing methods and propose novel collision avoidance methods based on the elastic collision principle. To verify the performance of the proposed methods, we also conduct simulations in this paper to demonstrate their effectiveness. From the simulation results, it can be seen that the proposed methods can effectively perform collision avoidance for multiple UAVs. Specifically, using the proposed methods, all UAVs can reach their destination points within reasonable time resources without any collision, validating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient velocity control algorithm for a large number of UAVs based on mean field games. In particular, we first formulate the velocity control problem for a large number of UAVs as a differential game, where we jointly consider the energy consumption, channel capacity, and obstacle avoidance in the cost function. Meanwhile, the state dynamics are used to describe the motion of UAVs under the influence of the wind. Then we derive the corresponding mean field game for a large number of UAVs and solve it with the G-prox primal dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method using its underlying variational primal dual structure. Scalability analysis shows that the computational complexity of the proposed method is unrelated to the number of UAVs. Based on the PDHG method, we conduct a comprehensive experiment where we analytically show the fast convergence of our energy-efficient velocity control algorithm by the convergence of the residual errors of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation. The experiment also shows that a large number of UAVs can avoid obstacles and provide communication services for the search and rescue team while minimizing their energy consumption.

AB This paper presents a formation control method for multiple underwater vehicles that combines artificial potential field and virtual structure. Facing the problem of attitude adjustment in the deployment of AUV and the detection of undulating seabed terrain, a method of finite-time position and attitude tracking control method combined with artificial potential field and virtual structure is presented. We complete the guidance and control in the space of the special Euclidean group of rigid body motions which is SE(3) under the framework of geometric mechanics. The control method we give makes the difference between the trajectory of the AUV and the expected trajectory stabilize to zero in finite time. After that, we give a control method on the attitude, so that the designated pointing vector in the body fixed frame of the AUV converges to the desired direction within a finite-time. This control method of combining artificial potential field and virtual structure can ensure that the AUVs avoid collisions with each other during the dive, and form and change the formation after reaching the set depth. A formation travel plan based on the distance to the seabed for attitude transformation was designed. Simulations are carried out to verify the feasibility.

AB The inclusion of photovoltaic (PV) technologies add extra functionalities in a building by replacing the conventional structural material and harnessing benign electricity aesthetically from PV. Building integration (BI) and building attached/applied (BA) are the two techniques to include PV in a building. Currently, first, and second-generation PV technologies are already included for BIPV and BAPV application in the form of wall, roof, and window whereas third generation PVs are under rigours exploration to find their potential suitability. To alleviate enhanced temperature from both BIPV and BAPV, active and passive cooling can be introduced, however passive techniques are influential in trimming down the temperature for retrofit building. Shading from snow, dust cover and nearby building can be an obstacle for BIPV/BAPV application. The hydrophobic (icephobic) self-cleaning coating is suited for snow covering PV while hydrophobic and hydrophilic are both applicable for anti-soiling. Electric vehicles, autonomous switchable glazing, low heat loss glazing and lightweight BIPV are the different future application for PV in BI and BA integration. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The advancement in the field of transportation has been accelerating with policymakers shifting the focus towards autonomous and connected vehicles. Being an important component of the IoT infrastructure, a majority of its deployment is still based on the results of conventional approaches and measurement practice. Factors and the best conditions are identified using trial-and-error approaches which are not entirely accurate. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the influences that affect the performance of the windshield tag and developing a prediction model based on the most influential factor has been presented in this paper. In addition, two machine learning algorithms are proposed to achieve the objective of the paper. Linear regression analysis provides a reliable estimation of the RSSI levels of the windshield tag from all the selected location. The second proposed algorithm is based on the logistic regression model which provides an accurate prediction model based on tag readability by the reader. The predicted tag detectability model coupled with the RSSI level estimation model gives a complete overview of the behavior of the RFID tag when deployed on the windshield of the vehicle. This will serve as a guideline for the RFID transportation application which may extensively rely on RFID as a part of the loT transformation.

AB Healthy coral reefs play a vital role in maintaining biodiversity in tropical marine ecosystems. Remote imaging techniques have facilitated the scientific investigations of these intricate ecosystems, particularly at depths beyond 10mwhere SCUBA diving techniques are not time or cost efficient. With millions of digital images of the seafloor collected using remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), manual annotation of these data by marine experts is a tedious, repetitive, and time-consuming task. It takes 10-30 min for a marine expert to meticulously annotate a single image. Automated technology to monitor the health of the oceans would allow for transformational ecological outcomes by standardizing methods to detect and identify species. This paper aims to automate the analysis of large available AUVimagery by developing advanced deep learning tools for rapid and large-scale automatic annotation of marine coral species. Such an automated technology would greatly benefit marine ecological studies in terms of cost, speed, and accuracy. To this end, we propose a deep learning based classificationmethod for coral reefs and report the application of the proposed technique to the automatic annotation of unlabeled mosaics of the coral reef in the Abrolhos Islands, W. A., Australia. Our proposed method automatically quantified the coral coverage in this region and detected a decreasing trend in coral population, which is in line with conclusions drawn by marine ecologists.

AB This paper presents an integrated navigation algorithm for deep-sea Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) based on M-estimation and heavy-tailed noise to solve the problems of inaccurate noise models in traditional navigation algorithms for deep-sea AUVs, significant delays in Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) acoustic positioning, and the inability to estimate deep-sea ocean currents. The algorithm encompasses four techniques: (1) A Strap-down Inertial Navigation Systems (SINS)/USBL integrated navigation algorithm based on M-estimation and heavy-tailed noise models. (2)Estimation and compensation of USBL acoustic delay positioning errors. (3)Estimation and compensation of steady or slowly varying ocean currents. (4)Considering the distance between the submerged vehicle and the center of the earth and the variation of gravity acceleration with depth. The first and second techniques are the innovations of this article, which can effectively improve the USBL calibration accuracy with only a slight increase in computational complexity. The significant positioning error caused by long-term voyages of large-depth AUVs in the middle layer of the ocean can be effectively suppressed using the third and fourth technologies. The results of the semi-physical simulation and lake experiment demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to significantly improve navigation accuracy and robustness in complex underwater environments compared to conventional methods.

AB Accurate localization constitutes a fundamental building block of any autonomous system. In this article, we focus on stereo cameras and present a novel approach, dubbed SOFT2, that is currently the highest-ranking algorithm on the KITTI scoreboard. SOFT2 relies on the constraints imposed by the epipolar geometry and kinematics, i.e., it is developed for configurations that cannot exhibit pure rotation. We minimize point-to-epipolar-line distances, which makes the approach resilient to object depth uncertainty, and as the first step, we estimate motion up to scale using just a single camera. Then, we propose to jointly estimate the absolute scale and the extrinsic rotation of the second camera in order to alleviate the effects of varying stereo rig extrinsics. Finally, we smooth the motion estimates in a temporal window of frames by using the proposed epipolar line bundle adjustment procedure. We also introduce a multiple hypothesis feature-matching approach for self-similar planar surfaces that account for appearance change due to perspective. We evaluate SOFT2 and compare it to ORB-SLAM2, OV2SLAM, and VINS-FUSION on the KITTI-360 dataset, KITTI train sequences, Malaga Urban dataset, Oxford Robotics Car dataset, and Multivehicle Stereo Event Camera dataset.

AB In this paper, we study the problem of network reconfiguration when unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms suffer damage. Multiple UAVs are divided into several groups to perform various tasks. Each master UAV is connected to the ground control station and provides network services for small UAVs that perform various tasks, ensuring that the information of small UAVs can be transmitted back in a timely manner. When master UAVs are destroyed due to factors such as jamming or attacks, the associated small UAVs must select new master UAVs for network service and cooperate with other small UAVs to execute tasks. Based on the heterogeneity and relevance of tasks, we model and analyze the task relationship among different UAVs. Since both master UAVs and small UAVs have respective optimization objectives in the network reconfiguration process, we construct a many-to-one bilateral matching market to model the interaction between master UAVs and small UAVs. To realize an efficient solution for UAV network reconfiguration in complex environments, we propose a distributed matching algorithm and prove that the algorithm can converge to two-sided stable matching. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the task completion degree of the network compared with three other algorithms.

AB A wide-coverage unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) antenna system for air-to-ground communications is proposed in this paper. The proposed antenna system has reconfigurable beam patterns based on five sets of dual-polarization and high gain antennas. Each antenna set is configured by a dual-polarization crossed inverted-V radiator and switched feed network to drive switched beamforming operations. Depending on the switch modes of the proposed antenna, main beam direction and circular polarization types can be independently selected. Further, each antenna set is faced toward the ground level at different angles from the center of UAV to provide wide beam coverage. To verify the antenna performance, each antenna set is designed at the center frequency of 5.7 GHz and total five sets are integrated with a switched feed network and a microcontroller. To implement the wide angle switched beamforming with 2-D angle-shifted main beams, a 3-D printed conformal fixture is used to connect both the antenna module and a drone body. The maximum measured bandwidth was more than 22% and the measured peak gain with the de-embedded switch feed network loss was about 10.2 dBic.

AB Aiming at the question of unknown current disturbance, control input saturation, and limited controller transmission network resources of multi-AUVs formation system, dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM) formation control method based on adaptive fixed time integral sliding mode disturbance observer (AFISMDO) is proposed, which not only can ensure formation control converge in fixed time, but also further reduce the consumption of the controller network transmission. First of all, adaptive fixed time integral sliding mode disturbance observer is put forward to estimate compound disturbance which is composed of ocean current disturbance, nonlinear item of control input saturation accurately. Based on the AFISMDO, with the combination of nonlinear filter and the back-stepping method, which is used to eliminate repeated derivation calculation explosion problem; Secondly, in order to save the energy consumption of network transmission resources, the dynamic event trigger mechanism conjunction with virtual trajectory strategy is introduced into the multi-AUVs formation control. The fixed-time formation controller is designed to realize the fixed-time stability of formation system, and the system convergence time is independent of the initial state. Finally, the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed algorithm are proved by the multi-AUVs formation simulation experiment.

AB Various learning-based approaches have been proposed recently for robot control in complex unknown environments. However, ensuring safety in these systems is essential. Learning-based approaches are usually black-box systems which are difficult to interpret/verify. We propose a real-time continuous safety checking system which monitors the validity of the mapping from the sensor input to the actuator command (i.e., controller-focused anomaly detection) and from the actuator command to the sensor input (i.e., system-focused anomaly detection). Our controller-focused anomaly monitor is an image conditioned energy based generative adversarial network in which the discriminator acts as an energy function attributing low energies to proper actuator commands and high energy to anomalous actuator commands. Our system-focused anomaly monitor is based on an action condition video prediction framework, which finds the action conditioned future frame most similar to the actual future frame and compares it with the true action to detect anomaly. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for an autonomous navigation system in indoor (on datasets from our ground vehicle) and outdoor environments (on Udacity dataset). Furthermore, we show through experimental evaluations that our proposed framework is resilient to various data corruptions common in a vision based system.

AB This research paper focuses on providing an algorithm by which (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) UAVs can be used to provide optimal routes for agricultural applications such as, fertilizers and pesticide spray, in crop fields. To utilize a minimum amount of inputs and complete the task without a revisit, one needs to employ optimized routes and optimal points of delivering the inputs required in precision agriculture (PA). First, stressed regions are identified using VegNet (Vegetative Network) software. Then, methods are applied for obtaining optimal routes and points for the spraying of inputs with an autonomous UAV for PA. This paper reports a unique and innovative technique to calculate the optimum location of spray points required for a particular stressed region. In this technique, the stressed regions are divided into many circular divisions with its center being a spray point of the stressed region. These circular divisions would ensure a more effective dispersion of the spray. Then an optimal path is found out which connects all the stressed regions and their spray points. The paper also describes the use of methods and algorithms including travelling salesman problem (TSP)-based route planning and a Voronoi diagram which allows applying precision agriculture techniques.

LA English
DT Article
DE Estimation; lane detection; lane-keeping control; multirate control
ID LATERAL CONTROL; DESIGN; VEHICLES
AB In this paper, we propose a new approach for a robust multirate lane-keeping control scheme with predictive virtual lanes. First, the multirate lane-keeping control scheme is proposed to improve the lane-keeping performance and to reduce the ripple in the yaw rate. To improve the lane-keeping performance on a curved road, the integral of the lateral offset error is added to the state feedback controller. A multirate Kalman filter (KF) has been developed to resolve the problems caused by slow lane detection due to the vision processing system. This multirate KF estimates vehicle states at a fast rate using a microprocessor. Utilizing the estimated states, the linear quadratic state feedback control operates at the same fast update rate of the microprocessor. Thus, a multirate control scheme can reduce the ripple in the yaw rate. Second, we propose a virtual lane prediction method that compensates for the momentary failure of lane detection from unexpected problems. If the camera sensor momentarily fails while obtaining lane information, the predicted virtual lane can be substituted for the lane detection using the camera sensor in the proposed control scheme. Thus, the proposed control scheme can normally operate when the lane information is momentarily unavailable. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated via experiments.

ID IMPACT
AB In self-driving vehicles, passengers can set their seats in an unconventional seating position, such as rear-facing. Sitting in such an orientation can increase the risk of whiplash in the head-and-neck system in a frontal impact, as frontal crashes usually have higher severities compared with rear-end crashes. This paper shows that a forward-facing front seat optimised for rear-impact protection needs to be redesigned to be used as a rear-facing seat. In the second and main part of this paper, a restraint system for rear-facing car seats is developed, and frontal impact simulations with 64 km/h of delta-V are used to evaluate its performance. The designed seating system comprises two rigid torso plates, a fixed recliner and an energy absorber under the seat pan. Without using the developed restraint system, the 50th percentile male human model is exposed to neck shear forces exceeding 600 N. With the developed restraint system, neck shear forces are less than 350 N in frontal impacts with 64 km/h of delta-V. Apart from whiplash, the risk of head, chest, lower extremity and lower back injuries are also evaluated. The results confirm that the developed restraint system successfully protects the occupant since all assessment criteria values are lower than the injury assessment reference values.

AB The appropriate maintenance of highway roads is critical for the safe operation of road networks and conserves maintenance costs. Multiple methods have been developed to investigate the surface of roads for various types of cracks and potholes, among other damage. Like road surface damage, the condition of expansion joints in concrete pavement is important to avoid unexpected hazardous situations. Thus, in this study, a new system is proposed for autonomous expansion joint monitoring using a vision-based system. The system consists of the following three key parts: (1) a camera-mounted vehicle, (2) indication marks on the expansion joints, and (3) a deep learning-based automatic evaluation algorithm. With paired marks indicating the expansion joints in a concrete pavement, they can be automatically detected. An inspection vehicle is equipped with an action camera that acquires images of the expansion joints in the road. You Only Look Once (YOLO) automatically detects the expansion joints with indication marks, which has a performance accuracy of 95%. The width of the detected expansion joint is calculated using an image processing algorithm. Based on the calculated width, the expansion joint is classified into the following two types: normal and dangerous. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed system is very efficient in terms of speed and accuracy.

AB The combination of different sensory information to predict upcoming situations is an innate capability of intelligent beings. Consequently, various studies in the Artificial Intelligence field are currently being conducted to transfer this ability to artificial systems. Autonomous vehicles can particularly benefit from the combination of multi-modal information from the different sensors of the agent. This paper proposes a method for video-frame prediction that leverages odometric data. It can then serve as a basis for anomaly detection. A Dynamic Bayesian Network framework is adopted, combined with the use of Deep Learning methods to learn an appropriate latent space. First, a Markov Jump Particle Filter is built over the odometric data. This odometry model comprises a set of clusters. As a second step, the video model is learned. It is composed of a Kalman Variational Autoencoder modified to leverage the odometry clusters for focusing its learning attention on features related to the dynamic tasks that the vehicle is performing. We call the obtained overall model Cluster-Guided Kalman Variational Autoencoder. Evaluation is conducted using data from a car moving in a closed environment and leveraging a part of the University of Alcala DriveSet dataset, where several drivers move in a normal and drowsy way along a secondary road.

AB The problem of nonlinear filtering for GNSS/INS under non-Gaussian noise is studied in this paper, where an improved maximum correntropy cubature Kalman filter (MCCKF) is proposed by utilizing resampling-free sigma-point update framework (SUF). The MCCKF has better robustness than CKF in case non-Gaussian noise appears. However, only the Gaussian moments are circulated in MCCKF, which is less efficient when the nonlinearity of dynamic function is strong. The proposed algorithm named RMCCKF, imports the re-scaled measurement and state prediction covariance that produced by maximum correntropy criterion into the direct construction of posterior sigma points. By constraining the posterior covariance of MCCKF and modifying the sigma points directly, the resampling-free SUF spreads extra information of dynamic model over the posterior sigma points update. The proposed algorithm is verified by using numerical simulation and field test on GNSS/INS. Experiment results indicate that, RMCCKF achieves better performance than CKF and MCCKF, especially when the filtering problem is of high dimension. On the GNSS/INS of land vehicle navigation, RMCCKF not only improves the position but also reduces the heading error from 1.77 degree to 0.26 degree, compared with MCCKF. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc.

ID SHARED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; PARKING DEMAND; AUSTIN; POLICY; TEXAS
AB The potential rise of automated vehicles (AVs) may significantly impact future traffic volumes, in turn affecting urban street designs and adjacent land use. While integrated studies on potential traffic and land-use changes due to AVs largely concern issues of location choice and changing settlement patterns, assessments of how AVs may influence the quality of streets depending on the requirements of adjacent land use remain scarce. This paper presents an integrated assessment of the urban effect of AVs on traffic and neighborhoods in Vienna. It provides a methodology to assess whether changing traffic volumes are compatible with the land use of a given neighborhood to approximate street space requirements for shared automated shuttles and to visualize possible trajectories of spatial transformation by considering local development goals. The results show that the opportunities to convert street space and the risks of environmental harm due to AVs will vary across neighborhoods and street typologies. It is crucial for policymakers and planners to consider such contextual differences to gain better insight into the functional requirements and urban consequences of AVs. This assessment aims to shed light on the possible trade-offs of a system change in favor of AVs to help evaluate adequate operational conditions and inform proactive traffic and urban design policies to harness possible implications.

AB This paper is concerned with the problem of dynamic output feedback control design for the cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) system with randomly occurring sensor saturations (ROSSs) subject to randomly occurring deception attacks (RODAs). The dynamics of the vehicle equipped with CACC system behave like a linear model in which the deviation of the position and velocity are chosen as the state variables. Sensor saturations and deception attacks are simultaneously taken into account, and two sets of Bernoulli random variables are utilized to characterize their nature of random occurrence. The main objective of this article is to develop a robust dynamic output feedback controller (RDOFC) such that, for all possible parameter uncertainties, sensor saturations as well as deception attacks, all the states can still be exponentially mean square stable and the H-infinity performance index is guaranteed. In light of the Lyapunov stability theory, a sufficient condition of the desired controller is firstly constructed, then the controller parameters are obtained relying on the solutions to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the three-car platoon system is evaluated to validate the usefulness of the developed algorithm.

AB Hydrobatic AUVsare very agile, and can perform challenging maneuvers that encompass the full 0 degrees-360 degrees flight envelope. Such AUVs can be beneficial in novel use cases in ocean production, environmental sensing, and security, by enabling new capabilities for docking, inspection, or under-ice operations. To further explore their capabilities in such scenarios, it is crucial to be able to model their flight dynamics over the full envelope, which includes strong nonlinear effects and turbulence at high angles of attack. With accurate and efficient simulation models, new hydrobatic maneuvers can be generated and control strategies can be developed. Therefore, this article contributes with a strategy to perform efficient and accurate simulations of hydrobatic maneuvers in real time. A multifidelity hydrodynamic database is synthesized by combining analytical, semiempirical, and numerical methods, thereby capturing fluid forces and moments over the full envelope. A component buildup workflow is used to assemble a nonlinear flight dynamics model using lookup tables generated from the database. This simulation model is used to perform real-time simulations of advanced hydrobatic maneuvers. Simulation results show agreement with literature and experiment, and the simulator shows utility as a development tool in designing new maneuvers and control strategies.

AB An advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) uses radar, visual information, and laser sensors to calculate variables representing driving conditions, such as time-to-collision (TTC) and time headway (THW), and to determine collision risk using empirically set thresholds. However, the empirically set threshold can generate differences in performance that are detected by the driver. It is appropriate to quickly relay collision risk to drivers whose response speed to dangerous situations is relatively slow and who drive defensively. However, for drivers whose response speed is relatively fast and who drive actively, it may be better not to provide a warning if they are aware of the collision risk in advance, because giving collision warnings too frequently can lower the reliability of the warnings and cause dissatisfaction in the driver, or promote disregard. To solve this problem, this study proposes a collision warning system (CWS) based on an individual driver's driving behavior. In particular, a driver behavior model was created using an artificial neural network learning algorithm so that the collision risk could be determined according to the driving characteristics of the driver. Finally, the driver behavior model was learned using actual vehicle driving data and the applicability of the proposed CWS was verified through simulation.

AB Autonomous and intelligent vehicles will undoubtedly depend on an accurate ego localization solution. Global navigation satellite systems suffer from multipath propagation rendering this solution insufficient. Herein, we present a real-time system for six-degrees-of-freedom ego localization that uses only a single monocular camera. The camera image is harnessed to yield an ego pose relative to a previously computed visual map. We describe a process to automatically extract the ingredients of this map from stereoscopic image sequences. These include a mapping trajectory relative to the first pose, global scene signatures and local landmark descriptors. The localization algorithm then consists of a topological localization step that completely obviates the need for any global positioning sensors such as GNSS. A metric refinement step that recovers an accurate metric pose is subsequently applied. Metric localization recovers the ego pose in a factor graph optimization process based on local landmarks. We demonstrate centimeter-level accuracy by a set of experiments in an urban environment. To this end, two localization estimates are computed for two independent cameras mounted on the same vehicle. These two independent trajectories are thereafter compared for consistency. Finally, we present qualitative experiments of an augmented reality (AR) system that depends on the aforementioned localization solution. Several screen shots of the AR system are shown confirming centimeter-level accuracy and subdegree angular precision.

AB Cooperative Driving requires ultra-reliable communications, and it is now clear that no single technology will ever be able to satisfy such stringent requirements, if only because active jamming can kill (almost) any wireless technology. Cooperative driving with multiple communication technologies which complement each other opens new spaces for research and development, but also poses several challenges. The work we present tackles the fallback and recovery mechanisms that the longitudinal controlling system of a platoon of vehicles can implement as a distributed system with multiple communication interfaces. We present a protocol and procedure to correctly compute the safe transition between different controlling algorithms, down to autonomous (or manual) driving when no communication is possible. To empower the study, we also develop a new version of Plexe, which is an integral part of this contribution as the only Open Source, free simulation tool that enables the study of such systems with a modular approach, and that we deem offers the community the possibility of boosting research in this field. The results we present demonstrate the feasibility of safe fallback, but also highlight that such complex systems require careful design choices, as naive approaches can lead to instabilities or even collisions, and that such design can only be done with appropriate in-silico experiments.

AB Currently, several platforms offer solutions for the management and control of fleets of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), addressing a wide range of scenarios, each with its own particular set of objectives. Some of these solutions are mission planning platforms for broader usage, without aiming to solve a single scenario. However, these often either do not support multi-UAV collaboration or generate a static flight trajectory, which does not facilitate the coordination of a fleet of several UAVs in a mission that may need to adapt to the current environment. Through the development of a domain-specific language (DSL) - EasyMission - for UAV mission definition and control, we introduce a mission planning framework that makes it possible to describe mission plans that also enable the user to define adjustments and constraints that may have to be taken into account in real-time according to sensor readings or other events. This framework enables inexperienced users to design missions with low or moderate complexity levels, while still being a useful tool for advanced users due to its versatility in addressing multiple scenarios through a single platform. We show how the mission framework is able to easily define differentiated mission examples with distinct purposes and scenarios, and with real-time decisions and constraints.

AB Adapting to the instantaneous disturbance in the driving environment and balancing the optimality and computational efficiency of control algorithms are two major challenges for the integrated optimization of active speed planning and powertrain energy management strategy. In this study, utilizing the framework of model predictive control, a simultaneous method (SM) and a hierarchical method (HM) are developed to serve as benchmarks for control optimality and computational efficiency, respectively. Then, by modifying the decou-pling strategy of the HM, this study ultimately proposes a modified HM which achieves similar control effec-tiveness in energy saving as that of the SM and preserves high computational efficiency. The comparative validation demonstrates that, due to fierce acceleration/deceleration operation caused by the heuristic decou-pling strategy adopted in the HM, the energy consumption provided by the HM is 221.5% in traffic flow scenarios (and 633.5% in the manually designed scenario) of that generated by the SM. However, by adopting the soft constraint on acceleration magnitudes, the modified HM narrows the sub-optimality in energy consumption to 3.95% compared with the SM, and it also realizes a 55.81% improvement in computation efficiency compared with the original HM.

AB Deep learning has made remarkable progress in the field of image classification and object detection. Nevertheless, in the autonomous driving research, the real-time lane line detection and lane offset estimation in complex traffic scenes have always been challenging and difficult tasks. Traditional detection methods need manual adjustment of parameters, they face many problems and difficulties and are still highly susceptible to interference caused by obstructing objects, illumination changes, and pavement wear. It is still challenging to design a robust lane detection and lane offset estimation algorithm. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network for lane offset estimation and lane line detection in a complex road environment, which transforms the problems of lane line detection into the instance's segmentation. In response to a change in the method of lane processing, the network will form its example to each line. The global scale perception optimization mechanism is designed to solve the issue, especially where the lane line width is gradually narrowing at the vanishing point of the lane. At the same time, to realize multi-tasking processing and improve performance, and end-to-end lane offset estimation network is used in addition to the lane line detection network.

AB This Review highlights the technological challenges linked to the application of nanophotonics for light detection and ranging (LiDAR).
   Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology, a laser-based imaging technique for accurate distance measurement, is considered one of the most crucial sensor technologies for autonomous vehicles, artificially intelligent robots and unmanned aerial vehicle reconnaissance. Until recently, LiDAR has relied on light sources and detectors mounted on multiple mechanically rotating optical transmitters and receivers to cover an entire scene. Such an architecture gives rise to limitations in terms of the imaging frame rate and resolution. In this Review, we examine how novel nanophotonic platforms could overcome the hardware restrictions of existing LiDAR technologies. After briefly introducing the basic principles of LiDAR, we present the device specifications required by the industrial sector. We then review a variety of LiDAR-relevant nanophotonic approaches such as integrated photonic circuits, optical phased antenna arrays and flat optical devices based on metasurfaces. The latter have already demonstrated exceptional functional beam manipulation properties, such as active beam deflection, point-cloud generation and device integration using scalable manufacturing methods, and are expected to disrupt modern optical technologies. In the outlook, we address the upcoming physics and engineering challenges that must be overcome from the viewpoint of incorporating nanophotonic technologies into commercially viable, fast, ultrathin and lightweight LiDAR systems.

AB Studies have shown that many behavioral decisions of fish are facilitated by the lateral line system which provides hydrodynamic information about the surrounding fluid. Inspired by the functionality of the system, a distributed pressure sensory system is developed. The system is intended for use on autonomous underwater vehicles to aid station keeping and accurate maneuvering by allowing the vehicle to react to the changes in the fluid environment before they result in body perturbation. The system can also be used for mission level decision making such as obstacle detection. This paper presents a prototype sensory system using differential, as opposed to absolute or gauge, pressure sensors as the sensing elements, which allows for higher measurement precision. Experimental tests are designed to characterize the system's ability to estimate the hydrodynamic force and to detect the presence of a wall. The hydrodynamic force estimated by the system is validated with an independent force measuring apparatus. The impending wall could also be detected by analyzing the pressure distribution obtained from the sensory system. Particularly, it is found that the wall distance and angle may be inferred by comparing the amplitude and phase of the Fourier components in the pressure distribution against those without the obstacle.

AB This paper presents a robust technique to detect traffic lights during both day and night conditions and estimate their distance. The traffic light detection is based initially on color properties. To enhance the color on the video sequences, the acquisition is adapted according to the luminosity of the pixels on the top of the image. A fuzzy clustering provides a better division of the traffic light colors. The traffic light color properties have been estimated from registered sequences including both colors from LED spot lights and from traditional light bulbs. The filters rules based on the traffic light aspect ratios as well as the tracking stage are used to decide whether the spots on the frames are likely to be traffic lights. Then, the distance between traffic lights and the autonomous vehicle is estimated by applying Bayesian filters to the traffic lights represented on the frames. The tests are validated with more than an hour in real urban scenarios during day and night. The paper shows that the developed advanced driver assistance system is able to detect the traffic lights with 99.4% of accuracy in the range of 10-115 m. The utility of this system has been demonstrated during the Public ROad Urban Driverless car test in Italy in 2013. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the intervehicle security-based robust formation control of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to implement the formation switch mission. In the scheme, a novel adaptive potential ship (APS)-based guidance principle is developed to prevent intervehicle collisions, which is common and threatening when maneuvering a formation switch. By employing the artificial potential field (APF), the APS can program the real-time attitude reference for USVs by using the security intervehicle distance while achieving the path-following task. As for the control part, a robust adaptive formation control algorithm is proposed to effectively stabilize the USVs to the APS via the fusion of the disturbance observer (DOB) and by using the robust neural damping technique. Regarding the merits of the improved design of the DOB, the weight compression of the neural networks can effectively simplify the structure of the DOB and enhance the observation accuracy of the external disturbance. This can facilitate the avoidance of intervehicle collisions and guarantee the application of the theoretical algorithm in engineering practice. Considerable effort has been made to obtain the semiglobally uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability via theoretical analysis. Finally, with the sailing scene in a narrow channel, the simulated experiment is illustrated to verify the security performance of the proposed strategy.

AB Recent developments in drone technology have led to the widespread use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In particular, UAVs are often used in reconnaissance to detect objects such as missing persons in large areas. However, traditional systems use only one UAV to search for missing persons in a large area. In addition, object detection is performed after flight or manually because detection requires high computing power. In this paper, a reconnaissance drone system using multiple UAVs is proposed. The proposed multi-UAV reconnaissance system performs real-time object detection on each UAV. The real-time object detection results from each UAV are received by the ground control system (GCS) to stitch the images. To enable real-time object detection in individual UAVs, the filter pruning method is applied to the YOLOv5 model, and the model uses 40% fewer parameters than the existing baseline model. The lightweight YOLOv5 model achieves approximately 11.73 FPS on the Jetson Xaiver NX using a mission computer. Moreover, the proposed image stitching method enables image stitching by effectively matching features using additional information generated by UAVs. The UAV flight tests show that the proposed reconnaissance system can monitor and detect objects in real time over large areas.

AB With the flourishing development of artificial intelligence, lasing with tailored features generated by photonic crystal (PhC) lasers has been playing a more important part in the optics field and in potential applications of self-control, light detection and ranging, telecommunications, and holography imaging. As an information vehicle, the optical beam's maneuverability is influenced by the working wavelength, direction, and efficiency of the laser. Liquid crystal (LC)-based mirrorless lasers are widely investigated in manipulating the tuning of emission wavelength. Realizing fast self-steering of the laser beam to tune the emission direction is challenging because of the limitation on the complex and expensive inorganic fabrication and circuit design. In this work, a self-steered lasing from a defect-mode sandwich film composed of photomechanical deformable azobenzene cholesteric LC elastomer (CLCE) PhC layers and an isotropic gain interlayer is demonstrated. On the basis of the great light-deformability of the CLCE, the output single-mode lasing emission of the sandwich-film laser can be steered quickly by UV irradiation in a wide angular tuning range of approximate to +/- 57 degrees. This flexible, portable, and durable laser system with controllable beam-steering and mechanical robustness is envisioned to open a gate for autonomous vehicles, self-sustaining machines, and optical devices with the core feature of photomechanical conversion.

ID DATA DISSEMINATION PROTOCOL; NETWORKS
AB Over the last few years, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have been the focus of a great progress due to the interest in autonomous vehicles and in distributing content, not only between vehicles, but also from the Cloud. The main characteristics of VANETs, such as high mobility, intermittent connectivity, scalability and constant changes in the network topology make the content dissemination a challenge, where traditional IP-based dissemination protocols do not present a good result. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol for storing and distributing content, where information is addressed by its content, instead of its location. It has been tested and deployed in wired networks, but never in an environment where nodes have intermittent connectivity, such as a VANET. In this work we propose the use of IPFS in a real vehicular network. We assess its performance in a small real platform, and we propose new modifications and configurations to its support, such as reducing discoverability times. Moreover, we evaluate IPFS in an emulator and in a real city VANET, and we compare it with other content distribution protocols. The obtained results show that IPFS is on par with the Sprinkler vehicular to vehicular protocol, which is built specifically for this use case, and greatly outperforms BitTorrent regarding neighbor discoverability and data transfers.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), a comparatively new technology in the field of underwater surveying, has principally been used for taking precise measurement of undersea structures in the oil and gas industry. Typically, the LiDAR is deployed on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), which will "land" on the seafloor in order to generate a 3D point cloud of its environment from a stationary position. To explore the potential of subsea LiDAR on a moving platform in an environmental context, we deployed an underwater LiDAR system simultaneously with a multibeam echosounder (MBES), surveying Kingston Reef off the coast of Rottnest Island, Western Australia. This paper compares and summarises the relative accuracy and characteristics of underwater LiDAR and multibeam sonar and investigates synergies between sonar and LiDAR technology for the purpose of benthic habitat mapping and underwater simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). We found that LiDAR reflectivity and multibeam backscatter are complementary technologies for habitat mapping, which can combine to discriminate between habitats that could not be mapped with either one alone. For robot navigation, SLAM can be effectively applied with either technology, however, when a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is available, SLAM does not significantly improve the self-consistency of multibeam data, but it does for LiDAR.

AB This paper presents a resource-aware state and uncertainty estimation method for dynamic positioning vessels subject to uncertain kinetics and unknown sea loads induced by wind, waves and currents. Specifically, an event-triggered extended state observer (ESO) is proposed such that unnecessary communications are avoided and sensor-to-observer communication cost are drastically reduced. A realizable event-triggering condition is established depending on the position-heading measurements only. It is proven that the observation errors are input-to-state stable (ISS), and Zeno behavior will not occur. Aimed at achieving finite-time convergence, an event-triggered finite-time convergent ESO is further designed. By resorting to a homogeneous Lyapunov function, the estimation errors are proven to be finite-time ISS. A salient feature of the proposed event-triggered ESOs is that a joint observation of the unmeasured velocities, unknown kinetics and unknown sea loads can be achieved with reduced communication cost. The proposed event-triggered ESOs can be applied to various motion scenario such trajectory tracking, path following, target tracking, and even formation control of marine vessels. Simulation results show that the communication times are largely decreased compared with the time-triggered ESOs.

   prediction
AB Big data for social transportation brings unprecedented opportunities for us to solve the transportation problems that cannot be solved by traditional methods and build the next generation of the intelligent transportation system (ITS). As one of the important functions of the ITS, supply-demand difference prediction for autonomous vehicles provides a decision basis for its control. In this article, a new learning process is proposed with Multiple feature Extraction and Fusion utilizing the combination of deep and shallow Features (MEFF) (the spatial deep features, (short and long) temporal deep features, and fuzzy shallow (semantic) features). The spatial deep features are captured with residual network and dimension reduction in spatial deep block. The fuzzy shallow (semantic) features are captured with multiattention fuzzy mechanism in the fuzzy shallow block. With the fused spatial deep features and fuzzy shallow features, the temporal deep features are captured with long short-term memory (LSTM) and attention mechanism in the temporal and prediction block to get the final prediction results. Based on two different distributions of membership attention (mean distribution and Gaussian distribution) in the fuzzy shallow block, our process MEFF has two methods, i.e., MEFF-mean method and MEFF-Gaussian method. Extensive experiments show that our methods provide more accurate and stable prediction results than the existing state-of-art-methods.

AB Robots used for inspection, package deliveries, moving of goods, and other logistics operations are often required to visit certain locations within specified time bounds. This gives rise to a challenging problem as it requires not only planning collision free and dynamically feasible motions but also reasoning temporally about when and where the robot should be. While significant progress has been made in integrating task and motion planning, there are still no effective approaches for multigoal motion planning when both dynamics and time windows must be satisfied. To effectively solve this challenging problem, this paper develops an approach that couples temporal planning over a discrete abstraction with sampling-based motion planning over the continuous state space of feasible motions. The discrete abstraction is obtained by imposing a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the free space. At each iteration of a core loop, the approach first invokes the temporal planner to find a solution over the roadmap abstraction. In a second step, the approach uses sampling to expand a motion tree along the regions associated with the discrete solution. Experiments are conducted with second-order ground and aerial vehicle models operating in complex environments. Results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the approach as we increase the number of goals and the difficulty of satisfying the time hounds.

ID OBJECT TRACKING; VISUAL TRACKING; STEREO; ALGORITHM
AB The navigation management systems in autonomous vehicles should be able to gather solid information about the immediate environment of the vehicle, discern ambulance from a delivery truck, and react in a proper manner to handle any difficult situation. Separating such information from a vision controlled system is a computationally demanding task for heavy traffic areas in the real world environmental conditions. In such a scenario, we need a robust moving object detection tracking system. To achieve this, we can make use of stereo vision-based moving object detection and tracking, utilizing symmetric mask-based discrete wavelet transform to deal with illumination changes, low memory requirement, and fake motion avoidance. The accurate motion detection in complex dynamic scenes is done by the combined background subtraction and frame differencing technique. For the fast motion track, we can employ a dense disparity-variance method. This SMDWT-based object detection has a maximum and minimum accuracy of 99.62% and 94.95%, respectively. The motion track has the highest accuracy of 79.47% within the time frame of 28.03seconds. The lowest accuracy of the system is 62.01% within the time frame of 34.46seconds. From the analysis, it is clear that this proposed method exceptionally outperforms the existing monocular and dense stereo object tracking approaches in terms of low computational cost, high accuracy, and in handling the dynamic environments.

AB Consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operation from the time it is launched until the time it is put into an autonomous flight control mode. The control input u(t) during this time duration is modeled sigma u(t) and assumed healthy with sigma = 1. In practice, however, the control inputs are less effective with a sigma-value in the interval [0, 1) (Fan et al. 2012; Jayakumar and Das 2006; Hu et al. J. Guid. Control. Dyn. 34(3), 927-932, 2011). Complete damaged condition is inferred from sigma = 0. Given a stabilizing controller, a range of sigma-values in the interval [0,1) for which the closed loop system would remain stable is referred as the fault-tolerant margin (FTM). Flight operations with control effectiveness beyond the FTM are catastrophic. Further, when aerodynamic parameter variations due to an uncertain atmospheric condition in an UAV are present, it is shown that the FTMs are extremely sensitive to these parameter perturbations. In this paper, the FTMs are presented. The effects of control effectiveness factor on the nonlinear UAV when it is in the stable range are investigated. An UAV model in Ashokkumar and York (2016) is considered to illustrate the FTMs as a threshold to guarantee the safe operation.

AB The 3-D light detection and ranging (3-D LIDAR) sensors are widely used in autonomous vehicles; however, their drawback is the significant computation processing requirement. Although parallel processing using high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) can solve the aforementioned problem, the cost of high-end GPUs prevents 3-D LIDAR from being used in commercial vehicles. In this study, a new fast and efficient perception method using 3-D LIDAR is developed. The aim is to develop a real-time perception method that can run on both a low-end GPU and a central processing unit (CPU). The proposed method consists of three parts: preprocessing, point cloud classification network (PCCN), and filtering. To process a point cloud using minimal computation and achieve good performance, handcrafted features and learning-based features are used in PCCN-the former capture the global information of the given point cloud, whereas the latter encode the local information of the points in the cloud. Finally, the proposed LIDAR perception method is applied to the SemanticKITTI dataset, and it is validated by comparing with other competing methods in terms of accuracy and computation time on the CPU.

AB This paper proposes a predictive driver coaching (PDC) system for fuel economy driving for hybrid electric trucks using upcoming static map and dynamic traffic data. Unlike traditional methods that optimize over engine torque and brake to obtain a speed profile, we propose to optimize over driving modes of trucks to achieve a trade-off between fuel consumption and trip time. The optimal driving mode is provided to the driver as a coaching recommendation. To obtain the optimal solution, the truck dynamics are firstly modeled as a hybrid controlled switching dynamical system with autonomous subsystems and then a hybrid optimal control problem (HOCP) is formulated. The problem is solved using an algorithm based on discrete hybrid minimum principle. A warm-start strategy to reduce algorithmic iterations is used by employing a shrinking horizon strategy. In addition, an extensive analysis of the proposed algorithm is provided. We prove that the the coasting mode is never optimal given the truck configuration and and we provide a guideline for tuning parameters to maintain the optimal mode sequence. Finally, the algorithm is validated using real-world data from baseline driving tests using a DAF hybrid truck. Significant reduction in fuel consumption is achieved when the data is perfectly available.

AB Monitoring subsea environment requires sophisticated tools such as Autonomous or Remote Underwater Vehicles, submersible sensors, and very skilled manpower. Power is vital to the success of subsea missions especially in deep-waters where visibility is poor and the travel time from the surface to the seabed and vice versa takes a relatively long time. Therefore, renewable energy sources have been tapped into as a solution to continuously provide power to underwater vehicles, actuators, and sensors used/located in deep waters, such as the Gulf of Mexico or the North Sea. Previously, we designed a one-magnet energy harvester installed at the bottom of the sea to generate electricity for small sensors. In order to increase the electrical power production to provide power for a variety of devices, two kinds of energy harvesters (single-magnet and two-magnet) actuated via a buoy are proposed here. The produced voltage is fed to a signal conditioning rectifier to prep it for usage by sensors/actuators. The performance of the two proposed harvesters using the Genetic Algorithms generated parameter is presented for comparison. The simulation results showed that the electrical power generated by the two-magnet energy harvester using periodic wave motion is double that of the single-magnet energy harvester.

ID DESCRIPTOR
AB While navigating in a typical traffic scene, with a drastic drift or sudden jump in its Global Positioning System (GPS) position, the localization based on such an initial position is unable to extract precise overlapping data from the prior map in order to match the current data, thus rendering the localization as unfeasible. In this paper, we first propose a new method to estimate an initial position by matching the infrared reflectivity maps. The maps consist of a highly precise prior map, built with the offline simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technique, and a smooth current map, built with the integral over velocities. Considering the attributes of the maps, we first propose to exploit the stable, rich line segments to match the lidar maps. To evaluate the consistency of the candidate line pairs in both maps, we propose to adopt the local appearance, pairwise geometric attribute and structural likelihood to construct an affinity graph, as well as employ a spectral algorithm to solve the graph efficiently. The initial position is obtained according to the relationship between the vehicle's current position and matched lines. Experiments on the campus with a GPS error of dozens of metres show that our algorithm can provide an accurate initial value with average longitudinal and lateral errors being 1.68m and 1.04m, respectively.

AB Next generation drive-by-wire automotive systems enabling autonomous driving will build on the fail-operational capabilities of electronics, control and software (ECS) architectural solutions. Developing such architectural designs that would meet dependability requirements and satisfy other system constraints is a challenging task and will possibly lead to a paradigm shift in automotive ECS architecture design and development activities. This aspect is becoming quite relevant while designing battery-driven electric vehicles with integrated in-wheel drive-train and chassis subsystems.
   In such highly integrated dependable systems, many of the primary features and functions are attributed to the highest safety critical ratings. Brake-by-wire is one such system that interfaces with active safety features built into an automobile, and which in turn is expected to provide fail-operational capabilities. In this paper, building up on the basic concepts of fail-silent and fail-operational systems design we propose a system-architecture for a brake-by-wire system with fail-operational capabilities. The design choices are supported with proper rationale and design trade-offs. Safety and reliability analysis of the proposed system architecture is performed as per the ISO 26262 standard for functional safety of electrical/electronic systems in road vehicles.

AB 3D mapping is very challenging in the underwater domain, especially due to the lack of high resolution, low noise sensors. A new spectral registration method is presented that can determine the spatial 6 DOF transformation between pairs of very noisy 3D scans with only partial overlap. The approach is hence suited to cope with sonar as the predominant underwater sensor. The spectral registration method is based on Phase Only Matched Filtering (POMF) on non-trivially resampled spectra of the 3D data.
   Two extensive sets of experiments are presented. First, evaluations with simulated data are done where the type and amount of noise can be controlled and the ground truth transformations between scans are known. Second, real world data from a Tritech Eclipse sonar is used. Concretely, 18 sonar scans of a large structure in form of a flood gate and a lock in the river Lesum in Bremen are used for 3D mapping. In doing so, the spectral registration method is compared to two other methods suited for noisy 3D registrations, namely Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and plane-based registration. It is shown that the spectral registration method performs very well in terms of the resulting 3D map as well as its run-times.

AB Air platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, airships, and balloons are expected to complement traditional ground networks to provide flexible coverage solutions. However, most existing models for air-ground integrated networks (AGINs) neglect the spatial dependence caused by the complementary deployment of the aerial and ground nodes. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose two AGIN models with horizontal dependence that differ in the vertical dimension, namely uniformly independent altitudes and location-dependent altitudes. The air platforms serve as aerial base stations, distributed as a marked Poisson hole process, and provide flexible beam coverage through varying altitudes. Under this setup, we propose a region-based user association scheme and derive the association probabilities as well as the serving distance distributions of an arbitrarily located user. Considering Nakagami fading and air-to-ground propagation properties, we characterize the signal-to-interference ratio and area spectral efficiency for each model. Using the proposed analytical framework, we demonstrate the importance of deploying the air platforms more sensibly to provide targeted services and flexible beam coverage in reducing the load of base stations and improving the user coverage and network capacity performance.

AB An extensive investigation of the interaction of thermoplastic olefin (TPO) compounds with high frequency radar wave has been conducted to understand how TPO materials affect radar sensor efficiency, an important function for vehicle safety and especially the advancement of autonomous vehicles. In this article, the effect of major ingredients of a TPO on its dielectric properties was studied, and then a wide range of TPO compounds were evaluated for their radar transmittance or attenuation. It was demonstrated that the characteristics of polypropylene (PP) resin and rubber have little impact on the dielectric properties of a TPO, thus minimal influence on TPO's radar transparency, while increasing the talc loading in the compound increases the dielectric constant of the TPO. The TPO materials containing talc from 7% up to 34% were found to have dielectric constants ranging from 2.30 to 2.70 and nearly zero dielectric loss. Experiments confirmed that parts molded with these materials are transparent to high frequency radar wave at optimized thicknesses. Some pigments for coloring the materials also affect dielectric properties of TPOs, thus radar transmittance, with metal pigments showing the most impact. Finally, commercial TPO products are shown to have great batch to batch consistency in radar transmittance at a selected part thickness.

AB Disruption of the ground communication infrastructure in emergency scenarios makes post-disaster rescue operations very complicate. This paper proposes to use edge intelligence to support rescue operators in managing these emergency scenarios. A set of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), organized as Flying Ad-Hoc network (FANET), autonomously takeoff and land to provide emergency operators with edge computing services. A charging station for batteries is supplied by a renewable-energy generator. The FANET Controller applies model-based Reinforcement Learning to decide how many UAVs have to take off, according to the current edge-computing service requests and the power availability, and a forecast of them. The optimal management policy has to provide the necessary level of edge-computing avoiding wide use of satellite channels in a short-time horizon during low green-energy generation and high service request periods. Results highlight that the optimal policy is an efficient modification of the greedy one, i.e., the policy enabling the takeoff of all the necessary UAVs without being care of challenging events in the future. A deep analysis has revealed that the level of modification depends on the combination of the edge-computing service request and the green power availability.

ID BLOCKCHAIN; BEHAVIOR
AB Driving style recognition of real-world drivers is beneficial for various reasons, such as safe and economic driving, auto-insurance and designing autonomous systems. A common way to achieve this goal is to group drivers using clustering methods according to their trajectory data. However, the conventional model training process is centralized, where all drivers' private trajectories are collected and shared, which has resulted in privacy concerns. Considering that the driving data are sourced from various vehicles and have a decentralized distribution, we introduce a federated clustering approach for privacy-preserving driving style recognition. The method preserves the trajectory data in edge devices, such as connected vehicles or roadside units, and allows only the exchange of model parameters and not raw, sensitive data under the coordination of a central server to meet the privacy protection requirements. To address the clustering heterogeneous challenge posed by the imbalanced distribution of trajectory data in this setting, we combine local Bayesian Gaussian mixture and global weighted K-means to output high-quality global initialization centers. Then, novel local training and global aggregation strategies are proposed to ensure the convergence of training and improve the performance of the final global model. Through comparison experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets, we conclude that this method outperforms existing methods.

AB Increased safety has been advocated as one of the major benefits of the introduction of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). Incorporation of ADSs in vehicles means that associated software has safety critical application, thus requiring exhaustive testing. To prove ADSs are safer than human drivers, some work has suggested that they will need to be driven for over 11 billion miles. The number of test miles driven is not, by itself, a meaningful metric for judging the safety of ADSs. Rather, the types of scenarios encountered by the ADSs during testing are critically important.
   With a Hazard Based Testing approach, this paper proposes that the extent to which testing miles are 'smart miles' that reflect hazard-based scenarios relevant to the way in which an ADS fails or handles hazards is a fundamental, if not pivotal, consideration for safety-assurance of ADSs. Using Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) method as a foundation, an extension to the STPA method has been developed to identify test scenarios. The approach has been applied to a real-world case study of a SAE Level 4 Low-Speed Automated Driving system (a.k.a. a shuttle). This paper, discusses the STPA analysis and a newly-developed test scenarios creation method derived from STPA.

AB This study proposes a path planning method based on behavioral decision-making (PPM-BBD). An optimized path is planned for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to save energy during the diving process. The key idea is to apply success-history based adaptive differential evolution algorithm including linear population size reduction (L-SHADE) to the optimization of energy. In addition, motion constraints are considered during the diving process to ensure that the path points are reachable. We take the sequence of motion angles as the population, and propose an angle modification strategy to apply to the population evolution process, so that the angle sequence remains in the space of feasible solutions. The modification strategy lays a theoretical foundation for the application of L-SHADE in this path planning problem. The performance of PPM-BBD is evaluated on data from simulation test. The most suitable control parameters are determined through simulation experiments. The effects of PPM-BBD with L-SHADE and five types of DE are compared. The experimental evaluation was performed through sea trials in Tuandao Bay, Qingdao, China. Results show that PPM-BBD saves at least 9% energy compared to the other algorithms. It is concluded that it is workable to obtain a reachable path with optimized energy consumption during diving process.

AB The position and attitude control of a six-degree-of-freedom vehicle is dealt with in this paper. The actuation system is assumed to consist of a set of mono-directional devices suitably located and directed. The model of the system is characterized by a large amount of uncertainties, disturbances and measurement errors. The state is assumed fully available and the navigation problems generating smooth references for the state trajectories are supposed already solved. A new attitude guidance algorithm has been developed to enhance robustness with respect to a class of nonsmooth measurement errors. The use of the simplex-based sliding mode methodology reveals to be simultaneously suitable for the design of the actuation system (position and orientation of the actuators) and the implementation of the control strategy. The chattering phenomenon is strongly attenuated by the introduction of integrators in the input channel and, consequently to this choice, a suitable mechanism to avoid the unbounded growth of the individual thrust of the actuators is designed, while at the same time, achieving a direct control of power losses. The performances of the proposed control scheme are demonstrated by simulation by using mathematical models available in the literature.

AB This study concerns autonomous ground vehicles performing missions of observation or surveillance. These missions are accomplished under the supervision of human operators, who can also remotely control the unmanned vehicle. This kind of human-machine system is likely to face perturbations in a dynamic natural environment. However, human operators are not able to manage perturbations due to overload. The objective of this study is to provide such systems with ways to anticipate, react and recover from perturbations. In other words, these works aim at improving system resilience so that it can better manage perturbations. This paper presents a model of human-robot cooperative control that helps to improve the resilience of the human-machine system by making the level of autonomy adjustable. A formalism of agent autonomy is proposed according to the semantic aspects of autonomy and the agent's activity levels. This formalism is then used to describe the activity levels of the global human-machine system. Hierarchical decision-making methods and planning algorithms are also proposed to implement these levels of activity. Finally, an experimental illustration on a micro-world is presented in order to evaluate the feasibility and application of the proposed model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB As high performance parallel computing architectures make their way into systems with tight size, weight, power, and energy budgets (e.g., portable computing and communications, autonomous vehicles, and space-borne computing), compact and efficient computing and communication mechanisms will be required. To provide such a communication mechanism, the Portable Image Computing Architectures (PICA) group at Georgia Tech is designing the High-Performance Efficient Router (HiPER), a multidimensional router with high-throughput serial channels (1-2 Gbps). Providing high performance for size, weight, power, and energy constrained systems requires careful attention to routing, switching, and error control mechanisms, and the HiPER Prototype (HiPER-P) is a proof-of-concept vehicle that will validate efficient implementations of these mechanisms. The HiPER-P combines mad postman (bit-pipelined) switching with dimension-order routing, producing a router with a very low-latency routing function. To maintain robust communication as link speeds increase and link power budgets decrease, the HiPER-P provides flit-level hop-by-hop retransmission of erroneous flits. This error control mechanism provides built-in error control at the network level. The design of the HiPER-P is presented in this paper as well as results of performance simulations which characterize mad postman switching combined with flit-level error control.

DE Lunar capture dynamics; Low-thrust dynamics; Earth-Moon missions;

ID MISSION; EARTH; POINT
AB Nonlinear orbit control with the use of low-thrust propulsion is proposed as an effective strategy for autonomous guidance of a space vehicle directed toward the Moon. Orbital motion is described in an ephemeris model, with the inclusion of the most relevant perturbations. Unfavorable initial conditions, associated with weak, temporary lunar capture, are considered, as representative conditions that may be encountered in real mission scenarios. These may occur when the spacecraft is released in nonnominal flight conditions, which would naturally lead it to impact the Moon or escape the lunar gravitational attraction. To avoid this, low-thrust propulsion, in conjunction with nonlinear orbit control, is employed, to drive the space vehicle toward two different, prescribed, low-altitude lunar orbits. Nonlinear orbit control leads to identifying a saturated feedback law (for the low-thrust magnitude and direction) that is proven to enjoy global stability properties. The guidance strategy at hand is successfully tested on three different mission scenarios. Then, the capture region is identified, and includes a large set of initial conditions for which nonlinear orbit control with low-thrust propulsion is effective to achieve lunar capture and final orbit acquisition. For the purpose of achieving lunar capture, low-thrust propulsion is shown to be more effective if ignited at aposelenium.

AB European ports are facing sustainability and energy challenges, requiring changes to port functions, supply chain systems and business models. A 20-year 'port vision' could support decision-makers in designing effective strategies and prioritising investments. This study aims to identify the current energy management trends and their impact on ports and analyse the resulting scenarios. A literature review on energy management trends and ports' value chains was used to develop a conceptual framework, from which a Delphi questionnaire was created. The questionnaire was administered in two rounds, during which experts assessed the probability, impacts and desirability of energy sources, renewable energy, cold ironing, equipment, alternative fuels, energy digitalisation, human resources, emergencies and security. The results are clustered to depict the following port's energy management scenarios: most critical (related to digitalisation, cybersecurity, installation of renewable energy in small ports and electrification of docks and vehicles), most uncertain (concerning inland and/or offshore expansion of renewable energy production, use of autonomous vehicles and energy self-sufficiency of large ports) and most desired (involving investments on cold-ironing, alternatively powered cranes and cost reduction for photovoltaics and wind power). The research implications include conceptual actions to be considered and introduced in a generic European port plan and provide strategy recommendations to foster future ports.

AB In this paper, an optimal design model was developed to reduce noise and secure the torque performance of a brushless direct-current motor used in the seat of an autonomous vehicle. An acoustic model using finite elements was developed and verified through the noise test of the brushless direct-current motor. In order to reduce noise in the brushless direct-current motor and obtain a reliable optimization geometry of noiseless seat motion, parametric analysis was performed through the design of experiments and Monte Carlo statistical analysis. The slot depth, stator tooth width, slot opening, radial depth, and undercut angle of the brushless direct-current motor were selected as design parameters for design parameter analysis. Then, a non-linear prediction model was used to determine the optimal slot depth and stator tooth width to maintain the drive torque and minimize the sound pressure level at 23.26 dB or lower. The Monte Carlo statistical method was used to minimize the deviation of the sound pressure level caused by the production deviation of the design parameters. The result is that the SPL was 23.00-23.50 dB with a confidence level of approximately 99.76% when the level of production quality control was set at 3 sigma.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB A micro air vehicle (MAV) is physically lightweight, such that even a slight perturbation could affect its attitude and position tracking. To attain better autonomous flight system performance, MAVs require good control strategies to maintain their attitude stability during translational movement. However, the available control methods nowadays have fixed gain, which is associated with the chattering phenomenon and is not robust enough. To overcome the aforementioned issues, an adaptive proportional integral derivative (PID) control scheme is proposed. An adaptive mechanism based on a second-order sliding mode control is used to tune the parameter gains of the PID controller, and chattering phenomena are reduced by a fuzzy compensator. The Lyapunov stability theorem and gradient descent approach were the basis for the automated tuning. Comparisons between the proposed scheme against SMC-STA and SMC-TanH were also made. MATLAB Simulink simulation results showed the overall favourable performance of the proposed scheme. Finally, the proposed scheme was tested on a model-based platform to prove its effectiveness in a complex real-time embedded system. Orbit and waypoint followers in the platform simulation showed satisfactory performance for the MAV in completing its trajectory with the environment and sensor models as perturbation. Both tests demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme, which produces better transient performance and fast convergence towards stability.

AB In the past two decades, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained attention in applications such as industrial inspection, search and rescue, mapping, and environment monitoring. However, the autonomous navigation capability of UAVs is aggravated in GPS-deprived areas such as indoors. As a result, vision-based control and guidance methods are sought. In this paper, a vision-based target-tracking problem is formulated in the form of a cascaded adaptive nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. The proposed algorithm takes the kinematics/dynamics of the system, as well as physical and image constraints into consideration. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed to estimate uncertain and/or time-varying parameters of the model. The control space is first divided into low and high levels, and then, they are parameterised via orthonormal basis network functions, which makes the optimisation- based control scheme computationally less expensive, therefore suitable for real-time implementation. A 2-DoF model helicopter, with a coupled nonlinear pitch/yaw dynamics, equipped with a front-looking monocular camera, was utilised for hypothesis testing and evaluation via experiments. Simulated and experimental results show that the proposed method allows the model helicopter to servo toward the target efficiently in real-time while taking kinematic and dynamic constraints into account. The simulation and experimental results are in good agreement and promising.

ID INSPECTION
AB In-water visual ship hull inspection using unmanned underwater vehicles needs to be performed at very close range to the target surface because of the visibility limitations in underwater environments mainly due to light attenuation, scattering, and water turbidity. These environmental challenges result in ineffective photometric and geometric information in hull surface images and, therefore, the performance of conventional three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques is often unsatisfactory. This paper addresses a visual mapping method for 3D reconstruction of underwater ship hull surface using a monocular camera as a primary mapping sensor. The main idea of the proposed approach is to model the moderately curved hull surface as a combination of piecewise-planar panels, and to generate a global map by aligning the local images in a two-dimensional reference frame and correcting them appropriately to reflect the information of perspective projections of the 3D panels. The estimated 3D panels associated with the local images are used to extract the loop-closure relative measurements in the framework of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for precise camera trajectory estimation and 3D reconstruction results. The validity and practical feasibility of the proposed method are demonstrated using a dataset obtained in a field experiment with a full-scale ship in a real sea environment.

AB The limited coverage extension of mobile edge computing (MEC) necessitates exploring cooperation with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to leverage advanced features for future computation-intensive and mission-critical applications. Moreover, the workflow for task offloading in software-defined networking (SDN)-enabled 5G is significant to tackle in UAV-MEC networks. In this paper, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) SDN control methods for improving computing resources are proposed. DRL-based SDN controller, termed DRL-SDNC, allocates computational resources, bandwidth, and storage based on task requirements, upper-bound tolerable delays, and network conditions, using the UAV system architecture for task exchange between MECs. DRL-SDNC configures rule installation based on state observations and agent evaluation indicators, such as network congestion, user equipment computational capabilities, and energy efficiency. This paper also proposes the training deep network architecture for the DRL-SDNC, enabling interactive and autonomous policy enforcement. The agent learns from the UAV-MEC environment through experience gathering and updates its parameters using optimization methods. DRL-SDNC collaboratively adjusts hyperparameters and network architecture to enhance learning efficiency. Compared with baseline schemes, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in optimizing resource efficiency and achieving satisfied quality of service for efficient utilization of computing and communication resources in UAV-assisted networking environments.

AB With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, the intelligence and autonomy of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been significantly improved. Because the real trajectory data is often discontinuous and random, the current aircraft maneuver trajectory prediction methods are far from meeting the practical requirements of the autonomous air tasks. Especially, in order to occupy a better position rapidly where it is easier to attack the enemy, a fast and accurate maneuver trajectory prediction method for the UAVs is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the prediction model of aircraft maneuvering trajectory is built by extracting characteristic information from the historical trajectory. Aiming at the problem of slow optimization speed and easy to fall into local optimization, a global aircraft maneuver trajectory prediction method based on the Hummingbird Optimization Algorithm (HOA) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed. Then, the implementation process of the maneuver trajectory prediction method based on the above HOA-GRU network for the UAVs is presented. Finally, the aircraft maneuver trajectory prediction method is applied to a simulation training system with the discontinuous and random air task data. The simulation results show that the proposed method can predict the maneuver trajectory of the UAVs with discontinuous data in real time with less error and less time.

AB In a wireless network that conveys status updates from sources (i.e., sensors) to destinations, one of the key issues studied by existing literature is how to design an optimal source sampling strategy on account of the communication constraints which are often modeled as queues. In this paper, an alternative perspective is presented-a novel status-aware communication scheme, namely parallel communications, is proposed which allows sensors to be communication-agnostic. Specifically, the proposed scheme can determine, based on an online prediction functionality, whether a status packet is worth transmitting considering both the network condition and status prediction, such that sensors can generate status packets without communication constraints. We evaluate the proposed scheme on a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) test platform, which is integrated with a collaborative autonomous driving simulator, i.e., Simulation-of-Urban-Mobility (SUMO), to produce realistic vehicle control models and road conditions. The results show that with online status predictions, the channel occupancy is significantly reduced, while guaranteeing low status recovery error. Then the framework is applied to two scenarios: a multi-density platooning scenario, and a flight formation control scenario. Simulation results show that the scheme achieves better performance on the network level, in terms of keeping the minimum safe distance in both vehicle platooning and flight control.

AB The transportation industry is facing major challenges that come along with innovative trends like autonomous driving. Due to the growing amount of network participants, smart sensors, and mixed-critical data, scalability and interoperability have become key factors of cost-efficient vehicle engineering. One solution to overcome these challenges is the AUTOSAR Adaptive software platform. Its service-oriented communication methodology allows a standardized data exchange that is not bound to a specific middleware protocol. OPC UA is a communication standard that is well-established in modern industrial automation. In addition to its Client-Server communication pattern, the newly released Publish-Subscribe (PubSub) architecture promotes scalability. PubSub is designed to work in conjunction with Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), a collection of standards that add real-time aspects to standard Ethernet networks. TSN allows services with different requirements to share a single physical network. In this paper, we specify an integration approach of AUTOSAR Adaptive, OPC UA, and TSN. It combines the benefits of these three technologies to provide deterministic high-speed communication. Our main contribution is the architecture for the binding between Adaptive Platform and OPC UA. With a prototypical implementation, we prove that a combination of OPC UA Client-Server and PubSub qualifies as a middleware solution for service-oriented communication in AUTOSAR.

AB In this paper, the first-ever measurements of the wake of a full-scale wind turbine using an instrumented uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) are reported. The key enabler for this novel measurement approach is the integration of fast response aerodynamic probe technology with miniaturized hardware and software for UAVs that enable autonomous UAV operation. The measurements, made to support the development of advanced wind simulation tools, are made in the near-wake (0.5D-3D, where D is rotor diameter) region of a 2 MW wind turbine that is located in a topography of complex terrain and varied vegetation. Downwind of the wind turbine, profiles of the wind speed show that there is strong three-dimensional shear in the near-wake flow. Along the centerline of the wake, the deficit in wind speed is a consequence of wakes from the rotor, nacelle, and tower. By comparison with the profiles away from the centerline, the shadowing effects of nacelle and tower diminish downstream of 2.5D. Away from the centerline, the deficit in wind speed is approximately constant approximate to 25%. However, along the centerline, the deficit is approximate to 65% near to the rotor, 0.5D-1.75D, and only decreases to approximate to 25% downstream of 2.5D. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4004707]

AB Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonators use is widespread, from electronic filters and oscillators to physical sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. These devices' ubiquity, small size, and low power consumption make them ideal for use in systems such as CubeSats, micro aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and micro-robots operating in radiation environments. Radiation's interaction with materials manifests as atomic displacement and ionization, resulting in mechanical and electronic property changes, photocurrents, and charge buildup. This study examines silicon (Si) ion irradiation's interaction with piezoelectrically transduced MEMS resonators. Furthermore, the effect of adding a dielectric silicon oxide (SiO2) thin film is unveiled. Aluminum nitride on silicon (AlN-on-Si) and AlN-SiO2-Si bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators are designed and fabricated. The devices are irradiated using 2 MeV Si+ ions at various fluxes up to a total fluence of 5 x 10(14) cm(-2). A time anneal is conducted to characterize device recovery. Scattering (S-) parameters are measured in situ. Specific damage coefficients are derived to describe the radiation effect on resonant frequency (f(r)), quality factor (Q), motional resistance (R-m), and electromechanical coupling factor (k(eff)(2)). Furthermore, the damage coefficients for the bulk material properties of elastic modulus (E) and the piezoelectric coefficient (d(31)) are found.

AB This paper aims to solve the trajectory tracking con-trol problem for an autonomous vehicle based on reinforcement learning methods. Existing reinforcement learning approaches have found limited successful applications on safety-critical tasks in the real world mainly due to two challenges: 1) sim-to-real transfer; 2) closed-loop stability and safety concern. In this paper, we propose an actor-critic-style framework SRL-TR2, in which the RL-based TRajectory TRackers are trained under the safety constraints and then deployed to a full-size vehicle as the lateral controller. To improve the generalization ability, we adopt a light-weight adapter State and Action Space Alignment (SASA) to establish mapping relations between the simulation and reality. To address the safety concern, we leverage an expert strategy to take over the control when the safety constraints are not satisfied. Hence, we conduct safe explorations during the training process and improve the stability of the policy. The experiments show that our agents can achieve one-shot transfer across simulation scenarios and unseen realistic scenarios, finishing the field tests with average running time less than 10 ms/step and average lateral error less than 0.1 m under the speed ranging from 12 km/h to 18 km/h. A video of the field tests is available at https://youtu.be/pjWcN_fV24g.

AB In this letter, a variation of the classical MarkovDubins problem is considered, which deals with curvature constrained least-cost paths in a plane with prescribed initial and final configurations, different bounds for the sinistral and dextral curvatures, and penalties mu(L) and mu(R) for the sinistral and dextral turns, respectively. The addressed problem generalizes the classical Markov-Dubins problem and the asymmetric sinistral/dextral Markov-Dubins problem. The proposed formulation can be used to model an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a penalty associated with a turn due to the required additional thrust to maintain altitude and airspeed while turning, or a UAV with different curvature bounds and costs for the sinistral and dextral turns due to hardware failures. Using optimal control theory, the main result of this letter shows that the optimal path belongs to a set of at most 21 candidate paths, each comprising of at most five segments. Unlike in the classical Markov-Dubins problem, the CCC path, which is a candidate path for the classical Markov-Dubins problem, is not optimal for the weighted Markov-Dubins problem. Moreover, the obtained list of candidate paths for the weighted Markov-Dubins problem reduces to the standard CSC and CCC paths and the corresponding degenerate paths when mu(L) and mu(R )approach zero.

AB Real-time recognition of non-driving behaviors is of great importance in conditionally automated driving, as it determines the takeover time budget, which in turn has a huge impact on the performance of the takeover. Here, a novel real-time non-driving behavior recognition system (RNBRS) integrating self-powered, low-cost, easy-to-manufacture triboelectric sensors, and a deep learning model is proposed. The structure, working mechanism, and electrical characteristics of triboelectric sensors are investigated and analyzed. Through the ingenious structural design of single-electrode triboelectric sensors and driving simulation experiments under conditional automated driving, non-driving behaviors are captured in the form of electrical signals. A well-trained long short-term memory network model is adopted to recognize the five most typical non-driving behaviors, including phone, console touchpad, driving, monitoring driving, and no operation, and test accuracy of 93.5% is achieved. Demonstration of a set of controlled experiments shows that RNBRS enables vehicles with conditional automation to dynamically adjust takeover time budget based on driver behavior, therefore significantly improving both safety and stability of takeover. This study opens new frontiers for the development of self-powered electronics and inspires new thoughts on human-machine interaction and the safety of autonomous vehicles.

AB The manipulation capabilities of flapping-wing flying robots (FWFRs) is a problem barely studied. This is a direct consequence of the load-carrying capacity limitation of the flapping-wing robots. Ornithopters will improve the existent multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) since they could perform longer missions and offer a safe interaction in proximity to humans. This technology also opens the possibility to perch in some trees and perform tasks such as obtaining samples from nature, enabling biologists to collect samples in remote places, or assisting people in rescue missions by carrying medicines or first-aid kits. This paper presents a very lightweight manipulator (79.7g) prototype to be mounted on an ornithopter. The distribution of the mass on the flapping-wing robot is sensitive and an extra lumped mass far from the center-of-mass (CoM) of the robot deteriorates the flight stability. A configuration was proposed to avoid changing the CoM. Flight experiments show that adding the arm to the robot only moved the CoM 6mm and the performance of the flight with the manipulator has been satisfactory. Plucking leaf is chosen as an application to the designed system and several experimental tests confirmed successful sampling of leaves by the prototype.

AB The aim of the study is to develop a unique approach to the problem of material handling control by means of artificial intelligence (computer intelligence) with respect to automated guided vehicle (AGV) path routing. In the analysed case the material handling system is fully integrated with IT tools and is considered under the constraint that the path cannot be changed during travel along a given loop, therefore, the path is predicted prior to every successive loop. The vector (ordered set) of stations requesting transportation service was determined by means of fuzzy logic, while the sequence of stations in a loop was optimised with genetic algorithms. The dispatch station can play the role of a switching station between the zones, where every AGV path loop begins and ends. This paper presents a system for both AGVs and semi-autonomous transportation vehicles where the human driver is informed of the route to follow. The subsequent verification of the developed model, by means of computer simulation, confirms that the proposed solution is effective. While the presented solution can be applied in a discrete manufacturing system, it can be considered as a part of the general manufacturing concept. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with multi-modal transmission can achieve high efficient data collection for underwater sensor networks. However, multi-modal transmission and trajectory planning impose great challenges on data collection in complex underwater environments. Most prior studies focus on design of multi-modal architecture, but lack of available implementation and consideration of AUVs' trajectory. Meanwhile, existing trajectory planning research cannot work well on data collection with multiple complex tasks simultaneously. In this paper, an efficient Data Collection scheme for Multi-modal underwater sensor networks based on Deep reinforcement learning (DCMD) is proposed to solve the above challenges. We first propose an optimal multi-modal transmission selection algorithm that provides an implementation to improve transmission efficiency. Then we propose a distributed multi-AUVs' trajectory planning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning by AUVs' collaborations, considering transmission situation, ocean currents and underwater obstacles, to maximize collection rate and energy efficiency. In addition, we joint transmission and trajectory planning in a protocol to improve collection efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that DCMD achieves better performance on efficiency and reliability than four state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its great advantage on collecting data for USNs.

AB Most existing visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) simply rejects dynamic object features to improve navigation performance, rendering the loss of dynamic object motion information, whereas some emerging applications, such as autonomous driving, need to accurately perceive the movement of surrounding objects for making decisions. Aiming at performing accurate pose estimations for both the ego vehicle and surrounding objects, we propose a tightly coupled estimator for visual-inertial navigation and multiobject tracking, called VIMOT. The proposed system directly utilizes a 3-D bounding box (BB) generated by an object detector to represent an object. On this basis, a multilevel data association method together with a geometry-based dynamic object classification method is applied for object tracking. Instead of rejecting the features of dynamic objects, their visual features are fully exploited in our system to form the object-related factors, which are jointly optimized with the static visual feature factors and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) preintegration factors for both ego-vehicle and multiobject state estimation. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated on both public datasets and real-world experiments. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art similar methods, the results show that integrating multiobject tracking into VINS can significantly improve the pose accuracy of both the VINS and tracked objects, which makes both estimations benefit from each other.

AB In this paper, we investigate unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted communication systems that require quasi-balanced data rates in uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), as well as users' heterogeneous traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly investigate joint UL-DL optimization for UAV assisted systems under heterogeneous requirements. A hybrid-mode multiple access (HMMA) scheme is proposed toward heterogeneous traffic, where non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) targets high average data rate, while orthogonal multiple access (OMA) aims to meet users' instantaneous rate demands by compensating for their rates. HMMA enables a higher degree of freedom in multiple access and achieves a superior minimum average rate among users than the UAV assisted NOMA or OMA schemes. Under HMMA, a joint UL-DL resource allocation algorithm is proposed with a closed-form optimal solution for UL/DL power allocation to achieve quasi-balanced average rates for UL and DL. Furthermore, considering the error propagation in successive interference cancellation (SIC) of NOMA, an enhanced-HMMA scheme is proposed, which demonstrates high robustness against SIC error and a higher minimum average rate than the HMMA scheme.

AB We have developed and demonstrated an intelligent auto-organizing aerial robotic sensor network system composed of cameras installed on UAVs and ground fixtures for urban surveillance using the decentralised control paradigm. The system can auto-organize to meet user requirements, changes to user requirements and when new UAVs or ground cameras are added or are lost due to failure. User designated targets can be automatically tracked and handed over from one camera to another, to ensure continuous tracking. The cameras can also self adjust their positions and pointing angles to cooperatively cover areas of interest completely. We have achieved this by designing a software architecture for managing multiple interacting algorithms online and in parallel, facilitating incremental software development and debugging. We have adapted algorithms to become computationally efficient and effective for real world use online and on-board the UAVs, and ensured that the integration of video analytics and tactical behaviours work in real world settings. We have also achieved near optimal, online close coordination of the UAVs and ground cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept of a fully integrated intelligent auto-organizing aerial robotic sensor network system of cameras installed on UAVs and ground fixtures for urban surveillance.

AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have great value with their ability to execute hazardous and time-consuming missions over water surfaces. Recently, USVs for inland waterways have attracted increasing attention for their potential application in autonomous monitoring, transportation, and cleaning. However, unlike sailing in open water, the challenges posed by scenes of inland waterways, such as the complex distribution of obstacles, the global positioning system (GPS) signal denial environment, the reflection of bank-side structures, and the fog over the water surface, all impede USV application in inland waterways. To address these problems and stimulate relevant research, we introduce USVInland, a multisensor dataset for USVs in inland waterways. The collection of USVInland spans a trajectory of more than 26 km in diverse real-world scenes of inland waterways using various modalities, including lidar, stereo cameras, millimeter-wave radar, GPS, and inertial measurement units (IMUs). Based on the requirements and challenges in the perception and navigation of USVs for inland waterways, we build benchmarks for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), stereo matching, and water segmentation. We evaluate common algorithms for the above tasks to determine the influence of unique inland waterway scenes on algorithm performance. Our dataset and the development tools are available at.(1)

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; MODEL
AB With the rapid development of wireless communication technology and intelligent mobile devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cluster is becoming increasingly popular in both civilian and military applications. Recently, a swarm intelligence-based UAV cluster study, aiming to enable efficient and autonomous collaboration, has drawn lots of interest. However, new security problems may be introduced with such swarm intelligence. In this work, we perform the first detailed security analysis to a kind of flocking-based UAV cluster with 5 policies, an upgrade version of the well-known Boids model. Targeting a realistic threat in a source-to-destination flying task, we design a data spoofing strategy and further perform complete vulnerability analysis. We reveal that such design and implementation are highly vulnerable. After breaking through the authentication of ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol by rushing attack, an attacker can masquerade as the first-arrival UAV within a specific scope of destination and generate data spoofing of arrival status to the following UAVs, so as to interfere with their normal flying paths of destination arrival and cause unexpected arrival delays amid urgent tasks. Experiments with detailed analysis from the 5-UAV cluster to the 10-UAV cluster are conducted to show specific feature composition-based attack effect and corresponding average delay. We also discuss promising defense suggestions leveraging the insights from our analysis.

AB Human curiosity for the natural world is the leading factor for the progress in deep ocean exploration. However, only in the last 60 years has the technological capability satisfied the human desire to reach the deepest point of the oceans. In this paper, the history of human exploration to the deep oceans is reviewed with a focus on the lessons learned from these pioneers. From this review, it is shown that deep-sea trenches remain one of the least explored ocean ecosystems due to a wide range of issues such as lack of investigation platforms and cruise funding. Although humans have twice reached the deepest point of the oceans, up to now there were no operational platforms for ocean scientists to freely conduct scientific research in hadal trenches. Therefore, a new strategy is being introduced in China to overcome the technical and funding issues to develop a comprehensive investigation system for hadal trenches. Through more than four years' practice, the new strategy has proved to be effective and the first phase of the comprehensive investigation system has been constructed. In this paper, this new strategy and its progress are presented and the underlying philosophy is explained.

DE Orthogonal waveforms; Genetic algorithm; Multi-target positioning;

ID NAVIGATION; LOCALIZATION
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are commonly used in deep water industries. Because the sound wave is the most effective carrier for transmitting information underwater, underwater acoustic positioning systems (UAPSs) are regarded as essential positioning and navigation components of AUVs or ROVs. Multi-target positioning is the most important emergent trend being explored for current UAPSs, within which signal design is a major issue. The designed waveforms determine the detection performance, user number, and system complexity of the UAPS. Conventional UAPSs use chirp signals or FM signals, which are disadvantaged by low user number, complex implementation, and low utilization bandwidth. In effort to solve these problems, we designed a group of signals based on orthogonal waveforms, then used a genetic algorithm to design a group of phase-coding signals, and finally analyzed the system as established in terms of time measurement precision, performance in the multipath environment, and the aliasing effects of multi-target signals. Simulation results showed that the signals we designed have ideal correlation performance and high time resolution. We further conducted an experiment in shallow water to test the proposed method's performance, and again found that the signals are suitable for multi-target UAPSs and thus show favorable potential in ocean engineering applications.

AB Regular grid ("lawnmower'') survey is a classical strategy for synoptic sampling of the ocean. Is it possible to achieve a more effective use of available resources if one takes into account a priori knowledge about variability in magnitudes of uncertainty and decorrelation scales? In this article, we develop and compare the performance of several path-planning algorithms: optimized "lawnmower,'' a graph-search algorithm (A*), and a fully nonlinear genetic algorithm. We use the machinery of the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) to quantify the ability of a vehicle fleet to synoptically map distribution of phytoplankton off the central California coast. We used satellite and in situ data to specify covariance information required by the BLUE estimator. Computational experiments showed that two types of sampling strategies are possible: a suboptimal space-filling design (produced by the "lawnmower'' and the A* algorithms) and an optimal uncertainty-aware design (produced by the genetic algorithm). Unlike the space-filling designs that attempted to cover the entire survey area, the optimal design focused on revisiting areas of high uncertainty. Results of the multivehicle experiments showed that fleet performance predictors, such as cumulative speed or the weight of the fleet, predicted the performance of a homogeneous fleet well; however, these were poor predictors for comparing the performance of different platforms.

AB This paper treats the question of control of a biorobotic autonomous undersea vehicle (BAUV) in the yaw plane using a biomimetic mechanism resembling the pectoral fins of fish. These fins are assumed to undergo a combined sway-yaw motion and the bias angle is treated as a control input, which is varied in time to accomplish the maneuver in the yaw-plane. The forces and moments produced by the flapping foil are parametrized using computational fluid dynamics. A finite-difference-based, Cartesian grid immersed boundary solver is used to simulate flow past the flapping foils. The periodic forces and moments are expanded as a Fourier series and a discrete-time model of the BAUV is developed for the purpose of control. An optimal control system for the set point control of the yaw angle and an inverse control law for the tracking of time-varying yaw angle trajectories are designed. Simulation results show that in the closed-loop system, the yaw angle follows commanded sinusoidal trajectories and the segments of the intersample yaw trajectory remain close to the discrete-time reference trajectory. It is also found that the fins suitably located near the center of mass of the vehicle provide better maneuverability.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently been gaining considerable attention due to their vast range of potential applications. To facilitate UAV use cases involving beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS), cellular networks have emerged as ground connectivity points, enabling remote control and payload communication for UAV links. However, the availability of limited datasets obstructs the study of cellular technology coverage for UAV flights at different altitudes and the development of machine learning (ML) techniques for improving UAV communication and navigation. In this article, we introduce raw LTE in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) sample data sets obtained from physical field experiments of the NSF AERPAW experimentation platform. A UAV equipped with a software-defined radio (SDR) was flown at altitudes ranging from 30 m to 110 m, collecting raw I/Q samples from an SDR-based LTE base station operating at 3.51 GHz. We have implemented a standardized metadata format that can be used to replicate the results obtained from the collected datasets. The post-processing of raw I/Q samples is described and representative results are provided. In the end, we give examples of potential uses of the provided dataset, post-processing sample code, and I/Q collection sample experiment code by other ML, wireless, and UAV researchers.

AB Cooperative, connected and automated mobility (CCAM) has a great potential to change drastically the mobility landscape and improve safety on the roads by assisting drivers to take the best decisions in given circumstances or by supporting autonomous driving features aboard the car, among other expected benefits. Yet, providing CCAM services poses not only technical but also business challenges, especially in cross-border environments. In this paper, we present a general techno-economic methodology intended first, to identify the cross-border ecosystem and the potential business models to enable CCAM services provision and second, to derive the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of deploying the required Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle to Network (V2N) infrastructure. As an illustration, we then apply this methodology to a canonical Cooperative Lane Merging (CLM) scenario in a representative border environment (i.e., the Brenner pass between Italy and Austria). On this occasion, the impact of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) placement on the deployment cost is also discussed and finally, a cost allocation model is developed to link these deployment costs to the key stakeholders within the identified business models. Results aim to give insights into the different deployment strategies in typical cross-border environments and settings.

AB The growth of IoT, edge and mobile Artificial Intelligence (AI) is supporting urban authorities exploit the wealth of information collected by Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), to drive the development of transformative intelligent transport applications for addressing smart city challenges. A critical challenge is timely and efficient road infrastructure maintenance. This paper proposes an intelligent hierarchical framework for road infrastructure maintenance that exploits the latest developments in 6G communication technologies, deep learning techniques, and mobile edge AI training approaches. The proposed framework abides with the stringent requirements of training efficient machine learning applications for CAV, and is able to exploit the vast numbers of CAVs forecasted to be present on future road networks. At the core of our framework is a novel Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) model which fuses imagery and sensory data to perform pothole detection. Experiments show the proposed model can achieve state of the art performance in comparison to existing approaches while being simple, cost-effective and computationally efficient to deploy. The proposed system can form part of a federated learning framework for facilitating large scale real-time road surface condition monitoring and support adaptive resource allocation for road infrastructure maintenance.

AB With the rapid increase of the number of autonomous driving vehicles, more and more radars working on a similar frequency band are equipped on vehicles, which incurs risks of automotive radar interference. Therefore, a precise interference recognition method is becoming a compelling task. In this article, a novel interference recognition network, called IRNet, is proposed to recognize eight types of interference signals that include mutual interference, unintended interference, and adverse intended interference. First, autocorrelation features of interference signals are obtained via calculating their autocorrelation functions (ACFs) and converted as two-dimensional feature images. Next, these images are employed as inputs of the IRNet that owns significant representation power and adaptive feature selection ability. Finally, the prediction types of interference will be output via the IRNet directly. The robustness of autocorrelation features is verified via simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve 90.85% overall recognition accuracy when the jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) is -14 dB and nearly 100% when JNR > -8 dB. Compared with six state-of-the-art methods, the IRNet achieves much better recognition performance, especially under lower JNR conditions with relatively lower and acceptable computational complexity. Results on measured signals also verify the powerful generalization ability of the proposed method.

AB With the ever-increasing advancements in the technology of driver assistant systems, there is a need for a comprehensive way to identify traffic conflicts to avoid collisions. Although significant research efforts have been devoted to traffic conflict techniques applied for junctions, there is dearth of research on these methods for motorways. This paper presents the validation of a traffic conflict prediction algorithm applied to a motorway scenario in a simulated environment. An automatic video analysis system was developed to identify lane change and rear-end conflicts as ground truth. Using these conflicts, the prediction ability of the traffic conflict technique was validated in an integrated simulation framework. This framework consisted of a sub-microscopic simulator, which provided an appropriate testbed to accurately simulate the components of an intelligent vehicle, and a microscopic traffic simulator able to generate the surrounding traffic. Results from this framework show that for a 10% false alarm rate, approximately 80% and 73% of rear-end and lane change conflicts were accurately predicted, respectively. Despite the fact that the algorithm was not trained using the virtual data, the sensitivity was high. This highlights the transferability of the algorithm to similar road networks, providing a benchmark for the identification of traffic conflict and a relevant step for developing safety management strategies for autonomous vehicles.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING
AB Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising technique for designing a model-free controller by interacting with the environment. Several researchers have applied RL to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for motion control, such as trajectory tracking. However, the existing RL-based controller usually assumes that the unknown AUV dynamics keep invariant during the operation period, limiting its further application in the complex underwater environment. In this article, a novel meta-RL-based control scheme is proposed for trajectory tracking control of AUV in the presence of unknown and time-varying dynamics. To this end, we divide the tracking task for AUV with time-varying dynamics into multiple specific tasks with fixed time-varying dynamics, to which we apply meta-RL for training to distill the general control policy. The obtained control policy can transfer to the testing phase with high adaptability. Inspired by the line-of-sight (LOS) tracking rule, we formulate each specific task as a Markov decision process (MDP) with a well-designed state and reward function. Furthermore, a novel policy network with an attention module is proposed to extract the hidden information of AUV dynamics. The simulation environment with time-varying dynamics is established, and the simulation results reveal the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB The registration of point clouds in urban environments faces problems such as dynamic vehicles and pedestrians, changeable road environments, and GPS inaccuracies. The state-of-the-art methodologies have usually combined the dynamic object tracking and/or static feature extraction data into a point cloud towards the solution of these problems. However, there is the occurrence of minor initial position errors due to these methodologies. In this paper, the authors propose a fast and robust registration method that exhibits no need for the detection of any dynamic and/or static objects. This proposed methodology may be able to adapt to higher initial errors. The initial steps of this methodology involved the optimization of the object segmentation under the application of a series of constraints. Based on this algorithm, a novel multi-layer nested RANSAC algorithmic framework is proposed to iteratively update the registration results. The robustness and efficiency of this algorithm is demonstrated on several high dynamic scenes of both short and long time intervals with varying initial offsets. A LiDAR odometry experiment was performed on the KITTI data set and our extracted urban data-set with a high dynamic urban road, and the average of the horizontal position errors was compared to the distance traveled that resulted in 0.45% and 0.55% respectively.

Bathymetric measurements are converted into the form of digital images by interpolation at the beginning of the process. Next, image texture features are obtained and integrated into terrain navigability parameters to define an underwater terrain feature vector. Then, by scanning the underwater terrain map using real-time data, the best match between their feature vectors are considered as the position estimation. Simulation results suggest that this method is reliable when signal to noise ratio is under 2 dB. In addition, the method is shown to be robust to image rotation as large as 20 and scale variance as small as 50 x 50 pixels, which means it is not sensitive to direction errors and the distance between the underwater vehicle and the bottom may vary. When image resolution is 1 m(2)/pixel and scanning step is 1 m/move, accuracy of the method can be as high as 1 m in suitable terrains. In comparison with terrain contour matching algorithm, performance of the proposed method is more stable when direction error is bigger than 10 and the accuracy is approximately 50% better while noise and scale vary in the real-time images.

AB This paper proposes a novel 3D sensor node to establish relative measurements within a robot network. The developed sensor nodes employ ultrasonic-based range measurement and infrared-based bearing measurement for spatial localization of robots. The sensor is low power, lightweight, low cost, and designed to be applicable across many robotic platforms, including microaerial vehicles. The proposed sensor design requires only two robots to perform relative measurements of each other and achieves a measurement accuracy of 0.96-cm Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) for range and 0.3 degrees RMSE for bearing. The sensor nodes are scalable and can be configured using either Star or Mesh protocols with a maximum of 10-Hz update rates over a detection range of 9 m. The correspondence issue of having multiple robots is resolved using time division multiple access methods where different time slots are used by each sensor node. These features are verified by multiple experimental evaluations on a multirobot team with both ground and aerial agents. The proposed approach allows multirobot localization in scenarios where supportive positioning services such as GPS are unavailable. As a result, even basic robots, which lack powerful simultaneous localization and mapping capabilities, will be capable of autonomous navigation by accessing the positional information provided by the sensor network.

AB This paper presents a computationally efficient real-time trajectory planning framework for typical unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) performing autonomous air-to-surface (A/S) attack. It combines the benefits of inverse dynamics optimization method and receding horizon optimal control technique. Firstly, the ground attack trajectory planning problem is mathematically formulated as a receding horizon optimal control problem (RHC-OCP). In particular, an approximate elliptic launch acceptable region (LAR) model is proposed to model the critical weapon delivery constraints. Secondly, a planning algorithm based on inverse dynamics optimization, which has high computational efficiency and good convergence properties, is developed to solve the RHC-OCP in real-time. Thirdly, in order to improve robustness and adaptivity in a dynamic and uncertain environment, a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) receding horizon control architecture is introduced and a regular real-time update strategy is proposed as well, and the real-time feedback can be achieved and the not-converged situations can be handled. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of this framework, and the results also show that the presented technique is well suited for real-time implementation in dynamic and uncertain environment.

AB Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) deployed with deep learning models have been widely applied both in civil and military. However, the vulnerability of the deployed model to adversarial attacks has raised security concerns. Previous studies have mainly explored adversarial attacks in the digital domain. While physical attacks have posed a more serious threat to UAVs. In this paper, we have explored a novel Robust Physical Attack against UAVs named, which directly threatens the flight safety of UAVs. Specifically, three attacks are proposed in : Hiding Attack (HA), Yaw Attack (YA), and Obstacle Attack (OA). To launch the attacks, we overcome three domain-design challenges, including continuous perturbation, digital-physical domain gap, and optimum perturbation generation. For continuous perturbation, we have introduced a nested patch that realizes attacks at any distance. Further, a series of transformations are considered to narrow the gap between the digital and physical domains. Then, we proposed a time-dependent mechanism for generating optimum perturbation. We conducted comprehensive experiments in the digital domain, simulation environment, and physical domain. The experimental results validate the robustness of the proposed framework. In the digital domain, outperforms the baseline by $54.9\%$ average attack success rate (ASR). More importantly, is still effective in both the simulation environment and the physical domain, achieving an average ASR of 100% .

AB The array formed by multiple AUVs can effectively improve target detection capabilities when each AUV is equipped with a sonar unit. However, due to the limited data processing capabilities of an AUV and its communication range limitations, efficiently forming and transforming arrays are challenging. Therefore, this article innovatively uses the optimal assignment in operations research to solve this problem and proposes an element zero method to efficiently assign multiple AUVs to arrays. First, a cost matrix consisting of the distance cost of each AUV for reaching their different assigned positions in the array is generated. Second, the preprocessing and postprocessing steps are combined to increase the number of zeros in the generated cost matrix. Third, the space tree method based on the depth-first search rule is used to find n independent zeros of different rows and columns. Fourth, the optimal assignment is adjusted after considering the communication range limitations. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulation experiments of array formation and transformation are performed for multiple numbers of AUVs. The results of this article show that the proposed method has significant advantages over the Hungarian method, and thus suggests that the proposed method is effective.

AB To incorporate the inherent superiorities of an experienced, proficient driver, a human-like control scheme for automated steering systems is proposed in this paper based on the concept of "staying within the safety zone". Designed in the precognitive architecture, the novel control scheme takes into account key characteristics of human steering behaviors in high-speed conditions by determining the steering activation and the steering intensity based on the inversed-time-to-lane-crossing (iTLC), generating smooth, moderate steering actions to maintain the vehicle within a predefined safety zone. The proposed control scheme provides a universal solution for steering control in multiple driving scenarios by accordingly allocating the safety zone to ensure the driving safety therein. A simulator experiment was conducted to test both the fully autonomous and the driver-in-the-loop performance of the proposed control scheme in lane keeping and lane changing. A traditional error-minimizing control algorithm was implemented as a comparison. Results indicate that the novel scheme outperforms the conventional control schemes by yielding higher steering performance, lower steering effort, and higher robustness, proving the benefits of imitating the patterns of human control behaviors in the control algorithm of an automated steering system.

ID RAIL PASSENGERS; TIME USE; EXTENT; MODEL; WORK
AB Research on multitasking during travel has increased, yet most studies have focused on public transit passengers. This work investigated travel-based multitasking and its potential determinants across multiple travel modes (automobile, nonmotorized, and transit) using a 2016 survey of around 650 commuters in the Portland, Oregon, region. First, exploratory factor analysis on 23 activities yielded two activity groups: those related to information and communications technologies (texting/emailing/messaging, reading electronically, and using social websites/apps) and those that are more passive in nature (viewing scenery or people watching and thinking/daydreaming). Next, mode-specific binary logit models predicted participation in each activity (or activity group) as a function of travel time, traveler socio-demographics, perceptions, and other factors. Travelers using riding modes (transit riders and auto passengers) engaged in a greater number and variety of activities, while vehicle (auto and bicycle) operators did fewer and more passive activities. For walking/bicycling commuters, exercising or being physically active appeared to be an enjoyable and productive use of travel time. On the other hand, many instances of travel-based multitasking for transit passengers may be more about coping with a burdensome or boring commute or the result of being time poor. These findings offer important implications for understanding motivations for travel-based multitasking, sustainable transportation mode choices, and future demands for autonomous vehicles.

ID HISTOGRAMS; INTENSITY; VISION; DEPTH
AB Driver assistance systems and autonomous robotics rely on the deployment of several sensors for environment perception. Compared to LiDAR systems, the inexpensive vision sensors can capture the 3D scene as perceived by a driver in terms of appearance and depth cues. Indeed, providing 3D image understanding capabilities to vehicles is an essential target in order to infer scene semantics in urban environments. One of the challenges that arises from the navigation task in naturalistic urban scenarios is the detection of road participants (e.g., cyclists, pedestrians and vehicles). In this regard, this paper tackles the detection and orientation estimation of cars, pedestrians and cyclists, employing the challenging and naturalistic KITTI images. This work proposes 3D-aware features computed from stereo color images in order to capture the appearance and depth peculiarities of the objects in road scenes. The successful part-based object detector, known as DPM, is extended to learn richer models from the 2.5D data (color and disparity), while also carrying out a detailed analysis of the training pipeline. A large set of experiments evaluate the proposals, and the best performing approach is ranked on the KITTI website. Indeed, this is the first work that reports results with stereo data for the KITTI object challenge, achieving increased detection ratios for the classes car and cyclist compared to a baseline DPM.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted growing attention in enhancing the performance of mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) since they can act as aerial servers (ASs) and have the autonomous nature to collect data for edge computing. In this paper, we consider to construct a virtual antenna array (VAA) consists of mobile sensor nodes (MSNs) and adopt collaborative beamforming (CB) to achieve long-distance and efficient uplink data transmissions with the ASs. First, we formulate a low interference and high-performance uplink transmission multi-objective optimization problem (UTMOP) of the CB-based UAV-assisted MWSN to simultaneously improve the total transmission rates, suppress the total maximum sidelobe levels (SLLs) and reduce the total propulsion energy consumptions of MSNs by jointly optimizing the positions and excitation current weights of MSN-enabled VAA and the order of communicating with different ASs. Then, we propose an improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (INSGA-III) with chaos initialization, average grade mechanism and hybrid-solution generate strategy to solve the problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the formulated UTMOP, and it has better performance than some other benchmark methods and peer algorithms.

AB The path planning of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in three-dimensional (3D) environment is an important part of the entire UAV's autonomous control system. In the constrained mission environment, planning optimal paths for multiple UAVs is a challenging problem. To solve this problem, the time stamp segmentation (TSS) model is adopted to simplify the handling of coordination cost of UAVs, and then a novel hybrid algorithm called HIPSO-MSOS is proposed by combining improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) and modified symbiotic organisms search (MSOS). The exploration and exploitation abilities are combined efficiently, which brings good performance to the proposed algorithm. The cubic B-spline curve is used to smooth the generated path so that the planned path is flyable for UAV. To assess performance, the simulation is carried out in the virtual three-dimensional complex terrain environment. The experimental results show that the HIPSO-MSOS algorithm can successfully generate feasible and effective paths for each UAV, and its performance is superior to the other five algorithms, namely PSO, Firefly, DE, MSOS and HSGWO-MSOS algorithms in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, stability and robustness. Moreover, HIPSO-MSOS performs better than other tested methods in multi-objective optimization problems. Thus, the HIPSO-MSOS algorithm is a feasible and reliable alternative for some difficult and practical problems.

DE Unmanned aerial vehicle; keyfilter-aware visual tracking; intermittent
   contextual learning; deep feature
AB Visual tracking, one of the most favorable multimedia applications, has been widely used in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for civil infrastructure monitoring, aerial cinematography, autonomous navigation, etc. Most existing trackers utilize deep convolutional feature to enhance tracking robustness in scenarios of various appearance variation. However, they commonly neglect speed which is crucial for UAV with restricted calculation resources. In this work, a novel correlation filter-based keyfilter-aware tracker with a new intermittent context learning strategy is proposed to efficiently and effectively alleviate the problems of background clutter, deficient description, occlusion, illumination change, etc. Specifically, context information is utilized to empower the filter higher discriminating ability through response repression of the omnidirectional context patches. Furthermore, keyfilter is produced from the periodically selected keyframe. The latest produced keyfilter is used to restrain the current filter's corrupted changes. Most importantly, context learning of correlation filter is implemented intermittently to fully increase the tracking efficiency. This intermittent learning strategy can ensure every filter maintain context awareness owing to the restriction of keyfilter, periodically enhancing the context awareness. Substantial experiments on three challenging UAV benchmarks totally with 213 image sequences have shown that our tracker surpasses the state-of-the-art results, and exhibits a remarkable generality in short-term and long-term UAV tracking tasks as well as a variety of challenging attributes.

ID DEPLOYMENT
AB The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in IoT networks, especially data collection, has received extensive attention. Due to the urgency of the mission and limitation of the network cost, the mission completion time and number of UAVs are research hotspots. Most studies mainly focus on the trajectory optimization of the UAV to shorten the mission completion time. However, under different data collection modes, flying mode (FM) and hovering mode (HM), the collection time will also greatly affect the mission completion time. This paper studies the data collection from ground IoT devices (GIDs) in Multi-UAV enabled IoT networks. The problem of data collection is formulated to minimize the aerial cost and maximum mission completion time of UAVs by optimizing mission allocation, UAV trajectory, and UAVs' flying speeds. In view of the complexity and non-convexity of the formulated problem, we propose a heuristic-based approximation algorithm to optimize the mission allocation of UAVs. Then, we specifically optimize the trajectory of the UAV for GIDs to minimize the flight time and collection time. Since the UAV's flying speed affects the mission completion time, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is adopted to optimize it. Simulation results show that our scheme achieves the performance of near-optimal solution.

AB To meet the requirements of safety, concealment, and timeliness of trajectory planning during the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) penetration process, a three-dimensional path planning algorithm is proposed based on improved holonic particle swarm optimization (IHPSO). Firstly, the requirements of terrain threat, radar detection, and penetration time in the process of UAV penetration are quantified. Regarding radar threats, a radar echo analysis method based on radar cross section (RCS) and the spatial situation is proposed to quantify the concealment of UAV penetration. Then the structure-particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is improved from three aspects. First, the conversion ability of the search strategy is enhanced by using the system clustering method and the information entropy grouping strategy instead of random grouping and constructing the state switching conditions based on the fitness function. Second, the unclear setting of iteration numbers is addressed by using particle spacing to create the termination condition of the algorithm. Finally, the trajectory is optimized to meet the intended requirements by building a predictive control model and using the IHPSO for simulation verification. Numerical examples show the superiority of the proposed method over the existing PSO methods.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising communication platform to assist terrestrial networks. In this work, we aim to provide relay communication to the blocked or low-quality terrestrial networks via an aerial relay. Nevertheless, major issues of the considered system are the worrying security and limited service time. Thus, we study a novel aerial relay system via collaborative beamforming (CB) by exploiting a UAV-enabled virtual antenna array (UVAA) to achieve a secure and energy-efficient communication for remote ground users (GUs). Specifically, we formulate a secure and energy-efficient communication multi-objective optimization problem (SECMOP) to circumvent the effects of the known and unknown eavesdroppers and minimize the propulsion energy consumption of UAVs, by optimizing the hovering positions and excitation current weights of UAVs and the scheduling for communicating with the remote GUs. The formulated SECMOP is challenging and proven to be NP-hard. Thus, we propose an improved evolutionary computation method with several enhanced designs to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed IMODAOM against various benchmark algorithms. Moreover, we find that the UVAA-based relay can achieve substantial energy consumption reduction as compared to the multi-hop relay scheme.

AB At least four non-coplanar anchor nodes (ANs) are required for the time-of-arrival (ToA)-based three-dimensional (3D) positioning to enable unique position estimation. Direct method (DM) and particle filter (PF) algorithms were developed to address the three-anchor ToA-based 3D positioning problem. The proposed DM reduces this problem to the solution of a quadratic equation, exploiting the knowledge about the workspace, to first estimate the x- or z-coordinate, and then the remaining two coordinates. The implemented PF uses 1000 particles to represent the posterior probability density function (PDF) of the AN's 3D position. The prediction step generates new particles by a resampling procedure. The ToA measurements determine the importance of these particles to enable updating the posterior PDF and estimating the 3D position of the AN. Simulation results corroborate the viability of the developed DM and PF algorithms, in terms of accuracy and computational cost, in the pursuit and circumnavigation scenarios, and even with a horizontally coplanar arrangement of the three ANs. Therefore, it is possible to enable applications requiring real-time positioning, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous docking and circling a stationary (or moving) position, without the need for an excessive number of ANs.

However, this implies developing algorithms to make the power line inspection process reliable and autonomous. In order to overcome the limitations of visual methods in the presence of poor light and noisy backgrounds, we propose to address the problem of power line detection and modeling based on LiDAR. The PL<mml:semantics>2</mml:semantics>DM, Power Line LiDAR-based Detection and Modeling, is a novel approach to detect power lines. Its basis is a scan-by-scan adaptive neighbor minimalist comparison for all the points in a point cloud. The power line final model is obtained by matching and grouping several line segments, using their collinearity properties. Horizontally, the power lines are modeled as a straight line, and vertically as a catenary curve. Using a real dataset, the algorithm showed promising results both in terms of outputs and processing time, adding real-time object-based perception capabilities for other layers of processing.

AB Time synchronization is the foundation of cooperative work among nodes of underwater sensor networks; it takes a critical role in the research and application of underwater sensor networks. Although numerous time synchronization protocols have been proposed for terrestrial wireless sensor networks, they cannot be directly applied to underwater sensor networks. This is because most of them typically assume that the propagation delay among sensor nodes is negligible, which is not the case in underwater sensor networks. Time synchronization is mainly affected by a long propagation delay among sensor nodes due to the low propagation speed of acoustic signals. Furthermore, sensor nodes in underwater tend to experience some degree of mobility due to wind or ocean current, or some other nodes are on self-propelled vehicles, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this paper, we propose a Doppler-enhanced time synchronization scheme for mobile underwater sensor networks, called DE-Sync. Our new scheme considers the effect of the clock skew during the process of estimating the Doppler scale factor and directly substitutes the Doppler scale factor into linear regression to achieve the estimation of the clock skew and offset. Simulation results show that DE-Sync outperforms existing time synchronization protocols in both accuracy and energy efficiency.

AB This work analyzes the implementation of an artificial mechanism inspired by a biological somatic marker that ables a passenger agent to both, react to changes in the service, as well as keep said reactions as a memory for future decisions. An artificial mental model was designed, and the passenger agent was implemented as an autonomous decision-making system, where both, the choice of the transport operator and the evaluation of the received service were fully delegated to the system. The evaluation of the service experience is not only based on rational aspects (such as the cost of the trip) but also on subjective aspects related to the satisfaction level derived from the passenger's experience. The experimental scenario considered 10,000 trip requests simulated within an artificial map that emulates characteristics that are usually present in a city, such as vehicular congestion, the unsafety of certain streets, or the benefits of an area with tourist interest. The results show that the option to travel under a transport operator with a touristic profile is a trend. Unlike current cases in the industry, this research work explores the scenario where the passenger can have as a client a trip profile with memory, differentiated from other clients, and can receive more than one trip proposal for the same trip request, according to the different conditions that the passenger is looking for.

AB Confined and subterranean areas are common in many civilian and industrial sites, although they are hazardous for humans given the presence of noxious gases, extreme temperatures, narrow spaces, un-healthy oxygen levels, flooding, and collapsing structures. Therefore, exploration, routine inspections, and surveillance tasks can benefit from using autonomous mobile robots to improve safety by reducing the presence of humans in those scenarios. However, despite advances in the field, there are still challenges to overcome for confined and subterranean robot operation. Real word robotic exploration requires robust and reliable map generation, precise localization, safe navigation, and efficient path planning. These requirements make exploration in complex 3D environments with rugged terrain difficult. The challenge is increased when considering multi-robot teams, as there is no guarantee of a functional network infrastructure. Despite consistent increasing interest in the area, there is a lack of research summarizing the results and best practices for exploring such environments. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a review and discuss state-of-the-art robotic exploration techniques, including single and cooperative approaches with homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, with a focus on complex subterranean and confined 3D scenarios. We also present a comprehensive list of insights on open challenges and possible directions for future investigation in the topic.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB End-to-end steering estimation is one of the important deep regression tasks. However, driving datasets are always imbalanced on the distribution of the steering value, which makes end-to-end learning models perform bad steering estimation accuracy, especially for the sharp steering value estimation, which finally, leads to an imbalanced training problem. In this paper, the essential reason for the imbalanced training problem for the deep regression task is first revealed as the gradient disharmony. To hedge the gradient disharmony, a general gradient balanced mechanism for the deep regression task is proposed in this paper. Meanwhile, the general gradient balanced mechanism is applied for the steering estimation task. According to the steering distribution, a novel Adaptive Gradient Balanced Mechanism (AGBM) is proposed to hedge the gradient disharmony based on the Laplace distribution with the general gradient balanced mechanism theory. Further, a new loss function embedding with AGBM is proposed to balance the gradient disharmony for the training process. AGBM makes the process of gradient hedging with adaptive style without parameters finetuning. Based on five driving datasets, four experiments are conducted for demonstrations. The experiment results show the AGBM enables the end-to-end models to perform the best accuracy of the steering estimation, including the sharp steering samples. Meanwhile, AGBM is generalized with different end-to-end learning models.

AB In this paper, we propose an efficient COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC) iteration circuit design for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors. A novel CORDIC architecture that achieves the goal of pre-selecting angles and reduces the number of iterations is presented for LiDAR sensors. The value of the trigonometric functions can be found in seven rotations regardless of the number of input N digits. The number of iterations are reduced by more than half. The experimental results show the similarity value to be all 1 and prove that the LiDAR decoded packet results are exactly the same as the ground truth. The total chip area is 1.93 mm x 1.93 mm and the core area is 1.32 mm x 1.32 mm, separately. The number of logic gates is 129,688. The designed chip only takes 0.012 ms and 0.912 ms to decode a packet and a 3D frame of LiDAR sensors, respectively. The throughput of the chip is 8.2105 x 10(8) bits/sec. The average power consumption is 237.34 mW at a maximum operating frequency of 100 MHz. This design can not only reduce the number of iterations and the computing time but also reduce the chip area. This paper provides an efficient CORDIC iteration design and solution for LiDAR sensors to reconstruct the point-cloud map for autonomous vehicles.

AB In this article, we present a novel underwater dataset collected from several field trials within the EU FP7 project Cognitive autonomous diving buddy (CADDY), where an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) was used to interact with divers and monitor their activities. To our knowledge, this is one of the first efforts to collect a large public dataset in underwater environments with the purpose of studying and boosting object classification, segmentation and human pose estimation tasks. The first part of the dataset contains stereo camera recordings (approximate to 10 K) of divers performing hand gestures to communicate with an AUV in different environmental conditions. The gestures can be used to test the robustness of visual detection and classification algorithms in underwater conditions, e.g., under color attenuation and light backscatter. The second part includes stereo footage (approximate to 12.7 K) of divers free-swimming in front of the AUV, along with synchronized measurements from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) located throughout the diver's suit (DiverNet), which serve as ground-truth for human pose and tracking methods. In both cases, these rectified images allow the investigation of 3D representation and reasoning pipelines from low-texture targets commonly present in underwater scenarios. This work describes the recording platform, sensor calibration procedure plus the data format and the software utilities provided to use the dataset.

AB Multiuser underwater acoustic communication is one of the enabling technologies for the autonomous ocean-sampling network (AOSN). Multiuser communication allows vehicles, moorings, and bottom instruments to interact without human intervention to perform adaptive sampling tasks. In addition, multiuser communication may be used to send data from many autonomous users to one buoy with RIF communications capability, which will then forward the information to shore. The two major signaling techniques for multiuser acoustic communication are phase-shift keying (PSK) direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) frequency-hopped spread-spectrum (FHSS). Selecting between these two techniques requires not only a study of their performance under multiuser conditions, but also an analysis of the impact of the underwater acoustic channel. In the case of DSSS, limitations in temporal coherence of the channel affect the maximum spreading factor, leading to situations that may be better suited to FHSS signals. Conversely, the multipath resolving properties of DSSS minimize the effects of frequency-selective fading that degrade the performance of FSK modulation. Two direct-sequence receivers potentially suitable for the underwater channel are presented. The first utilizes standard despreading followed by decision-directed gain and phase tracking. The second uses chip-rate adaptive filtering and phase tracking prior to despreading. Results from shallow water testing in two different scenarios are presented to illustrate the techniques and their performance.

AB The fate of cetacean carcasses in the deep sea was investigated using autonomous deep-sea lander vehicles incorporating time-lapse camera systems, fish and amphipod traps. Three lander deployments placed cetacean carcasses at depths of 4000-4800 m in the north-east Atlantic for periods of 36 h, 152 h and 276 h before being recovered. The photographic sequences revealed that carcasses were rapidly consumed by fish and invertebrate scavengers with removal rates ranging from 0.05-0.4 kgh(-1). In the longest experiment the carcass was skeletonized within five days. In each deployment, approximately an hour after emplacement, the grenadier Coryphaenoides (Nematonurus) armatus and large numbers of lysianassid amphipods had arrived at the food-fall. The initially high numbers of grenadiers declined once the majority of the bait had been consumed and a variety of other fish and invertebrates were then observed, some taking up residence at the site. None of the fish species appeared to consume the carcass directly, but preyed upon amphipods instead. Funnel traps recovered with the carcass indicated a succession in the species composition of amphipods, with the specialist necrophages such as Paralicella spp. being replaced by more generalist feeders of the Orchomene species complex.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted edge caching has been emerged as a promising solution to alleviate network congestion, which can provide users with their desired contents with reduced latency. For achieving effective UAV-assisted edge caching, how to jointly design the trajectory and caching strategy is critical, which, however, is not straightforward due to the heterogeneous and uncertain demand in the network. In this paper, aiming at maximizing the reduced delay brought by the UAV-assisted caching, we propose a proactive joint strategy on trajectory and caching for the UAV, where the demand uncertainty is particularly studied. Specifically, by regarding the demand on each content as a random variable, we formulate the strategy design as a risk-averse stochastic optimization problem to make the network performance guaranteed under certain confidence level. Different from most existing works assuming the perfect distributional information is available to deal with the uncertainty, we develop a data-driven approach based on the first and second order statistics to achieve a distributionally robust (DR) solution, which can make the strategy trustworthy with guaranteed network performance even though the specific distributional information is unknown. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed DR strategy.

AB Since the invention in 2016, federated learning (FL) has been a key concept of artificial intelligence, in which the data of FL users needs not to be uploaded to the central server. However, performing FL tasks may not be feasible due to the unavailability of terrestrial communications and the battery limitation of FL users. To address these issues, we make use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wireless powered communications (WPC) for FL networks. In order to enable sustainable FL solutions, the UAV equipped with edge computing and WPC capabilities is deployed as an aerial energy source as well as an aerial server to perform FL tasks. We propose a joint algorithm of UAV placement, power control, transmission time, model accuracy, bandwidth allocation, and computing resources, namely energy-efficient FL (E2FL), aiming at minimizing the total energy consumption of the aerial server and users. The E2FL overcomes the original nonconvex problem by an efficient algorithm. We show that sustainable FL solutions can be provided via UAV-enabled WPC through various simulation results. Moreover, the outperformance of E2FL in terms of energy efficiency over several benchmarks emphasizes the need for a joint resource allocation framework rather than optimizing a subset of optimization factors.

DE Cellular V2X; medium access control; age of information; status update;
   semi-persistent scheduling
AB Real-time status update in future vehicular networks is vital to enable control-level cooperative autonomous driving. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), as one of the most promising vehicular wireless technologies, adopts a Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) based Medium-Access-Control (MAC) layer protocol for its sidelink communications. Despite the recent and ongoing efforts to optimize SPS, very few work has considered the status update performance of SPS. In this paper, Age of Information (AoI) is first leveraged to evaluate the MAC layer performance of C-V2X sidelink. Critical issues of SPS, i.e., persistent packet collisions and Half-Duplex (HD) effects, are identified to hinder its AoI performance. Therefore, a piggyback-based collaboration method is proposed accordingly, whereby vehicles collaborate to inform each other of potential collisions and collectively afford HD errors, while entailing only a small signaling overhead. Closed-form AoI performance is derived for the proposed scheme, optimal configurations for key parameters are hence calculated, and the convergence property is proved for decentralized implementation. Simulation results show that compared with the standardized SPS and its state-of-the-art enhancement schemes, the proposed scheme shows significantly better performance, not only in terms of AoI, but also of conventional metrics such as transmission reliability.

AB The paper proposes an evaluation method providing decision support for policymakers in regard to the land consumption of transport activities. Due to the increasing pressure on vehicle parking, traffic jams and the housing crisis in large cities, it is important to use road space effectively. The primary objective of this paper is to review and evaluate the published research about the time-area concept, as well as proposing an evaluation method for the time-area requirements of vehicles used in last mile delivery such as pedestrian porters, bicycles, cargo bikes, sidewalk autonomous delivery robots (SADRs) and delivery vans. The time-area concept measures the size of an area occupied during a transport activity and the duration for which it is occupied for standing, as well as moving transport units. While most of the research applies the time-area concept to compare various modes of transport used to move people around a city, this paper focusses on moving parcels and evaluates the effect that operating strategies and policy changes have on the time-area requirements of a single mode of transport. The study builds on a real trip data set of parcel deliveries in London.

AB The point clouds acquired by a vehicle-borne mobile laser scanning (MLS) system have shown great potential for many applications such as intelligent transportation systems, road infrastructure inventories, and high-definition (HD) maps to support the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper presents a novel two-step approach to automated detection and reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) highway curves from MLS point clouds. However, when dealing with noisy, unstructured, dense point clouds, we often face some challenges, most notably in handling of the outliers introduced during road marking detection and in recognition of curve types during 3D curve reconstruction. Our approach is formed by two main algorithms: a detector based on intensity variance and a robust model fitting estimator. The experimental results obtained using both a virtual scan dataset and a real MLS dataset demonstrated that our approach is very promising in handling of the outliers and reconstruction of 3D road curves. Specifically, a relative accuracy of 0.6% has been achieved in estimation of circle radii based on the virtual scan dataset. A comparative study also showed that our road marking detection approach is more effective and more stable than state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Vehicular ad hoc networks have attracted the attention of many researchers during the last years due to the emergence of autonomous vehicles and safety concerns. Most of the frameworks which are proposed for the modeling and analysis VANET applications make use of simulation techniques. Due to the high level of concurrency in these applications, simulation results do not guarantee the correct behavior of the system and more accurate analysis techniques are required. In this paper, we have developed a framework to provide model checking facilities for the analysis of VANET applications. To this end, an actor-based modeling language, Rebeca, is used which is equipped with a variety of model checking engines. We have extended Rebeca with the inheritance mechanism to support model-specific message passing among vehicles, which is crucial for the modeling of VANET applications. To illustrate the applicability of this framework, we modeled and analyzed two warning message dissemination schemes. Reviewing the results of using the model checking technique supports the claim that concurrent behaviors of the system components in VANETs may cause uncertainty which may not be detected by simulation-based techniques. We also observed that considering the interleaving of concurrent executions of the system components affects the performance metrics of it.

AB Gesture spotting is an essential task for recognizing finger gestures used to control in-car touchless interfaces. Automated methods to achieve this task require to detect video segments where gestures are observed, to discard natural behaviors of users' hands that may look as target gestures, and be able to work online. In this paper, we address these challenges with a recurrent neural architecture for online finger gesture spotting. We propose a multi-stream network merging hand and hand-location features, which help to discriminate target gestures from natural movements of the hand, since these may not happen in the same 3D spatial location. Our multi-stream recurrent neural network (RNN) recurrently learns semantic information, allowing to spot gestures online in long untrimmed video sequences. In order to validate our method, we collect a finger gesture dataset in an in-vehicle scenario of an autonomous car. 226 videos with more than 2100 continuous instances were captured with a depth sensor. On this dataset, our gesture spotting approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an improvement of about 10% and 15% of recall and precision, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that by combining with an existing gesture classifier (a 3D Convolutional Neural Network), our proposal achieves better performance than previous hand gesture recognition methods.

AB How to evaluate driver spontaneous reactions in various collision patterns in a quantitative way is one of the most important topics in vehicle safety. Firstly, this paper constructs representative numerical crash scenarios described by impact velocity, impact angle and contact position based on finite element (FE) computation platform. Secondly, a driver cabin model is extracted and described in the well validated multi-rigid body (MB) model to compute the value of weighted injury criterion to quantitatively assess drivers' overall injury under certain circumstances. Furthermore, based on the coupling of FE and MB, parametric studies on various crash scenarios are conducted. It is revealed that the WIC (Weighted Injury Criteria) value variation law under high impact velocities is quite distinct comparing with the one in low impact velocities. In addition, the coupling effect can be elucidated by the fact that the difference of WIC value among three impact velocities under smaller impact angles tends to be distinctly higher than that under larger impact angles. Meanwhile, high impact velocity also increases the sensitivity of WIC under different collision positions and impact angles. Results may provide a new methodology to quantitatively evaluate driving behaviors and serve as a significant guiding step towards collision avoidance for autonomous driving vehicles.

AB In this paper, distributed control reconfiguration strategies for directed switching topology networked multi-agent systems are developed and investigated. The proposed control strategies are invoked when the agents are subject to actuator faults and while the available fault detection and isolation (FDI) modules provide inaccurate and unreliable information on the estimation of faults severities. Our proposed strategies will ensure that the agents reach a consensus while an upper bound on the team performance index is ensured and satisfied. Three types of actuator faults are considered, namely: the loss of effectiveness fault, the outage fault, and the stuck fault. By utilizing quadratic and convex hull (composite) Lyapunov functions, two cooperative and distributed recovery strategies are designed and provided to select the gains of the proposed control laws such that the team objectives are guaranteed. Our proposed reconfigurable control laws are applied to a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under directed switching topologies and subject to simultaneous actuator faults. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed distributed reconfiguration control laws in compensating for the effects of sudden actuator faults and subject to fault diagnosis module uncertainties and unreliabilities.

AB The applications of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) have been increasing and becoming part of many daily tasks in numerous organizations. As matter of fact, the use of a UAV does not mean the decreasing of operational complexities and, consequently, the costs of performing its tasks. Sometimes, this high cost is related to the dependence of well-trained operators and huge remote control facilities to operate a sophisticated UAV. This work proposes an UAV that can perform its tasks as much independent of human interaction as possible, and with a minimum connection to its mission control facilities. This independence will be achieved by embedding the mission control into the UAV. As the mission control is embedded, the UAV will have less connection issues with its control center and will be less dependable of human interaction. To prove this concept, the kinematics and dynamics of a light air vehicle (blimp) were developed; a prototype of an embedded parallel-distributed computer was constructed; and new procedures to resolve navigations and collision evasions issues were proposed. The new evasion procedures were implemented into a simulator and a new parallel/distributed program for optimal path discover was developed to be used in the cluster prototype. All tests of the evasion procedures simulator were satisfactory and the speed up tests using the embedded cluster showed the best performance of the proposed framework.

AB With the arrival of smart grid era and the advent of advanced communication and information infrastructures, bidirectional communication, advanced metering infrastructure, energy storage systems and home area networks would revolutionize the patterns of electricity usage and energy conservation at the consumption premises. Coupled with the emergence of vehicle-to-grid technologies and massive distributed renewable energy, there is a profound transition for the energy management pattern from the conventional centralized infrastructure towards the autonomous responsive demand and cyber-physical energy systems with renewable and stored energy sources. Under the sustainable smart grid paradigm, the smart house with its home energy management system (HEMS) plays an important role to improve the efficiency, economics, reliability, and energy conservation for distribution systems. In this paper, a brief overview on the architecture and functional modules of smart HEMS is presented. Then, the advanced HEMS infrastructures and home appliances in smart houses are thoroughly analyzed and reviewed. Furthermore, the utilization of various building renewable energy resources in HEMS, including solar, wind, biomass and geothermal energies, is surveyed. Lastly, various home appliance scheduling strategies to reduce the residential electricity cost and improve the energy efficiency from power generation utilities are also investigated.

AB Underwater hydrothermal vents draw a lot of interest as they are the shelter for unique ecosystems, besides being a possible new opportunity for ore mining. Manganese (Mn) is found at a high concentration in hydrothermal vents, which make it possible to use this metal ion as a tracer to detect and evaluate new hydrothermal sources. Here we present a miniaturized and integrated microfluidic system for the detection of Mn in deep-sea environment, called the integrated in situ analyzer for Mn2+ (IISA-Mn). The detection system is based on the chemiluminescence reaction of Mn contained in the seawater sample with a luminol-based reagent, which offers a high sensitivity. This system is composed of a microdevice for mixing and reaction, a pumping unit, several valving units, and a photomultiplier (PMT) detector. The system is able to detect Mn concentration above 280 nM in seawater, and gives a quite linear response until 500 nM. It is also proven to be able to work continuously during the 8 h of an actual remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dive. This system has led to the discovery of a previously unknown hydrothermal site in the Okinawa Trough.

AB In mobile robotics, there are often features that, while potentially powerful for improving navigation, prove difficult to profit from as they generalize poorly to novel situations. Overhead imagery data, for instance, have the potential to greatly enhance autonomous robot navigation in complex outdoor environments. In practice, reliable and effective automated interpretation of imagery from diverse terrain, environmental conditions, and sensor varieties proves challenging. Similarly, fixed techniques that successfully interpret on-board sensor data across many environments begin to fail past short ranges as the density and accuracy necessary for such computation quickly degrade and features that are able to be computed from distant data are very domain specific. We introduce an online, probabilistic model to effectively learn to use these scope-limited features by leveraging other features that, while perhaps otherwise more limited, generalize reliably. We apply our approach to provide an efficient, self-supervised learning method that accurately predicts traversal costs over large areas from overhead data. We present results from field testing on-board a robot operating over large distances in various off-road environments. Additionally, we show how our algorithm can be used offline with overhead data to produce a priori traversal cost maps and detect misalignments between overhead data and estimated vehicle positions. This approach can significantly improve the versatility of many unmanned ground vehicles by allowing them to traverse highly varied terrains with increased performance.

AB Two benthic lander systems were used as part of a project investigating the geochemical characteristics of a North Sea drill cuttings pile. Complications associated with deploying sampling gear in close proximity to the platform required an innovative technique to obtain the necessary measurements. To achieve this goal, two deep-sea autonomous free fall vehicles (benthic landers) were adapted for deployment and transport by remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The landers were fitted with a microelectrode profiling system for obtaining high-resolution oxygen, sulphicle and pH profiles, and a rig to deploy gel probes into the sediment to examine dissolved trace metal profiles within the cuttings pile. The use of an ROV for deployment of the landers enabled the simultaneous collection of data within a defined spatial context while providing real-time visual feedback of the landers operating on the seabed. Eight deployments were made over 5 days, totalling over 100 hours of sampling time. The successful deployment and retrieval of the instrumentation, the quality of data obtained and the limited disruptions to the ongoing ship operations demonstrate the value of the lander system as an efficient and versatile tool for in situ biogeochemical investigations in areas associated with sampling and measuring difficulties such as North Sea drill cuttings piles.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) have evolved most often with specific mission focus areas determined by the defense sponsor or commercial customer. These focus areas have driven platform design and capabilities, as well as the mission planners delivered with these vehicles. While these mission planners have a broad spectrum of sophistication in the interfaces, none provide substantial guidance to the operator in designing a track plan optimized for the physical environment. For some mission areas, survey design is relatively straight-forward. If 100% sensor coverage or over-sampling of an area are required. as is often the case for mine-clearance or industrial reconnaissance, the area of responsibility determines the boundaries, and an estimate of sensor sweep width determines the track spacing. There are other mission areas, however, where area boundaries are too large, and the dynamic parameters too variable, to allow full sensor coverage in a synoptic sense. In these cases, compromises in survey extent and resolution demand track optimization that is driven by vehicle number, speed and endurance trade-offs, spatial and temporal variability of the measured parameters, and environmental factors that physically influence AUV performance. Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA) is one critical mission area where survey optimization is essential, and the selection of waypoints, depths, and geometries to best characterize the changing physical environment with limited platforms and time becomes a critical challenge. Researchers at the Naval Undersea Warfare Division, Newport are using commercially available AUVs from OceanServer Technologies, Inc. (OSTI) with YSI oceanographic sensors to conduct REA surveys in shallow waters. Dynamic Graphics, Inc. (DGI) software is used to establish a 3-D grid and compare the incoming data log files from the AUV sensors with the developing detail of the oceanographic characterization. Confidence estimates are generated in near real-time to represent cost versus benefit of continued survey effort. On-board adjustments to initial survey design, such as increased track spacing, can result from this evaluation to reduce the survey effort and still meet the tactical requirements for accuracy and precision. Field experiments with OSTI AUVs in Lake Champlain, NY and South Watuppa Pond, MA in July, 2007 demonstrated that DGI software could develop high-fidelity data-centric 2-D and 3-D characterizations of environmental parameters with irregular trackline data. The characterizations were suitable for statistical evaluation in near-real time to assess the return on continued survey effort and to recognize dynamic areas for subsequent survey focus. For these environments, reductions in total survey effort of 50%-70% could be achieved with little loss in 2D- and 3D-grid fidelity or feature definition. While the potential for reduction in survey effort is a function of environmental variability, the strength of this approach lies in the ability to establish in-stride the minimum effort required for a fidelity threshold without a first-guess field or a priori knowledge. Processing times and results support future on-board, in-stride analysis by AUVs for survey re-planning to optimize track and depth plans. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB To alleviate the explosive growth of data traffic caused by the increased use of smart devices, new transmission techniques are needed to increase the utilization of limited bandwidth resources and for providing high transmission rates in future wireless networks. On the other hand, due to their flexibility and autonomy, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered as a potential candidate to support ubiquitous connectivity and operate as flying base stations, where the deployment of UAVs can affect the quality of experience (QoE) of users. Hence, in this paper, we employ UAVs as aerial base stations to transmit data to ground users (GUs) via air to ground (A2G) communication links, where we show how content awareness can help improve the data rate. Specifically, we design two content-sharing (CS) data transmission schemes to improve the average data rate of the GUs. Additionally, two UAV deployment strategies, namely the fixed-point deployment scheme and traverse-search deployment scheme, are proposed based on the proposed CS transmission schemes. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed data transmission schemes combined with their proposed deployment schemes outperform the traditional transmission scheme by 26 bits/s/Hz and 51 bits/s/Hz, respectively.

AB This work focuses on the challenges associated with autonomous robot guidance, navigation, and control in multi-robot systems. This study provides an affordable solution by utilizing a group of small unmanned ground vehicles and quadrotors that collaborate on monitoring and inspection missions. The proposed system utilizes a potential fields path planning algorithm to allow a robot to track a moving target while avoiding obstacles in a dynamic environment. To achieve the required performance and provide robust tracking against wind disturbances, a backstepping controller is used to solve the essential stability problem and ensure that each robot follows the specified path asymptotically. Furthermore, the performance is also compared with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to ensure the superiority of the control system. The system combines a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU), a GNSS receiver, and a barometer for UAVs to generate a navigation solution (position, velocity, and attitude estimations), which is then used in the guidance and control algorithms. A similar solution is used for UGVs by integrating the IMU, a GNSS receiver, and encoders. Non-linear complementary filters integrate the measurements in the navigation system to produce high bandwidth estimates of the state of each robotic platform. Experimental results of several scenarios are discussed to prove the effectiveness of the approach.

AB Drones have been getting more and more popular in many economy sectors. Both scientific and industrial communities aim at making the impact of drones even more disruptive by empowering collaborative autonomous behaviors-also known as swarming behaviors-within fleets of multiple drones. In swarming-powered 3D mapping missions, unmanned aerial vehicles typically collect the aerial pictures of the target area whereas the 3D reconstruction process is performed in a centralized manner. However, such approaches do not leverage computational and storage resources from the swarm members. We address the optimization of a swarm-powered distributed 3D mapping mission for a real-life humanitarian emergency response application through the exploitation of a swarm-powered ad hoc cloud. Producing the relevant 3D maps in a timely manner, even when the cloud connectivity is not available, is crucial to increase the chances of success of the operation. In this work, we present a mathematical programming heuristic based on decomposition and a variable neighborhood search heuristic to minimize the completion time of the 3D reconstruction process necessary in such missions. Our computational results reveal that the proposed heuristics either quickly reach optimality or improve the best known solutions for almost all tested realistic instances comprising up to 1000 images and fifteen drones.

AB The steering-by-wire (SbW) system is one of the main subsystems of automatic vehicles, realizing the steering control of autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes an event-triggered adaptive sliding mode control for the SbW system subject to the uncertain nonlinearity, time-varying disturbance, and limited communication resources. Firstly, an event-triggered nested adaptive sliding mode control is proposed for SbW systems. The uncertain nonlinearity is approximated by the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS). The time-varying disturbance, modeling error, and event-triggering error can be offset by robust terms of sliding mode control. The key advantage is that the high-frequency switching of sliding mode control only appears on the time derivate of control input without increasing the input-output relative degree of closed-loop SbW systems, such that the chattering phenomenon can be eliminated. Finally, theoretical analysis shows that the practical finite-time stability of the closed-loop SbW system can be achieved, and communication resources in the controller-to-actuator channels can be saved while avoiding the Zeno-behavior. Numerical simulations and experiments are given to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Smart cities have become a popular concept because they have the potential to create a sustainable and livable urban future. Smart mobility forms an integral part of the smart city agenda. This paper investigates "smart mobility" from the angle of sustainable commuting practices in the context of smart cities. This paper studies a multivariate multiple regression model within a panel data framework and examines whether increasing access to broadband Internet connections leads to the choice of a sustainable commuting mode in Australian local government areas. In this case, access to the Internet is used as a proxy for determining urban smartness, and the use of different modes of transport including working at home is used to investigate sustainability in commuting behavior. The findings show that an increasing access to broadband Internet reduces the level of working from home, public transport use, and active transport use, but increases the use of private vehicles, perhaps to overcome the fragmentation of work activities the Internet creates. How to overcome the need for car-based travel for fragmented work activities while increasing smartness through the provisioning of broadband access should be a key smart city agenda for Australia to make its cities more sustainable.

ID SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION
AB Underwater glider is an autonomous underwater vehicle that glides by controlling their buoyancy and attitude using internal actuators. By changing the vehicle's buoyancy intermittently, vertical motion can be achieved. Characteristics of glider motion include upward and downward movement in a saw tooth pattern, turning and gliding in a vertical spiral motion and gliding without using thrusters or propellers. This paper presents the modelling and identification on net buoyancy, depth and pitching angle of an underwater glider system. A ballast tank subsystem is considered appropriate for the identification process since it is the main parameter for the motion control. By selecting the ballast rate as the input, three aspects of the dynamics of a glider can be observed: buoyancy, depth of the glider and pitching angle. The MATLAB System Identification Toolbox (TM) is used to obtain a mathematical model of the glider ballast-buoyancy, ballast-depth and ballast-pitching angle conditioning system. The best three parametric estimation models are chosen, and the results of the comparison between simulated and estimated outputs are presented. The information obtained from the modelling and identification approaches are used for USM's Underwater Glider Prototype controller design. The information observed during this procedure are utilised for optimisation, stability, reliability and robustness analysis of the underwater glider. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous researches in this field focus on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), underwater manipulators, etc. Fish robot, which is a new type of underwater biomimetic robot, has attracted great attention because of its silence in moving and energy efficiency compared to conventional propeller-oriented propulsive mechanism.
   However, most of researches on fish robots have been carried out via empirical or experimental approaches, not based on dynamic optimality. In this paper, we proposed an analytical optimization approach which can guarantee the maximum propulsive velocity of fish robot in the given parametric conditions. First, a dynamic model of 3-joint (4 links) carangiform fish robot is derived, using which the influences of parameters of input torque functions, such as amplitude, frequency and phase difference, on its velocity are investigated by simulation. Second, the maximum velocity of the fish robot is optimized by combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Hill Climbing Algorithm (HCA). GA is used to generate the initial optimal parameters of the input functions of the system. Then, the parameters are optimized again by HCA to ensure that the final set of parameters is the "near" global optimization. Finally, both simulations and primitive experiments are carried out to prove the feasibility of the proposed method.

AB Direct observations of turbulent mixing in energetic ocean currents are fundamentally important to improving the understanding of stratified turbulence and the predictive capability of ocean models. In this study, we have selected an energetic region of the Western Indian Ocean to make simultaneous measurements of temperature and velocity to directly infer the geography of turbulent mixing on the east coast of South Africa. Direct measurements of the rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation, c, were recorded by an autonomous underwater vehicle glider platform and vertical microstructure profiler (VMP). The glider was deployed in the Agulhas current in 2015 over a 200 km transect and measured approximately 250 vertical profiles of turbulent microstructure. Additional vertical profiles near the shelf were obtained from approximately 85 VMP casts during 2018 in a region where the powerful Agulhas current is formed and interacts with the shelf. VMP and glider data collected at Sodwana Bay and the Agulhas current showed evidence of elevated dissipation rates 10(-8) < epsilon < 10(-6) Wkg(-1). Our results indicate that in general turbulent mixing in the Agulhas is concentrated spatially in pancake-shaped patches. Ordinary Kriging was used to interpolate between consecutive profiles and showed that the horizontal scale of the turbulent patches was typically O(1 km) while the vertical scales of the patches ranged between 0.01 and 10 m.

ID TRACKING
AB Autonomous driving systems must have the ability to monitor the kinematic behaviour of multiple obstacles. Therefore, 3D multi-object tracking (3D-MOT) is one of the crucial modules in autonomous driving to detect the presence of potential hazard movements such as human operated vehicles and pedestrians. In this work, we present a novel online 3D multi-tracking system that uses the Aggregated Euclidean Distances (AED) in data association module instead of using Intersection over Union (IoU) as a new metric. AED is used in order to obtain the relationship between predicted tracks and current object detections. There are several benefits from using AED in data association module. Firstly, it can reduce the system's complexity so that the execution time can be significantly reduced (as calculating Euclidean distances is much faster than obtaining 3D-IoU). Secondly, AED can provide distance measurement even when there is no overlaps between the predicted tracks and the current detections, while 3D-IoU produces zeros for non-overlapping cases. To demonstrate the validity of our proposed method, we performed extensive experiments on KITTI multi-tracking benchmark and nuScenes validation datasets. The experimental results are compared against the open-sourced state of the art 3D MOTs such as AB3DMOT, FANTrack, and mmMOT. Our method clearly outperforms the AB3DMOT baseline method and other methods in terms of accuracy and/or processing speed.

DT Article
DE HD map; crowdsourcing update; semantic segmentation; visual SLAM;
   autonomous driving
AB Continuous maintenance and real-time update of high-definition (HD) maps is a big challenge. With the development of autonomous driving, more and more vehicles are equipped with a variety of advanced sensors and a powerful computing platform. Based on mid-to-high-end sensors including an industry camera, a high-end Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and an onboard computing platform, a real-time HD map change detection method for crowdsourcing update is proposed in this paper. First, a mature commercial integrated navigation product is directly used to achieve a self-positioning accuracy of 20 cm on average. Second, an improved network based on BiSeNet is utilized for real-time semantic segmentation. It achieves the result of 83.9% IOU (Intersection over Union) on Nvidia Pegasus at 31 FPS. Third, a visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) associated with pixel type information is performed to obtain the semantic point cloud data of features such as lane dividers, road markings, and other static objects. Finally, the semantic point cloud data is vectorized after denoising and clustering, and the results are matched with a pre-constructed HD map to confirm map elements that have not changed and generate new elements when appearing. The experiment conducted in Beijing shows that the method proposed is effective for crowdsourcing update of HD maps.

AB Roughly 25 years ago, "ecogenomic sensors" were conceived of as autonomous devices that would be used to apply molecular analytical techniques below the sea surface as one part of a futuristic, integrated ocean observing system. The Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) was built to address that idea-an instrument to help define both the technological and operational elements that underlie the ecogenomic sensor concept. Over time, the ESP emerged as a working example of that class of instrument, enabling the application of DNA probe and protein arrays as well as use of the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique to assess the presence and abundance of a wide range of organisms, specific genes, and metabolites. The ESP is also used to preserve samples for a variety of laboratory tests not yet possible to carry out in situ (e.g., DNA sequencing). The instrument has been deployed on a variety of platforms, including coastal moorings, piers, an open ocean drifter, research vessels, a shallow water benthic lander, and a 4,000 m rated "elevator" designed for use on deep-sea cabled observatories. A new version of the ESP is currently being developed for use aboard an autonomous underwater vehicle. This article traces the evolution of the ESP from its conception to present-day status.

ID PHASE CORRELATION
AB This paper presents an UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) localisation algorithm for its autonomous navigation based on matching between on-board UAV image sequences to a pre-installed reference satellite image. As the UAV images and the reference image are not necessarily taken under the same illumination condition, illumination-invariant image matching is essential. Based on the investigation of illumination invariant property of Phase Correlation (PC) via mathematical derivation and experiments, we propose a PC based fast and robust illumination-invariant localisation algorithm for UAV navigation. The algorithm accurately determines the current UAV position as well as the next UAV position even the illumination condition of UAV on-board images is different from the reference satellite image. A Dirac delta function based registration quality assessment together with a risk alarming criterion is introduced to enable the UAV to perform self-correction in case the UAV deviates from the planned route. UAV navigation experiments using simulated terrain shading images and remote sensing images have demonstrated a robust high performance of the proposed PC based localisation algorithm under very different illumination conditions resulted from solar motion. The superiority of the algorithm, in comparison with two other widely used image matching algorithms, MI (Mutual Information) and NCC (Normalised Correlation Coefficient), is significant for its high matching accuracy and fast processing speed.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an important technique of autonomous driving. In order to accurately predict the reasonable future trajectory of pedestrians, it is inevitable to consider social interactions among pedestrians and the influence of surrounding scene simultaneously, which can fully represent the complex behavior information and ensure the rationality of predicted trajectories obeyed realistic rules. In this article, we propose one new prediction model named social soft attention graph convolution network (SSAGCN), which aims to simultaneously handle social interactions among pedestrians and scene interactions between pedestrians and environments. In detail, when modeling social interaction, we propose a new social soft attention function, which fully considers various interaction factors among pedestrians. Also, it can distinguish the influence of pedestrians around the agent based on different factors under various situations. For the scene interaction, we propose one new sequential scene sharing mechanism. The influence of the scene on one agent at each moment can be shared with other neighbors through social soft attention; therefore, the influence of the scene is expanded both in spatial and temporal dimensions. With the help of these improvements, we successfully obtain socially and physically acceptable predicted trajectories. The experiments on public available datasets prove the effectiveness of SSAGCN and have achieved state-of-the-art results. The project code is available at.

AB In October of 2002, The Power and Propulsion Office and The Risk Management Office of NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland Ohio began developing the Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) engineering approach for the Space Nuclear Propulsion and Power Systems Project. The objective of the Space Nuclear Power and Propulsion Project is to provide safe and reliable propulsion and power systems for planetary missions. The safety of the crew, ground personnel, and the public has to be the highest priority of the RAM engineering approach for nuclear powered space systems. The Project will require a top level reliability goal for substantial mission success in the range from 0.95 to 0.98. In addition, the probability of safe operation without loss of crew, vehicle, or danger to the public, cannot be less than 0.9999. (See Note 1)
   The achievement of these operational goals will require the combined application of many RAM engineering techniques. These include: advanced Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability Analysis, Probabilistic Risk Assessment that includes hardware, software, and human induced faults, Accelerated Life Testing, Parts Stress Analysis, and selective End to End Sub-System Testing. Design strategy must involve the selection of parts and materials specifically to withstand the stresses of prolonged operation in the space and planetary environments with a wide design margin. Interplanetary distances and resulting signal time delay drive the need for autonomous control of major system functions including redundancy management.

TI Deep Learning Segmentation and 3D Reconstruction of Road Markings Using

AB The 3D information of road infrastructures is growing in importance with the development of autonomous driving. In this context, the exact 2D position of road markings as well as height information play an important role in, e.g., lane-accurate self-localization of autonomous vehicles. In this paper, the overall task is divided into an automatic segmentation followed by a refined 3D reconstruction. For the segmentation task, we applied a wavelet-enhanced fully convolutional network on multiview high-resolution aerial imagery. Based on the resulting 2D segments in the original images, we propose a successive workflow for the 3D reconstruction of road markings based on a least-squares line-fitting in multiview imagery. The 3D reconstruction exploits the line character of road markings with the aim to optimize the best 3D line location by minimizing the distance from its back projection to the detected 2D line in all the covering images. Results showed an improved IoU of the automatic road marking segmentation by exploiting the multiview character of the aerial images and a more accurate 3D reconstruction of the road surface compared to the semiglobal matching (SGM) algorithm. Further, the approach avoids the matching problem in non-textured image parts and is not limited to lines of finite length. In this paper, the approach is presented and validated on several aerial image data sets covering different scenarios like motorways and urban regions.

AB Many physical and engineered systems (e.g., smart grid, autonomous vehicles, and robotic systems) that are observed and controlled over a communication/cyber infrastructure can be efficiently modeled as stochastic hybrid systems (SHS). This paper quantifies the bias of a mode-based Kalman filter commonly used for state estimation in SHS. The main approach involves modeling the bias dynamics as a transformed switched system and the transitions across modes are abstracted via arbitrary switching signals. This general model effectively captures a wide range of SHS systems where the modes may follow deterministic, Markovian, or guard condition based transitions. By leveraging techniques developed to analyze the stability of switched systems, we derive conditions for statistical convergence of the bias in a mode-based Kalman filter in the presence of mode mismatch errors. Developed upon the foundations of Lyapunov theory, we demonstrate a linear matrix inequality condition that guarantees asymptotic stability of the corresponding autonomous switched system irrespective of the choice of mode mismatch probability. Furthermore, we obtain the range of mode mismatch probabilities that assures bounded input bounded output stability of the bias dynamics for both stable and unstable SHS. Using numerical simulations of a smart grid with network topology errors, we verify and validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the potency of using the analysis in critical infrastructures.

AB In this study, the authors investigate the application of the Doppler beam sharpening (DBS) technique for angular refinement to the emerging area of low-terahertz (THz) radar sensing. Ultimately this is to improve radar image quality in the azimuth plane to complement the excellent range resolution and thus improve object classification in low-THz radar imaging systems for autonomous platforms. The study explains the fundamental theory behind the process of DBS and describes the applicability of DBS to automotive sensing, indicating the potential for synthetic beamwidths of a fraction of a degree. Low-THz DBS was experimentally tested under controlled laboratory conditions, not only to accurately localised target objects in Cartesian space but also to provide unique object imaging at low-THz frequencies with wide azimuthal beamwidth antennas. It was shown that a stationary (i.e. non-scanned) wide beam antenna mounted on a moving platform can deliver imagery at least comparable to that produced by physical beamforming, be that steering arrays or narrow beam scanning antennas as in the experimental case presented.

ID ATTENTION
AB Camera image simulation is integral to the virtual validation of autonomous vehicles and robots that use visual perception to understand their environment. It also has applications in creating image datasets for training learning-based vision models. As camera image simulation takes into account a wide variety of external and internal parameters, achieving a high-fidelity simulation is a computationally expensive process. Recently, several neural network-based techniques have been proposed to reduce the computational complexity of image rendering, a critical element of the camera simulation pipeline. However, the existing methods are tailored for monocular camera images and are not optimised for stereo images, which are widely used in autonomous driving applications. To address this, we propose a technique based on Stereo Super Resolution (SSR) to speed up the simulation of stereo images. The proposed method first simulates stereo images at a lower resolution, then super-resolves them to their original resolution using our introduced SSR model, ETSSR. We evaluated the performance of our technique using the CARLA driving simulator and created our own synthetic dataset for training ETSSR. The evaluations indicate that our approach can speed up stereo image simulation by a factor of up to 2.57 over various resolutions. Moreover, it shows that our ETSSR achieves on-par or superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art models, using significantly fewer parameters and FLOPs. We have made our source code and dataset available at https://github.com/hamedhaghighi/ETSSR.

AB The inductive power transfer (IPT) is expected to greatly contribute towards electrification in transportation. In fact, IPT charging technology has the potential to overcome several limitations of conductive charging: in particular, the process can be fully automatable, and both static and dynamic charging are allowed, thus reducing the size of the battery pack. Additionally, safety is increased due to the absence of safety issues related to loss of cable insulation or to the unwanted interruption of the plug-socket connection. This paper presents, from a systematic approach, the design and realization of a prototype for IPT charging of autonomous shuttles in automated warehouses. First of all, the typical mission profile of the shuttle was properly identified, and a storage system based on power-oriented electrochemical cells was sized. Based on that, the architecture of the IPT system was chosen, both for transmitting and receiving sections. The pads were designed for this purpose, by considering the geometric constraints imposed by the manufacturer, through the utilization of the finite elements method. Finally, the power electronic circuitry was also designed. Numerical simulations of the components, as well as of the complete system, were performed and a prototype was built to widely verify the correspondence of the simulation outputs with the results obtained from an experimental measurements campaign.

AB The 5G network is considered as the essential underpinning infrastructure of manned and unmanned autonomous machines, such as drones and vehicles. Besides aiming to achieve reliable and low-latency wireless connectivity, positioning is another function provided by the 5G network to support the autonomous machines as the coexistence with the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is typically supported on smart 5G devices. This paper is a pilot study of using 5G uplink physical layer channel sounding reference signals (SRSs) for 3D user equipment (UE) positioning. The 3D positioning capability is backed by the uniform rectangular array (URA) on the base station and by the multiple subcarrier nature of the SRS. In this work, the subspace-based joint angle-time estimation and statistics-based expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms are investigated with the 3D signal manifold to prove the feasibility of using SRSs for 3D positioning. The positioning performance of both algorithms is evaluated by estimation of the root mean squared error (RMSE) versus the varying signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), the bandwidth, the antenna array configuration, and multipath scenarios. The simulation results show that the uplink SRS works well for 3D UE positioning with a single base station, by providing a flexible resolution and accuracy for diverse application scenarios with the support of the phased array and signal estimation algorithms at the base station.

AB Low-terahertz (THz) (above 150GHz) radar sensing is one of the promising technologies to provide safe navigation for autonomous cars due to its expected high-resolution imaging capability. It is anticipated that for robust operation at high levels of autonomy the sensor suite should provide a fusion of video and radar data and its efficiency depends on radar ability to deliver a resolution high enough to be compatible with that of the optical image. Performance of low-THz radar, capable to deliver required resolution, is considered in this study, with the focus on reflectivities of pedestrians at frequencies within the low-THz region - 150 and 300GHz. Backscatter returns are collected in a controlled environment at a number of frequency bands and at different aspect angles. Measurement methodology is presented and several indicators of reflectivities are calculated. Results are compared with values of radar cross-section reported for current automotive frequency standards 24 and 77GHz. The effect of clothing on reflectivities is also considered in this study.

AB This article analyzes the current research status and development trend of intelligent technologies for underground metal mines in China, where such technologies are under development for use to develop mineral resources in a safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly manner. We analyze and summarize the research status of underground metal mining technology at home and abroad, including some specific examples of equipment, technology, and applications. We introduce the latest equipment and technologies with independent intellectual property rights for unmanned mining, including intelligent and unmanned control technologies for rock-drilling jumbos, down-the-hole (DTH) drills, underground scrapers, underground mining trucks, and underground charging vehicles. Three basic platforms are used for intelligent and unmanned mining: the positioning and navigation platform, information-acquisition and communication platform, and scheduling and control platform. Unmanned equipment was tested in the Fankou Lead-Zinc Mine in China, and industrial tests on the basic platforms of intelligent and unmanned mining were carried out in the mine. The experiment focused on the intelligent scraper, which can achieve autonomous intelligent driving by relying on a wireless communication system, location and navigation system, and data-acquisition system. These industrial experiments indicate that the technology is feasible. The results show that unmanned mining can promote mining technology in China to an intelligent level and can enhance the core competitive ability of China's mining industry. (C) 2018 THE AUTHORS.

AB Automated driving is an active area of research in both industry and academia. Automated parking, which is automated driving in a restricted scenario of parking with low speed manoeuvring, is a key enabling product for fully autonomous driving systems. It is also an important milestone from the perspective of a higher end system built from the previous generation driver assistance systems comprising of collision warning, pedestrian detection, etc. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of an automated parking system from the perspective of computer vision algorithms. Designing a low-cost system with functional safety is challenging and leads to a large gap between the prototype and the end product, in order to handle all the corner cases. We demonstrate how camera systems are crucial for addressing a range of automated parking use cases and also, to add robustness to systems based on active distance measuring sensors, such as ultrasonics and radar. The key vision modules which realize the parking use cases are 3D reconstruction, parking slot marking recognition, freespace and vehicle/pedestrian detection. We detail the important parking use cases and demonstrate how to combine the vision modules to form a robust parking system. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first detailed discussion of a systemic view of a commercial automated parking system. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, research into autonomous driving and traffic safety has been drawing a great deal of attention. To realize autonomous driving and solve traffic safety problems, wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE) technology has been developed, and IEEE 802.11p defines the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) layer in the WAVE standard. However, the IEEE 802.11p frame structure, which has low pilot density, makes it difficult to predict the properties of wireless channels in a vehicular environment with high vehicle speeds; thus, the performance of the system is degraded in realistic vehicular environments. The motivation for this paper is to improve the channel estimation and tracking performance without changing the IEEE 802.11p frame structure. Therefore, we propose a channel estimation technique that can perform well over the entire SNR range of values by changing the method of channel estimation accordingly. The proposed scheme selectively uses two channel estimation schemes, each with outstanding performance for either high-SNR or low-SNR signals. To implement this, an adaptation algorithm based on a preamble is proposed. The preamble is a signal known to the transmitter-receiver, so that the receiver can obtain channel estimates without demapping errors, evaluating performance of the channel estimation schemes. Simulation results comparing the proposed method to other schemes demonstrate that the proposed scheme can selectively switch between the two schemes to improve overall performance.

AB High-resolution autonomous sensors routinely measure physical (temperature, salinity), chemical (oxygen, nutrients) and biological (fluorescence) parameters. However, while fluorescence provides a proxy for phytoplankton, heterotrophic populations remain challenging to monitor in real-time and at high resolution. Bathyphotometers, sensors which measure the light emitted by bioluminescent organisms when mechanically stimulated, provide the capability to identify bioluminescent dinoflagellates and zooplankton. In the coastal ocean, highly abundant dinoflagellates emitting low-intensity flashes generate a background bioluminescence signal, while rarer zooplankton emit bright flashes that can be individually resolved by high-frequency sensors. Bathyphotometers were deployed from ships and onboard autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) during three field campaigns in Monterey Bay, California. Ship-based in situ water samples were simultaneously collected and the plankton communities characterized. Plankton concentrations were matched with concurrent datasets of fluorescence and bioluminescence to develop proxies for autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, other phytoplankton such as diatoms, copepods, larvaceans (appendicularians), and small jellies. The method extracts the bioluminescence background as a proxy for dinoflagellates, and exploits differences in bioluminescence flash intensity between several types of zooplankton to identify larvaceans, copepods and small jellies. Fluorescence is used to discriminate between autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, and to identify other autotrophic plankton. Concurrent fluorometers and bathyphotometers onboard AUVs can thus provide a novel view of plankton diversity and phytoplankton/zooplankton interactions in the sea.

TI Detection of the Driver's Mental Workload Level in Smart and Autonomous
   Systems Using Physiological Signals
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB With the continuous advancement of automation technology, autonomous driving assistance systems are gradually sharing the tasks during driving, but the driver still assumes the main driving tasks. In addition to driving activities, the advent of numerous new functions will have an indirect impact on the driver's mental effort. However, determining the driver's mental effort remains a difficult issue. In this paper, a method is proposed to assess the mental workload of drivers, combining real driver's physiological data with the speed of his/her vehicle. The correlation coefficient and significance level are obtained by analyzing the correlation between physiological data and road types. The relevant data is then preprocessed to determine the characteristic index, with the mental workload as the input index. The driver's mental workload is classified and the mental workload prediction model is constructed on the basis of the combination of the Fuzzy Pattern Recognition Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm. At the same time, the suggested approach is compared to the J48 Classification Algorithm and the Simulated Annealing Optimization Algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed method in this paper's effectiveness for identifying the driver's mental workload level is evidently better than other algorithms, which provides new theoretical support for assessing the L3+ driver's mental workload level under the background of the safety of the intended functionality when they take over the control of the drive.

AB Lately, pose estimation based on learning-based Visual Odometry (VO) methods, where raw image data are provided as the input of a neural network to get 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) information, has been intensively investigated. Despite its recent advances, learning-based VO methods still perform worse than the classical VO that consists of feature-based VO methods and direct VO methods. In this paper, a new pose estimation method with the help of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network trained by pose data acquired by an accurate sensor is proposed. The historical trajectory data of the yaw angle are provided to the GRU network to get a yaw angle at the current timestep. The proposed method can be easily combined with other VO methods to enhance the overall performance via an ensemble of predicted results. Pose estimation using the proposed method is especially advantageous in the cornering section which often introduces an estimation error. The performance is improved by reconstructing the rotation matrix using a yaw angle that is the fusion of the yaw angles estimated from the proposed GRU network and other VO methods. The KITTI dataset is utilized to train the network. On average, regarding the KITTI sequences, performance is improved as much as 1.426% in terms of translation error and 0.805 deg/100 m in terms of rotation error.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged unexpectedly as a new force in the recent local wars. To occupy the high ground of military technology in the future, research on autonomous air combat using UAVs is extremely important. In this paper, we propose an intelligent air combat learning system inspired by the cognitive mechanism of the human brain. The air combat capability was divided into two parts: declarative and procedural memory. Imitating the updating and storage mechanism of human knowledge, a long- and short-term hierarchical asynchronous learning principle was designed. We adopted the basic idea of using the error signal to drive learning according to neurophysiological research. Drawing lessons from the working memory mechanism, the error signal for driving the short-term learning was created in the absence of labelled data, using only the interactive information. Then, we proved that the learning mechanism could ensure that system performance advances steadily and gradually. The experiments illustrated that the learning system designed in this paper can achieve some inferior confrontation ability through self-learning without human prior knowledge. Action strategies formed by learning are analogous to the classical tactical manoeuvres of human fighter pilots. We compared our work with related works and found that our method could improve its performance continuously and finally defeat its opponent.

AB The most versatile and robust flying machines are still those produced by nature through evolution. The solutions to the 6 DOF control problem faced by these machines are implemented in extremely small neuronal structures comprising thousands of neurons. Hence, the biological principles of flight control are not only very effective but also,ficient in terms of their implementation. An important question, to what extent these principles can be generalized to man-made flying platforms. Here, this question is investigated in relation to the computational and behavioral principles of the opto-motor system of the fly and locust. The aim is to provide a control infrastructure based only on biologically plausible and realistic neuronal models of the insect opto-motor system. It is shown that relying solely on vision, biologically constrained neuronal models of the fly visual system suffice for course stabilization and altitude control of a blinip-based UAV Moreover the system is augmented with a collision avoidance model based on the Lobula Giant Movement Detector neuron of the Locust. It is shown that the biologically constrained course stabilization model is highly robust and that the combined model is able to perform autonomous indoor flight.

TI Hardware-Efficient Scheme for Trailer Robot Parking by Truck Robot in an
   Indoor Environment with Rendezvous

AB Autonomous grounded vehicle-based social assistance/service robot parking in an indoor environment is an exciting challenge in urban cities. There are few efficient methods for parking multi-robot/agent teams in an unknown indoor environment. The primary objective of autonomous multi-robot/agent teams is to establish synchronization between them and to stay in behavioral control when static and when in motion. In this regard, the proposed hardware-efficient algorithm addresses the parking of a trailer (follower) robot in indoor environments by a truck (leader) robot with a rendezvous approach. In the process of parking, initial rendezvous behavioral control between the truck and trailer robots is established. Next, the parking space in the environment is estimated by the truck robot, and the trailer robot parks under the supervision of the truck robot. The proposed behavioral control mechanisms were executed between heterogenous-type computational-based robots. Optimized sensors were used for traversing and the execution of the parking methods. The truck robot leads, and the trailer robot mimics the actions in the execution of path planning and parking. The truck robot was integrated with FPGA (Xilinx Zynq XC7Z020-CLG484-1), and the trailer was integrated with Arduino UNO computing devices; this heterogenous modeling is adequate in the execution of trailer parking by a truck. The hardware schemes were developed using Verilog HDL for the FPGA (truck)-based robot and Python for the Arduino (trailer)-based robot.

AB Semantic segmentation is key in autonomous driving. Using deep visual learning architectures is not trivial in this context, because of the challenges in creating suitable large scale annotated datasets. This issue has been traditionally circumvented through the use of synthetic datasets, that have become a popular resource in this field. They have been released with the need to develop semantic segmentation algorithms able to close the visual domain shift between the training and test data. Although exacerbated by the use of artificial data, the problem is extremely relevant in this field even when training on real data. Indeed, weather conditions, viewpoint changes and variations in the city appearances can vary considerably from car to car, and even at test time for a single, specific vehicle. How to deal with domain adaptation in semantic segmentation, and how to leverage effectively several different data distributions (source domains) are important research questions in this field. To support work in this direction, this letter contributes a new large scale, synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation with more than 100 different source visual domains. The dataset has been created to explicitly address the challenges of domain shift between training and test data in various weather and view point conditions, in seven different city types. Extensive benchmark experiments assess the dataset, showcasing open challenges for the current state of the art. The dataset will be available at: https://idda-dataset.github.io/home/.

AB This work presents a field-hardened autonomous multimodal legged-aerial robotic system for subterranean exploration, extending a legged robot to be the carrier of an aerial platform capable of a rapid deployment in search-and-rescue scenarios. The driving force for developing such robotic configurations are the requirements for large-scale and long-term missions, where the payload capacity and long battery life of the legged robot is combined and integrated with the agile motion of the aerial agent. The multimodal robot is structured around the quadruped Boston Dynamics Spot, enhanced with a custom configured autonomy sensor payload as well as a UAV carrier platform, while the aerial agent is a custom built quadcopter. This work presents the novel design and hardware implementation as well as the onboard sensor suites. Moreover it establishes the overall autonomy architecture in a unified supervision approach while respecting each locomotion modality, including guidance, navigation, perception, state estimation, and control capabilities with a focus on rapid deployment and efficient exploration. The robotic system complete architecture is evaluated in real subterranean tunnel areas, in multiple fully autonomous search-and-rescue missions with the goal of identifying and locating objects of interest within the subterranean environment.

AB In this paper we post-process and evaluate the position estimation of pairs of template windows and geo-referenced images generated from LiDAR cloud point data using the Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) method. We created intensity, surface and terrain pairs of images for use with template matching, with 5 m pixel spacing, through binning. We evaluated square and circular binning approaches, without filtering the original data. Template matching achieved approximately 7 m root mean square error (RMSE) on intensity and surface templates on the respective geo-referenced images, while on terrain templates it had many mismatches due to insufficient terrain features over the assumed flight transect. Analysis of NCC showed the possibility of rejecting bad matches of intensity and surface templates, but terrain templates required an additional criteria of flatness for rejection. The combined NCC of intensity, surface and terrain proved stable for rejection of bad matches and had the lowest RMSE. Filtering outliers from surface images changed very little the accuracy of the matches, but greatly improved correlation values, indicating that the forest canopy might have the best features for geo-localization with template matching. Position estimation is essential for autonomous navigation of aerial vehicles and the these experiments with LiDAR data show potential for localization over densely forested regions where methods using optical camera data may fail to acquire distinguishable features.

AB Accurate high-definition maps with lane markings are often used as the navigation back-end for commercial autonomous vehicles. Currently, most high-definition maps are manually constructed by human labelling. Therefore, it is urgently required to propose a multi-class lane detection method that can automatically mark the road lanes to assist in generating high-precision maps for autonomous driving. We propose a lane segmentation detection method, named Lane-DeepLab, which is based on semantic segmentation for detecting multi-class lane lines in unmanned driving scenarios. The proposed method is based on the DeepLabv3+ network as the baseline, and we have redesigned the encoder-decoder structure to generate more accurate lane line detection results. More specifically, we restructure the atrous convolution at multi-scale by applying attention mechanism. Subsequently, we employ the Semantic Embedding Branch (SEB) to combine the high-level and low-level semantic information to obtain more abundant features, and use the Single Stage Headless (SSH) context module to obtain multi-scale information. Finally, we fuse the results to generate automatic high-precision mapping results. Our method has improved performance compared with other methods in the ApolloScape part of the dataset. Besides, in the database of Cityscapes, our approach has also achieved good results in semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Lane-DeepLab can provide excellent performance in real traffic scenarios. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The introduction of intelligent machines and autonomous vehicles to agricultural operations will allow for increased efficiency as well as for reduced environmental impact. Currently, innovative sensing and actuating technologies together with improved information and communication technologies provide the potential for such advancements. However, the full exploitation of these engineering advances requires the traditional agricultural machinery management process to be revisited. As a result, traditional agricultural operations planning methods, especially the job-shop planning methodology, must be supplemented with new planning features, such as route planning and sequential task scheduling. The objectives of this review are to outline current and required advances in agricultural machinery management to prepare for future intelligent manned and/or autonomous sustainable operations in agriculture. In the following sections, five key management tasks for agricultural machinery management are selected that span the various management phases and levels. These tasks are i) capacity planning (strategic level), task times planning (tactical level), scheduling (operational), route planning (operational level), and performance evaluation (evaluation level). For each of the management tasks, a definition is provided, and the most recent related literature is presented. Finally, the future requirements which will facilitate and set the framework for the development efforts necessary for fully implementing future agricultural management models and tools are discussed.

AB An In-Space Cryogenic Propellant Depot (ISCPD) is an important stepping stone to provide the capability to preposition, store, manufacture, and later use the propellants for Earth-neighborhood campaigns and beyond. An in-space propellant depot will provide affordable propellants and other similar consumables to support the development of sustainable and affordable exploration strategies as well as commercial space activities. An in-space propellant depot not only requires technology development in key areas such as zero boil-off storage and fluid transfer, but in other areas such as lightweight structures, highly reliable connectors, and autonomous operations. These technologies can be applicable to a broad range of propellant depot concepts or specific to a certain design. In addition, these technologies are required for spacecraft and orbit transfer vehicle propulsion and power systems, and space life support. Generally, applications of this technology require long-term storage, on-orbit fluid transfer and supply, cryogenic propellant production from water, unique instrumentation and autonomous operations.
   This paper discusses the reasons why such advances are important to future affordable and sustainable operations in space. This paper also discusses briefly R&D objectives comprising a promising approach to the systems planning and evolution into a meaningful stepping stone design, development, and implementation of an ISCPD. The success of a well-planned and orchestrated approach holds great promise for achieving innovation and revolutionary technology development for supporting future exploration and development of space.

AB The problem of localization, that is, of a robot finding its position on a map, is an important task for autonomous mobile robots. It has applications in numerous areas of robotics ranging from aerial photography to autonomous vehicle exploration, In this paper we present a new strategy LPS (Localize-by-Placement-Separation) for a robot to find its position on a map, where the map is represented as a geometric tree of bounded degree. Our strategy exploits to a high degree the self-similarities that may occur in the environment We use the framework of competitive analysis to analyze the performance of our strategy. In particular, we show that the distance traveled by the robot is at most O(rootn) times longer than the shortest possible route to localize the robot, where n is the number of vertices of the tree. This is a significant improvement over the best known previous bound of O (n(2/3)). Moreover, since there is a lower bound of Omega(rootn), our strategy is optimal up to a constant fa :tor, Using the same approach we c:an also show that the problem of searching for a target in a geometric tree, where the robot is given a map of the tree and the location of the target but does not know its own position, can be solved by a strategy with a competitive ratio of O(rootn), which is again optimal up to a constant factor.

AB Automated building processes that enable efficient in situ resource utilization can facilitate construction in remote locations while simultaneously offering a carbon-reducing alternative to commonplace building practices. Toward these ends, we present a robotic construction pipeline that is capable of planning and building freeform stone walls and landscapes from highly heterogeneous local materials using a robotic excavator equipped with a shovel and gripper. Our system learns from real and simulated data to facilitate the online detection and segmentation of stone instances in spatial maps, enabling robotic grasping and textured 3D scanning of individual stones and rubble elements. Given a limited inventory of these digitized stones, our geometric planning algorithm uses a combination of constrained registration and signed-distance-field classification to determine how these should be positioned toward the formation of stable and explicitly shaped structures. We present a holistic approach for the robotic manipulation of complex objects toward dry stone construction and use the same hardware and mapping to facilitate autonomous terrain-shaping on a single construction site. Our process is demonstrated with the construction of a freestanding stone wall (10 meters by 1.7 meters by 4 meters) and a permanent retaining wall (65.5 meters by 1.8 meters by 6 meters) that is integrated with robotically contoured terraces (665 square meters). The work illustrates the potential of autonomous heavy construction vehicles to build adaptively with highly irregular, abundant, and sustainable materials that require little to no transportation and preprocessing.

AB Autonomous navigation based on sequential images is widely accepted as an effective method to guarantee pinpoint landing and precise obstacle avoidance in planetary landings. Observing a large number of landmarks and processing a large number of images places a computational burden on landers with limited computational resources, but existing studies lack observation planning methods for landmarks in unknown environments that can be operated autonomously on landers. In this article, we analyze the observability of a vision-aided inertial navigation system and propose an observation planning strategy. The minimum number of landmarks and the minimum number of observations are obtained from the observability analysis, which is the boundary condition for observation planning. The landmark configuration planning in the observation planning strategy optimizes only univariate convex functions to efficiently select a small number of landmarks in unknown environments with high navigation accuracy, and the observation interval planning adaptively reduces the number of observations without significantly affecting the navigation accuracy. Simulation results verify the correctness of the observability analysis results, and it is found that the proposed observation planning strategy outperforms traditional observability degrees in terms of both improved navigation accuracy and computational speed when observing a small number of landmarks and can effectively reduce the number of observations.

AB In this paper, we propose a C51-Duel-IP (C51 Dueling DQN with Independent Policy) dynamic destination path-planning algorithm to solve the problem of autonomous navigation and avoidance of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the communication denial environment. Our proposed algorithm expresses the Q function output by the Dueling network as a Q distribution, which improves the fitting ability of the Q value. We also extend the single-step temporal differential (TD) to the N-step timing differential, which solves the problem of inflexible updates of the single-step temporal differential. More importantly, we use an independent policy to achieve autonomous avoidance and navigation of multiple UAVs without any communication with each other. In the case of communication rejection, the independent policy can achieve the consistency of multiple UAVs and avoid the greedy behavior of UAVs. In multiple-UAV dynamic destination scenarios, our work includes path planning, taking off from different initial positions, and dynamic path planning, taking off from the same initial position. The hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) experiment results show that our C51-Duel-IP algorithm is much more robust and effective than the original Dueling-IP and DQN-IP algorithms in an urban simulation environment. Our independent policy algorithm has similar effects as the shared policy but with the significant advantage of running in a communication denial environment.

AB Autonomous driving can make traffic safer by reducing human errors. Different sensor types in autonomous vehicles could introduce additional technical failures. We offer a target simulator testing LiDAR systems under automotive conditions. Therefore, data are projected over-the-air by laser signals on the LiDAR detector. This work presents a concept of a LiDAR target simulator with regards to LiDAR systems using the direct time-of-flight principle. We develope design considerations for a screen discussing undesired screen reflections, a curved screen form and the positioning of light sources on this screen. As one main solution, we introduce a concept of an antireflective screen. For the scenario simulation, we derive a model delivering the required optical power representing a simulated target, which is combined with the simulated time-of-flight. Considering no prior knowledge of the LiDAR system under test, we discuss the required calibration data and timing resolution. Thereby, we suggest an optimized time-of-flight concept requiring only one optical trigger to determine the LiDAR measurement start. All requirements are supported by calculated example parameters based on real LiDAR systems. Altogether, we discuss main challenges and possible solutions of our LiDAR target simulator, which will allow a safer and more efficient development of LiDAR systems.

AB Wind turbines require periodic inspection to ensure efficient power generation and a prolonged lifetime. Traditionally, inspection involves the risk of a person falling while abseiling from the top of the nacelle. To avoid this, drones have been controlled by operators to inspect the blades. However, this task requires expert pilots, who experience fatigue quickly. Alternatively, autonomous drones are not subject to human tiredness and can follow trajectories in a repeatable manner. Motivated by the latter, we introduce a vision-based blade detector capable of recognizing their orientation and relative position to generate a flight plan that allows it to safely collect image data. The proposed blade detector extracts line features with the camera, which are filtered to reduce the search space by using bounding boxes. They are obtained with a single-shot detector based on a convolutional neural network. Finally, a random sample consensus procedure finds the lines that best fit a geometrical model of the wind turbine. We compare our deep learning approach against a color segmentation method, showing that it is up to 6 times faster. We also compare against guided search during random sampling, which exploits the separate boxes detected by the network, seeking to reduce the number of outliers. We conclude with an illustrative example of how our proposed detector could be used for autonomous wind turbine inspection.

AB This paper presents an agent-based approach to modelling individual driver behaviour under the influence of real-time traffic information. The driver behaviour models developed in this study are based on a behavioural survey of drivers which was conducted on a congested commuting corridor in Brisbane, Australia. Commuters' responses to travel information were analysed and a number of discrete choice models were developed to determine the factors influencing drivers' behaviour and their propensity to change route and adjust travel patterns. Based on the results obtained from the behavioural survey, the agent behaviour parameters which define driver characteristics, knowledge and preferences were identified and their values determined. A case study implementing a simple agent-based route choice decision model within a microscopic traffic simulation tool is also presented. Driver-vehicle units (DVUs) were modelled as autonomous software components that can each be assigned a set of goals to achieve and a database of knowledge comprising certain beliefs, intentions and preferences concerning the driving task. Each DVU provided route choice decision-making capabilities, based on perception of its environment, that were similar to the described intentions of the driver it represented. The case study clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and the potential to develop more complex driver behavioural dynamics based on the belief-desire-intention agent architecture.

AB Many safety-related systems are evolving into cyber-physical systems (CPSs), integrating information technologies in their control architectures and modifying the interactions among automation and human operators. Particularly, a promising potential exists for enhanced efficiency and safety in applications such as autonomous transportation systems, control systems in critical infrastructures, smart manufacturing and process plants, robotics, and smart medical devices, among others. However, the modern features of CPSs are ambiguous for system designers and risk analysts, especially considering the role of humans and the interactions between safety and security. The sources of safety risks are not restricted to accidental failures and errors anymore. Indeed, cybersecurity attacks can now cascade into safety risks leading to physical harm to the system and its environment. These new challenges demand system engineers and risk analysts to understand the security vulnerabilities existing in CPS features and their dependencies with physical processes. Therefore, this paper (a) examines the key features of CPSs and their relation with other system types; (b) defines the dependencies between levels of automation and human roles in CPSs from a systems engineering perspective; and (c) applies systems thinking to describe a multi-layered diagrammatic representation of CPSs for combined safety and security risk analysis, demonstrating an application in the maritime sector to analyze an autonomous surface vehicle.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; SCENARIO APPROACH; SYSTEM
AB In this paper, a sampling-based stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) algorithm is proposed for discrete-time linear systems subject to both parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances. One of the main drivers for the development of the proposed control strategy is the need for reliable and robust guidance and control strategies for automated rendezvous and proximity operations between spacecraft. To this end, the proposed control algorithm is validated on a floating spacecraft experimental testbed, proving that this solution is effectively implementable in real time. Parametric uncertainties due to the mass variations during operations, linearization errors, and disturbances due to external space environment are simultaneously considered. The approach enables to suitably tighten the constraints to guarantee robust recursive feasibility when bounds on the uncertain variables are provided. Moreover, the offline sampling approach in the control design phase shifts all the intensive computations to the offline phase, thus greatly reducing the online computational cost, which usually constitutes the main limitation for the adoption of SMPC schemes, especially for low-cost on-board hardware. Numerical simulations and experiments show that the approach provides probabilistic guarantees on the success of the mission, even in rather uncertain and noisy situations, while improving the spacecraft performance in terms of fuel consumption.

AB This paper presents a detailed analysis and characterization of Subjective Assessment Indicators for evaluating manual as well as fully automatic parking maneuvers. Parking is a huge challenge for many drivers. With the introduction of autonomous driving, parking maneuver assistants are essential functional components. For the development of automatic parking assistants, a detailed characterization of a subjective evaluation is essential. The characterization analysis presented here is based on general Subjective Assessment Indicators, which cover the subjective overall performance of a parking maneuver on a customer-oriented level in as many facets as necessary. This paper shows meaningful characteristics of the individual Subjective Assessment Indicators validated in a driving study with 497 performed parking maneuvers. The study results reveal different degrees of intensity of the characterizations for the different driving maneuvers. Here, it is shown that the characterization of the Final Parking Position has different reference points for longitudinal and lateral parking maneuvers. Furthermore, it was shown that an additional characteristic "Driving-Off Behavior" is required for the evaluation of the Safety Feeling, but for Parking Comfort the "Lateral Acceleration" and for Dynamic Performance the "Distance Traveled" can be neglected. The characteristics described in this paper can be used for all parking maneuvers and vehicle types. It forms the basis for a complete evaluation and enables OEMs to apply their individual requirements in the development of parking assistants.

AB This paper presents the design of an unmanned and tele-operated robotized life-saving system aimed to work as a recovery tool in case of water-related disasters. The device is designed to save people in distress in the water, either conscious or unconscious, without exposing the rescuer's life to risk. The data of in water accidents show that the greatest number of casualties occurs because of dangerous predicaments conducted by people who want to save other lives. All present solutions are based on aerial, surface or submarine systems needing a crew and able to save only conscious people. This paper intends to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the main critical issues in the design of a marine autonomous rescue vehicle in terms of performance, capabilities of maneuver in rough sea conditions and the costs. The proposed robot is fully electric and tele-manipulated, from the shore in case of accidents near dry land, or directly from boats or helicopters if drowning is occurring in the open sea. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of a system and its readiness for prototyping phases while presenting a trade-off and cost analysis between six different configurations as well as illustrating in detail the design of the selected layout. The motivations behind the choice of diving strategy to tackle rough sea conditions are described along with the design and the numerical validations of the hydroplane and propulsion systems.

AB Once their safety is confirmed, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which do not entail ethical concerns, may become a preferred cell source for regenerative medicine. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of transplanting hiPSC-derived neurospheres (hiPSC-NSs) into nonobese diabetic (NOD)severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice to treat spinal cord injury (SCI). For this, we used a hiPSC clone (201B7), established by transducing four reprogramming factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) into adult human fibroblasts. Grafted hiPSC-NSs survived, migrated, and differentiated into the three major neural lineages (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) within the injured spinal cord. They showed both cell-autonomous and noncell-autonomous (trophic) effects, including synapse formation between hiPSC-NS-derived neurons and host mouse neurons, expression of neurotrophic factors, angiogenesis, axonal regrowth, and increased amounts of myelin in the injured area. These positive effects resulted in significantly better functional recovery compared with vehicle-treated control animals, and the recovery persisted through the end of the observation period, 112 d post-SCI. No tumor formation was observed in the hiPSC-NS-grafted mice. These findings suggest that hiPSCs give rise to neural stem/progenitor cells that support improved function post-SCI and are a promising cell source for its treatment.

AB Autonomous transportation systems (ATSs) focus on traffic services and have become more capable of handling stochastic traffic scenarios. The preliminary work for designing and constructing ATS management and control systems is to develop an instructive and systematic architecture. However, the construction process of a conventional traffic system generally follows a function- and demand-oriented way. Thus, few studies have addressed architecture integrity evaluation and verification. In this work, we propose a collaboration mechanism-based approach to ATS architecture integrity evaluation. First, to provide a clear description of ATSs, ATS theory was systematically introduced through the generation, definition, and property of its basic elements, and then the relations between each element were analyzed based on the concept of microservices. Second, a collaboration mechanism on physical architecture was proposed to realize the adaptive construction of the architecture. Additionally, to fulfill the evaluation of architecture integrity, a contrast scheme combined with system function and information flow (IF) was determined, and accordingly, two independent ways were determined to obtain both the reference and calculated results. Finally, the scenario of automatic vehicles passing through an intersection was illustrated to demonstrate the feasibility of this static simulation evaluation method for the scenario architecture, and achieved a 100% function integrity rate and 93.3% IF integrity rate. A successful application in the case study shows that the proposed method could be extended to more general traffic scenarios.

AB Comprehensive and accurate perception of the real 3D world is the basis of autonomous driving. However, many perceptual methods focus on a single task or object type, and the accuracy of existing multi-task or multi-object methods is difficult to balance against their real-time performance. This paper presents a unified framework for concurrent dynamic multi-object joint perception, which introduces a real-time monocular joint perception network termed MJPNet. In MJPNet relative weightings are automatically learned by a series of developed network branches. By training an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network on a shared feature encoder and many proposed decoding sub-branches, the information of the 2D category and 3D position/pose/size of an object are reconstructed both simultaneously and accurately. Moreover, the effective information among subtasks is transferred by multi-stream learning, guaranteeing the accuracy of each task. Compared to various state-of-the-arts, comprehensive evaluations on the benchmark of challenging image sequences demonstrate the superior performance of our 2D detection and 3D reconstruction of depth, lateral distance, orientation, and heading angle. Moreover, on the KITTI test set, the real-time runtime (up to 15 fps) of MJPNet significantly outran the public state-of-the-art visual detection methods.

AB In a world with rapidly growing levels of automation, robotics is playing an increasingly significant role in every aspect of human endeavour. In particular, many types of mobile robots are increasingly being utilised in places and for tasks that are difficult and dangerous for humans. Although the vision of fully autonomous mobile robotic platforms that can perform complex tasks without direct guidance from a human operator is compelling, the reality is that the current state of robotics technology is still a long way from being able to achieve this capability outside of very narrowly constrained contexts. Technology advancement for improved mobile robotic teleoperation and remote control is vital to enable robotic vehicles to operate with increasing autonomy levels while allowing for effective remote operation when task complexity is too great for the autonomous systems. Being motivated to bridge this gap, we present a review of existing teleoperation methods and enhancement techniques for control of mobile robots. After defining teleoperation, we provide a detailed review that analyses, categorises, and summarises existing mobile robot teleoperation methods. Next, we highlight existing enhancement techniques that have been applied to these teleoperation methods, along with their relative advantages and disadvantages. Finally, several promising future research directions are identified. The paper concludes with a discussion of research challenges and future research possibilities. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Techniques are described for research on deep-sea fishes using in situ lander platforms equipped with cameras for imaging fishes, sonars for tracking movements and other environmental monitoring sensors. Fishes are attracted to the vicinity of the platform by bait placed within view of the camera. Over most of the world's oceans at depths greater than 3000 m the dominant scavenging fish is the grenadier Coryphaenoides (Nematonurus) armatus arriving at bait within 15-150 min depending on local population abundance. Applying an inverse square law relationship scavenger abundance can be calculated from fish arrival times. These fish show evidence of optimal foraging, staying longer at the bait if food is sparse. Ingestible acoustic transmitters embedded in baits allow tracking of fish departing from the bait source. Average radial rate of movement in the abyss is 1.75 cm s(-1) dispersing small food falls within a few hours. C. armatus in the north Pacific Ocean double their swimming speed in late summer associated with seasonal enrichment of the benthos with organic carbon. In situ techniques allow comparison of swimming performance of different species, allowing elucidation of mechanisms of niche separation in otherwise apparently similar fish. Autonomous lander platforms are proposed as an important adjunct to conventional research methods based on capture of dead specimens of fish from the wild.

AB Autonomous sprayer UAVs are one of the most used aerial machines in modern agriculture. During flight missions, some common narrow obstacles appear in the flying zone. These are non-detectable from satellite images and one of the biggest challenges for autonomous sprayer UAVs in farmland. This work introduces an obstacle avoidance architecture specifically for sprayer UAVs. This architecture has generality in the spraying UAV problem, and it reduces the reliance on the global mapping of farmland. This approach computes the avoiding path based on the onboard sensor fusion system in real-time. Moreover, it autonomously determines the transition of several maneuver states using the current spraying liquid data and the UAV dynamics data obtained by offline system identification. This approach accurately tracks the avoidance path for the nonlinear time-variant spraying UAV systems. To verify the performance of the approach, we performed multiple simulations with different spraying missions, and the method demonstrated a high spraying coverage of more than 98% while successfully avoiding all vertical obstacles. We also demonstrated the adaptability of our control architecture; the safe distance between the UAV and obstacles can be changed by specifying the value of a high-level parameter on the controller. The proposed method adds value to precision agriculture, reduces mission time, and maximizes the spraying area coverage.

AB This paper presents a design approach and basic algorithms for a future system that can perform aircraft conflict resolution, arrival scheduling and convective weather avoidance with a high level of autonomy in terminal area airspace. Such a system, located on the ground, is intended to solve autonomously the major problems currently handled manually by human controllers. It has the potential to accomodate higher traffic levels and a mix of conventional and unmanned aerial vehicles with reduced dependency on controllers. The main objective of this paper is to describe the fundamental trajectory and scheduling algorithms that provide the foundation for an autonomous system of the future. These algorithms generate trajectories that are free of conflicts with other traffic, avoid convective weather if present, and provide scheduled times for landing with specified in-trail spacings. The maneuvers the algorithms generate to resolve separation and spacing conflicts include speed, horizontal path, and altitude changes. Furthermore, a method for reassigning arrival aircraft to alternate runways in order to reduce delays is also included. The algorithms generate conflict free trajectories for terminal area traffic, comprised primarily of arrivals and departures to and from multiple airports. Examples of problems solved and performance statistics from a fast-time simulation using simulated traffic of arrivals and departures at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Dallas Love Field are described.

AB With the rapid development of deep learning in recent years, the level of automatic driving perception has also increased substantially. However, automatic driving perception under adverse conditions, such as fog, remains a significant obstacle. The existing fog-oriented detection algorithms are unable to simultaneously address the detection accuracy and detection speed. Based on improved YOLOv5, this work provides a multiobject detection network for fog driving scenes. We construct a synthetic fog dataset by using the dataset of a virtual scene and the depth information of the image. Second, we present a detection network for driving in fog based on improved YOLOv5. The ResNeXt model, which has been modified by structural re-parameterization, serves as the model's backbone. We build a new feature enhancement module (FEM) in response to the lack of features in fog scene images and use the attention mechanism to help the detection network pay more attention to the more useful features in the fog scenes. The test results show that the proposed fog multitarget detection network outperforms the original YOLOv5 in terms of detection accuracy and speed. The accuracy of the Real-world Task-driven Testing Set (RTTS) public dataset is 77.8%, and the detection speed is 31 frames/s, which is 14 frames faster as compared with the original YOLOv5.

AB The rapid development and application of AI in intelligent transportation systems has widely impacted daily life. The application of an intelligent visual aid for traffic sign information recognition can provide assistance and even control vehicles to ensure safe driving. The field of autonomous driving is booming, and great progress has been made. Many traffic sign recognition algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed because of the fast execution and high recognition rate of CNNs. However, this work addresses a challenging question in the autonomous driving field: how can traffic signs be recognized in real time and accurately? The proposed method designs an improved VGG convolutional neural network and has significantly superior performance compared with existing schemes. First, some redundant convolutional layers are removed efficiently from the VGG-16 network, and the number of parameters is greatly reduced to further optimize the overall architecture and accelerate calculation. Furthermore, the BN (batch normalization) layer and GAP (global average pooling) layer are added to the network to improve the accuracy without increasing the number of parameters. The proposed method needs only 1.15 M when using the improved VGG-16 network. Finally, extensive experiments on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) Dataset are performed to evaluate our proposed scheme. Compared with traditional methods, our scheme significantly improves recognition accuracy while maintaining good real-time performance.

ID FLOW; DISPERSION; CFD; DATABASE; QUALITY
AB A method is presented for using large-eddy simulation to generate urban wake fields for use in studying the effects on the autonomous flight performance of a small quadrotor. The flowfield is solved around a single square building using OpenFOAM and stored in a database accessed by a MATLAB/Simulink flight simulator. Four flight missions are evaluated to compare the difference in performance between wake fields generated by Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and large-eddy simulation solutions. The results of the holding position in a constant freestream wind show both methods produce similar results and can hold position in all three directions within approximately +/- 1.5 body lengths. When the quadrotor is in or on the boundary of the building wake, the maximum deviation volumes, as calculated when using a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes or large-eddy simulation air wake, can differ by two orders of magnitude. Additionally, the large-eddy simulation air wakes can cause skewed deviations by as much as five to one in a given direction for both holding position and moving along a desired flight path. Since the turbulent large-eddy simulation wake field more accurately reflects the flow physics present within the wake of real-world structures, it is recommended that large-eddy-simulation-generated wake fields be used when designing and testing autonomous control algorithms for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles on the order of 0.5m in size and 2kg in mass.

AB The problem of energy management in the smart autonomous electrical grids (SAEGs) is a main challenge in the active distribution networks. In such systems, the operator of the network decides on the optimal scheduling of the resources to supply the local demand. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model is developed for a SAEG considering responsive consumers (RCs) and a hydrogen storage system (HSS). The objective functions are maximizing the reliability and minimizing both the operation cost and the gap between the energy consumption and its optimal value. The participation of the RCs is modeled through the demand shifting strategy and the local generation of the plug-in electric vehicles. To model the uncertainties of the renewable energy sources and the demand, the Monte Carlo simulation approach is used. The resulted model is solved using the shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) regarding which the non-dominated solutions are generated. Then, the best solution is obtained using the fuzzy and the weighted sum methods. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model, it is applied on a 24-node test system through defining four case studies. The results shown that in the presence of the RCs and the HSS, the operation cost and the reliability of the system both improve.

It estimates the similarity between pairs of scans using the concept of image overlap generalized to range images and furthermore provides a relative yaw angle estimate. Based on such predictions, our method is able to detect loop closures in a SLAM system or to globally localize in a given map. For loop closure detection, we use the overlap prediction as the similarity measurement to find loop closure candidates and integrate the candidate selection into an existing SLAM system to improve the mapping performance. For global localization, we propose a novel observation model using the predictions provided by OverlapNet and integrate it into a Monte-Carlo localization framework. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets collected using different LiDAR scanners in various environments. The experimental results show that our method can effectively detect loop closures surpassing the detection performance of state-of-the-art methods and that it generalizes well to different environments. Furthermore, our method reliably localizes a vehicle in typical urban environments globally using LiDAR data collected in different seasons.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), although hardly a new technology, have recently gained a prominent role in many industries being widely used not only among enthusiastic consumers, but also in high demanding professional situations, and will have a massive societal impact over the coming years. However, the operation of UAVs is fraught with serious safety risks, such as collisions with dynamic obstacles (birds, other UAVs, or randomly thrown objects). These collision scenarios are complex to analyze in real-time, sometimes being computationally impossible to solve with existing State of the Art (SoA) algorithms, making the use of UAVs an operational hazard and therefore significantly reducing their commercial applicability in urban environments. In this work, a conceptual framework for both stand-alone and swarm (networked) UAVs is introduced, with a focus on the architectural requirements of the collision avoidance subsystem to achieve acceptable levels of safety and reliability. The SoA principles for collision avoidance against stationary objects are reviewed and a novel approach is described, using deep learning techniques to solve the computational intensive problem of real-time collision avoidance with dynamic objects. The proposed framework includes a web-interface allowing the full control of UAVs as remote clients with a supervisor cloud-based platform. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated through experimental tests using a UAV, developed from scratch using the proposed framework. Test flight results are presented for an autonomous UAV monitored from multiple countries across the world.

TI Vision-aided Guidance and Navigation for Close Formation Flight
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID OPERATIONS; DESIGN
AB Close formation flight can extend an unmanned aerial vehicle's (UAV) range and endurance by utilizing lift from a wingman's wake vortices and by autonomous midair refueling or recharging. The prohibitive challenge in each of these applications is the highly accurate and reliable relative positioning that is required to station-keep in the wingman's wake and to dock, amid external disturbances. Global navigation satellite systems are well-suited to reliable absolute positioning, but they fall short for accurate relative positioning. This work proposes a relative positioning solution for UAV rendezvous and close formation flight that has been verified in multiple flight tests. A nonlinear estimation framework uses precise air-to-air measurements to correct onboard sensor measurements and produce an accurate relative state estimate that is resilient to intermittent relative measurement outages and degrades gracefully during extended outages. A guidance strategy compensates for wingman turn dynamics, acts explicitly on the estimated relative state, and is applicable to both rendezvous and formation flight. Ground testing showed a relative position estimate accuracy that is 2% of the separation distance, with successful detection and correspondence at up to 36m. Autonomous close formation flight tests verified the relative positioning solution over extended periods, as close as two wingspans, in winds that were 30%-40% of the cruise airspeed, and at altitudes as low as 15m. Root-mean-square relative position errors were 1.2m horizontally and 0.44m vertically during flights at the closest separation.

AB The North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP) recognizes waterfowl hunters and non-consumptive users as important stakeholders to sustain waterfowl populations through economic and political support for habitat conservation initiatives. Opportunities to shoot at and harvest ducks are key determinants of achievement-oriented hunt satisfaction and quality. Therefore, identifying factors influencing harvest opportunity would help hunters and wildlife managers identify optimal days afield and promote hunter recruitment, retention, and reactivation (R3) efforts in support of NAWMP. Waterfowl extensively use spatial sanctuaries during hunting seasons, especially diurnally, which could limit their perceived availability to hunters. Thus, a possible management action to support R3 is allowing limited public access on sanctuaries, which could offer diverse recreational opportunities for non-consumptive users and potentially increase harvest opportunities for hunters in traditional hunting areas if the limited disturbance caused waterfowl to leave sanctuaries. Therefore, we evaluated to what extent experimental sanctuary disturbance, landscape characteristics, and weather influenced local harvest opportunities. We conducted disturbance treatments including travel by a covered truck (i.e., truck with enclosed cab), a pedestrian on foot, and an uncovered vehicle (e.g., motor boat or all-terrain vehicle [ATV]). To measure harvest opportunity, we used autonomous recording units (ARU) to enumerate daily shotgun volleys at a landscape-scale across western Tennessee, USA, during 2019-2021 waterfowl hunting seasons. We identified 339,391 distinct shotgun volleys (x over bar $\bar{x}$ = 73 shotgun volleys/day/ARU). Shotgun volleys decreased 50% within 2 weeks of opening day and did not notably increase for the remainder of the hunting season. Contrary to our predictions, sanctuary disturbance decreased harvest opportunity. Specifically, the pedestrian disturbance and covered vehicle disturbance decreased daily shotgun volleys by 32% and 31%, respectively. Additionally, harvest opportunity decreased 20% with every 5-km increase in distance from a sanctuary. Harvest opportunity increased 2% for every 1 & DEG;C decrease from mean low temperatures and 9% with every 10-hPa increase in barometric pressure from the previous day. Conversely, harvest opportunity was unaffected by changes in cloud cover, daily precipitation, waterfowl abundance, or surface water inundation. Our results suggest disturbing sanctuaries decreases harvest opportunity and, in turn, may reduce hunt quality and satisfaction. If increasing harvest opportunity is a primary management objective, we recommend limiting sanctuary disturbance to maximize local harvest opportunities. Furthermore, greater harvest opportunity nearer sanctuaries indicates that additional disturbance-free areas may increase local harvest opportunities and hunter satisfaction.

AB In autonomous driving, object detection is considered a base step to many subsequent processes. However, object detection is challenged by loss in visibility caused by rain. Rainfall occurs in two main forms, which are streaks and streaks accumulations. Each degradation type imposes different effect on the captured videos; therefore, they cannot be mitigated in the same way. We propose a lightweight network which mitigates both types of rain degradation in real-time, without negatively affecting the object-detection task. The proposed network consists of two different modules which are used progressively. The first one is a progressive ResNet for rain streaks removal, while the second one is a transmission-guided lightweight network for rain streak accumulation removal. The network has been tested on synthetic and real rainy datasets and has been compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) networks. Additionally, time performance evaluation has been performed to ensure real-time performance. Finally, the effect of the developed deraining network has been tested on YOLO object-detection network. The proposed network exceeded SOTA by 1.12 dB in PSNR on the average result of multiple synthetic datasets with 2.29x speedup. Finally, it can be observed that the inclusion of different lightweight stages works favorably for real-time applications and could be updated to mitigate different degradation factors such as snow and sun blare.

AB Intelligent mobile vehicles asks for the ability to learn to comprehend immediate surroundings similar to human cognition and autonomously navigate in an unknown scene. Although simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can construct a geometrically surrounding map, the map contains little semantic information. This paper presents a novel stereo visual-inertial system with loop closure detection based on a semantic-topological map framework. In our system, a hybrid 3D point cloud semantic-topological mapping framework is used to realize autonomous navigation simply by providing a map for path planning and meanwhile for storing semantic information under a dynamic environment. A stereo visual-inertial system can obtain more accurate visual-inertial odometry than a monocular system, and a visual-inertial system is capable of real-time map correction when the localization module detects a loop closure. This paper adopts state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN components to obtain 2D semantic information and project it to a semi-dense 3D semantic-topological map built by stereo visual-inertial SLAM. We perform experimental evaluation of our proposed system on the EuRoC MAV datasets and we also compare it with other competitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than the other competitive methods.

AB Simple Summary
   This paper presents a hierarchical approach to place recognition and pose refinement for Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) scanning radar localisation.
   This paper presents a novel two-stage system which integrates topological localisation candidates from a radar-only place recognition system with precise pose estimation using spectral landmark-based techniques. We prove that the-recently available-seminal radar place recognition (RPR) and scan matching sub-systems are complementary in a style reminiscent of the mapping and localisation systems underpinning visual teach-and-repeat (VTR) systems which have been exhibited robustly in the last decade. Offline experiments are conducted on the most extensive radar-focused urban autonomy dataset available to the community with performance comparing favourably with and even rivalling alternative state-of-the-art radar localisation systems. Specifically, we show the long-term durability of the approach and of the sensing technology itself to autonomous navigation. We suggest a range of sensible methods of tuning the system, all of which are suitable for online operation. For both tuning regimes, we achieve, over the course of a month of localisation trials against a single static map, high recalls at high precision, and much reduced variance in erroneous metric pose estimation. As such, this work is a necessary first step towards a radar teach-and-repeat (RTR) system and the enablement of autonomy across extreme changes in appearance or inclement conditions.

AB Bats have long captured the imaginations of scientists and engineers with their unrivaled agility and maneuvering characteristics, achieved by functionally versatile dynamic wing conformations as well as more than 40 active and passive joints on the wings. Wing flexibility and complex wing kinematics not only bring a unique perspective to research in biology and aerial robotics but also pose substantial technological challenges for robot modeling, design, and control. We have created a fully self-contained, autonomous flying robot that weighs 93 grams, called Bat Bot (B2), to mimic such morphological properties of bat wings. Instead of using a large number of distributed control actuators, we implement highly stretchable silicone-based membrane wings that are controlled at a reduced number of dominant wing joints to best match the morphological characteristics of bat flight. First, the dominant degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the bat flight mechanism are identified and incorporated in B2' s design by means of a series of mechanical constraints. These biologically meaningful DOFs include asynchronous and mediolateral movements of the armwings and dorsoventral movements of the legs. Second, the continuous surface and elastic properties of bat skin under wing morphing are realized by an ultrathin (56 micrometers) membranous skin that covers the skeleton of the morphing wings. We have successfully achieved autonomous flight of B2 using a series of virtual constraints to control the articulated, morphing wings.

DE Aerial systems: perception and autonomy; deep learning in robotics and
   automation
AB On the pursuit of autonomous flying robots, the scientific community has been developing onboard real-time algorithms for localisation, mapping and planning. Despite recent progress, the available solutions still lack accuracy and robustness in many aspects. While mapping for autonomous cars had a substantive boost using deep-learning techniques to enhance LIDAR measurements using image-based depth completion, the large viewpoint variations experienced by aerial vehicles are still posing major challenges for learning-based mapping approaches. In this letter, we propose a depth completion and uncertainty estimation approach that better handles the challenges of aerial platforms, such as large viewpoint and depth variations, and limited computing resources. The core of our method is a novel compact network that performs both depth completion and confidence estimation using an image-guided approach. Real-time performance onboard a GPU suitable for small flying robots is achieved by sharing deep features between both tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms the state-of-the-art in depth completion and uncertainty estimation for single-view methods on mobile GPUs. We further present a new photorealistic aerial depth completion dataset that exhibits more challenging depth completion scenarios than the established indoor and car driving datasets. The dataset includes an open-source, visual-inertial UAV simulator for photo-realistic data generation. Our results show that our network trained on this dataset can be directly deployed on real-world outdoor aerial public datasets without fine-tuning or style transfer.

AB Most human-centred robotic applications require robots to follow a certain pre-defined path. This makes the robot's autonomous movements acceptable and predictable for humans. Planning a trajectory for the robot thus involves guiding it along this desired path. The classical approach of segmenting a path into multiple waypoints and tracking them only works well in environments which are obstacle-free or contain fixed stationary obstacles. Movable or dynamic obstacles that can potentially lie directly on waypoints result in deadlock situations causing the robot to oscillate around the desired waypoint without moving forward. This chapter presents a novel approach for trajectory planning in which an Adaptive Virtual Target (AVT) is formulated that follows the desired path irrespective of surrounding obstacles. The AVT essentially plays the role of a moving reference for the trajectory planner to track. Additionally, the AVT velocity can be adapted such that the robot can catch up in case of deviations from the path due to obstacle avoidance manoeuvres. A model predictive control (MPC) based trajectory planner tracks the AVT and accounts for obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows the robot to keep moving towards the goal by preventing deadlocks while simultaneously minimizing deviation from the desired path. Simulations based on a medical X-ray robot are provided to validate the approach.

AB The AEB-P (Autonomous Emergency Braking Pedestrian) system has the functional requirements of avoiding the pedestrian collision and ensuring the pedestrian's life safety. By studying relevant theoretical systems, such as TTC (time to collision) and braking safety distance, an AEB-P warning model was established, and the traffic safety level and work area of the AEB-P warning system were defined. The upper-layer fuzzy neural network controller of the AEB-P system was designed, and the BP (backpropagation) neural network was trained by collected pedestrian longitudinal anti-collision braking operation data of experienced drivers. Also, the fuzzy neural network model was optimized by introducing the genetic algorithm. The lower-layer controller of the AEB-P system was designed based on the PID (proportional integral derivative controller) theory, which realizes the conversion of the expected speed reduction to the pressure of a vehicle braking pipeline. The relevant pedestrian test scenarios were set up based on the C-NCAP (China-new car assessment program) test standards. The CarSim and Simulink co-simulation model of the AEB-P system was established, and a multi-condition simulation analysis was performed. The results showed that the proposed control strategy was credible and reliable and could flexibly allocate early warning and braking time according to the change in actual working conditions, to reduce the occurrence of pedestrian collision accidents.

AB Growing interest in marine autonomous systems such as underwater gliders and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has led to the increase of research on hydrofoil performance at low Reynolds numbers, bringing forward the issue of simulating laminar to turbulent transition using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Most conventional turbulence closures in practical Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are incapable of predicting transition with excessive turbulence generation near the leading edge, deriving from their eddy viscosity assumption. Having the potential of inherently predicting transition by solving the near wall flow accurately, three Low-Re BANS closures with anisotropy consideration are selected and evaluated for their ability to capture both separation-induced transition and natural transition. The empirical gamma - Re-theta transition model is also assessed in this work. Comparison with published experiments shows the capability of the four turbulence closures to capture separation-induced transition accurately. Predicting natural transition remains more challenging: two Low-Re closures exhibit the potential to capture natural transition only at medium grid finesse levels, whereas the gamma - Re-theta model evidences challenges in reproducing the correct flow physics. The lag elliptic blending model provides the most accurate solution owing to its consistent grid convergence, high accuracy for predicting the hydrodynamic coefficients, and ability to reproduce the correct transition physics.

AB Prediction of the substantial biologically mediated carbon flows in a rapidly changing and acidifying ocean requires model simulations informed by observations of key carbon cycle processes on the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. From 2000 to 2004, the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) supported the development of the first low-cost, fully autonomous ocean profiling Carbon Explorers, which demonstrated that year-round, real-time observations of particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration and sedimentation could be achieved in the world's ocean. NOPP also initiated the development of a particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) sensor suitable for operational deployment across all oceanographic platforms. As a result, PIC profile characterization that once required shipboard sample collection and shipboard or shore-based laboratory analysis is now possible to full ocean depth in real time using a 0.2-W sensor operating at 24 Hz. NOPP developments further spawned US Department of Energy support to develop the Carbon Flux Explorer, a free vehicle capable of following hourly variations of PIC and POC sedimentation from the near surface to kilometer depths for seasons to years and capable of relaying contemporaneous observations via satellite.
   We have demonstrated the feasibility of real-time, low-cost carbon observations that are of fundamental value to carbon prediction and that, when further developed, will lead to a fully enhanced global carbon observatory capable of real-time assessment of the ocean carbon sink, a needed constraint for assessment of carbon management policies on a global scale.

ID POINT CLOUD
AB Light detection and ranging technology allows for the creation of detailed 3D point clouds of physical objects and environments. Therefore, it has the potential to provide valuable information for the operation of various kinds of cyber-physical systems that need to be aware of, and interact with, their surroundings, such as autonomous vehicles and robots. Point clouds can also become the basis for the creation of digital representations of different assets and a system's operational environment. This article outlines a system architecture that integrates the geo-spatial context information provided by LiDAR scans with behavioral models of the components of a cyber-physical system to create a digital twin. The clear distinction between behavior and data sets the proposed digital twin architecture apart from existing approaches (that primarily focus on the data aspect), and promotes contextual digital twin generation through executable process models. A vaccine logistics automation use case is detailed to illustrate how information regarding the environment can be used for the operation of an autonomous robot carrying out transport preparation tasks. Besides supporting operation, we propose to combine context data retrieved from the system at different points in the logistics process with information regarding instances of executable behavior models as part of the digital twin architecture. The twin can subsequently be used to facilitate system and process monitoring through relevant stakeholders and structure context data in a user-centric fashion.

AB Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision systems with a wide range of applications in autonomous driving, medical imaging, retail, security, face recognition, robotics, and others. Nowadays, neural networks based models are used to localize and classify instances of objects of particular classes. When real-time inference is not required, ensembles of models help to achieve better results. In this work, we present a novel method for fusing predictions from different object detection models: weighted boxes fusion. Our algorithm utilizes confidence scores of all proposed bounding boxes to construct averaged boxes. We tested the method on several datasets and evaluated it in the context of Open Images and COCO Object Detection challenges, achieving top results in these challenges. The 3D version of boxes fusion was successfully applied by the winning teams of Waymo Open Dataset and Lyft 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles challenges. The source code is publicly available at GitHub (Solovyev, 2019 [31]). We present a novel method for combining predictions in ensembles of different object detection models: weighted boxes fusion.

AB Visual navigation is a key enabling technology for autonomous mobile vehicles. The ability to provide large-scale, long-term navigation using low-cost, low-power vision sensors is appealing for industrial applications. A crucial requirement for long-term navigation systems is the ability to localize in environments whose appearance is constantly changing over time-due to lighting, weather, seasons, and physical changes. This paper presents a multiexperience localization (MEL) system that uses a powerful map representation-storing every visual experience in layers-that does not make assumptions about underlying appearance modalities and generators. Our localization system provides real-time performance by selecting online, a subset of experiences against which to localize. We achieve this task through a novel experience-triage algorithm based on collaborative filtering, which selects experiences relevant to the live view, outperforming competing techniques. Based on classical memory-based recommender systems, this technique also enables landmark-level recommendations, is entirely online, and requires no training data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the MEL system in the context of long-term autonomous path following in unstructured outdoor environments with a challenging 100-day field experiment through day, night, snow, spring, and summer. We furthermore provide offline analysis comparing our system to several state-of-the-art alternatives. We show that the combination of the novel methods presented in this paper enable full use of incredibly rich multiexperience maps, opening the door to robust long-term visual localization.

AB Cooperative intelligent and autonomous transportation systems rely on intelligent sensing, computing, and actuating technologies for unmanned freight and public movements. The information gained from neighbors and communication infrastructures provides efficient actuation for safe and sustained transportation. This article resolves traffic data management congestion using sixth-generation (6G) communication and computing techniques. Terahertz and machine-type communications are exploited for swift information exchange, bypassing the congestion effects. Congestion occurs when demand for road space exceeds supply. This proposal incorporates prediction-based learning to compute the feasibility of handling traffic information and cooperative intelligent transportation. This model is named Congestion-aware Pre-predictive Data Allocation (CPPDA). The traffic flows causing congestion in the data exchange process are predicted for re-allocation and independent channel utilization. In this learning, the pre-predicted instances are updated with the actual identified utilization-to-congestion rate. Therefore, the congestion-causing channels for sensing are identified with ease, reducing the outage. The outage is examined for a basic inter-vehicle data link. Through the optimal allocation of channels for actuation, cloud-aided resources are utilized to a maximum level, leveraging infrastructure support. In addition to an outage of 10.83%, the response time of 14.75%, congestion factor of 8.2%, computational overhead of 6.4%, and information gain factors of 6.86% are analyzed through a comparative study.

AB As a critical sensor for high-level autonomous vehicles, LiDAR's limitations in adverse weather (e.g. rain, fog, snow, etc.) impede the deployment of self-driving cars in all weather conditions. However, studies in literature on LiDAR's performance in harsh conditions are insufficient. In this paper, based on a dataset collected with a popular Near-InfraRed (NIR) ToF LiDAR in a well-controlled artificial fog chamber, we statistically model the LiDAR ranging process in fog conditions through a data-driven approach. Specifically, giving an object at a known distance, our model is able to predict LiDAR measures (range and intensity) under various fog conditions. For a transmitted laser under fog, we first model and predict the minimum visibility required to detect its true range or not. Then, the noisy range and intensity measures are sampled from the probabilistic measurement distributions inferred from the dataset. The performance of the proposed method has been quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. Experimental results show that our approach can provide a promising performance prediction of the utilized NIR ToF LiDAR under fog, which opens a new gate to the quantitative assessment of adverse weather and contributes to the specification of relevant Operational Domain Designs (ODDs).

AB With cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and other new information technologies going into space, the era of space intelligence is coming. The spacecraft is facing more frequent and multi-task tests in an unprecedented complex environment, which set higher requirements for self-management. The current challenge lies in how to further build an integrated system of the virtual and physical space for spacecraft. In this tendency, the integration of Digital twin(DT) with spacecraft is also in its evolutionary trend. DT provides a data and model-based systematic approach for operation and management in the entire service life of on-orbit spacecraft. In this context, as a basic space system entity, the method of constructing DT of spacecraft is explored in this paper. Firstly, the concept of Spacecraft Digital twin (SDT) is put forward and four stages of simulation development are discussed from the perspective of DT. Moreover, the conceptual structure of four-dimensional model is proposed to adapt spatial distribution. After that, the key problems of SDT are discussed, including data acquisition, system configuration, and data service model. Accordingly, the future intelligent applications of spacecraft based on DT in autonomous cognition, autonomous operation and maintenance, as well as cluster collaboration are presented respectively.

AB Ship maneuvering toward a dock is a hot research topic in the field of autonomous ships. How to realize autonomous low-speed maneuver to a designated location under environmental disturbances is the fundamental problem at present. In addition, potential collisions with other nearby vessels and evasive maneuvers that meet maritime regulations increase the complexity of maneuvering. This paper presents an effective ship control strategy for collision-free maneuver toward a dock. In the strategy, a line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm is utilized to steer the ship along a pre-planned path toward the dock. A collision risk factor that takes ship's maneuvering characteristics, ship domain and relative velocity into account is designed for collision avoidance. Evasive maneuvers complying with the main rules of the international collision avoidance regulations at sea can be achieved based on the risk factor. A ship bumper is constructed, based on which the strategy can switch to either "path following" or "collision avoidance". Numerical simulations for different encounter situations including head-on, starboard-crossing and overtaking under wind perturbations are carried out. The results show the proposed strategy is able to keep the ship domain free during maneuvering and steer the ship to the docking area in a safe and appropriate manner.

AB The integral line-of-sight guidance law for path following applications of autonomous surface vessels is presented in a unified manner, merging intuitive and theoretical aspects of this valuable control technique. Straight line path following scenarios of underactuated surface vessels in the presence of unknown constant irrotational ocean currents are considered. The integral line-of-sight guidance and two feedback controllers are combined into a cascaded configuration where the integral effect in the line-of-sight guidance is introduced to counteract the disturbance. The chosen integration law is defined to reduce the risk of wind-up effects, and it is shown that the integral action in the line-of-sight guidance law performs a vectorial sum between the vessel relative velocity and the unknown current velocity to compensate for the drift. Moreover, only relative velocities are used in the feedback loop since the ocean current is assumed constant and irrotational. Redefining the vessel model with relative velocities significantly simplifies the control system compared to the approach based on absolute velocities. Closed-loop uniform local exponential stability is achieved for path following of straight line paths. Furthermore, in steady state, the presented guidance law paired with measurements of the absolute speed and the relative speed of the vessel yields to an estimation of the ocean current. Simulations are presented to support the theoretical results.

AB The subject of autonomy within unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has proven to be a remarkable research field - mostly due to the development of AI techniques within embedded advanced bespoke microcontrollers - during the last several decades. For drones, as safety-critical systems, there is an increasing need for onboard detect & avoid (DAA) technology i) to see, sense or detect conflicting traffic or imminent non-cooperative threats due to their high mobility with multiple degrees of freedom and the complexity of deployed unstructured environments, and subsequently ii) to take the appropriate actions to avoid collisions depending upon the level of autonomy. The safe and efficient integration of UAV traffic management (UTM) systems with air traffic management (ATM) systems, using intelligent autonomous approaches, is an emerging requirement where the number of diverse UAV applications is increasing on a large scale in dense air traffic environments for completing swarms of multiple complex missions flexibly and simultaneously. Significant progress over the past few years has been made in detecting UAVs present in aerospace, identifying them, and determining their existing flight path. This study makes greater use of electronic conspicuity (EC) information made available by PilotAware Ltd (https://www.pilotaware.com) in developing an advanced collision management methodology - Drone Aware Collision Management (DACM) - capable of determining and executing a variety of time-optimal evasive collision avoidance (CA) manoeuvres using a reactive geometric conflict detection and resolution (CDR) technique. The merits of the DACM methodology have been demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world field tests in avoiding mid-air collisions (MAC) between UAVs and manned aeroplanes. The results show that the proposed methodology can be employed successfully in avoiding collisions while limiting the deviation from the original trajectory in highly dynamic aerospace without requiring sophisticated sensors and prior training. With the proposed technological improvement equipped with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, MAC risks which cannot be avoided with the current off-the-shelf sensor technologies, in particular, between flights with very high velocities, can be definitely prevented with the accurate measurements and state and situation awareness (SSA) that uses a global coverage strategy with real-time low latency EC data feeds acquired from all aircraft. The MAC standards, dictated by the aviation authorities, can be mandated for UAVs considering the reliable decision-making abilities of DACM - without creating new collision risks during evasive manoeuvres, which can expedite the safe and efficient integration of UAVs into ATM systems.

AB Repairing potholes is a task for municipalities to prevent serious road user injuries and vehicle damage. This study presents a low-cost, high-performance pothole monitoring system to maintain urban roads. The authors developed a methodology based on photogrammetry techniques to predict the pothole's shape and volume. A collection of overlapping 2D images shot by a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has been used to create a pothole 3D model. The Raspberry-based configuration has been mounted on an autonomous and remote-controlled robot (developed in the InfraROB European project) to reduce workers' exposure to live traffic in survey activities and automate the process. The outputs of photogrammetry processing software have been validated through laboratory tests set as ground truth; the trial has been conducted on a tile made of asphalt mixture, reproducing a real pothole. Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) technologies allowed visualising potholes on a map with information about their centre, volume, backfill material, and an associated image. Ten on-site tests validated that the system works in an uncontrolled environment and not only in the laboratory.

AB The population of the world is predicted to reach nine billion by 2050, implying that agricultural output must continue to rise. To deal with population expansion, agricultural chores must be mechanized and automated. Over the last decade, ground robots have been developed for a variety of agricultural applications, with autonomous and safe navigation being one of the most difficult hurdles in this development. When a mobile platform moves autonomously, it must perform a variety of tasks, including localization, route planning, motion control, and mapping, which is a critical stage in autonomous operations. This research examines several agricultural applications as well as the path planning approach used. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current literature on path/trajectory planning aspects of ground robots in agriculture using a systematic literature review technique, to contribute to the goal of contributing new information in the field. Coverage route planning appears to be less advanced in agriculture than point-to-point path routing, according to the finding, which is due to the fact that covering activities are usually required for agricultural applications, but precision agriculture necessitates point-to-point navigation. In the recent era, precision agriculture is getting more attention. The conclusion presented here demonstrates that both field coverage and point-to-point navigation have been applied successfully in path planning for agricultural robots.

ID ROBOTS
AB We develop a set of novel autonomous controllers for multiple point-mass robots or agents in the presence of wall-like rectangular planes in three-dimensional space. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that such a set of controllers for the avoidance of rectangular planes has been derived from a single attractive and repulsive potential function that satisfies the conditions of the Direct Method of Lyapunov. The potential or Lyapunov function also proves the stability of the system of the first-order ordinary differential equations governing the motion of the multiple agents as they traverse the three-dimensional space from an initial position to a target that is the equilibrium point of the system. The avoidance of the walls is via an approach called the Minimum Distance Technique that enables a point-mass agent to avoid the wall from the shortest distance away at every unit time. Computer simulations of the proposed Lyapunov-based controllers for the multiple point-mass agents navigating in a common workspace are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the controllers. Simulations include towers and walls of tunnels as obstacles. In the simulations, the point-mass agents also show typical swarming behaviors such as split-and-rejoin maneuvers when confronted with multiple tower-like structures. The successful illustration of the effectiveness of the controllers opens a fertile area of research in the development and implementation of such controllers for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles such as quadrotors.

AB Recently, the cooperative control of multiple vessels has been gaining increasing attention because of the potential robustness, reliability and efficiency of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we propose the concept of Cooperative Multi-Vessel Systems (CMVSs) consisting of multiple coordinated autonomous vessels. We in particular focus on the so-called Vessel Train Formation (VTF) problem. The VTF problem considers not only cooperative collision avoidance, but also grouping of vessels. An MPC-based approach is proposed for addressing the VTF problem. A centralized and a distributed formulation based on the Alternating Direction of Multipliers Method (ADMM) are investigated. The distributed formulation adopts a single-layer serial iterative architecture, which gains the benefits of reduced communication requirements and robustness against failures. The impacts of information updating sequences and responsibility parameters are discussed. We furthermore analyze the scalability of the proposed method. Simulation experiments of a CMVS navigating from different terminals in the Port of Rotterdam to inland waterways are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed method successfully steers the vessels from different origins to form a vessel train. Due to the effective communication, vessels can timely respond to the velocity changes that others make. After the formation is formed, the distances between vessels become constant. The results show the potential to use CMVSs for inland shipping with enhanced safety.

AB Driver assistance systems have the potential to create the basis for future mobility solutions. They enable older generations in need of assistance to maintain their mobility even in the case of physical deficits. Therefore, we conducted a literature review and identified factors that may influence the acceptance of driver assistance systems. Based on the technology acceptance model and other influencing factors, we developed a research model that was validated with the help of a study (n = 227). The results show that, depending on age, there are differences in the acceptance of driver assistance systems and their influencing factors among old and young people. The five determinants of acceptance, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and trust in technology are viewed as equally important for all age groups. Differences emerge within the group of older vehicle drivers with varying weighting. For the 50-59 age group, perceived ease of use and social norm are most important, while for the 60-69 age group, perceived usefulness and trust in technology are very important. Among 70-90-year olds, trust in technology is emphasized as most important. Our results show how important it is to increase the confidence of older drivers in age-appropriate driver assistance systems, using target-group-specific advertising and public relations work.

AB This research addresses two kinds of problems related to optimal trajectory tracking of a Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS): those caused by the time-varying external disturbances including winds, waves and ocean currents as well as those resulting from inherent dynamical uncertainties. As the paper shows, an accurate and robust optimal controller can successfully deal with both issues. An improved Optimal Adaptive Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control (OAST-SMC) algorithm is proposed here as a robust optimal adaptive strategy. In this strategy, in order to improve performance of the standard super-twisting approach, we apply an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP)-based optimal tuning of gains and an underlying concept based on Time Delay Estimation (TDE). An ADP algorithm is implemented using an actor-critic neural network to deal with the curse of dimensionality in Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. The critical role of TDE part in this algorithm is estimating the impact of disturbances and uncertainties on the MASS model. The results have shown that OAST-TDE significantly outperforms the ST-TDE and AST-TDE algorithm in terms of the optimal control efforts. Also, compared with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), proposed controller meets the optimal control efforts and accurate tracking concurrently.

AB Robotic handling systems are increasingly applied in distribution centers. They require little space, provide flexibility in managing varying demand requirements, and are able to work 24/7. This makes them particularly fit for e-commerce operations. This paper reviews new categories of automated and robotic handling systems, such as shuttle-based storage and retrieval systems, shuttle-based compact storage systems, and robotic mobile fulfillment systems. For each system, we categorize the literature in three groups: system analysis, design optimization, and operations planning and control. Our focus is to identify the research issue and operations research modeling methodology adopted to analyze the problem. We find that many new robotic systems and applications have hardly been studied in academic literature, despite their increasing use in practice. Because of unique system features (such as autonomous control, flexible layout, networked and dynamic operation), new models and methods are needed to address the design and operational control challenges for such systems, in particular, for the integration of subsystems. Integrated robotic warehouse systems will form the next category of warehouses. All vital warehouse design, planning, and control logic, such as methods to design layout, storage and order-picking system selection, storage slotting, order batching, picker routing, and picker to order assignment, will have to be revisited for new robotized warehouses.

AB Hybridization of energy storages (ESs) with different ramp rates helps minimization of system bus voltage variation and extension of ESs lifetime in dc microgrids. Hybrid ES system (HESS) control is normally realized with centralized coordination. In this paper, HESS distributed control, which is independent of the communication link, is proposed to enhance system reliability. All ESs are configured as slack terminals to regulate system bus voltage with droop control. System net power decomposition and ESs power sharing are realized with localized low-pass filter (LPF) applied to ESs with low-ramp rates. The relationship between LPF cut-off frequency and ES ramp rate is elaborated in detail. However, bus voltage deviation and power tracking errors are the main drawbacks of HESS distributed control. Multilevel energy management system (EMS) is thus proposed to enhance system control accuracy. HESS distributed control is scheduled as the primary control. Bus voltage restoration and power sharing compensation are applied in secondary control to eliminate the voltage deviation and power tracking errors, respectively. In tertiary control, autonomous state of charge (SoC) recovery is implemented to limit SoC variation of ES with high-ramp rate. A lab-scale dc microgrid is developed to verify the proposed multilevel EMS for HESS control.

AB This paper seeks to provide an autonomous navigation systems engineer with the tools and insights needed to design a high-integrity navigation system. The term "high integrity" is used here to describe a system that is robust to failure and at the very least can be guaranteed upon failure to attain a " safe" state. By designing for high integrity, the designer is acknowledging the fact that at some point in time, the system will fail. The time between failures may be maximized by choosing high-reliability components, but nevertheless the components (whether they be sensors, actuators, mechanics, computers, or even mathematical models) will at some time fail in potentially unpredictable ways. A navigation system is said to have high integrity if a guarantee is provided that while individual components may fail, the system as a whole will never fail in a catastrophic manner, and therefore Hill not require any human intervention. Without the guarantee of integrity, autonomous navigation systems will be difficult, if not impossible, to deploy in real-world applications. This paper aims to provide this guarantee by determining the necessary conditions that are required for a navigation system to be considered of high integrity. Frequency-domain techniques are used to model the contribution of sensor and process faults to navigation system performance. This methodology provides the foundation needed to design navigation systems with enough frequency redundant information to make possible reliable fault detection and identification over the entire operating frequency spectrum.

AB The ability to perceive and understand 3-D space is crucial for autonomous driving to effectively navigate their surroundings and make informed decisions. However, deep learning on point clouds is currently in its early stages due to the unique challenges of processing such data with deep neural networks. One of the major challenges lies in accurately detecting partially occluded objects under various practical conditions. To address this problem, we propose 3-D detector for Occluded Object under Obstructed conditions (3ONet), a two-stage light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-based 3-D object detection framework. Leveraging the advantages of the point-voxel-based method, 3ONet efficiently encodes multiscale features, enabling the generation of high-quality 3-D proposals while preserving detailed object shape information. Specifically, we introduce a point reconstruction network module designed to recover the missing 3-D spatial structures of foreground points. In the first stage, 3ONet identifies the regions containing foreground objects using a point segmentation network and combines them with the proposals to reconstruct the occluded object's 3-D point cloud geometry using an encoder-decoder approach. The refinement stage further enhances the performance by rescoring and adjusting the box location based on the enriched spatial shape information. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework on the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open dataset, and the results demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance in 3-D object detection.

AB Driver monitoring systems (DMS) are a key component of vehicular safety and essential for the transition from semi-autonomous to fully autonomous driving. Neuromorphic vision systems, based on event camera technology, provide advanced sensing in motion analysis tasks. In particular, the behaviours of drivers' eyes have been studied for the detection of drowsiness and distraction. This research explores the potential to extend neuromorphic sensing techniques to analyse the entire facial region, detecting yawning behaviours that give a complimentary indicator of drowsiness. A second proof of concept for the use of event cameras to detect the fastening or unfastening of a seatbelt is also developed. Synthetic training datasets are derived from RGB and Near-Infrared (NIR) video from both private and public datasets using a video-to-event converter and used to train, validate, and test a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a self-attention module and a recurrent head for both yawning and seatbelt tasks. For yawn detection, respective F1-scores of 95.3% and 90.4% were achieved on synthetic events from our test set and the "YawDD" dataset. For seatbelt fastness detection, 100% accuracy was achieved on unseen test sets of both synthetic and real events. These results demonstrate the feasibility to add yawn detection and seatbelt fastness detection components to neuromorphic DMS.

AB Improving the level of autonomy during the landing phase helps promote the full-envelope autonomous flight capability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Aiming at the identification of potential landing sites, an end-to-end state estimation method for the autonomous landing of carrier-based UAVs based on monocular vision is proposed in this paper, which allows them to discover landing sites in flight by using equipped optical sensors and avoid a crash or damage during normal and emergency landings. This scheme aims to solve two problems: the requirement of accuracy for runway detection and the requirement of precision for UAV state estimation. First, we design a robust runway detection framework on the basis of YOLOv5 (you only look once, ver. 5) with four modules: a data augmentation layer, a feature extraction layer, a feature aggregation layer and a target prediction layer. Then, the corner prediction method based on geometric features is introduced into the prediction model of the detection framework, which enables the landing field prediction to more precisely fit the runway appearance. In simulation experiments, we developed datasets applied to carrier-based UAV landing simulations based on monocular vision. In addition, our method was implemented with help of the PyTorch deep learning tool, which supports the dynamic and efficient construction of a detection network. Results showed that the proposed method achieved a higher precision and better performance on state estimation during carrier-based UAV landings.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a seamless autonomous navigation method based on the motion constraint of the mobile robot, which is able to meet the practical need of maintaining the navigation accuracy during global positioning system (GPS) outages.
   Design/methodology/approach - The seamless method uses the motion constraint of the mobile robot to establish the filter model of the system, in which the virtual observation about the speed is used to overcome the shortage of the navigation accuracy during GPS outages. The corresponding motion constraint model of the mobile robot is established. The proposed seamless navigation scheme includes two parts: the micro inertial navigation system (MINS)/GPS- integrated filter model and the motion constraint filter model. When the satellite signals are good, the system works on the MINS/GPS-integrated mode. If some obstacles block the GPS signals, the motion constraint measurement equation will be effective so as to improve the navigation accuracy of the mobile robot.
   Findings - Three different vehicle tests of the mobile robot show that the seamless navigation method can overcome the shortage of the navigation accuracy during GPS outages, so as to improve the navigation performance in practical applications.
   Originality/value - A seamless navigation system based on the motion constraint of the mobile robot is proposed to overcome the shortage of the navigation accuracy during GPS outages, thus improving the adaptability of the robot navigation.

AB Vulnerable road users as bicyclists and pedestrians account for a significant share of fatalities and serious injuries in the road transport system. Traditionally, the protection for bicyclists has been addressed by speed management and separating vulnerable road users from motorized traffic. Also, the use of bicycle helmet has been prompted and regulated in some countries. Pedestrian protection by improving the car fontal design has been around since the late 1990s and has proven to be effective in reducing injury risk on pedestrians (Strandroth et al., 2011) as well as on bicyclists (Strandroth et al., 2014). Pedestrian detection with Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) has also been introduced on the market to prevent and mitigate pedestrian and bicyclist injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the different interventions promoting safety for vulnerable road users, and an additional purpose was to look at the combined effect of the interventions. Swedish emergency hospital reports from approximately 2000 bicyclists and 1200 pedestrians between Jan 1st 2003 and March 2014 were included in the study. Hospital reports including injury diagnosis were combined with police data and the vehicle registry in order to obtain detailed vehicle information. Euro NCAP pedestrian test score, speed limit restriction and helmet use was correlated with real-life pedestrian and bicyclist injuries. The results showed that on pedestrians, large injury reductions were found comparing low scoring cars (1-9 p) in the Euro NCAP pedestrian test to high scoring cars (>18 p). Also for bicyclists significant injury reductions were found. Focusing on bicyclist's injury level, large reductions were found on all body regions, with the highest reduction on head injuries. The effect of speed limit restriction showed few statistically significant results, although across both pedestrian and bicyclist injuries the trends showed overall small but positive effects. The effect of helmet use on bicyclist injuries was investigated both on individual level and on head injury level. Helmet showed to significantly reduce the risk of head injuries. However, on individual level, the results were quiet conflicting, and only on mRPMI10+ level a positive and statistically significant reduction was found. The calculated combined effect of speed-reduction, helmet-use and car frontal design was 79%. Also, preliminary calculations, based on a limited number of cases, and including both bicyclists and pedestrians, showed that when adding the effect of AEB, the risk of long-term impairment decreased by more than 90%.

AB Smart production systems (SPSs) are complex smart network systems composed of multiple smart objects that require a self-decision-making mechanism for quick and accurate execution and decision making of dynamic smart production tasks. However, there is currently no uniform self-decision mechanism to handle the dynamic uncertainty of multi-smart object behaviors and ensure SPSs stability. To address this problem, this paper proposes a comprehensive self-decision method for SPSs that considers users' preferences. A common technological framework for SPSs, a self-decision feature tree, and a self-decision mechanism with three modules are proposed in this paper to define conditions of dynamic smart production scheme (DSPs), optimize DSPs, and recommend DSPs. Autonomic computing methods and improved uncertainty theory are used to achieve real-time optimization and satisfy multi-objective performance requirements. Additionally, a collaborative filtering algorithm integrated with basic user preferences (user-CFA) is proposed to enable autonomous scheme recommendations. Finally, the effectiveness and autonomous operation of self-decision method is demonstrated through a case study on multi-Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), where we compare it with conventional methods. The results confirm the advantages of our proposed self-decision method, which contributes to the development and improvement of SPSs.

ID AUTONOMOUS EXPLORATION
AB The ability to plan informative paths online is essential to robot autonomy. In particular, sampling-based approaches are often used as they are capable of using arbitrary information gain formulations. However, they are prone to local minima, resulting in sub-optimal trajectories, and sometimes do not reach global coverage. In this letter, we present a new RRT*-inspired online informative path planning algorithm. Our method continuously expands a single tree of candidate trajectories and rewires nodes to maintain the tree and refine intermediate paths. This allows the algorithm to achieve global coverage and maximize the utility of a path in a global context, using a single objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm's capabilities in the applications of autonomous indoor exploration as well as accurate Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF)-based 3D reconstruction on-board a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). We study the impact of commonly used information gain and cost formulations in these scenarios and propose a novel TSDF-based 3D reconstruction gain and cost-utility formulation. Detailed evaluation in realistic simulation environments show that our approach outperforms sampling-based state of the art methods in these tasks. Experiments on a real MAV demonstrate the ability of our method to robustly plan in real-time, exploring an indoor environment with on-board sensing and computation. We make our framework available for future research.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Street Scene Parsing (SSP) is a fundamental and important step for autonomous driving and traffic scene understanding. Recently, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) based methods have delivered expressive performances with the help of large-scale dense-labeling datasets. However, in urban traffic environments, not all the labels contribute equally for making the control decision. Certain labels such as pedestrian, car, bicyclist, road lane or sidewalk would be more important in comparison with labels for vegetation, sky or building. Based on this fact, in this paper we propose a novel deep learning framework, named Residual Atrous Pyramid Network (RAPNet), for importance-aware SSP. More specifically, to incorporate the importance of various object classes, we propose an Importance-Aware Feature Selection (IAFS) mechanism which automatically selects the important features for label predictions. The IAFS can operate in each convolutional block, and the semantic features with different importance are captured in different channels so that they are automatically assigned with corresponding weights. To enhance the labeling coherence, we also propose a Residual Atrous Spatial Pyramid (RASP) module to sequentially aggregate global-to-local context information in a residual refinement manner. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks have shown that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performances, and can consistently obtain more accurate results on the semantic classes with high importance levels.

ID DRIVER ASSISTANCE TECHNOLOGIES; AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING
AB Objective: The objective of this research is to use historical crash data to evaluate the potential benefits of both high-and low-speed automatic emergency braking (AEB) with forward collision warning (FCW) systems.
   Methods: Crash data from the NHTSA's NASS-General Estimates System (GES) and Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) databases were categorized to classify crashes by the speed environment, as well as to identify cases where FCW systems would be applicable.
   Results: Though only about 19% of reported crashes occur in environments with speeds greater than 45mph, approximately 32% of all serious or fatal crashes occur in environments with speeds greater than 45 mph. The percentage of crashes where FCW systems would be relevant has remained remarkably constant, varying between about 21 and 26% from 2002 to 2015. In 2-vehicle fatal crashes where one rear-ends the other, the fatality rates are actually higher in the struck vehicle (33%) than the striking vehicle (26%). The disparity is even greater when considering size-class differences, such as when a light truck rear-ends a passenger car (15 vs. 42% fatality rates, respectively).
   Conclusions: NHTSA and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) proposed the Automatic Emergency Braking Initiative in 2015, which is intended to make AEB (also called crash-imminent braking) with FCW systems standard on nearly all new cars by September 2022. Twenty automakers representing 99% of the U.S. auto market voluntarily committed to the initiative. Though the commitment to safety is laudable, the AEB component of the agreement only covers low-speed AEB systems, with the test requirements set to 24mph or optionally as low as 12mph. The test requirements for the FCW component of the agreement include 2 tests that begin at 45mph. Only 21% of relevant serious injury or fatal accidents occur in environments at speeds under 24mph, whereas about 22% of serious or fatal crashes occur in environments with speeds greater than 45mph. This means that the AEB with FCW systems as agreed upon will cover only 21% of serious or fatal crashes and will not cover 22% of serious or fatal crashes. Because these systems are protective not only for the occupants of the vehicle where they are installed but also other vehicles on the roads, the data indicate that these systems should be a standard feature on all cars for high-speed as well as low-speed environments for the greatest social benefit.

   Transport system analysis; Impact analysis
ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; AUTOMATED VEHICLES
AB This paper presents an analysis of the potential impacts of large-scale adoption of driverless trucks on transport patterns and system costs for a national freight transport system with Sweden as a case study. The analysis is performed by extending the application domain of the Swedish national freight transport model Samgods to analyze two types of driverless truck scenarios. The first scenario represents a full adoption of driverless trucks that can operate the complete road network and thereby substitute manually driven trucks. In this scenario, road transport tonne-kilometers on Swedish territory increase by 22%, vehicle kilometers traveled by trucks increase by 35% and annual total system costs decrease by 1.7 B(sic) compared to a baseline scenario without driverless trucks. In the second scenario, the current fleet of manually driven trucks is complemented by driverless trucks that can operate on major roads between logistics hubs, but not in complex traffic environments like urban areas due to a limited operational design domain. This may be an initial use-case for driverless trucks operating on public roads. In this scenario, road tonne-kilometers increase by 11%, truck vehicle kilometers traveled increase by 15%, and annual total system costs decrease by 1.2 B_ compared to the baseline. For both scenarios, the impacts of driverless trucks vary significantly between commodity types and transport distances which suggests heterogeneity of benefits of automated driving between different types of freight flows. A sensitivity analysis is performed in which the costs for driverless truck operations is varied, and for the second scenario, also which parts of the road network that driverless trucks can operate are varied. This analysis indicates that the magnitude of impacts is highly dependent on the cost level of driverless trucks and that the ability for DL-trucks to perform international, cross-border transport is crucial for achieving reductions in system costs. An overarching conclusion of the study is that driverless trucks may lead to a significant increase in road transport demand due to modal shifts from rail and sea as a result of the improved cost performance of road transport. This would further strengthen the need to decarbonize road transport to meet non-negotiable climate targets. Important topics for future research include assessing potential societal costs related to driverless trucks due to infrastructure investments and negative externalities such as increasing CO2 emissions and congestion.

DE Surface vehicles; Nonlinear modeling; Bifurcations; Nonlinear dynamics
ID SHIP; FEEDBACK; TRACKING
AB The dynamics of surface vehicles such as boats and ships, when modeled as a rigid body, is complex as it is strongly nonlinear and involves six degrees of freedom. We are particularly interested in the steering dynamics decoupled from pitching and rolling as the basis of our research on unmanned boats and autonomy. Steering dynamics has been traditionally modeled using a linear Nomoto's model, which however does a poor job of capturing real nonlinear phenomena. On the other hand, there exists a somewhat simplified three-degree-of-freedom nonlinear model derived by Abkowitz, which, although better than the Nomoto's model, is still too intractable for analytical methods. In this paper, we derive a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom model with a cubic nonlinearity that is conditionally equivalent to the Abkowitz model. Using this model, we analyze the yaw motion of an autopilot ship with a PD controller under the influence of an external wave force. Analytical and numerical investigations of the nonlinear dynamics are performed using parameters of an example container ship for various sea states. We employ the harmonic balance method to investigate the nonlinear frequency response of the ship under the influence of different parameters and demonstrate that the external wave force is balanced by stiffer ships. We also numerically investigate the nonlinear dynamic behavior to understand the different mechanisms involved in transitions from periodic to chaotic behavior under the influence of various parameters and different sea state conditions. The analysis reveals periodic response of the ship for a calm sea state. It is noteworthy that for lower values of linear stiffness, higher values of nonlinear stiffness, and higher values of external wave force corresponding to higher sea states, the bifurcation structure reveals mixed dynamic response in which periodic solutions evolve into period doubled, period tripled, and chaotic-like solutions even with high levels of damping. This work aims to demonstrate the utility of a simple nonlinear model and nonlinear behavior of steering motion of the ships to gain better insight into the nonlinear dynamics of autonomous surface vehicles. Further, the model stands out as an accessible nonlinear model for steering motion of the ship adequately representing the dynamics of real ships. It hence provides a basis for much improved controller design to implement smarter autopilots on manned ships but also aids in the development of robust autonomy in surface vehicles.

AB Introduction: Prospective and retrospective performance assessment of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) is fundamental to pilot future enhancements for active safety devices. In critical road scenarios between two vehicles where ADAS activation enables collision mitigation only, currently available assessment methodologies rely on the reconstruction of the impact phase consequent to the specific intervention on braking and steering: the velocity change sustained by the vehicle in the collision (Delta V) is retrieved, so that IR decrease for the vehicle occupants can be obtained by appropriate Injury Risk (IR) models. However, information regarding the ADAS performance is available only after the impact phase reconstruction and not just as when the criticality occurs in the pre-impact phase: the best braking and steering alternative cannot be immediately envisaged, since a direct correlation lacks between the braking/steering intervention and IR.
   Method: This work highlights an ADAS performance assessment method based on the disaggregation of Delta V in the two pre-impact parameters closing velocity at collision (V-r) and impact eccentricity, represented by the Crash Momentum Index (CMI). Such a disaggregation leads to the determination of IR based solely on impact configuration between the vehicles, without directly considering the impact phase. The performance of diverse ADASs in terms of intervention logic are directly comparable based on the resulting impact configuration, associated with a single coordinate in the CMI-V-r plane and a sole IR value as a consequence.
   Results: The CMI-V-r approach is employable for both purposes of prospective and retrospective performance assessment of ADAS devices. To illustrate the advantages of the methodology, a solution for prospective assessment based on the CMI-V-r plane is initially proposed and applied to case studies: this provides direct suggestions regarding the most appropriate interventions on braking and steering for IR minimization, fundamental in the tuning or development phase of an ADAS. A method for retrospective assessment is ultimately contextualized in the EuroNCAP "Car-to-Car Rear moving" test for an Inter-Urban Autonomous Emergency Braking system, a device implemented on a significant portion of the circulating fleet.
   Conclusions: Based on the evidenced highlights, it is demonstrated that the approach provides complementary information compared to well-established performance assessment methodologies in all stages of an ADAS life cycle, by suggesting a direct physical connection in the pre-impact phase between the possible ADAS interventions and the foreseeable injury outcomes.

AB This paper addresses a UAV path planning problem for a team of cooperating heterogeneous vehicles composed of one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and multiple unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The UGVs are used as mobile actuators and scattered in a large area. To achieve multi-UGV communication and collaboration, the UAV, modeled as a Dubins vehicle, serves as a messenger to fly over the effective communication range of all UGVs to relay information. The curvature-constrained path planning of the messenger UAV is formulated as a Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Dynamic Neighborhood (DTSPDN) which is a complex optimization problem involving coupled variables and contains dynamic constraints. We design an effective memetic algorithm to find the shortest route that enables the messenger UAV to visit all moving UGVs. This algorithm combines the genetic algorithm procedure, two kinds of local search operators based on gradient search and uniform sampling respectively, and a gradient-based repair operator to repair the solutions violating dynamic constraints. During the evolutionary process, a special phenomenon may occur that changing some decision variables (i.e., visiting sequence and location) may not affect the evaluation function value, but may alter the feasible region of another decision variable (i.e., visiting time) due to the encounter constraint between the UAV and UGV. To track and utilize the change of the feasible region, a transformation procedure is proposed to change one solution to another with less visiting time by analyzing the encounter pattern between UAV and UGV. The computational results on random instances with different scales demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively generate better curvature-constrained tours to encounter all moving UGVs when compared to other four competitive algorithms in the literature. Note to Practitioners-This paper studies an emerging path planning problem for a UAV which is used to provide communication service for multiple moving UGVs. These UGVs are required to execute tasks (e.g., firefighting, search and rescue) within a large area. Due to their limited communication capabilities, they may be unable to obtain necessary information from other UGVs. The UAV serves as a messenger to fly over the effective communication range of all moving UGVs to relay information. We propose a novel memetic algorithm to efficiently search for the shortest tour that enables the messenger UAV to visit all moving UGVs. The memetic algorithm combines the parallel global search virtue of genetic algorithm with efficient local search procedure to improve the generated tour. A gradient-based repair procedure is also employed to make sure that the planned tour can guide the UAV to sequentially encounter each moving UGV. Simulations exhibit that the proposed approach can effectively generate high-quality tours for messenger UAV to rapidly visit all UGVs, which assists UGVs to achieve collaboration in large area. In future work, the proposed memetic algorithm will be extended to plan tours for multiple messenger UAVs.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation has been widely applied in various aspects, both for military and civil purposes. In this article, multiple UAV formations are deployed to perform different types of tasks, and the heterogeneous mission planning problem is studied. The problem is divided into two subproblems, i.e., task assignment and path planning. First, the task assignment is formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem. Different from the existing articles, appropriate UAVs need to be selected to build the formation and perform specific types of tasks. To obtain the task assignment scheme, a hybrid genetic and simulated annealing (HGSA) algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, a feasible solution is guaranteed by the designed task-based strategy, and the diversity of solutions is ensured by the group-based solution remaining approach. In the path planning problem, an obstacle avoidance-enabled consensus (OAEC) algorithm is developed to form the UAV formation, which extends the application of the standard consensus algorithm. A multistep particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm is combined with the consensus algorithm to generate a path for the UAV formation to reach each task point. The conflict among multiple UAV formations is resolved by adjusting their departure time. Furthermore, the task assignment scheme is modified by utilizing real path information on the flying distance between the UAVs and the task points. The simulation results demonstrate that the HGSA algorithm can build the UAV formations and assign the tasks to them while satisfying all the complicated constraints. The advantages of the OAEC algorithm and the MPSO algorithm in path planning are verified by comparison with relevant algorithms.

AB A novel XM-YOLOViT real-time detection algorithm for pedestrians and vehicles in foggy weather based on YOLOV5 framework is proposed, which effectively solves the problems of dense target interference and obscuration by haze, and the detection effect in complex foggy environments is improved. Firstly, Inverted Residual Block and MobileViTV3 Block are introduced to construct XM-net feature extraction network, secondly, EIOU is used as a location loss function and a high-resolution detection layer is added in the Neck region. In terms of data, a nebulization method is designed to map images from fogless space to foggy space based on the atmospheric scattering model and the dark channel prior. Finally, the validity on four datasets under different foggy environments is verified, respectively. The experimental results show that the accuracy, recall and mAP of the XM-YOLOViT model are 54.95%, 41.93% and 43.15% respectively, and with an F1-Score of 0.474, which is 3.42%,7.08%,7.52% and 13.94% improved, the model parameter reduction of 41.7% to 4.09M, the FLOPs is 25.2G and detection speed is 70.93 FPS compared to the baseline model. The XM-YOLOViT model has better performance than the advanced YOLO detectors, the F1-Score and mAP are improved by 5.57% and 3.65% compared with YOLOv7-tiny, and 2.38%, 2.37% respectively compared with YOLOv8s. Therefore, the XM-YOLOViT algorithm proposed in this article has high detection accuracy and an extremely lightweight structure, which can effectively improve the efficiency and quality of detection tasks for UAV in foggy weather, especially for extremely small targets.

AB The explosively increasing development of marine communication networks will improve the quality of service (QoS) of marine applications (e.g., ocean farm and marine tourism), which has attracted much attention from both academia and industrial in recent years. However, real-time data processing for diverse marine tasks (especially those computing-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks) is still challenging due to the limited marine communication and computing resources. Mobile edge computing (MEC) driven by powerful computing capability is envisioned as a promising solution to address the issue for resource-constrained marine services. In this paper, we propose a hybrid offshore and aerial-based multi-access edge computing scheme in marine communication networks to improve the QoS of marine applications. Specifically, we consider a scenario that both offshore base-station and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are equipped with edge-servers, and the computation workloads of unmanned surface vehicle (USV) can be simultaneously offloaded to offshore base-station and UAVs via multi-access manner. To minimize the latency of completing USV's workloads and reduce USV's energy consumption, we formulate a joint optimization problem to optimize the offloading decision, transmission time, and computing-rate allocation, with the objective of Minimizing the Maximum Workloads Latency (MMWL). Exploiting the features of the formulated problem, we present a layered structure approach and decompose it into three subproblems. We propose efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal solutions and validate the optimality of the proposed algorithms. Finally, we provide simulation results and analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme and algorithms in comparison with benchmark algorithms.

AB A challenge for rescue teams when fighting against wildfire in remote areas is the lack of information, such as the size and images of fire areas. As such, live streaming from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), capturing videos of dynamic fire areas, is crucial for firefighter commanders in any location to monitor the fire situation with quick response. The 5G network is a promising wireless technology to support such scenarios. In this paper, we consider a UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication scenario, where a UAV at a high altitude acts as a mobile base station (UAV-BS) to stream videos from other flying UAV-users (UAV-UEs) through the uplink. Due to the mobility of the UAV-BS and UAV-UEs, it is important to determine the optimal movements and transmission powers for UAV-BSs and UAV-UEs in real-time, so as to maximize the data rate of video transmission with smoothness and low latency, while mitigating the interference according to the dynamics in fire areas and wireless channel conditions. In this paper, we co-design the video resolution, the movement, and the power control of UAV-BS and UAV-UEs to maximize the Quality of Experience (QoE) of real-time video streaming. We applied the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Actor-Critic (AC) to maximize the QoE of video transmission from all UAV-UEs to a single UAV-BS to learn the dynamic fire areas and communication environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in terms of the QoE, delay and video smoothness compared to the Greedy algorithm.

AB Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), a device made of low-cost meta-surfaces that can reflect or refract the signals in the desired manner, have the immense ability to enhance the data transmission from the sender to the receiver. The concept of RIS is inspired by a smart radio environment or programmable radio environment. The introduction of this device in wireless communications aids in reducing the hardware requirements, energy consumption, and signal processing complexity. The integration of this device with various emerging technologies such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique, physical layer security, etc., has increased its potentiality in terms of performance enhancement. One such integration could be studied, i.e. RIS-assisted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs exhibit aiding capability in various services to our society such as real-time data collection, traffic monitoring, military operations & surveillance, medical assistance, and goods delivery. Despite the positive appeal, the UAV has its limitations such as fuel efficacy, environment disturbances, limited network capability, etc. Considering these scenarios, the RIS can provide assistance to UAVs to enhance their performance when integrated. There is a limited number of articles and researches that consider UAV-assisted RIS systems. This article provides a detailed survey on RIS-assisted UAV systems considering multiple contexts such as optimization, communication techniques, deep reinforcement learning, secrecy performance, efficiency enhancement, and the internet of things. Finally, we draw attention to the open challenges and possible future directions of UAV-assisted RIS systems in phase shifting, channel modeling, energy efficacy, and federated learning.

AB This paper proposes an implementation, based on a multi-agent system, of a management system for automated negotiation of electricity allocation for charging electric vehicles (EVs) and simulates its performance. The widespread existence of charging infrastructures capable of autonomous operation is recognised as a major driver towards the mass adoption of EVs by mobility consumers. Eventually, conflicting requirements from both power grid and EV owners require automated middleman aggregator agents to intermediate all operations, for example, bidding and negotiation, between these parts. Multi-agent systems are designed to provide distributed, modular, coordinated and collaborative management systems; therefore, they seem suitable to address the management of such complex charging infrastructures. Our solution consists in the implementation of virtual agents to be integrated into the management software of a charging infrastructure. We start by modelling the multi-agent architecture using a federated, hierarchical layers setup and as well as the agents' behaviours and interactions. Each of these layers comprises several components, for example, data bases, decision-making and auction mechanisms. The implementation of multi-agent platform and auctions rules, and of models for battery dynamics, is also addressed. Four scenarios were predefined to assess the management system performance under real usage conditions, considering different types of profiles for EVs owners', different infrastructure configurations and usage and different loads on the utility grid (where real data from the concession holder of the Portuguese electricity transmission grid is used). Simulations carried with the four scenarios validate the performance of the modelled system while complying with all the requirements. Although all of these have been performed for one charging station alone, a multi-agent design may in the future be used for the higher level problem of distributing energy among charging stations.

AB The work described in this paper is part of the development of a framework to support the joint execution of cooperative missions by a group of robotic vehicles, in a simulated, augmented or real environment. Such framework brings forward the need for formal languages in which to specify the group of vehicles that compose a team; the scenario in which they will operate; and the definition of the mission to be performed (surveillance, pollution detection, search and rescue operations, and so on). This paper presents the Mission Description Language (MDL), a XML dialect that describes the specifics of a mission to be performed by a team of autonomous vehicles. The MDL definition decomposes a mission into a number of possibly dependent phases and uses high-level concepts that facilitate the specification of a mission by both experts and non-experts. The dialect was defined using XML Schema, with all the required information being integrated in the definition. An interface was developed and incorporated into the framework, as to allow for the creation and edition of XML files following the defined schema. Once the information is correctly specified, it can be used in the framework, thus facilitating the process of mission specification and deployment. A survey answered by both practitioners and researchers shows that the degree of satisfaction with MDL is elevated (the overall evaluation of MDL achieved a 3.97 score (out of 5), with 82.05% of the answers being equal to or above 4); also, the usability of the interface was evaluated, having achieved a score of 82.9 in the SUS scale. These results imply that MDL is flexible enough to represent several types of missions, through a user-friendly interface. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) nowadays are developing rapidly for various applications such as UAV taxis and delivery drones. However, the limited battery energy restricts the flight distance of the UAVs. Thus, urban prosumers equipped with drone recharge stations are introduced to provide charging services for the UAVs. In this article, first, a day-ahead energy scheduling problem for UAV charging-enabled urban prosumers is studied, where the objective is to maximize the overall energy satisfaction of the prosumers with ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS) of the charged UAVs. Specifically, to deal with the considered problem, we decompose it into two stages: 1) the day-ahead energy requirement data prediction stage and 2) energy scheduling stage per prosumer. Thus, second, a joint method based on hierarchical federated learning (HFL) on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture (HFL-LSTM) and stochastic game-based multi-agent double deep $Q$ -learning (MADDQN) with community agent-independent approach is proposed. In particular, the HFL-LSTM approach is leveraged to forecast each prosumer's energy requirement data without centralized collecting local prosumers' data such that to protect data privacy. Then, the stochastic game is adopted to analyze the formulated problem, aiming to find the Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy. Afterward, MADDQN with a community agent-independent method is utilized to achieve the best energy scheduling strategy per prosumer. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed joint method that can achieve the lowest mean squared error with the value of 0.0152 and the highest energy satisfaction $(36388)$ achieved by the NE policy compared with the benchmarks.

AB In this work, we aim to maximize the timeliness of data collection subject to a covertness constraint in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where a UAV periodically conducts wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge an energy-constrained IoT device and then the IoT device opportunistically sends its collected data to the UAV. To this end, we first derive a lower bound on the covertness constraint and an analytical expression for Age of Information (AoI) to characterize timeliness. Then, we jointly optimize the UAV's transmit power for WPT, the WPT duration, and the data transmission duration by considering two practical scenarios. For the fixed total duration scenario, our analytical optimal solutions indicate that the total harvested energy at the IoT device is independent of the covertness constraint, although both the UAV's transmit power and the WPT duration are significantly affected by the covertness constraint. With the optimized total duration scenario, we prove that the UAV's optimal transmit power is always attained at its maximum value regardless of the existence of the covertness constraint, but the WPT and data transmission durations are sensitive to the required covertness. Overall, there exists a nontrivial tradeoff between the timeliness and covertness for data collection in the considered system, which is determined by the WPT design. Furthermore, our numerical results show that the optimal prior probability of the IoT device's opportunistic transmission is generally not 0.5 for the fixed total duration, but it is indeed 0.5 for the optimized total duration.

AB This article introduces a Rich Arc Routing Problem (RARP). Required arcs are partitioned into given clusters, and each cluster shall be serviced for prescribed times during the planning horizon. There is a time limit that restricts the visits that can be performed in a single day. Each vehicle has to stop at one of intermediate facilities before the end of the specific hours per day. Accordingly, several days may be necessary to complete all tasks, and paths traveled by different vehicles on the same day shall not overlap. The RARP consists of finding a set of routes with (i) the minimum total distance, (ii) the minimum number of vehicles, (iii) the minimum pure working days, and (iv) the temporal service time interval consistency of each cluster. Recently, a Local-Ideal-Points based Autonomous Space Decomposition (LIP-ASD) algorithm has been demonstrated to be a competitive multi-objective framework. However, randomly generating an initial population in each decomposed space decreases the convergence speed of LIP-ASD. In addition, retaining only one individual preserved in each sub-space limits population diversity. In response to these issues, an Improved LIP-ASD (I-LIP-ASD) for RARP is developed. The two improvements of the proposed algorithm are as follows: (i) the initial population in the current sub-space is generated by combining existing nondominated individuals, and (ii) all nondominated solutions will be output from the evolved population in each decomposed sub-space. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments over converted capacitated arc routing problem instances, as well as analyze them under a real-world case to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithm.

AB Articulated steering vehicles (ASV) are widely used in many industries for their high efficiency and excellent maneuverability. The autonomous driving and intelligent control of ASV are extremely critical owing to the operation characteristics. As a very important parameter, the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) determines the extreme tire force directly in the process of intelligent control. However, it cannot be obtained with the existing methods for the harsh environment and special structure of ASV. This paper proposed a two-layer model-based method of tire-road friction coefficient estimation for ASV. The dynamic models of ASV in the XY plane, including the longitudinal and lateral models of frames, tire forces, and steering system models, are established first. The dynamic models are embedded into the upper layer with a Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the tire forces in longitudinal and lateral directions. During the process, some self-contained sensors, including the state sensors of frames and steering system, are used to provide the observation data. In the lower layer, a recursive least square (RLS) method with a forgetting factor is used to obtain the TRFC and tire stiffness parameters with the aid of the tire model. The simulation and field test are carried out to validate the method under comprehensive conditions, in which different steering commands, velocities, and roads are included. The simulation and field test results show that the forgetting factor has a significant influence on the convergence and robustness of the proposed method. The forgetting factor tau = 0.95 is used in the field test, the estimation result of dry concrete road friction coefficient is around 0.83. The results indicated that the proposed method can obtain the TRFC and tire parameters dynamically for ASVs.

TI Implementation of robot routing approaches for convoy merging manoeuvres

DT Article
DE Dynamic route planner; Optimal meeting point; Merging convoy manoeuvre;
   Dynamic programming; Uncertain traveling time
AB Autonomous and cooperative guidance strategies for a convoy of electric vehicles in an urban context are challenging research topics in robotics and intelligent transportation systems. The vehicles that form the convoy eventually will have to leave it to perform a mission and return to the convoy formation once the mission has been accomplished. Nevertheless, the merging manoeuvres amongst the convoy and the units returning to it (pursuing units) is a complex task that involves the determination of the best merging point and the route across the city to reach it. This paper tackles this routing problem of a robot located in a map that is trying to join a convoy of robots in constant movement along a peripheral trajectory. We have developed two search strategies able to determine the optimal merging point and the best route to reach it: on one hand we describe a basic solution able to solve the problem when the time spent by the robot traveling along every street of the map is considered to be known and constant. On the other hand, we extended this basic approach to provide a new search strategy that considers uncertainty in traveling times. This increases considerably the complexity of the problem and makes necessary the inclusion of a risk factor that must be considered when determining the best route and the merging point for the manoeuvre. We also put our search strategies into practice in both, simulated and real scenarios. On one hand we have simulated the behavior of a convoy leader and a transport unit which is trying to join in the convoy, using Player&Stage. On the other hand we have used real P3-DX robot units as prototypes of electrical vehicles in a transport scenario. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The IoT networks implemented in high-speed scenarios like intra and intervehicular communications in autonomous driving vehicles, high-speed vehicles, and trains will experience a Doppler effect. Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, the popular transmission technology for existing new-radio IoT (NR-IoT), is limited in providing reliable connections in high-speed vehicular scenarios. The performance of such system degrades with higher-order antenna configuration due to the lack of channel state information in highly mobile environments. The recently proposed orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a strong contender that can handle high mobility but requires efficient transceiver design to be deployed in vehicular NR-IoT (V-IoT) systems. To conserve the resources and minimize the air time of the devices, we have proposed an embedded pilot design in the Delay-Doppler domain for the V-IoT systems. In the designed frame structure, the pilot's position is optimized as per the vehicle speed to maximize the spectral efficiency of the system. The increase in spectral efficiency is at the cost of interference in the channel search region of the received Delay-Doppler domain OTFS signal. So a new joint estimator and the low-complex detector are proposed to handle the interference. The proposed efficient transceiver design with the spectral efficient pilot patterns allows us to conserve resources and remove complex encoder-decoders like the low-density parity check in NR-IoT.

AB Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) is an emerging technology that enables a comfortable, safe, and efficient travel experience by providing mechanisms to execute applications related to traffic congestions, road accidents, autonomous driving, and entertainment. The mobile vehicles in VANET are characterized by low computational and storage capabilities. In such scenarios, to meet applications' performance requirements, requests from vehicles are offloaded to edge and cloud servers. The high energy consumption of these servers increases operating costs and threatens the environment. Energy-aware offloading strategies have been introduced to tackle this problem. Existing works on computation offloading focus on optimizing the energy consumption of either the IoT devices/mobile/vehicles and/or the edge servers. This paper proposes a novel offloading algorithm that optimizes the energy of edge-cloud integrated computing platforms based on Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (EGA) while maintaining applications' Service Level Agreement (SLA). The proposed algorithm employs an adaptive penalty function to incorporate the optimization constraints within EGA. Comparative analysis and numerical experiments are carried out between the proposed algorithm, random and genetic algorithm-based offloading, and no offloading baseline approaches. On average, the results show than the proposed algorithm saves 2.97 times and 1.37 times more energy that the random and no offloading algorithms respectively. Our algorithm has 0.3% of violations versus 52.8% and 62.8% by the random and no offloading approaches respectively. While the energy-non-SLA-aware genetic algorithm saves, on average, 1.22 times more energy than our approach, however, it violates SLAs by 159 times more than our proposed approach.

ID OBSTACLE DETECTION
AB The need for a vehicle to perceive information about the external environmental as an independent intelligent individual has grown with the progress of intelligent driving from primary driver assistance to high-level autonomous driving. The ability of a common independent sensing unit to sense the external environment is limited by the sensor's own characteristics and algorithm level. Hence, a common independent sensing unit fails to obtain comprehensive sensing information independently under conditions such as rain, fog, and night. Accordingly, an extended network-based fusion target detection algorithm for millimeter-wave radar and vision fusion is proposed in this work by combining the complementary perceptual performance of in-vehicle sensing elements, cost effectiveness, and maturity of independent detection technologies. Feature-level fusion is first used in this work according to the analysis of technical routes of the millimeter-wave radar and vision fusion. Training and test evaluation of the algorithm are carried out on the nuScenes dataset and test data from a homemade data acquisition platform. An extended investigation on the RetinaNet one-stage target detection algorithm based on the VGG-16+FPN backbone detection network is then conducted in this work to introduce millimeter-wave radar images as auxiliary information for visual image target detection. We use two-channel radar and three-channel visual images as inputs of the fusion network. We also propose an extended VGG-16 network applicable to millimeter-wave radar and visual fusion and an extended feature pyramid network. Test results showed that the mAP of the proposed network improves by 2.9% and the small target accuracy is enhanced by 18.73% compared with those of the reference network for pure visual image target detection. This finding verified the detection capability and algorithmic feasibility of the proposed extended fusion target detection network for visually insensitive targets.

ID DESIGN
AB In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the interest and demand for embedded systems have been explosively increasing. In particular, vehicular sensor networks are one of the fields where IoT-oriented embedded devices (also known as IoT devices) are being actively used. These IoT devices are widely deployed in and out of the vehicle to check vehicle conditions, prevent accidents, and support autonomous driving, forming a vehicular sensor network. In particular, such sensor networks mainly consist of third-party devices that operate independently of the vehicle and run on their own batteries. After all, like all battery-powered embedded devices, the IoT devices for the vehicular sensor network also suffer from limited power sources, and thus research on how to design/operate them energy-efficiently is drawing attention from both academia and industry. This paper notes that the vehicular sensor network may be the best application for ultra-low power system on-chips (ULP SoCs). The ULP SoCs are mainly designed based on ultra-low voltage operating (ULV) circuits, and this paper aims to realize the energy-optimized driving of the network by applying state of the art (SoA) low-power techniques exploiting the unique characteristics of ULV circuits to the IoT devices in the vehicular sensor network. To this end, this paper proposes an optimal task assignment algorithm that can achieve the best energy-efficient drive of the target network by fully utilizing the SoA low power techniques for ULV circuits. Along with a detailed description of the proposed algorithm, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method by providing an in-depth evaluation process and experimental results for the proposed algorithm.

AB Objective: It is commonly agreed that active safety will have a significant impact on reducing accident figures for pedestrians and probably also bicyclists. However, chances and limitations for active safety systems have only been derived based on accident data and the current state of the art, based on proprietary simulation models. The objective of this article is to investigate these chances and limitations by developing an open simulation model.
   Methods: This article introduces a simulation model, incorporating accident kinematics, driving dynamics, driver reaction times, pedestrian dynamics, performance parameters of different autonomous emergency braking (AEB) generations, as well as legal and logical limitations. The level of detail for available pedestrian accident data is limited. Relevant variables, especially timing of the pedestrian appearance and the pedestrian's moving speed, are estimated using assumptions. The model in this article uses the fact that a pedestrian and a vehicle in an accident must have been in the same spot at the same time and defines the impact position as a relevant accident parameter, which is usually available from accident data. The calculations done within the model identify the possible timing available for braking by an AEB system as well as the possible speed reduction for different accident scenarios as well as for different system configurations.
   Results: The simulation model identifies the lateral impact position of the pedestrian as a significant parameter for system performance, and the system layout is designed to brake when the accident becomes unavoidable by the vehicle driver. Scenarios with a pedestrian running from behind an obstruction are the most demanding scenarios and will very likely never be avoidable for all vehicle speeds due to physical limits. Scenarios with an unobstructed person walking will very likely be treatable for a wide speed range for next generation AEB systems.

AB Micro-Doppler (m-D) effect, induced by the rotation of rotor blades, supplies a differentiable characteristic to address the problem for the identification of low, slow, and small unmanned aerial vehicles (LSS UAVs). However, the primary challenge for the estimation of m-D parameters is how to separate weak rotation signal from Doppler signal and other interferences. Theoretically, null space pursuit (NSP) is an operator-based signal decomposition approach to decompose a signal into additive subcomponents. The premise of NSP is that two separated components are orthogonal. However, due to the different modulation models, rotation signal, Doppler signal, or other interferences could not satisfy the condition. Moreover, the traditional multiorder differential operator is not suitable for the decomposition of m-D signal. In this article, a backprojection strategy with instantaneous orthogonal NSP (BPIO-NSP) is proposed to distill Doppler signal, and then, micro-Doppler NSP (MD-NSP) is jointly developed to separate rotation signal for the identification of LSS UAVs. First, the decomposed component after NSP is applied to the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to find the segments with instantaneous nonorthogonal property. Second, the backprojection strategy is developed in BPIO-NSP to acquire the instantaneous orthogonal data, so as to adjust the decomposed Doppler signal with high accuracy. Finally, customized operator is specially constructed in MD-NSP to achieve the required rotation signal from the residue. Simulation results verify the theoretical analysis, and measured data of the fun and UAV detection experiments suggest that the proposed methods could be served for the application of the identification of LSS UAVs.

AB Motorized automobility and suburban living are not only highly valued but are also associated with a range of serious social problems, including deaths and injuries of motor-vehicle users and nonusers, roadway congestion, air pollution, dependence on insecure oil supplies, community fragmentation, and climate change. However, these problems, which make the present transportation and land-use system unsustainable, are not necessary consequences of automobility and suburban living per se, but rather are attributable mainly to the high kinetic energy of fast, heavy-motor vehicles (FHVs). Therefore, the challenge in creating a sustainable transportation and land-use system is to dramatically lower the kinetic energy of personal travel while retaining the advantages of personal motorized automobility and low-density development. Our approach is to redefine the technical artifact that is the conventional automobile and create two autonomous and universally accessible travel networks at a citywide scale: one for FHVs, the other for low-speed, low-mass modes including walking, cycling, and a new class of motor vehicles. In this paper, we motivate the need for this new urban-settlement and transportation-infrastructure scheme (USATIS), describe its design principles and features, review aspects of it in the literature and in the real world, present analyses covering a wide range of sustainability criteriasafety, mobility, congestion, environmental and energy-use impacts, urban aesthetics and community fragmentation, and economicsand discuss challenges for implementation and future research. We conclude that our USATIS does have the potential to support sustainable transportation without making people drive less or give up suburban living, but that before practical implementation plans can be considered, more research needs to be done on how people will adapt to the opportunities and constraints in the proposal.

AB This paper studies a rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless powered fog computing network, where a UAV serves as both a mobile wireless energy source and a mobile fog server to provide charging and computing services to a group of ground sensors. The UAV first broadcasts radio frequency (RF) signals to charge the sensors, and then the sensors use the harvested energy to complete their tasks by local computing and fog computing, where the partial offloading policy is employed. In order to achieve green communication system design, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the UAV's energy consumption by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the task offloading allocation and computing resource allocation, where the piecewise nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) model, the charging requirements of sensors and velocity constraints of UAV are taken into account together. To solve the non-convex problem, an iterative method is designed based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) theory. Simulation results show that our presented scheme converges within a few iterations, by using which the UAV's energy consumption can be greatly reduced compared to benchmark schemes. It is also observed that the harvested energy by the linear EH model have obvious bias compared to that obtained by the nonlinear EH model. And in the case of nonlinear EH model, as circuit saturation threshold increases, the UAV moves closer to the sensors such that their tasks can be completed, which may result in a higher energy consumption of the UAV. Besides, the velocity variation of UAV is relatively small by introducing the velocity constraint, which avoids drastic steering of the UAV in our considered scenario.

AB Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) has become a part and parcel of ongoing research in autonomous vehicles. LIDAR efficiently captures data during day and night alike; yet, data accuracy is affected in altered weather conditions. LIDAR data fusion with sensors, such as color camera, hyperspectral camera, and RADAR, proves to be a viable solution to improve the quality of data and add spectral information. LIDAR 3-D point cloud containing intensity data are transformed to 2-D intensity images for the said purpose. LIDAR produces large point cloud, but, while generating images for limited field of view, data sparsity results in poor quality images. Moreover, 3-D to 2-D data transformation also involves data reduction, which further deteriorates the quality of images. This paper focuses on generating intensity images from LIDAR data using interpolation techniques, including bi-linear, natural neighbor, bi-cubic, kriging, inverse distance, and weighted and nearest neighbor interpolation. The main focus is to test the suitability of interpolation methods for 2-D image generation, and analyze the quality of the generated 2-D image. Image similarity metrics, such as root mean square error, normalized least square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, correlation, difference entropy, mutual information, and structural similarity index measurement, are utilized for camera and LIDAR image matching, and their ability to compare images from heterogeneous sensors is also analyzed. Generated images can further be used for data fusion purpose. Images generated using LIDAR points have a relevant distance matrix as well, which can be used to find the distance of any given pixel from the image. In addiiton, the accuracy of interpolated distance data is evaluated as well by comparing it with the original distance values of traffic cones placed in front of vehicle. Results show that the inverse distance weighted interpolation outperforms other selected methods in 2-D image quality, and images from nearest neighbor appear brighter subjectively.

AB Driver workload (DWL) is an important factor that needs to be considered in the study of traffic safety. The research focus on DWL has undergone certain shifts with the rapid development of scientific and technological advancements in the field of transportation in recent years. This study aims to grasp the state of research on DWL by both bibliometric analysis and individual critical literature review. The knowledge structure and development trend are described using bibliometric analysis. The knowledge mapping method is applied to mine the available literature in depth. It is discovered that one of the current research focus on DWL has shifted towards investigating its application in the field of autonomous driving. Subjective questionnaires and experimental tests (including both simulation technology and field study) are the main approaches to analyze DWL. An individual critical literature review of the influencing factors, measurement, and performance of DWL is provided. Research findings have shown that DWL was highly impacted by both intrinsic (e.g., age, temperament, driving experience) and external factors (e.g., vehicles, roads, tasks, environments). Scholars are actively exploring the combined effects of various factors and the level of vehicle automation on DWL. In addition to assess DWL by using subjective measures or physiological parameter measures separately, studies have started to improve classifi-cation accuracy by combining multiple measurement methods. Safety thresholds of DWL are not sufficiently studied due to the various interference items corresponding to different scenarios, but it is expected to quantify the DWL and find the threshold by establishing assessment models considering these intrinsic and external multiple-factors simultaneously. Driver or vehicle performance indicators are controversial to measure DWL directly, but they were suitable to reflect the impact of DWL in different driving conditions.

ID TESLA
AB In 2018, in the Dialogue, Debate, and Discussion section of MOR 14.3, an interesting series of articles was published in the 'Forum on Tesla and the Global Automotive Industry', where researchers discussed the future dynamics of the global automotive sector. In their work, Perkins and Murmann (2018) contended that, based on Tesla's success, a well-funded company could develop a new electric vehicle (EV) from scratch and move it into production within three to five years if it would invest one to two billion USD in design, development, and manufacturing. Expressing a contrasting view, MacDuffie (2018) questioned this possibility, arguing that EV product architecture is unlikely to become substantially more modular and any new entrant would therefore have to develop the ordinary capabilities that current automotive original equipment manufacturers possess, and there is no guarantee that a firm can develop such capabilities. Teece (2018) joined the debate by proposing a capability-based framework within which to analyze four paradigm shifts that have marked progress in the global automotive industry: EVs, autonomous vehicles, connected cars, and personal mobility services. He argues that these paradigm shifts have created opportunities for new entrants while posing challenges to incumbent firms. To navigate through the uncertainty associated with these paradigm shifts, incumbent firms need to enhance and refine their dynamic capabilities and leverage their integration skills. Jiang and Lu (2018) based their contribution to this debate on the development of the Chinese EV market. In MOR 15.1, published in 2019, Teece (2019) further elaborated his framework to facilitate analysis of the prospects for Chinese firms seeking a stronger foothold in the global automobile market. All these articles have been well received by MOR readers and were ranked among the top 20 articles in full-text view times between June 2021 and June 2022.

AB Energy hubs as a multi-carrier energy system with various energy carriers and conversions have been integrated with smart grids to increase the efficiency, flexibility, and reliability of the network. Today, scheduling multi energy hubs (MEH) is one of the challenging issues in smart grids. In this paper, the optimal schedule of interconnected MEHs based on the robust optimization in the presence of electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed. A robust optimization approach is considered to deal with uncertainties of electrical price, renewable energy resources (RESs) generations, and electrical loads. In this paper, MEHs network include commercial, industrial, and residential energy hubs. The energy consumption of MEHs consist of electrical, water, gas, and heat. RESs, demand response (DR) programs, heat and electrical energy storage devices are used to supply the energy demand. The aim of the proposed model is reducing the total cost of operation and carbon emission. The price-based demand response program is applied to shift the power consumption from on-peak to off-peak times in response to the price signal. Finally, the problem is solved for the three cases with CPLEX under YALMIP MATLAB. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model to achieve optimal scheduling of MEHs. The proposed problem is organized in three scenarios, among which the scenario I determines optimal scheduling of MEHs, using robust optimization method. The scenario II investigates the problem with deterministic model. The scenario III evaluates the problem applying robust optimization method without DR program and energy storage device consideration in autonomous EHs. The numerical results show that the total operation cost is increased 15.46% in scenario I compared with the scenario II due to applying the worst-case of uncertainties in robust optimization approach.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recently considered as a flying platform to provide wide coverage and relaying services for mobile users (MUs). Mobile edge computing (MEC) is developed as a new paradigm to improve quality of experience of MUs in future networks. Motivated by the high flexibility and controllability of UAVs, in this study, the authors study a multi-UAV-enabled MEC system, in which UAVs have computation resources to offer computation offloading opportunities for MUs, aiming to reduce MUs' total consumptions in terms of time and energy. Considering the rich computation resource in the remote cloud centre, they propose the MUs-Edge-Cloud three-layer network architecture, where UAVs play the role of flying edge servers. Based on this framework, they formulate the computation offloading issue as a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, which is difficult to obtain an optimal solution in general. To address this, they propose an efficientQ-learning based computation offloading algorithm (QCOA) to reduce the complexity of optimisation problem. Numerical results show that the proposed QCOA outperforms benchmark offloading policies (e.g. random offloading, traversal offloading). Furthermore, the proposed three-layer network architecture achieves a 5% benefits compared with the traditional two-layer network architecture in terms of MUs' energy and time consumptions.

   architecture; Servers; Privacy; Vehicle dynamics
AB Online social networks (OSNs) are comprised of people with social interactions and relationships, such as friendship and acquaintance. Social web communities (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), and content-sharing sites with social networking functionality (e.g., YouTube), have attracted millions of users, and OSNs are continuing to grow, with a giant number of users. At the same time, new social services are emerging, moving social networking from traditional OSNs toward vehicular social networks (VSNs). VSNs consider a social network where every vehicle is capable of establishing social ties in an autonomous way with other vehicles or drivers/passengers. However, limitations exist in VSNs, such as reduced connectivity due to mobility models and the opportunistic nature of vehicular networks. Similar considerations apply in OSNs, where the centralized architecture may suffer from high traffic load. In this article, the integration of OSNs with VSNs is realized through a hybrid framework that merges the centralized structure of OSNs with the distributed opportunistic nature of VSNs. The proposed hybrid OSN-VSN framework, named SOLVER, allows communications both among different VSNs and toward OSN communities, in order to maintain connectivity and service that can be affected by mobility. Connectivity holes of VSNs can be limited through a handover procedure toward an OSN community, and traffic load in an OSN can be redirected to specific VSNs in order to release network resources in OSNs, with the consequent reduction of transmission delay. SOLVER presents a solution for maintaining connectivity in VSNs and extending it toward OSNs, and vice versa. Security and privacy issues are also addressed through the use of a multi-layer security approach adopted in SOLVER. As a main strength, SOLVER is able to synergistically exploit the positive features of OSNs and VSNs, as well as providing security and privacy, with mechanisms that are completely agnostic to the final users.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object tracking has been widely used in military and civilian tasks and is very challenging due to factors such as aerial view, low resolution (LR), background clutter (BC), and small scale. Currently, many correlation filter (CF) methods for UAV object tracking introduce predefined regularization terms to improve the discriminative power. However, the predefined spatial constraints neither exploit the changing foreground and background information during tracking nor adapt to complex video attributes, such as BC, illumination variation (IV), and viewpoint change (VC). In this work, a novel CF tracking model is proposed to learn the spatial regularization CFs with the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC_SRCF) in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for UAV tracking. First, HSIC _SRCF learns the high confidence spatial weight coefficient for the filters, which encourages the filters to focus on the more reliable region. Second, the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) can be used to optimize the proposed model, and the subproblems of the model have closed-form solutions. Third, the model update scheme uses RKHS and the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR) to obtain the confidence of the object bounding box and reduce the effect of background noise for the UAV object. The ablation study shows that the proposed approach achieves a precision of 0.699 and a success rate of 0.607, which are 2.8% higher and 2.2% higher, respectively, than the baseline AutoTrack on the UAV123@10fps. Experimental results on four popular UAV datasets, including VisDrone2018-test-dev, UAV123@10fps, UAV123, and UAVDT, show that our approach performs favorably compared with current state-of-the-art methods.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used to collect data from ground nodes (GNs) in various applications because of their flexibility and mobility. Some emergency situations pose strict requirements for UAV's mission completion time. The current research focuses on the design and optimization of UAV's flight trajectory to shorten the mission completion time. But the data collection process also greatly affects the mission completion time, especially when the uplink throughput is large. This article emphasizes the data collection process and proposes a V-shaped collection trajectory for the first time to shorten UAV's collection time and then jointly optimizes the flight and collection trajectory to minimize the mission completion time. We formulate the mission completion time under energy constraints to an optimization problem and decompose it into three subproblems: 1) mission allocation of UAVs; 2) collection time minimization; and 3) joint optimization of collection and flight trajectory. 1) We establish the mission allocation model by setting the scaling factors for the flight and collection mission, and then solve it by utilizing the min-max multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP) algorithm; 2) for the data collection process, we propose a V-shaped trajectory to minimize the data collection time and prove its validity; and 3) since the flight and collection trajectory of the adjacent GNs are deeply coupled, we model the joint optimization of the flight and the collection time as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, and solve it by the joint optimization algorithm for flight trajectory and collection trajectory (JOFC). The simulation results show that our proposal outperforms the compared schemes.

AB Advances in Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) technology have paved a way for numerous configurations and applications in communication systems. However, UAV dynamics play an important role in determining its effective use. In this article, while considering UAV dynamics, we evaluate the performance of a UAV equipped with a Mobile-Edge Computing (MEC) server that provides services to End-user Devices (EuDs). The EuDs due to their limited energy resources offload a portion of their computational task to nearby MEC-based UAV. To this end, we jointly optimize the computational cost and 3D UAV placement along with resource allocation subject to the network, communication, and environment constraints. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technique based on a continuous action space approach, namely Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is utilized. By exploiting DDPG, we propose an optimization strategy to obtain an optimal offloading policy in the presence of UAV dynamics, which is not considered in earlier studies. The proposed strategy can be classified into three cases namely; training through an ideal scenario, training through error dynamics, and training through extreme values. We compared the performance of these individual cases based on cost percentage and concluded that case II (training through error dynamics) achieves minimum cost i.e., 37.75 %, whereas case I and case III settles at 67.25% and 67.50% respectively. Numerical simulations are performed, and extensive results are obtained which shows that the advanced DDPG based algorithm along with error dynamic protocol is able to converge to near optimum. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, a comparison with state-of-the-art Deep Q-Network (DQN) is carried out, which shows that our algorithm has significant improvements.

AB Future automated vehicles may be equipped with external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs). Currently, little is known about the effect of the perspective of the eHMI message on crossing decisions of pedestrians. We performed an experiment to examine the effects of images depicting eHMI messages of different perspectives (egocentric from the pedes-trian?s point of view: WALK, DON?T WALK, allocentric: BRAKING, DRIVING, and ambiguous: GO, STOP) on participants? (N = 103) crossing decisions, response times, and eye move-ments. Considering that crossing the road can be cognitively demanding, we added a mem-ory task in two-thirds of the trials. The results showed that egocentric messages yielded higher subjective clarity ratings than the other messages as well as higher objective clarity scores (i.e., more uniform crossing decisions) and faster response times than the allocentric BRAKING and the ambiguous STOP. When participants were subjected to the memory task, pupil diameter increased, and crossing decisions were reached faster as compared to trials without memory task. Regarding the ambiguous messages, most participants crossed for the GO message and did not cross for the STOP message, which points towards an egocen-tric perspective taken by the participant. More lengthy text messages (e.g., DON?T WALK) yielded a higher number of saccades but did not cause slower response times. We conclude that pedestrians find egocentric eHMI messages clearer than allocentric ones, and take an egocentric perspective if the message is ambiguous. Our results may have important impli-cations, as the consensus among eHMI researchers appears to be that egocentric text-based eHMIs should not be used in traffic. ? 2021 The Authors.

AB Path planning is important to the efficiency and navigation safety of USV autonomous operation offshore. To improve path planning, this study proposes the improved ant colony optimization-artificial potential field (ACO-APF) algorithm, which is based on a grid map for both local and global path planning of USVs in dynamic environments. The improved ant colony optimization (ACO) mechanism is utilized to search for a globally optimal path from the starting point to the endpoint for a USV in a grid environment, and the improved artificial potential field (APF) algorithm is subsequently employed to avoid unknown obstacles during USV navigation. The primary contributions of this article are as follows: (1) this article proposes a new heuristic function, pheromone update rule, and dynamic pheromone volatilization factor to improve convergence and mitigate finding local optima with the traditional ant colony algorithm; (2) we propose an equipotential line outer tangent circle and redefine potential functions to eliminate goals unreachable by nearby obstacles (GNRONs) and local minimum problems, respectively; (3) to adapt the USV to a complex environment, this article proposes a dynamic early-warning step-size adjustment strategy in which the moving distance and safe obstacle avoidance range in each step are adjusted based on the complexity of the surrounding environment; (4) the improved ant colony optimization algorithm and artificial potential field algorithm are effectively combined to form the algorithm proposed in this article, which is verified as an effective solution for USV local and global path planning using a series of simulations. Finally, in contrast to most papers, we successfully perform field experiments to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB A framework that could achieve submeter-level-accurate horizontal navigation with carrier phase differential measurements from cellular signals is developed. This framework, termed CD-cellular, is composed of a base and a rover in a cellular environment, both making carrier phase measurements to the same cellular base transceiver stations (BTSs). The base shares its carrier phase measurements with the mobile rover, which in turn employs an extended Kalman filter to obtain a coarse estimate of its states, followed by a batch weighted nonlinear least squares (B-WNLS) estimator to solve for the integer ambiguities, and finally a point-solution WNLS to estimate its own states. The framework is designed to guarantee that after some time, the rover's position error remains below a pre-defined threshold with a desired probability. This is achieved by leveraging models of the BTS positions from stochastic geometry. Experimental results on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an open semi-urban environment with multipath-free, line-of-sight (LOS) conditions are presented, showing that the developed framework achieves a 70.48 cm position root mean-squared error (RMSE) over a trajectory of 2.24 km, measured with respect to the UAV's navigation solution from its onboard GPS-inertial navigation system (INS).

AB This work proposes a framework to design a cost-efficient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based energy-neutral (EN) system deployed to harvest data from a set of internet-of-things (IoT) nodes. The energy-neutrality refers to the zero-sum balance between energy harvested, stored, and consumed during operation, which is a game-changer when a connection to the electricity grid is not available/feasible. This involves employing an off-grid charging station (CS) comprising of photovoltaic (PV) panels and batteries that provide enough energy to recharge the UAV-based aerial access points (AAPs). The investment cost is determined by the number of AAPs, PV panels, and ground battery units. Its minimization cannot be achieved using conventional optimization tools due to the non-tractable form of the CS load. Therefore, a novel wave-based method is proposed to represent the load profile as a proportional function of the required number of AAPs, so as to directly relate the CS design to the trajectory optimization. Compared to baseline scenarios, the proposed trajectory design can halve the time and energy consumption; the investment cost varies with the time and season of service; the off-grid CS is particularly advantageous in rural areas, while in urban areas its cost is comparable to that of a grid-connected alternative.

TI Multi-USV System Cooperative Underwater Target Search Based on

ID UNMANNED SURFACE VEHICLE
AB Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is a robotic system with autonomous planning, driving, and navigation capabilities. With the continuous development of applications, the missions faced by USV are becoming more and more complex, so it is difficult for a single USV to meet the mission requirements. Compared with a single USV, a multi-USV system has some outstanding advantages such as fewer perceptual constraints, larger operation ranges, and stronger operation capability. In the search mission about multiple stationary underwater targets by a multi-USV system in the environment with obstacles, we propose a novel cooperative search algorithm (CSBDRL) based on reinforcement learning (RL) method and probability map method. CSBDRL is composed of the environmental sense module and policy module, which are organized by the "divide and conquer" policy-based architecture. The environmental sense module focuses on providing environmental sense values by using the probability map method. The policy module focuses on learning the optimal policy by using RL method. In CSBDRL, the mission environment is modeled and the corresponding reward function is designed to effectively explore the environment and learning policies. We test CSBDRL in the simulation environment and compare it with other methods. The results prove that compared with other methods, CSBDRL makes the multi-USV system have a higher search efficiency, which can ensure targets are found more quickly and accurately while ensuring the USV avoids obstacles in time during the mission.

AB A practical approach for generating motion paths with continuous steering for car-like mobile robots is presented here. This paper addresses two key issues in robot motion planning; path continuity and maximum curvature constraint for nonholonomic robots. The advantage of this new method is that it allows robots to account for their constraints in an efficient manner that facilitates real-time planning. B-spline curves are leveraged for their robustness and practical synthesis to model the vehicle's path. Comparative navigational-based analyses are presented to selected appropriate curve and nominate its parameters. Path continuity is achieved by utilizing a single path, to represent the trajectory, with no limitations on path, or orientation. The path parameters are formulated with respect to the robot's constraints. Maximum curvature is satisfied locally, in every segment using a smoothing algorithm, if needed. It is demonstrated that any local modifications of single sections have minimal effect on the entire path. Rigorous simulations are presented, to highlight the benefits of the proposed method, in comparison to existing approaches with regards to continuity, curvature control, path length and resulting acceleration. Experimental results validate that our approach mimics human steering with high accuracy. Accordingly, efficiently formulated continuous paths ultimately contribute towards passenger comfort improvement. Using presented approach, autonomous vehicles generate and follow paths that humans are accustomed to, with minimum disturbances.

AB The meteorological mini unmanned aerial vehicle (M(2)AV) was used for measuring the meteorological wind. The wind is the vector difference between the aircraft speed relative to the earth (inertial velocity) and relative to the airflow (true airspeed). The latter was computed from five-hole-probe pressure measurements in combination with calibration-coefficient polynomials obtained during wind tunnel calibration. The aircraft inertial velocity, position, and attitude were calculated using a Kalman filter that combined data from a global positioning system (GPS) and an inertial navigation system (INS). The temporal (and spatial) resolution of the M(2)AV wind measurement is remarkably fine. An inertial subrange of locally isotropic turbulence can be measured up to 40 Hz (or 0.55 m at 22 m s(-1) airspeed).
   The first M(2)AV wind estimation showed some systematic deviations compared to the expected values (like a constant mean wind in every flight direction). Therefore, an in-flight wind calibration technique was developed that corrects for the inaccuracy of the true heading, the constant offset of the pitch angle, and the underestimation of the true airspeed. The final adjusted wind measurements were verified during a field experiment at the measurement field of the German Meteorological Service, southeast of Berlin. The mean horizontal and vertical wind measured by the M(2)AV agreed well with simultaneous sodar and tower measurements.

AB Three experiments and a computational analysis were conducted to investigate the effects of a delegation-type interface on human supervision of simulated multiple unmanned vehicles. Participants supervised up to eight robots using automated behaviors ("plays"), manual (waypoint) control, or both to capture the flag of an opponent with an equal number of robots, using a simple form of a delegation-type interface, Playbook. Experiment I showed that the delegation interface increased mission success rate and reduced mission completion time when the opponent "posture" was unpredictably offensive or defensive. Experiment 2 showed that performance was superior when operators could flexibly use both automated behaviors and manual control, although there was a small increase in subjective workload. Experiment 3 investigated additional dimensions of flexibility by comparing delegation interfaces to restricted interfaces. Eight interfaces were tested, varying in the level of abstraction at which robot behavior could be tasked and the level of aggregation (single or multiple robots) to which plays could be assigned. Performance was superior with flexible interfaces for four robots, but this benefit was eliminated when eight robots had to be supervised. Finally, a computational analysis using task-network modeling and Monte Carlo simulation gave results that closely paralleled the empirical data on changes in workload across interface type. The results provide initial empirical evidence for the efficacy of delegation-type interfaces in human supervision of a team of multiple autonomous robots.

AB Traffic speed is one of the critical indicators reflecting traffic status of roadway networks. The abnormality and sudden changes of traffic speed indicate the occurrence of traffic congestions, accidents, and events. Traffic control and management systems usually take the spatiotemporal variations of traffic speed as the critical evidence to dynamically adjust the traffic signal timing plan, broadcast traffic accidents, and form a management strategy. Meanwhile, transport is multimodal in most cities, including vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Traffic states of different traffic modes are usually used simultaneously as the significant input of advanced traffic control systems, e.g., multiobjective traffic signal control system, connected vehicles, and autonomous driving. In previous studies, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth passive sensing technology was demonstrated as an effective method for obtaining traffic speed data. However, there are some challenges that greatly affect the accuracy the estimated traffic speed, e.g., traffic mode uncertainty and the errors caused by sensors' detection range. Thus, this study develops a real-time method for estimating the multimodal traffic speed of road networks covered by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth passive sensors. To address the two identified challenges, an algorithm is developed to correct the biased estimated traffic speed based on the received signal strength indicator of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals, and a novel semisupervised Possibilistic Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm is proposed for identifying traffic modes of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth device owners. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated by comparing with the selected baseline algorithms. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The proposed method of this study can provide accurate and real-time multimodal traffic speed information for supporting traffic control and management, and, thus, improving the operational performance of the whole road network.

AB Pilot projects have emerged in cities globally as a way to experiment with the utilization of a suite of smart mobility and emerging transportation technologies. Automated vehicles (AVs) have become central tools for such projects as city governments and industry explore the use and impact of this emerging technology. This paper presents a large-scale assessment of AV pilot projects in U.S. cities to understand how pilot projects are being used to examine the risks and benefits of AVs, how cities integrate these potentially transformative technologies into conventional policy and planning, and how and what they are learning about this technology and its future opportunities and risks. Through interviews with planning practitioners and document analysis, we demonstrate that the approaches cities take for AVs differ significantly, and often lack coherent policy goals. Key findings from this research include: (1) a disconnect between the goals of the pilot projects and a city's transportation goals; (2) cities generally lack a long-term vision for how AVs fit into future mobility systems and how they might help address transportation goals; (3) an overemphasis of non-transportation benefits of AV pilots projects; (4) AV pilot projects exhibit a lack of policy learning and iteration; and (5) cities are not leveraging pilot projects for public benefits. Overall, urban and transportation planners and decision makers show a clear interest to discover how AVs can be used to address transportation challenges in their communities, but our research shows that while AV pilot projects purport to do this, while having numerous outcomes, they have limited value for informing transportation policy and planning questions around AVs. We also find that AV pilot projects, as presently structured, may constrain planners' ability to re-think transportation systems within the context of rapid technological change.

ID MODEL
AB Following the development of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry, the number of UAVs has increased significantly, and higher expectations regarding the effect of spatial path planning have been expressed. Traditional coordinate-based conflict detection and path planning methods of UAVs are highly complex and have low computational efficiency. While the conflict detection method based on the grid system can improve efficiency, the rigid grid structure of the existing local grid system or discrete global grid system is insufficient. Since the rigid structure only encodes grid cells, multiple or different size grids are required to identify UAVs in motion, further complicating path planning. The main contributions of this article are as follows. First, we proposed a nonrigid hierarchical discrete grid structure and coding method for spatial three-dimensional grids and grid data model. This method can accomplish the aggregation of any adjacent eight grids to form multiple nonrigid structures, making the original fixed relationship between parent and child grids more flexible. Second, the nonrigid grid structure optimizes the identification ability of grid vertices, grid edges, and grid faces. It has eight times the identification ability of the rigid grid structure. We exploited this structure for UAV identification with the same size grid at any position of the grid structure. Third, based on the nonrigid grid structure, an improved UAV conflict detection method and path planning method are designed. Experimental results indicate that, on an average, the efficiency of the improved conflict detection is an order of magnitude higher than that of the traditional computational detection method. The improved path planning method reduces the path length by an average of 11% compared to the single-grid planning method, and is 3.85 times more efficient than the multi-grid buffer planning method.

AB Self-driving systems require the creation of perception, which means that they must learn to interact with their environment, gather information and perform tasks while driving. Localization and mapping are essential concepts that any autonomous vehicle must perceive, as they provide information about the location and distance between objects. The absence of GPS, for example, in tunnels and urban canyons, makes it necessary to develop robust methods based on other vehicle equipment, such as Lidar, cameras, IMU, or to combine them all. Based on Lidar measurements, our work presents an architecture consisting of two main phases of mapping and localization; The mapping phase creates a global map of the environment based on non-semantic features using a fuzzy c-means algorithm instead of a semantic algorithm as it was done in some state-of-the-art work. In addition, the remaining clusters were filtered using the DBSCAN algorithm. The localization phase adopted here followed the particle filter architecture; motion update, measurement update, and resampling to estimate the positions. The main contribution of this work is the novel extension of selecting particles to reduce computational time and maintain long-term localization reliability. We have exhibited a method to select relevant particles after motion updates, based on two approaches: clustering with the k-means algorithm and the sigma points algorithm, which were thoroughly examined on short sequences of the Kitti dataset to discover the best one. The selected approach thoroughly tested on the Pandaset dataset. In addition, we tested our method on a long sequence dataset and compared it with the most recent methods. The analysis performed demonstrated the speed of our method and its ability to capture the features needed for real-time localization. Furthermore, it outperformed the well-known localization methods.

AB In the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks, ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is considered as an essential service that will empower real-time wireless systems, smart grids, and industrial applications. In this context, URLLC traffic relies on short blocklength packets to reduce the latency, which poses a daunting challenge for network operators and system designers since classical communication systems are designed based on the classical Shannon's capacity formula. Therefore, to tackle this challenge, this article considers an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acting as a decode-and-forward relay to communicate short URLLC control packets between a controller and multiple-mobile robots in a cell to enable a use-case of Agriculture 4.0. Moreover, this article employs perturbation theory and studies the quasi-optimization of the UAV's location, height, beamwidth, and resource allocation, including time-varying power and blocklength for the two phases of transmission from the controller to UAV and from UAV to robots. In this regard, we propose an iterative optimization method to find the optimal UAV's height and location, the antenna beamwidth, and the variable power and blocklength allocated to each robot inside the circular cell to minimize the average overall decoding error. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms based on fixed parameters and performs nearly as well as the smart exhaustive search. Lastly, our results emphasize the need to jointly optimize all of the abovementioned UAV's system parameters and resource allocation for the two phases of transmission to achieve URLLC for multiple-mobile robots.

AB Owing to the factors such as controllable mobility, ready-to-use technology, low cost, easy implementation, and so on, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) possesses tremendous potential to be one of the primary candidates for next-generation (6G) wireless networks. This paper presents a UAV-assisted multiuser communication network where a multiple antenna UAV base station (BS) serves multiple single antenna ground users (GUs). UAV-BS uses a laser source-based charging mechanism to fulfill its power requirement and applies simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in the downlink in order to provide desired power to energy-constrained GUs. Also, a clustering-based hybrid multiple access technique is used that combines both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) signaling to transmit the information to all GUs, simultaneously. Due to the involved analytical complexity corresponding to the multiple antennas and users, we use a hybrid beamforming method for efficient communication. Next, we analyze the performance of the proposed framework in terms of user outage probabilities, their respective throughput, and average power harvested considering non-linear energy harvesting and derive expressions of these performance metrics. Moreover, we formulate an optimization problem where the throughput of one GU is maximized by optimally choosing the power allocation parameter while ensuring the desired target throughput at other GU in each cluster. We also illustrate how crucial is the optimal selection of the target rates to maximize the network performance. Simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy of derived expressions and to highlight the dominance of hybrid beamforming and hybrid NOMA compared to conventional methods on the performance of the considered network.

TI Camera-LIDAR Integration: Probabilistic Sensor Fusion for Semantic

DT Article

AB An automated vehicle operating in an urban environment must be able to perceive and recognise objects and obstacles in a three-dimensional world for navigation and path planning. In order to plan and execute accurate and sophisticated driving maneuvers, a high-level contextual understanding of the surroundings is essential. Due to the recent progress in image processing, it is now possible to obtain high definition semantic information in 2D from monocular cameras, though cameras cannot reliably provide the high accuracy 3D information provided by lasers. The fusion of these two sensor modalities can overcome the shortcomings of each individual sensor, though there are a number of important challenges that need to be addressed in a probabilistic manner. In this paper we address the common, yet challenging, LIDAR/camera/semantic fusion problems which are seldom approached in a wholly probabilistic manner. Our approach is capable of using a multi-sensor platform to build a three-dimensional semantic voxelized map that considers the uncertainty of all of the processes involved. We present a probabilistic pipeline that incorporates uncertainty from the sensor readings (cameras, LIDAR, IMU and wheel encoders), compensation for the motion of the vehicle, and heuristic label probabilities for the semantic images depicted in Fig. 1. We also present a novel and efficient viewpoint validation algorithm to check for occlusions within the camera frame. A probabilistic projection is performed from the camera images to the LIDAR point cloud. Each labelled LIDAR scan then feeds into an octree map-building algorithm that updates the class probabilities of the map voxels every time a new observation is available. We validate our approach using a set of qualitative and quantitative experiments using the USyd Campus Dataset.(1) These tests demonstrate the usefulness of a probabilistic sensor fusion approach by evaluating the performance of the perception system in a typical autonomous vehicle application.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to play a key role in intelligent transportation systems to complement the communication infrastructure in future smart cities. UAV-assisted vehicular networking research typically adopts throughput and latency as the main performance metrics. These conventional metrics, however, are not adequate to reflect the freshness of the information, an attribute that has been recently identified as a critical requirement to enable services such as autonomous driving and accident prevention. In this paper, we consider a UAV-assisted single-hop vehicular network, wherein sensors (e.g., LiDARs and cameras) on vehicles generate time sensitive data streams, and UAVs are used to collect and process this data while maintaining a minimum age of information (AoI). We aim to jointly optimize the trajectories of UAVs and find scheduling policies to keep the information fresh under minimum throughput constraints. The formulated optimization problem is shown to be mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and generally hard to be solved. Motivated by the success of machine learning (ML) techniques particularly deep learning in solving complex problems with low complexity, we reformulate the trajectories and scheduling policies problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) where the system state space considers the vehicular network dynamics. Then, we develop deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the vehicular environment and its dynamics in order to handle UAVs' trajectory and scheduling policy. In particular, we leverage Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for learning the trajectories of the deployed UAVs to efficiently minimize the Expected Weighted Sum AoI (EWSA). Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show the deployed UAVs adapt their velocities during the data collection mission in order to minimize the AoI.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) contributes substantial strategic benefits on the Internet of Military Things (IoMT). However, the untrusted party's misuse of the UAV may violate the security and even demolish the critical operation in the IoMT system. In addition, data manipulation and falsification using unauthorized access are the significant challenges of the IoMT system. In response to this problem, this study proposes a blockchain-integrated convolution neural network (CNN)-based intelligent framework named IoMT-Net for identification and tracking illegal UAV in the IoMT system. Blockchain technology prevents illicit access, data manipulation, and illegal intrusions, as well as stored data on the central control server (CCS). Concurrently, the proposed CNN analyzed the radio-frequency (RF) signal sent by the antenna array element to determine the Direction of Arrival (DoA) for the localization of the illegal UAV. Therefore, a signal model is designed to process the received signal array through IoMT-Net. Moreover, the proposed CNN model is designed with two different functional modules, such as the resource accuracy tradeoff (RAT) module and the unique feature extraction and accuracy boosting (UAB) module, by adopting depthwise and grouped convolution layers. These sparsely connected convolution layers offer high DoA estimation accuracy while maintaining the network more lightweight. In addition, the skip connection is also leveraged into the subunits of RAT and UAB modules for sharing features and handling the vanishing gradients problem. Based on the simulation results, the proposed network achieves superior DoA estimation accuracy (approximately 97.63% accuracy at 10-dB SNR) and outperforms other state-of-the-art models.

AB Accurate car positioning on the Earth's surface is a requirement for many state-of-the-art automotive applications, but current low-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers can suffer from poor precision and transient unavailability in urban areas. In this article, a real-time data fusion system of absolute and relative positioning data is proposed with the aim of increasing car positioning precision. To achieve this goal, a system based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was employed to fuse absolute positioning data coming from a low-cost GNSS receiver with data coming from four wheel speed sensors, a lateral acceleration sensor, and a steering wheel angle sensor. The bicycle kinematic model and the Ackerman steering geometry were employed to particularize the EKF. The proposed system was evaluated through experimental tests. The results showed precision improvements of up to 50% in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), 50% in terms of the 95th-percentile of the distance error distribution, and 75% in terms of the maximum distance error, with respect to using a stand-alone, low-cost GNSS receiver. These results suggest that the proposed data fusion system for car vehicles can significantly reduce the positioning error with respect to the positioning error of a low-cost GNSS receiver. The best precision improvements of the system are expected to be achieved in urban areas, where tall buildings hinder the effectiveness of GNSS systems. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a novel system that enables accurate car positioning during short GNSS signal outages. This advance could be integrated in larger expert and intelligent systems such as autonomous cars, helping to make self-driving easier and safer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Technological advancements in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), particularly the integration of diverse stakeholder groups (communication service providers, road operators, automakers, repairers, CAV consumers, and the general public) and the pursuit of new economic opportunities, have resulted in the emer-gence of new technical, legal, and social challenges. The most pressing challenge is deterring criminal behaviour in both the physical and cyber realms through the adoption of CAV cybersecurity protocols and regulations. However, the literature lacks a systematic decision tool to analyze the impact of the potential cybersecurity regulations for dynamically interacting stakeholders, and to identify the leverage points to minimise the cyber-risks. To address this knowledge gap, this study uses systems theory to develop a dynamic modelling tool to analyze the indirect consequences of potential CAVs cybersecurity regulations in the medium to long term. It is hypothesized that CAVs Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF) is the property of the entire ITS stakeholders. The CRF is modelled using the System Dynamic based Stock-and-Flow-Model (SFM) technique. The SFM is founded on five critical pillars: the Cybersecurity Policy Stack, the Hacker's Capability, Logfiles, CAV Adopters, and intelligence-assisted traffic police. It is found that decision-makers should focus on three major leverage points: establishing a CRF grounded on automakers' innovation; sharing risks in eliminating negative externalities associated with underinvestment and knowledge asymmetries in cybersecurity; and capitalising on massive CAV-generated data in CAV operations. The formal integration of intelligence analysts and computer crime investigators to strengthen traffic police capabilities is pivotal. Recommendations for automakers include data-profiteering in CAV design, production, sales, marketing, safety enhancements and enabling consumer data transparency. Furthermore, CAVs-CRF necessitate a balanced approach to the trade-off between: i) data acces-sibility constraints on CAV automakers and ITS service providers; ii) regulator command and control thresholds; iii) automakers' business investment protection; and iv) consumers' data privacy guard.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in various fields due to their advantages like high mobility and low cost. Reliable communication is the premise to ensure the connectivity between UAV nodes. To provide reasonable references for the design, deployment, and operation of UAV communication systems, the precise prediction of radio channel parameters are required. In this study, the authors propose prediction methods for path loss and delay spread in air-to-ground millimetre-wave channels based on machine learning. Random forest and K-nearest-neighbours are the algorithms employed in the methods. Then, a feature selection scheme is proposed to further improve the prediction accuracy and generalisation performance of the machine-learning-based methods. Generally, machine learning algorithms require massive data for training purpose. However, measuring data is time-consuming and costly, especially when the scenario or frequency changes. Therefore, transfer learning methods are introduced to predict path loss with limited data. The proposed methods for path loss prediction are compared to Okumura-Hata and COST-231 Hata models. The lognormal distribution is the contrast model in delay spread prediction. Based on the data generated by ray-tracing software, the new methods have a smaller root mean square errors than contrast models.

AB The traditional vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), which is evolving into the internet of vehicles (IoV), has drawn great attention for its enormous potential in road safety improvement, traffic management, infotainment service support, and even autonomous driving. IEEE 802.11p, as the vital standard for wireless access in vehicular environments, has been released for more than one decade and its evolution, IEEE 802.11bd, has also been released for a few months. Since the analytical models for the IEEE 802.11p/bd medium access control (MAC) play important roles in terms of performance evaluation and MAC protocol optimization, a lot of analytical models have been proposed. However, the existing analytical models are still not accurate as a result of ignoring some important factors of the MAC itself and real communication scenarios. Motivated by this, a novel analytical model is proposed, based on a novel two-dimensional (2-D) Markov chain model. In contrast to the existing studies, all the important factors are considered in this proposed model, such as the backoff freezing mechanism, retry limit, post-backoff states, differentiated packet arrival probabilities for empty buffer queue, and queue model of packets in the buffer. In addition, the influence of the capture effect under a Nakagami-m fading channel has also been considered. Then, the expressions of successful transmission, collided transmission, normalized unsaturated throughput, and average packet delay are all meticulously derived, respectively. At last, the accuracy of the proposed analytical model is verified via the simulation results, which show that it is more accurate than the existing analytical models.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating at different altitudes will be integral to the 5th generation and beyond (5G+) communication network to provide ubiquitous coverage. Though 5G+ communications target to operate in sub-6 GHz as well as millimeter wave range (mmWaves), sub-6 GHz being already congested, mmWaves are seen as a viable technology that can support high data rates. To this end, in this paper, we study the feasibility of using UAVs at mmWaves deployed at low altitudes to serve a user population higher than the number of RF chains available at the UAV. Since the UAVs are energy constrained devices, solar harvesting is considered for the UAVs to act as access nodes for an extended period of time. Practical 3-dimensional antenna array radiation pattern and the resulting inter-beam interference from the sidelobes are taken into account in the analysis. We devise a sub-array hybrid precoder that provides minimum rate support to all users across the wideband mmWave channel. The RF precoder is designed according to the users' locations. In addition, we propose a low complexity iterative joint subcarrier allocation and baseband precoder optimization algorithm with faster convergence. In the proposed algorithm, we employ weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) to design baseband precoder to reduce inter-beam interference while jointly optimizing subcarrier allocation to maintain minimum user rate constraint. Next, we determine the optimal number of beams at UAV to optimize throughput while guaranteeing minimum user rate support for energy sustainable UAV operation. Finally, we compare the performance gain achieved by low-altitude UAV deployed at mmWaves over the UAV deployed at sub-6 GHz frequency range.

AB Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) is considered as a backbone for the 5G network. The successive MEC network combines the networking and computation at the edge of the network to achieve the Quality of Services (QoS) with ultralow latency. The devices with mobility feature, whether hand-held devices or vehicles move from one edge server (ES) location to another ES, creates a nonoptimal environment in the long run. To maintain QoS and avoid service disruptions, existing network topologies do not fulfill the requirement. Hence, a unique traffic steering with dynamic path selection is required for live service migration of time-sensitive applications. In this article, we are the first to introduce a distributed traffic steering through the differentiation of two different types of network elements (i.e., ESs and routers), in a large MEC system. Using this concept, we, for the first time, resolve the scalability problem of a large MEC network into a partitioned MEC network. The proposed framework bounds the path-finding procedure with a filter strategy based on the network distance to eliminate the excess of nonrelated network elements. With a decentralized framework for MEC, we propose matrix-based dynamic shortest path selection and matrix-based dynamic multipath searching algorithms for dynamic path selection under the proposed autonomous network boundary discovery and must connect node block benchmarks. Our proposed dynamic traffic steering system works under two most important metric measurements (time delay and available bandwidth). Experimental results validate the effectiveness of dynamic and adaptive path searching in a partitioned controlled MEC network that significantly outperforms the centralized approaches with 35%-70% efficiency in QoS.

AB Recently, a hybrid remote sensing network constituted by satellites in constellation and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in formation attracts a lot of interests, benefiting from the flexible architecture and excellent rapid responsiveness. Considering frequently intermittent connectivity and limited resource onboard, Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) develops a feasible solution for the remote sensing scenarios. However, the intrinsic motion models of multifarious nodes lead to deterministic or semi-deterministic contacts, which makes finding a reliable end-to-end routing path for timely data delivery difficult, with typical routing strategies such as Contact Graph Routing (CGR). To cope with such routing challenge in the hybrid network, a Probabilistic Contact Graph (PCG) is designed, taking the diverse node properties into consideration. In particular, a probability prediction model for semi-deterministic contacts between the UAV nodes is proposed, with a semi-Markov motion model for the UAV nodes. Besides, a Markov Decision Process based Routing (MDPR) algorithm is designed to search for a feasible data transmission path with a series of hybrid deterministic and semi-deterministic contacts. Through the numerical and experimental simulations with Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION), the proposed MDPR algorithm shows excellent routing performance concerning delivery delay and delivery ratio, compared with the typical CGR strategy.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are becoming increasingly attractive as highly integrated miniature sensors and processors deliver extraordinary performance. The employment of UAV swarms on complex real-life tasks has motivated exploration on allocation problems involving multiple UAVs, complex constraints, and multiple tasks with coupling relationships. Such problems have been summarized domain independently as multirobot task allocation problems with temporal and ordering constraints (MRTA/TOC). The majority of MRTA/TOC works have hitherto focused on deterministic settings, while their stochastic counterparts are sparsely explored. In this article, allocation problems incorporating classification uncertainty of targets and soft ordering constraints of tasks are considered. To address such problems, a novel market-based allocation algorithm, the probability-tuned market-based allocation (PTMA), is proposed. PTMA consists of iterations between two phases: 1) the first phase updates local perception of global situational awareness and 2) the second phase is a market-based allocation scheme with embedded artificial randomness to locally generate allocation results. Under reasonable assumptions on classification uncertainty, the proposed PTMA algorithm is proven to guarantee a superior performance compared with conventional auctions, verifying the feasibility of using randomness to counter randomness theoretically. Three groups of numerical experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the proposed PTMA. The first group of experiments compares PTMA with the consensus-based auction algorithm (CBAA), the chance-constrained CBAA, and the PTMA-I (specialization of PTMA with the Identity matrix), on simulated task scenarios with varying degrees of classification uncertainty. The second group evaluates the stability of PTMA. The third group tests the scalability of PTMA on expanded task scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate a satisfactory performance in effectiveness, robustness, stability, and scalability of the proposed PTMA.

ID MODEL
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in military and civilian fields, but they also pose great threats to restricted areas, such as densely populated areas and airports. Thermal infrared (IR) imaging technology is capable of monitoring UAVs at a long range in both day and night conditions. Therefore, the anti-UAV technology based on thermal IR imaging has attracted growing attention. However, the images acquired by IR sensors often suffer from small and dim targets, as well as heavy background clutter and noise. Conventional detection methods usually have a high false alarm rate and low detection accuracy. This article proposes a detection method that formulates the UAV detection as predicting the residual image (i.e., background, clutter, and noise) by learning the nonlinear mapping from the input image to the residual image. The UAV target image is obtained by subtracting the residual image from the input IR image. The constructed end-to-end U-shaped network exploits the depthwise separable residual dense blocks in the encoder stage to extract the abundant hierarchical features. Besides, the multiscale feature fusion and representation block is introduced to fully aggregate multiscale features from the encoder layers and intermediate connection layers at the same scale, as well as the decoder layers at different scales, to better reconstruct the residual image in the decoder stage. In addition, the global residual connection is adopted in the proposed network to provide long-distance information compensation and promote gradient backpropagation, which further improves the performance in reconstructing the image. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves favorable detection performance in real-world IR images and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics.

AB Safety guarantees are vital to the dependability of the automated vehicle (AV), so are of primary concern to the AV industry and regulatory bodies. Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS), proposed by Mobileye, is a rigorous mathematical model that defines the real-time safety distance that the AV needs to maintain in relation to surrounding vehicles, and helps the AV respond to dangerous situations. However, RSS's performance has not yet been tested with real driving data. This study thus calibrates and evaluates the RSS model based on car-following scenarios created from safety critical events (SCEs) detected in the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. SCEs were identified from the raw data with a trigger method; they were manually validated and then converted into virtual scenarios in which the human-driven subject vehicle was replaced with an AV controlled by a model predictive control based adaptive cruise control (ACC) system embedded with RSS. The RSS model was calibrated with the goal of achieving optimal safety performance, that is, of generating the lowest time-integrated time-to-collision (TIT) after the AV algorithms were implemented in the safety-critical scenarios. By comparing the performance of RSS-embedded ACC, ACC-only, and the unassisted human driver, this study found that: 1) RSS-embedded ACC performed best in eliminating underlying safety-critical situations by controlling the average TIT for each 15-second event at 2.65 s(2); 2) RSS-embedded ACC generated the highest average relative speed and relative distance, and the lowest standard deviation of speed; and 3) on average, RSSembedded ACC was able to perceive the SCEs 2.31 s ahead of the human driver.

AB Spores of fungi in the genus Fusarium may be transported through the atmosphere over long distances. New information is needed to characterize seasonal trends in atmospheric loads of Fusarium and to pinpoint the source(s) of inoculum at both local (farm) and regional (state or country) scales. We hypothesized that (1) atmospheric concentrations of Fusarium spores in an agricultural ecosystem vary with height and season and (2) transport distances from potential inoculum source(s) vary with season. To test these hypotheses, spores of Fusarium were collected from the atmosphere in an agricultural ecosystem in Blacksburg, VA, USA using a Burkard volumetric sampler (BVS) 1 m above ground level and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) 100 m above ground level. More than 2200 colony forming units (CFUs) of Fusarium were collected during 104 BVS sampling periods and 180 UAV sampling periods over four calendar years (2009-2012). Spore concentrations ranged from 0 to 13 and 0 to 23 spores m(-3) for the BVS and the UAVs, respectively. Spore concentrations were generally higher in the fall, spring, and summer, and lower in the winter. Spore concentrations from the BVS were generally higher than those from the UAVs for both seasonal and hourly collections. A Gaussian plume transport model was used to estimate distances to the potential inoculum source(s) by season, and produced mean transport distances of 1.4 km for the spring, 1.7 km for the summer, 1.2 km for the fall, and 4.1 km for the winter. Environmental signatures that predict atmospheric loads of Fusarium could inform disease spread, air pollution, and climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based communication is a promising technology for offering wireless communication services. UAVs can typically be adopted as aerial base stations to collect data from ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the Ground-to-Air link of UAV-based IoT communications is prone to be interfered by surrounding WiFi devices in the Industrial, Scientific, Medical (ISM) band. This paper aims to enable reliable uplink communications for IoT devices in 5 GHz ISM bands, thereby reducing the hover time and energy consumption of the UAV. To this end, we first study and design suppression frames suitable for WiFi devices. Then a suppression method is proposed, which is shown to be effective for all the tested devices, based on emulation performance verification of the frames for multiple commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices. Moreover, by taking the energy consumption of the UAV and multiple transmission parameters of the suppression method into account, we formulate an optimization problem for the desired uplink, which is designed to minimize the energy consumption of the UAV, under the constraints of satisfying the link channel capacity. Given that the optimization problem is non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm that takes advantage of the suppression performance of the utilized frames. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the WiFi device density, UAV weight, channel capacity requirement and parameters of the suppression method. The communication quality of the desired Ground-to-Air link is shown to be significantly improved, while the consumed energy is demonstrated to be obviously reduced.

AB Estimation and control of wheel slip is a critical consideration in preventing loss of traction, minimizing power consumptions, and reducing soil disturbance. An approach to wheel slip estimation and control, which is robust to sensor noises and modeling imperfection, has been investigated in this study. The proposed method uses a simplified form of wheels longitudinal dynamic and the measurement of wheel and vehicle speeds to estimate and control the optimum slip. The longitudinal wheel forces were estimated using a robust sliding mode observer. A straightforward and simple interpolation method, which involves the use of Burckhardt tire model, instantaneous values of wheel slip, and the estimate of longitudinal force, was used to determine the optimum slip ratio that guarantees maximum friction coefficient between the wheel and the road surface. An integral sliding mode control strategy was also developed to force the wheel slip to track the desired optimum value. The algorithm was tested in Matlab/Simulink environment and later implemented on an autonomous electric vehicle test platform developed by the Nanjing agricultural university. Results from simulation and field tests on surfaces with different friction coefficients (mu) have proved that the algorithm can detect an abrupt change in terrain friction coefficient; it can also estimate and track the optimum slip. More so, the result has shown that the algorithm is robust to bounded variations on the weight on the wheels and rolling resistance. During simulation and field test, the system reduced the slip from non-optimal values of about 0.8 to optimal values of less than 0.2. The algorithm achieved a reduction in slip ratio by reducing the torque delivery to the wheel, which invariably leads to a reduction in wheel velocity.

ID FLOCKING
AB Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) are playing an increasingly prominent role in our lives. Numerous studies have been conducted on autonomous mobility. In this study, an architecture has been developed for 3D mapping and 3D navigation for MAVs. The flight time of a MAV is considerably shorter than ground vehicles. Therefore, they are expected to perform tasks more efficiently and with higher performance. MAVs can plan a route to a given target and follow this path using the developed 3D navigation algorithm. Tracking paths produced by classical waypoint-based planners is slow. For this reason, a local path planner based on Bezier curves has been developed for MAVs, with path planning represented as a curve on the low-level control card. Since it is not always possible to reach the given target with a single curve, the multi-hop Bezier curves approach has been proposed. Particularly in environments with low complexity, this approach yields very effective results. In cases where the Bezier path cannot be generated in high-complexity environments, a metric has been developed to measure the complexity, allowing for a switch between waypoint and multi-hop Bezier curves based local plans on the environment complexity metric. Thanks to these developed methods, the aim is to extend the flight time of MAVs by optimizing their battery usage. Within the scope of this study, all experiments were conducted in the ROS-GAZEBO simulation environment. Firstly, waypoint-based local planning methods such as Dijkstra and A*, which will function within the navigation algorithm, were implemented to operate in 3D, and performance tests were conducted in the designed simulation environments. Subsequently, a multi-hop Bezier curves-based local planner was developed, and performance comparisons were made with waypoint-based methods using the same simulation environments, taking into account environmental complexity parameters.

AB The numerous obstacles to large-scale integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and the mitigating steps that need to be taken to overcome them in smart grid technology implementation are extensively discussed in this review article. Main focus is given on the control techniques in Microgrids, different supporting measures such as electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and the monitoring techniques of Microgrid considering large scale renewable energy integration. The absence of physical factors like reactive power and frequency makes the DC microgrid less difficult than the AC microgrid. A comparison of the characteristics of centralized, decentralized, and distributed control arrangements reveals that the microgrid central controller (MGCC) bears the majority of the computational load and the cost of computation in centralized control, whereas local controllers (LCs) bear the least of the load and the cost of computation in completely decentralized control. Centralized and decentralized control also have less difficult implementations than distributed control, which has more complexity. Due to a number of challenges that are discussed in this article, the EV scenario in Bangladesh is rather challenging. The transportation sector has chosen vehicle to grid (V2G) approaches over other technologies due to a number of its advantages. In the event that a home energy storage system and an emergency backup storage system are required, V2G can reduce the cost of EVs and be modified for the local community. An autonomous power generation and distribution system is the main emphasis of a smart micro grid in this age, and internet of things (IoT) is utilized in various applications, such as micro grids, intelligent buildings, and intelligent control devices, for monitoring and tracking crucial data. Based on the topics that are presented in this article, it clearly demonstrates the state-of-the-art research in the area in question.

AB Computation and memory resource management strategies are the backbone of continuous object tracking in intelligent vehicle orchestration. Multi-object tracking generates enormous measurements of targets and extended object positions using light detection and ranging (Lidar) sensors. Designing an adequate object-tracking system is a global challenge because of dynamic object detection and data association uncertainties during scene understanding. In this regard, we develop an intelligent multi-objective tracking (IMOT) system with a novel measurement model, called the box data association inflate (BDAI) model, to assess each target's object state and trajectory without noise by using the Bayesian approach. The box object filter method filters ambiguous detection responses during data association. The theoretical proof of the box object filter is derived based on binomial expansion. Prognosticating a lower-dimension object than the original point object reduces the computational complexity of vehicle orchestration. Two datasets (NuScenes dataset and our lab dataset) are considered during the simulations, and our approach measures the kinematic states adequately with reduced computation complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. The simulation outcomes show that our proposed method is effective and works well to detect and track objects. The NuScenes dataset contains 28130 samples for training, 6019 examples for validation and 6008 samples for testing. IMOT achieves 58.09% tracking accuracy and 71% mAP with 5 ms pre-processing time. The Jetson Xavier NX consumes 49.63% GPU and 9.37% average power and exhibits 25.32 ms latency compared to other approaches. Our system trains a single pair frame in 169.71 ms with affinity estimation time of 12.19 ms, track association time of 0.19 ms and mATE of 0.245 compared to state-of-the-art approaches

AB This paper presents a review of soil-machine interaction studies in soil bin test facilities; it provides an insight on the historical background, concepts, past and present studies and future research direction. Soil-machine interaction studies seek to provide scientific knowledge on how tillage tools and traction devices interact with the terrain over which they work or move. Variables usually investigated include; force required to pull or push the tillage tool, vertical and lateral forces on tools, soil failure patterns, soil particles displacement, force generated at the interface of the wheel and the soil, wheel sinkage, rolling resistance, wheel contact area estimation, and soil stress at different depths. Soil bin facility is a model laboratory for tillage and traction experiments. The main components include the soil bin that models the ground; mobile tool carrier that models tool/implement frame; soil engaging tool/device for modeling tillage tools or traction elements; power source and the drive system that model the prime mover; soil conditioning equipment for preparation of the soil before experiments; motion control system for controlling the moving components along the rails of the soil bin; measurement/data acquisition and analysis system for real time measurement, analysis and display of variables during experiments; a lifting system for hoisting of heavy components. Simulations with Finite Element and Discrete Element Methods together with experimental analyses in the field or the soil bin are applied by many researchers in studying soil machine interaction. Results of this kind of study are useful for design, modeling, prediction, performance evaluation and optimization of different kinds of off-road vehicles, earth moving machines, tractors, tillage tools/implements, traction elements, wheeled mobile robots and autonomous traction vehicles.

AB Most applications for small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) have a critical need for appropriate position and attitude control in environments with extreme external dynamic disturbances such as wind gusts. Moreover, to maximize flight time, UAVs have to operate within strict constraints on payload and under computational efficiency. This article presents an optimized robust adaptive controller for a UAV in the presence of realistic wind gusts that are flying in an urban environment at an altitude lower than 400 ft. The position controller is based on two degree-of-freedom proportional-integral-derivative controller tuned with particle swarm optimization, while the attitude controll is based on a robust adaptive integral backstepping controller. By assuming the knowledge of the predetermined limits of the external and unstructured disruptions (for example, wind gusts) at low altitude, a guaranteed quality of transient and steady-state tracking performance were attained. The aerodynamics, wind gust model, and control modules are integrated into a six-degree-of-freedom UAV with a fully nonlinear robust adaptive controller. Optimal power is obtained for UAVs using the radial inflow model in the presence of wind gusts that are compared with the simplified model. Two case studies were performed systematically for two representative flight paths, namely, up-cruise-down and circular paths. The simulation results demonstrate the robustness and adaptive property of controllers against wind gusts. These results are useful for a variety of UAV applications, e.g. accurate trajectory tracking and autonomous waypoint navigation without loss of performance in the presence of wind disturbances under computational efficacy.

AB The aim of the Smart and Networking Underwater Robots in Cooperation Meshes (SWARMs) project is to make autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), remote operated vehicles (ROVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) more accessible and useful. To achieve cooperation and communication between different AUVs, these must be able to exchange messages, so an efficient and reliable communication network is necessary for SWARMs. In order to provide an efficient and reliable communication network for mission execution, one of the important and necessary issues is the topology control of the network of AUVs that are cooperating underwater. However, due to the specific properties of an underwater AUV cooperation network, such as the high mobility of AUVs, large transmission delays, low bandwidth, etc., the traditional topology control algorithms primarily designed for terrestrial wireless sensor networks cannot be used directly in the underwater environment. Moreover, these algorithms, in which the nodes adjust their transmission power once the current transmission power does not equal an optimal one, are costly in an underwater cooperating AUV network. Considering these facts, in this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Topology Control (PTC) algorithm for an underwater cooperating AUV network. In PTC, when the transmission power of an AUV is not equal to the optimal transmission power, then whether the transmission power needs to be adjusted or not will be determined based on the AUV's parameters. Each AUV determines their own transmission power adjustment probability based on the parameter deviations. The larger the deviation, the higher the transmission power adjustment probability is, and vice versa. For evaluating the performance of PTC, we combine the PTC algorithm with the Fuzzy logic Topology Control (FTC) algorithm and compare the performance of these two algorithms. The simulation results have demonstrated that the PTC is efficient at reducing the transmission power adjustment ratio while improving the network performance.

AB With the development of autonomous driving, precise positioning capabilities are becoming increasingly important. GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) is normally utilized for vehicle positioning, but is susceptible to factors such as urban canyons, especially in increasingly urbanized scenario nowadays. The interpretation of relative positioning information by means of multi-source sensors such as LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) or camera, has also been widely investigated, but there are deficiencies in the precision and reliability of the sensors due to their operating principles. For GNSS challenging environments, we give a semi-tightly coupled sensor fusion system based on factor graph optimization. The system is tightly coupled with the raw observations from the LiDAR, camera, and inertial measurement unit. Based on this, the back end is optimized by means of the factor graphs, which ultimately give optimized positional information of the vehicle, and the GNSS sensor is decoded to reduce the cumulative error, which is regarded as the loosely coupled component of graph optimization. We selected three representative datasets from publicly available datasets in different categories and conducted experiments respectively. The results indicate that this semi-tightly coupled system outperforms both the GNSS strategy and the typical SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) strategies in terms of precision and possesses very high reliability, exhibiting the best performance.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB With innovative applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks in various areas, their demands on broad bandwidth, large capacity and low latency become prominent. The combination of millimeter wave, directional antenna and time division multiple access techniques, which enables concurrent transmissions, is promising to deal with it. In this paper, we study the resource allocation problem in UAV ad hoc networks. Specifically, the slot assignment, antenna boresight and transmit power are jointly optimized to promote the network capacity. First, we formulate the optimization problem as the maximization of the fairness-weighted network capacity, subject to the constraint on priority guarantee. Then, because the formulated problem is a mixed integer non-linear programming problem (MINLP), which is NP-hard, two algorithms called dual-based iterative search algorithm (DISA) and sequential exhausted allocation algorithm (SEAA) are respectively proposed to efficiently solve it with acceptable complexity. DISA slacks the MINLP into a continuous-variable optimization problem and solves it with the Lagrangian dual method in an iterative manner. As a heuristic method, SEAA schedules links sequentially, i.e., from high-priority to low-priority ones. Numerical results demonstrate that both DISA and SEAA can efficiently allocate resources for UAVs, while guaranteeing the fairness and priority of links.

AB The application of the concept of shared mobility can mitigate numerous negative impacts of urban transportation and improve the city's sustainability. This study aims to address and solve the problem of prioritizing sustainable mobility sharing systems to promote sustainability and foster the concept of shared mobility. Four sustainable mobility sharing systems are proposed. They are electric vehicle (EV) sharing, autonomous EV sharing, e-bike sharing, and e-scooter sharing systems. A multi-level practical framework, including four clusters and 20 criteria offers a primer on how city authorities should evaluate mobility sharing systems in real-life settings. Also, this research introduces an advanced decision-making model to prioritize sustainable mobility sharing systems. The model integrates the DIBR (Defining Interrelationships Between Ranked criteria) method and the EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) method in a fuzzy-rough environment. A case study of Belgrade, Serbia, is provided to offer decision-making guidelines in a real-world context. The practical findings show that "e-bike sharing" is an advantageous alternative in the context of Belgrade. The integrated fuzzy DIBR and fuzzy-rough EDAS model could serve as a powerful tool for rational and objective solving not only the newly addressed problem but also other emerging decision-making problems related to sustainable cities.

AB This paper proposes a stereovision-based auto-guidance method for a riding-type cultivator to track the inter-rows between ridges and furrows. A stereo camera perceives the three-dimensional (3D) structure of field sur-faces and enables autonomous agricultural vehicles to determine navigation paths. However, when developing an efficient ridge-furrow classification and guidance-line-extraction algorithm for outdoor applications, the stereo camera must overcome the irregular vehicle movements caused by uneven surfaces and errors caused by strong sunlight. When moving on uneven surfaces, pitch and roll oscillations of the stereo camera would cause disparity variations corresponding to the ground plane. Furthermore, due to the image artifacts caused by strong outdoor sunlight, the boundary discontinuity between the objects would disturb the robust detection of the guidance line. The primary contributions of this study were the development of a compensation method that responds to the dynamic pitch and roll movements and a robust guidance-line extraction method that responds to image artifacts. The developed algorithm could classify ridges and furrows with an accuracy above 90% under outdoor conditions. On-site testing with auto-guided riding-type cultivators using a stereo camera confirmed that the developed ridge-tracking algorithm is useful for real-world agricultural applications and revealed a lateral deviation from the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.5 cm in a flat field and 6.2 cm in a hillside field.

AB The underwater probe device such as ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle), AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) and ARGO (Array for Real-Time Geostrophic Oceanography) float are widely used in observing the salty, temperature, depth and other oceanographic parameter. As the working depth go deeper the limitation of anti-pressure case becomes vital. The optimal size of the anti-pressure should be designed in order to meet the requirement that the float's house can ensure the 4000m deep-sea pressure and has the minimum weight. However, rare researches focus on the anti-pressure house theory or designation for the ARGO float. In this paper, an innovation structure and working principle of a 4000m deep-sea ARGO float is introduced. Then a non-linear buckling mathematic model for the thin-walled cylinder house is constructed. The ANSYS simulation is applied to draw the critical pressure at different diameter, wall-thickness or length of the abstract pressure house. Then the mathematic conclusion is compared with the ANSYS data to validate the correctness of the mathematic method and find the initial imperfection. Finally, the pressure resistance experimental is carried out to examine the sealability and pressure resistant ability of the shell. In all, this paper would provide a practical construction theory and anti-pressure model for the deep sea profile probe ARGO floats.

AB The new developments in mobile edge computing (MEC) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications has positioned 5G and beyond in a strong position to answer the market need towards future emerging intelligent transportation systems and smart city applications. The major attractive features of V2X communication is the inherent ability to adapt to any type of network, device, or data, and to ensure robustness, resilience and reliability of the network, which is challenging to realize. In this work, we propose to drive further these features by proposing a novel robust, resilient and reliable architecture for V2X communication based on harnessing MEC and blockchain technology. A three stage computing service is proposed. Firstly, a hierarchcial computing architecture is deployed spanning over the vehicular network that constitutes cloud computing (CC), edge computing (EC), fog computing (FC) nodes. The resources and data bases can migrate from the high capacity cloud services (furthest away from the individual node of the network) to the edge (medium) and low level fog node, according to computing service requirements. Secondly, the resource allocation filters the data according to its significance, and rank the nodes according to their usability, and selects the network technology according to their physical channel characteristics. Thirdly, we propose a blockchain-based transaction service that ensures reliability. We discussed two use cases for experimental analysis, plug-in electric vehicles in smart grid scenarios, and massive IoT data services for autonomous cars. The results show that car connectivity prediction is accurate 98% of the times, where 92% more data blocks are added using micro-blockchain solution compared to the public blockchain, where it is able to reduce the time to sign and compute the proof-of-work (PoW), and deliver a low-overhead Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This approach can be considered a strong candidate architecture for future V2X, and with more general application for everything-to-everything (X2X) communications.

AB [1] Recent advances in underwater vehicle navigation and sonar technology now permit detailed mapping of complex seafloor bathymetry found at mid-ocean ridge crests. Imagenex 881 (675 kHz) scanning sonar data collected during low-altitude (similar to 5 m) surveys conducted with DSV Alvin were used to produce submeter resolution bathymetric maps of five hydrothermal vent areas at the East Pacific Rise (EPR) Ridge2000 Integrated Study Site (9 degrees 50'N, "bull's-eye''). Data were collected during 29 dives in 2004 and 2005 and were merged through a grid rectification technique to create high-resolution (0.5 m grid) composite maps. These are the first submeter bathymetric maps generated with a scanning sonar mounted on Alvin. The composite maps can be used to quantify the dimensions of meter-scale volcanic and hydrothermal features within the EPR axial summit trough (AST) including hydrothermal vent structures, lava pillars, collapse areas, the trough walls, and primary volcanic fissures. Existing Autonomous Benthic Explorer (ABE) bathymetry data (675 kHz scanning sonar) collected at this site provide the broader geologic context necessary to interpret the meter-scale features resolved in the composite maps. The grid rectification technique we employed can be used to optimize vehicle time by permitting the creation of high-resolution bathymetry maps from data collected during multiple, coordinated, short-duration surveys after primary dive objectives are met. This method can also be used to colocate future near-bottom sonar data sets within the high-resolution composite maps, enabling quantification of bathymetric changes associated with active volcanic, hydrothermal and tectonic processes.

AB The decentralised infrastructure of the Danish thermal and electricity infrastructure has improved security, efficiency and reliability in energy transmission and consumption in each of the systems. To further improve this trend, this paper investigates the concept of decentralised coupling of electrified thermal and transportation system in low voltage residential network to identify their operational flexibility. In this paper, diagnosis based on actual data from the energy distributors and surveys is used to understand and improve the flexibility of an integrated energy system. The main contribution is a set up model with an autonomous control system that can assess the potential flexibility from thermal units (eg heat pumps and storages) and electric vehicles (EV) charging systems, in the low voltage distribution network as a multi-energy system. Each thermal system and EV charging has its respective individual controller. The proposed control technique manages to successfully operate and control the thermal units and EVs charging system within the recommended operating limits of grid voltage, and by sharing flexibility within the specific network integrated with multi-carrier energy systems. It has the capability of sensing local key control parameters like node voltage, state of charge of EV, temperature and level of hot water in the storage tank. These control parameters allow scheduling, re-scheduling, and decision making on the operation of individual thermal and EV charging-unit with operational priorities. This enhances the sharing of flexibility for proper coordination, control, and management of thermal and EV charging systems in low voltage (LV) distribution networks with mutual technical benefits. From the results of the steadystate analysis of power system, the application of the proposed control architecture is found to be effective to manage grid congestions and local voltage control, satisfying the thermal energy requirements of the customer as well as charging needs of EV.

AB The journey to the next decade of smart cellular connectivity, sixth-generation (6G) networks, has already begun, even though 6G is still in its nascent stages and far from its deployment. In telecommunications, 6G networks have gained the attention of the industry and academia. 6G is planned to succeed the 5G standard with almost 100 times greater speed. One of the exciting features of 6G is Edge Intelligence (EI), which is the coupling of Edge Computing with Artificial Intelligence (AI). So far, EI has yet to be a component of the existing and predecessor communication standards; thus, 6G will open up many opportunities with its deployment in the future. Nonetheless, integration of 6G with EI, in other words, Edge and AI, is also susceptible to various challenges, particularly security and privacy. Therefore, this article proposes a trusted AI-enabled intelligent architecture for the 6G-envisioned Edge Computing platform. The proposed architecture is based on the Explainable AI concept and is mainly used to ensure the security and privacy of the future 6G networks at the Edge. Following this, the work presents a detailed case study of employing the proposed framework. The preliminary discussion indicates some exciting findings and lays the foundation for future research. In a nutshell, the proposed architecture can be extended to different verticals, including, but not limited to, life-critical systems, like e-healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and traffic monitoring.

AB Artificial intelligence and mechanical engineering are two mature fields of science that intersect more and more often. Computer-aided mechanical analysis tools, including multibody dynamics software, are very versatile and have revolutionalized many industries. However, as shown by the literature presented in this review, combining the advantages of multibody system dynamics and machine learning creates new and exciting possibilities. For example, the multibody method can assist machine learning by providing synthetic data, while machine learning can provide fast and accurate subsystem models. The intersection of both approaches results in surrogate and hybrid modeling techniques, advanced control algorithms, and optimal design applications. A notable example is the development of autonomous systems for vehicles, robots, and mobile machinery. In our review we have found nontrivial, innovative, and even surprising applications of machine learning and multibody dynamics. This review focuses on applying neural networks, mainly deep learning, in connection with the multibody system method. Over one hundred and fifty papers are covered, and three main research areas are identified and introduced: data-driven modeling, model-based control and estimation, and data-driven control. The paper starts with a primer on machine learning and concludes with future research directions. The main goal is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of existing literature to inspire further research.

AB In this paper, we propose to employ multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base stations to serve ground users in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands. To improve the spectrum efficiency, uniform planar arrays are equipped at the UAVs and users for compensation of the high path loss and for mitigation of interference. We formulate a problem to jointly optimize the UAV positioning, user clustering, and hybrid analog-digital beamforming (BF) for the maximization of user achievable sum rate (ASR), subject to a minimum rate constraint for each user. Since the problem is highly non-convex and involves high-dimensional variable matrices and combinatorial programming variables, we develop a suboptimal solution via alternating optimization, successive convex optimization, and combinatorial optimization. First, we design the UAV positioning and user clustering under the assumption of ideal beam patterns, which significantly decouples the UAV positioning and directional BF. Then, the transmit and receive BF variables are successively optimized to approach the ideal beam patterns. Our simulation results verify the convergence and superiority of the proposed algorithm. Significant performance gains can be obtained compared to some benchmark schemes in terms of the ASR, and the proposed hybrid BF solution closely approaches a performance bound given by fully-digital BF.

AB In this paper, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabledspace-air-ground integrated relay system, in which UAV is equipped with phased-array antennas to receive satellite's signal while utilizing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes to transmit data to land-based users, is proposed. For UAV signal collection, a detection-vector optimization problem can be addressed by introducing a serial of transformations into a second-order cone programming problem. Furthermore, the UAV-ground NOMA communication is summarized into a max-min problem in terms of UAV's energy efficiency (EE), which is a fractional mixed-integer non-convex problem and has been widely recognized as hard work. Thus, a two-step solution is proposed. Firstly, we transfer the max-min fractional problem into a subtractive one. After that, the transformed problem is further divided into three sub-problems, which are used for jointly performing UAV trajectory optimization, NOMA scheduling optimization, and NOMA power allocation. In addition, the non-convexity of the above-mentioned problem is well solved by using the proposed iterative algorithm, achieving a rapid convergence. Numerical results illustrate the superiority of the proposed EE-NOMA scheme, which achieves three times higher energy-efficient than the conventional spectrum efficiency scheme, and NOMA is shown to globally outperform the orthogonal multiple access in UAV EE circumstance.

AB Underwater wireless communication (UWC) networks have attracted substantial attention in recent years. UWC can facilitate critical emerging services including communications for: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), environmental monitoring, surveillance, navigation, and ex-ploration. Most UWC devices are battery-powered, where recharging/swapping batteries is not straightforward. Since the reliability of a UWC network depends on limited energy storage, energy-efficient communication is critical for its operation. Whilst communication range and data rate in UWC have been popular research topics, until recently, this energy-efficiency aspect of UWC has not received the same level of attention. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive literature review on existing contributions in the area of energy-efficient UWC. At first, we provide a detailed overview of UWC network architectures and relevant challenges for UWC networks. Next, we discuss and compare the most commonly-used UWC physical layer technologies, reviewing the existing physical layer power-saving techniques proposed in the literature. Then, we review various energy-saving techniques in the upper layers, including Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, routing protocols, and localization techniques. Lastly, we provide a detailed discussion of alternative energy sources in UWC networks before highlighting future research directions in the field and challenges related to the widespread adoption of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT).

TI Evaluating a Lithium-Seawater Battery on Gliders
SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Neutral-buoyancy vehicles demand high-density energy sources and lithium is light with high oxidation energy. PolyPlus Battery Company has developed a prototype lithium-seawater battery that is attractive for powering long-duration autonomous oceanographic vehicles (floats and underwater gliders). These batteries were tested in the laboratory and at sea.
   PolyPlus batteries use "Protected Lithium Electrodes'' with proprietary "windows'' protecting the volatile lithium anode from water while passing lithium ions. The cathode reduces oxygen dissolved in seawater, or hydrolyzes seawater to produce hydrogen. Not requiring additional electrolyte, fuel, or pressure cases, these cells have impressive weight advantages. Good electrode-seawater mass transfer is required but can increase drag and be impeded by biofouling.
   Tests assessing robustness of the PolyPlus batteries in oceanographic use, evaluating mass transfer issues, and observing biofouling impacts are reported. In sea trials, two cells were tested for 69 days mounted on a Spray glider. Findings are as follows: 1) the cells were robust over 900 dives, most to 400 m; 2) without antifouling measures, the cells became substantially biofouled, but their performance was undiminished; and 3) performance was complex, depending on current density, oxygen concentration, and flow conditions. For dissolved oxygen concentration above 1mL L-1, the cells delivered 9Wm(-2) of electrode surface at 3V. For low oxygen, the cell shifted to hydrolysis near 2.3 V, but mass transfer was less critical so current density could be increased and observed power reached 5Wm(-2). This could be increased using a lower resistance load.

AB We developed small computer-controlled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, Ant-Plane) using parts and technology designed for model airplanes. These UAVs have a maximum flight range of 300-500 km. We planned aeromagnetic and aerial photographic surveys using the UAVs around Bransfleld Basin, Antarctica, beginning from King George Island. However, we were unable to complete these flights due to unsuitable weather conditions and flight restrictions. Successful flights were subsequently conducted from Livingston Island to Deception Island in December 2011. This flight covered 302.4 km in 3:07:08, providing aeromagnetic and aerial photographic data from an altitude of 780 m over an area of 9 x 18 km around the northern region of Deception Island. The resulting magnetic anomaly map of Deception Island displayed higher resolution than the marine anomaly maps published already. The flight to South Bay in Livingston Island successfully captured aerial photographs that could be used for assessment of glacial and sea-ice conditions. It is unclear whether the cost-effectiveness of the airborne survey by UAV is superior to that of manned flight. Nonetheless, Ant-Plane 6-3 proved to be highly cost-effective for the Deception Island flight, considering the long downtime of the airplane in the Antarctic storm zone.

AB Offloading tasks and data is an important use case for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) that benefits a wide variety of mobile applications on different platforms, including autonomous vehicles and smartphones. A moving vehicle may pass through multiple Roadside Units (RSUs) and the MEC servers located within them as it travels. On-board applications generate structured tasks and can offload them to observable servers. However, since the mobile node cannot determine the information of the global server, choosing the best server becomes a key issue. In this paper, we address the problem of the offloading threshold in traditional Optimal Stopping Theory (OST) based decision models that cannot adapt to the environment. We use Deep Q-Network (DQN) to provide the model with the optimal offloading threshold for adaptive environments and propose a DQN-based Adaptive Threshold Multi-task Offloading approach (DQN-ATMOO). This method uses the principle of OST to solve the offloading order decision problem, divides structured tasks into sub-tasks, and executes offloading in sequence, with the goal of maximizing the probability of offloading to the best server and minimizing the total offloading delay. We experimentally compare and evaluate the proposed model using simulated and real datasets. The results show that the proposed model can be effectively implemented on mobile nodes and significantly reduces the total expected processing time.

AB Auto-labeling is one of the main challenges in 3D vehicle detection. Auto-labeled datasets can be used to identify objects in LiDAR data, which is a challenging task due to the large size of the dataset. In this work, we propose a novel methodology to generate new 3D based auto-labeling datasets with a different point of view setup than the one used in most recognized datasets (KITTI, WAYMO, etc.). The performance of the methodology has been further demonstrated with the development of our own dataset with the auto-generated labels and tested under boundary conditions on a bridge in a fixed position. The proposed methodology is based on the YOLO model trained with the KITTI dataset. From a camera-LiDAR sensor fusion, it is intended to auto-label new datasets while maintaining the consistency of the ground truth. The performance of the model, with respect to the manually labeled KITTI images, achieves an F-Score of 0.957, 0.927 and 0.740 in the easy, moderate and hard images of the dataset. The main contribution of this work is a novel methodology to auto-label autonomous driving datasets using YOLO as the main labeling system. The proposed methodology is tested under boundary conditions and the results show that this approximation can be easily adapted to a wide variety of problems when labeled datasets are not available.

AB As the automotive industry is shifting the paradigm towards autonomous driving, safety guarantee has become a paramount consideration. Temperature plays a key role in the system-wide reliability of the electronic control systems (ECS) used in the automotive. A vehicle is usually subjected to harsh temperature conditions from its operating environment. The increasing power density of IC chips in the ECS further exacerbates the operating temperature and thermal gradient condition on the chip, thereby significantly impacting the vehicle's reliability. In this paper, we study how to map a periodic distributed automotive application on a heterogeneous multiple-core processing architecture with temperature and system-level reliability issues in check. We first present a mathematical programming model to bound the peak operating temperature for the ECS. Then we propose a more sophisticated approach based on the genetic algorithm to effectively bound the peak temperature and optimize the system-wide reliability of the ECS by maximizing its mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). To this end, we present an algorithm to guarantee the peak temperature for periodic applications with variable execution times to ensure our approach's effectiveness. We also present several computationally efficient techniques for system-wide MTTF computation, which show several-order-of-magnitude speed-up over the state-of-the-art method when tested using synthetic cases and practical benchmarks.

AB In this paper we present a new way to compute the odometry of a 3D lidar in real-time. Due to the significant relation between these sensors and the rapidly increasing sector of autonomous vehicles, 3D lidars have improved in recent years, with modern models producing data in the form of range images. We take advantage of this ordered format to efficiently estimate the trajectory of the sensor as it moves in 3D space. The proposed method creates and leverages a flatness image in order to exploit the information found in flat surfaces of the scene. This allows for an efficient selection of planar patches from a first range image. Then, from a second image, keypoints related to said patches are extracted. This way, our proposal computes the ego-motion by imposing a coplanarity constraint between pairs whose correspondences are iteratively updated. The proposed algorithm is tested and compared with state-of-the-art ICP algorithms. Experiments show that our proposal, running on a single thread, can run 5x faster than a multi-threaded implementation of GICP, while providing a more accurate localization. A second version of the algorithm is also presented, which reduces the drift even further while needing less than half of the computation time of GICP. Both configurations of the algorithm run at frame rates common for most 3D lidars, 10 and 20 Hz on a standard CPU.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication is an essential component of the promising next generation networks owning to its advantages of high maneuverability and low cost. However, the limited onboard energy and weak communication ability of the UAV, as well as the open nature of the wireless networks, may result in the insufficient service time, low coverage and worrying security. Collaborative beam-forming is an effective technique for boosting the communication performance of the multi-antenna systems, which is able to achieve an energy-efficient, long-range and secure transmission. In this work, we focus on the UAV-enabled collaborative beamforming via swarm intelligence approaches. First, we present some preliminaries such as collaborative beamforming, swarm intelligence and multi-objective optimization, and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled UAV swarm networks. Then, several typical applications of UAV-enabled collaborative beamforming are briefly presented. Subsequently, we propose two UAV communication schemes via collaborative beamforming to enhance communication performance. Specifically, we jointly optimize the schedules of UAVs and the communication order of multiple base stations (BSs) to achieve a secure and energy-efficient transmission. Moreover, we also deploy the UAVs and configure the communication order of the BSs for a time and energy minimization communication via collaborative beamforming. Visualization and numerical results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed schemes. Finally, we also point out some future directions worthy of further investigation.

AB Autonomous vehicles make use of an Inertial Navigation System (INS) as part of vehicular sensor fusion in many situations including GPS-denied environments such as dense urban places, multi-level parking structures, and areas with thick tree-coverage. The INS unit incorporates an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to process the linear acceleration and angular velocity data to obtain orientation, position, and velocity information using mechanization equations. In this work, we describe a novel deep-learning-based methodology, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to reduce errors from MEMS IMU sensors. We develop a CNN-based approach that can learn from the responses of a particular inertial sensor while subject to inherent noise errors and provide near real-time error correction. We implement a time-division method to divide the IMU output data into small step sizes to make the IMU outputs fit the input format of the CNN. We optimize the CNN approach for higher performance and lower complexity that would allow its implementation on ultra-low power hardware such as microcontrollers. Our results show that we achieved up to 32.5% error improvement in straight-path motion and up to 38.69% error improvement in oval motion compared with the ground truth. We examined the performance of our CNN approach under various situations with IMUs of various performance grades, IMUs of the same type but different manufactured batch, and controlled, fixed, and uncontrolled vehicle motion paths.

AB The ability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to autonomously operate is constrained by the severe limitations of their on-board resources. The limited processing capacity and energy storage of these devices inevitably makes the real-time analysis of complex signals - the key to autonomy - challenging. In urban environments, the UAVs can leverage the communication and computation resources of the surrounding city-wide Internet of Things infrastructure to enhance their capabilities. For instance, the UAVs can interconnect with edge computing resources and offload computation tasks to improve response time to sensor input and reduce energy consumption. However, the complexity of the urban topology and large number of devices and data streams competing for the same network and computation resources create an extremely dynamic environment, where poor channel conditions and edge server congestion may penalize the performance of task offloading. This paper develops a framework enabling optimal offloading decisions as a function of network and computation load parameters and current state. The optimization is formulated as an optimal stopping time problem over a semi-Markov process. We solve the optimization problem using Dynamic Programming and Deep Reinforcement learning at different levels of abstraction and prior knowledge of the system underlying stochastic processes. We validate our results in a realistic scenario, where a UAV performs a building inspection task while connected to an edge server.

AB y In the context of growing the adoption of advanced sensors and systems for active vehicle safety and driver assistance, an increasingly important issue is the security of the information exchanged between the different sub-systems of the vehicle. Random number generation is crucial in modern encryption and security applications as it is a critical task from the point of view of the robustness of the security chain. Random numbers are in fact used to generate the encryption keys to be used for ciphers. Consequently, any weakness in the key generation process can potentially leak information that can be used to breach even the strongest cipher. This paper presents the architecture of a high performance Random Number Generator (RNG) IP-core, in particular a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) IP-core, a digital hardware accelerator for random numbers generation which can be employed for cryptographically secure applications. The specifications used to develop the proposed project were derived from dedicated literature and standards. Subsequently, specific architecture optimizations were studied to achieve better timing performance and very high throughput values. The IP-core has been validated thanks to the official NIST Statistical Test Suite, in order to evaluate the degree of randomness of the numbers generated in output. Finally the CSPRNG IP-core has been characterized on relevant Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and ASIC standard-cell technologies.

AB The pendulum-swing problem is a factor that limits the development of parafoil-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Autonomous attitude control based on parafoil and UAV control mechanisms is considered an effective solution to this problem. However, due to the coupling effect of the two control mechanisms, conventional control methods are not suitable. The design of attitude control for parafoil-UAV systems has become a challenge. For this problem, a model-independent optimal control method called multivariate extremum seeking with the Newton method (ES-NM) is introduced in this paper. To assess the performance of multivariate ES-NM control for parafoil-UAV systems, a multibody dynamic model based on the flexible line assumption is built. The aerodynamic coefficients of this model are estimated via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and corrected using flight data. Using this model, the coupling effect of the two control mechanisms is investigated, and the control range is determined. Finally, the effectiveness of multivariate ES-NM controller for a parafoil-UAV system is verified. Simulation experiments performed under various conditions demonstrate that the multivariate ES-NM control can manipulate the UAV control mechanism and the parafoil control mechanism simultaneously and produce the desired UAV attitude track. Additionally, comparisons to proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control reveal the better performance of the proposed control method.

AB A sampler for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was developed for deployment on a multicopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The sampler was designed to collect gas-and aerosol-phase VOCs on up to four commercially available VOC-adsorbent cartridges for subsequent offline analysis by thermal-desorption gas chromatography. The sampler had a mass of 0.90 kg and dimensions of 19 cm x 20 cm x 5 cm. Power consumption was < 10 kJ in a typical 30 min flight, representing < 3% of the total UAV battery capacity. Autonomous sampler operation and data collection in flight were accomplished with a microcontroller. Sampling flows of 100 to 400 sccm were possible, and a typical flow of 150 sccm was used to balance VOC capture efficiency with sample volume. The overall minimum detection limit of the analytical method for a 10 min sample was 3 ppt and the uncertainty was larger than 3 ppt or 20% for isoprene and monoterpenes. The sampler was mounted to a commercially available UAV and flown in August 2017 over tropical forest in central Amazonia. Samples were collected sequentially for 10 min each at several different altitude-latitude-longitude collection points. The species identified, their concentrations, their uncertainties, and the possible effects of the UAV platform on the results are presented and discussed in the context of the sampler design and capabilities. Finally, design challenges and possibilities for next-generation samplers are addressed.

AB This study presents an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) with simultaneous localization and map building (SIAM) based on matching method, and extended Kalman filter SIAM. In general, the AGV is a large mobile robot that is used in transportation to carry cargoes, and it is guided using wired or wireless guidance systems. The guidance system based AGV accounts for a majority of robots in the mobile robot industry. However, in semiconductor factories, landmarks are unavailable; hence, the existing system has not been used in the mentioned environments. Therefore, the SLAM technology is applied in the environments, and can guide the AGV without landmarks. However, the accuracy of the SLAM can be low owing to measurement error of sensors and a cumulative calculation caused by localization sensors. Therefore, the accuracy is frequently assumed to be incorrect; moreover, the accuracy of the built map is low. In order to solve the problems, this study proposes the AGV with the SLAM based on matching methods; two matching method; geometric matching method and iterative closest point algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is compared with typical methods such as singular value decomposition / RIGID transformation based technologies using feature-point-based SLAM and is compared with the aforementioned two methods using the extended Kalman filter SLAM. The proposed method is more efficient than the typical methods used in the comparison. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we characterize the performance of a three-dimensional (3D) two-hop cellular network in which terrestrial base stations (BSs) coexist with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to serve a set of ground user equipment (UE). In particular, a UE connects either directly to its serving terrestrial BS by an access link or connects first to its serving UAV which is then wirelessly backhauled to a terrestrial BS (joint access and backhaul). We consider realistic antenna radiation patterns for both BSs and UAVs using practical models developed by the third generation partnership project (3GPP). We assume a probabilistic channel model for the air-to-ground transmission, which incorporates both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links. Assuming the max-power association policy, we study the performance of the network in both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we analyze the joint distribution of distance and zenith angle of the closest (and serving) UAV to the origin in a 3D setting. Further, we identify and extensively study key mathematical constructs as the building blocks of characterizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution. Using these results, we obtain exact mathematical expressions for the coverage probability in both AF and DF relaying protocols. Furthermore, considering the fact that backhaul links could be quite weak because of the downtilted antennas at the BSs, we propose and analyze the addition of a directional uptilted antenna at the BS that is solely used for backhaul purposes. The superiority of having directional antennas with wirelessly backhauled UAVs is further demonstrated via simulation.

AB In this paper, we propose an agent-based approach for the evaluation of Multiple Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (MUAV) wildfire monitoring systems for remote and hard-to-reach areas. Emerging environmental factors are causing a higher number of wildfires and keeping these fires in check is becoming a global challenge. MUAV deployment for the monitoring and surveillance of potential fires has already been established. However, most of the scholarly work is still focused on MUAV operations details. In wildfire surveillance and monitoring, evaluations of the system-level performance in terms of the analysis of the effects of individual behavior on system surveillance has yet to be established. Especially in an MUAV system, the individual and cooperative behaviors of the team affect the overall performance of the system. Such systems are dynamic and stochastic because of an ever-changing environment. Quantifying the emergent system behavior and general performance measures of such a system by analytical methods is challenging. In our work, we present an agent-based model for MUAV surveillance missions. This paper focuses on the overall system performance of cooperative UAVs performing forest fire surveillance. The principal theme is to present the effects of three behaviors on overall performance: (1) the area allocation and (2) dynamic coverage, and (3) the effects of forest density on team allocation. For area allocation, three behaviors are simulated: (1) randomized, (2) two-layer barrier sweep coverage, and (3) full sweep coverage. For dynamic coverage, the effects of communication and resource unavailability during the mission are studied by analyzing the agent's downtime spent on refueling. Last, an extensive simulation is carried out on wildfire models with varying forest density. It is found that cooperative complete sweep coverage strategies perform better than the rest and the performance of the team is greatly affected by the forest density.

AB Very often, the root of problems found to produce food sustainably, as well as the origin of many environmental issues, derive from making decisions with unreliable or inexistent data. Data-driven agriculture has emerged as a way to palliate the lack of meaningful information when taking critical steps in the field. However, many decisive parameters still require manual measurements and proximity to the target, which results in the typical undersampling that impedes statistical significance and the application of AI techniques that rely on massive data. To invert this trend, and simultaneously combine crop proximity with massive sampling, a sensing architecture for automating crop scouting from ground vehicles is proposed. At present, there are no clear guidelines of how monitoring vehicles must be configured for optimally tracking crop parameters at high resolution. This paper structures the architecture for such vehicles in four subsystems, examines the most common components for each subsystem, and delves into their interactions for an efficient delivery of high-density field data from initial acquisition to final recommendation. Its main advantages rest on the real time generation of crop maps that blend the global positioning of canopy location, some of their agronomical traits, and the precise monitoring of the ambient conditions surrounding such canopies. As a use case, the envisioned architecture was embodied in an autonomous robot to automatically sort two harvesting zones of a commercial vineyard to produce two wines of dissimilar characteristics. The information contained in the maps delivered by the robot may help growers systematically apply differential harvesting, evidencing the suitability of the proposed architecture for massive monitoring and subsequent data-driven actuation. While many crop parameters still cannot be measured non-invasively, the availability of novel sensors is continually growing; to benefit from them, an efficient and trustable sensing architecture becomes indispensable.

AB Background
   The increasing access to autonomously-operated technologies offer vast opportunities to sample large volumes of biological data. However, these technologies also impose novel demands on ecologists who need to apply tools for data management and processing that are efficient, publicly available and easy to use. Such tools are starting to be developed for a wider community and here we present an approach to combine essential analytical functions for analysing large volumes of image data in marine ecological research.
   New information
   This paper describes the Koster Seafloor Observatory, an open-source approach to analysing large amounts of subsea movie data for marine ecological research. The approach incorporates three distinct modules to: manage and archive the subsea movies, involve citizen scientists to accurately classify the footage and, finally, train and test machine learning algorithms for detection of biological objects. This modular approach is based on open-source code and allows researchers to customise and further develop the presented functionalities to various types of data and questions related to analysis of marine imagery. We tested our approach for monitoring cold water corals in a Marine Protected Area in Sweden using videos from remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs). Our study resulted in a machine learning model with an adequate performance, which was entirely trained with classifications provided by citizen scientists. We illustrate the application of machine learning models for automated inventories and monitoring of cold water corals. Our approach shows how citizen science can be used to effectively extract occurrence and abundance data for key ecological species and habitats from underwater footage. We conclude that the combination of open-source tools, citizen science systems, machine learning and high performance computational resources are key to successfully analyse large amounts of underwater imagery in the future.

AB The ever-increasing demands of vehicular networks pose significant challenges such as availability, computation complexity, security, trust, authentication, etc. This becomes evenmore complicated for high-speed moving vehicles. As a result, increasing the capacity of these networks has been attracting considerable awareness. In this regard, the next generation of cellular networks, 5G, is expected to be a promising solution enabling high data rates, capacity, and quality of service as well as low latency communications. However, 5G networks still face challenges in providing ubiquitous and reliable connections among high-speed vehicles. Thus, to overcome the gaps in the existing solutions, we propose a software defined network (SDN)-based consolidated framework providing end-to-end security and privacy in 5G enabled vehicular networks. The framework simplifies networkmanagement through SDN, while achieving optimized network communications. It operates in two phases: first, an elliptic curve cryptographic based authentication protocol is proposed to mutually authenticate the cluster heads and certificate authority in SDN-based vehicular setups, and, second, an intrusion detectionmodule supported by tensor based dimensionality reduction is designed to reduce the computational complexity and identify the potential intrusions in the network. In order to assess the performance of the proposed framework, an extensive evaluation is performed on three simulators; NS3, SUMO, and SPAN. To harness the potential benefits of the proposed model, the first module, is evaluated on the basis of security features, whereas the second module is evaluated, and compared with the existing state-of-the-art models, on the basis of detection rate, false positive rate, accuracy, detection time, and communication overhead. The simulation results indicate the superiority of the proposed framework as compared to the existing models.

   Monitoring and navigation; Panda3D; Testbed training platform
AB Purpose - The paper aims to report the development of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Testbed Training Platform (TTP). The development is to enable users to safely fly and control the UAV in real time within a limited (yet unconstrained) virtually created environment. Thus, the paper introduces a hardware-virtual environment coupling concept, the Panda3D gaming engine utilization to develop the graphical user interface (GUI) and the 3D-flying environment, as well as the interfacing electronics that enables tracking, monitoring and mapping of real-time movement onto the virtual domain and vice verse.
   Design/methodology/approach - The platform comprises a spring-shuttle assembly fixed to a heavy aluminium base. The spring supports a rotating platform (RP), which is intended to support UAVs. The RP yaw, pitch and roll are measured by an inertial measurement unit, its climb/descend is measured by a low cost infrared proximity sensor and its rotation is measured by a rotary optical encoder. The hardware is coupled to a virtual environment (VE), which was developed using the Panda3D gaming engine. The VE includes a GUI to generate, edit, load and save real-life environments. Hardware manoeuvres are reflected into the VE.
   Findings - The prototype was proven effective in dynamically mapping and tracking the rotating platform movements in the virtual environment. This should not be confused with the hardware in loop approach, which requires the inclusion of a mathematical model of the hardware in a loop. The finding will provide future means of testing navigation and tracking algorithms.
   Research limitations/implications - The work is still new, and there is great room for improvement in many aspects. Here, this paper reports the concept and its technical implementation only.
   Practical implications - In the literature, various testbeds were reported, and it is felt that there is still room to come up with a better design that enables UAV flying in safer and unlimited environments. This has many practical implications, particularly in testing control and navigation algorithms in hazardous fields.
   Social implications - The main social impact is to utilise the concept to develop systems that are capable of autonomous rescue mission navigation in disaster zones.
   Originality/value - The authors are aware that various researchers have developed various testbeds, at different degrees of freedom. Similarly, the authors are also aware that researchers have used game engines to simulate mobile robots or sophisticated equipment (like the VICON Motion Capture System) to measure to perform complex manoeuvres. However, the cost of this kind of equipment is very high, autonomous movements are planned in restricted environments and tested systems are only autonomous in certain setups. However, the idea of mapping the dynamics of an avatar flying object onto a 3D-VE is novel. To improve productivity and rapid prototyping, this paper proposes the use of commercially available game engines, such as the Panda3D, to create virtual environments.

AB Control algorithms of a multiagent system (MAS) have been applied to many Internet of Things devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles. Flocking control is a crucial problem in MAS to enhance the safety and cooperativity of agents, which requires the agents to maintain the flock when navigating to a target position and avoiding collisions. In comparison with the traditional algorithms, methods based on multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) can solve the problem of flocking control more flexibly and adapt to more complex environments. However, the MARL-based methods demand a huge number of interactions between agents and the environment, resulting in the problem of sample inefficiency. In this article, we propose nonexpert policy-aided MARL (NPA-MARL) to improve sample efficiency, which utilizes a fundamental MARL algorithm and a prior policy whose performance can be nonexpert. Before online MARL training, NPA-MARL generates demonstrations by the nonexpert policy to pretrain agents, while preventing overfitting demonstrations. During online training, NPA-MARL instructs agents to imitate the nonexpert policy if the nonexpert policy is better in agents' recognition. We leverage NPA-MARL to solve the problem of flocking control. Experimental results show that NPA-MARL improves sample efficiency and policy performance in flocking control. Besides, NPA-MARL has the scalability of more agents and the flexibility of choice of the nonexpert policy and a fundamental MARL algorithm.

AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have impacts on the development of communication networks. Diversified applications and scenarios put forward AI-native requirement for communication network. The network is envisioned to offer high data rate and low-latency communications, pervasive artificial intelligence, full coverage and programmable service. With the aid of AI, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an indispensable role in the emerging scenarios. Owing to their flexibility and scalability, UAVs can be utilized as the mobile platform to deliver various kinds of services in dynamic and adversarial environments, especially the emergency scenarios. In this article, we deal with the post-disaster scenarios that UAVs, equipped with computing servers, work with the remaining infrastructures to provide communication and computing services for the ground mobile users (GMUs). With the aim of minimizing the energy cost and computing delay of task offloading, a two-layer optimization mechanism that can dynamically orchestrate the task offloading decision and the UAVs deployment is proposed. In lower layer, the problem of making offloading decisions is formulated into an evolutionary game. Replicator dynamics is exploited to help users to make decisions. In upper layer, a clustering approach for users is introduced to avoid unbalanced load distribution. By suggesting the locations and number of UAVs based the clusters, system cost is further reduced. The fairness of service load among UAVs is also achieved. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-layer optimization mechanism.

AB Operations of electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles heavily rely on rechargeable battery packs. The degradation of the battery cell is influenced by several factors, e.g., heat generation, load cycle, and road condition. Vibration from the engine and uneven road can be transmitted to the battery pack and may significantly affect the rechargeable batteries' performance. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of vibration parameters on the performance of batteries and battery thermal management systems. In this work, a series of experimental investigations have been conducted on the thermal performance of the 18,650 lithium (Li)-ion battery under a vibrating environment. The thermal behaviour of the battery surface has been studied under various discharge rates (i.e., 1C, 2C, and 3C) with three different vibrational frequencies (5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 15 Hz) and amplitudes (10 mm/s, 20 mm/s, and 30 mm/s). Moreover, this study has been extended with aluminium foam considering vibration with natural and forced convection conditions. Besides, thermal images of the battery surface have been investigated to examine the significance of aluminium foam. The experimental results indicate that the battery surface temperature surrounded by aluminium foam and under forced convection has dropped around 26 C compared to without any heat transfer media.

AB Vehicular networks aim to provide a communication framework for moving vehicles, road infrastructure and pedestrians. Such kind of networks is the entrance to a new era of services that will make areas such as security and safety, information, transactions, entertainment and sustainability (green transportation) more efficient than they are today, especially in the upcoming era of autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. However, the severe nature of vehicular environments makes efficient inter-vehicular communication very difficult to achieve. Vehicular Delay-Tolerant Networks (VDTN), as these networks are called, have very sparse, intermittent connections, and the lack of a fixed topology gives rise to one of the main challenges that they face: packet routing. A range of routing algorithms has been proposed in recent years to optimize communication in vehicular networks, and significant progress has been made in the matter but the quest for the optimal performance is still ongoing. In this paper, we explore a deep learning approach to the routing problem in VDTN, proposing a routing architecture and algorithm based on Deep Neural Networks that helps routers make packet forwarding decisions based on the current conditions of its surroundings. In order to assess the performance of the proposed architecture, simulations were run showing important gains in terms of network overhead and hop count with respect to popular routers, while maintaining acceptable packet delivery rates and average delivery delays.

AB The triboelectric generator (TEG) is a strong candidate for low-power sensors utilized in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Within IoT technologies, advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) technology is included within autonomous driving technology. Development of an energy source for sensors necessary for operation becomes an important issue, since a lot of sensors are embedded in vehicles and require more electrical energy. Although saving energy and enhancing energy efficiency is one of the most important issues, the application approach to harvesting wasted energy without compromising the reliability of existing mechanical systems is still in very early stages. Here, we report of a new type of TEG, a suspension-type free-standing mode TEG (STEG) inspired from a shock absorber in a suspension system. We discovered that the optimum width of electrode output voltage was 131.9 V and current was 0.060 mu A/cm(2) in root mean square (RMS) value while the optimized output power was 4.90 W/cm(2) at 66 M. In addition, output power was found to be proportional to frictional force due to the contact area between two frictional surfaces. It was found that the STEG was made of perfluoroalkoxy film and showed good mechanical durability with no degradation of output performance after sliding 11,000 times. In addition, we successfully demonstrated charging a capacitor of 330 F in 6 min.

ID AUTONOMOUS FORMATIONS
AB The classical notion of rigidity (that a formation of agents in R-2 or R-3 is rigidly constrained by interagent distances up to rigid-body transformations of space) is inherently dependent on the nature of Euclidean space and the nature of distance measurements. In this paper, we present a generalized formulation of rigidity, where agent states may lie in heterogeneous and non-Euclidean state spaces with arbitrary differentiable measurement constraints. A key aspect of our approach is to recognize the crucial role that the symmetry action of rigid-body transformations plays in classical rigidity theory. We consider a general symmetry given by a Lie-group action on a heterogeneous state space and define global rigidity of a formation to be the case where the interagent measurements fully constrain the agent locations up to the invariance encoded by the group action. In this framework, we develop general definitions of local rigidity and infinitesimal rigidity and introduce a new notion of robust rigidity that we believe will be important for control applications. To motivate the development, we show how the proposed theory can be applied to generalizations of the established problems of network localization and formation control. The provided results are directly applicable to networks of robotic vehicles involving a mixture of bearing and distance sensors, as well as cases where a collection of ground, submersible, and aerial vehicles operate in a single formation.

AB The problem of homing a mobile robot to a given reference location under unknown relative and absolute positions is addressed in this paper. This problem is easy to solve when all the positions and kinematic variables are known or are observable, but remains a challenge when only range is measured. Its complexity further increases when variable and unknown drifts are added to the motion, which is typical for marine vehicles. Based on the range measurements, it is possible to drive the robot arbitrarily close to the reference. This paper presents a complete solution and demonstrates the validity of the approach based on the Lyapunov theory. The use of models, which are often affected by uncertainties and/or unmodeled terms, is intended to be minimal and only some constraints are imposed on the speed of the robot. We derive a control law that makes the robot converge asymptotically to the reference and prove its stability theoretically. Nevertheless, as it is well known, practical limitations on the actuation can weaken some properties of convergence, namely when the system dynamics require increasing actuation along the approach trajectory. We will demonstrate that the robot reaches a positively invariant set around the reference whose upper bound is determined. Finally, we conclude our work by presenting simulation and experimental data and by demonstrating the validity and the robustness of the method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE 3D object detection; deep learning; Jetson platforms; benchmark
AB This paper presents a benchmark analysis of NVIDIA Jetson platforms when operating deep learning-based 3D object detection frameworks. Three-dimensional (3D) object detection could be highly beneficial for the autonomous navigation of robotic platforms, such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and drones. Since the function provides one-shot inference that extracts 3D positions with depth information and the heading direction of neighboring objects, robots can generate a reliable path to navigate without collision. To enable the smooth functioning of 3D object detection, several approaches have been developed to build detectors using deep learning for fast and accurate inference. In this paper, we investigate 3D object detectors and analyze their performance on the NVIDIA Jetson series that contain an onboard graphical processing unit (GPU) for deep learning computation. Since robotic platforms often require real-time control to avoid dynamic obstacles, onboard processing with a built-in computer is an emerging trend. The Jetson series satisfies such requirements with a compact board size and suitable computational performance for autonomous navigation. However, a proper benchmark that analyzes the Jetson for a computationally expensive task, such as point cloud processing, has not yet been extensively studied. In order to examine the Jetson series for such expensive tasks, we tested the performance of all commercially available boards (i.e., Nano, TX2, NX, and AGX) with state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. We also evaluated the effect of the TensorRT library to optimize a deep learning model for faster inference and lower resource utilization on the Jetson platforms. We present benchmark results in terms of three metrics, including detection accuracy, frame per second (FPS), and resource usage with power consumption. From the experiments, we observe that all Jetson boards, on average, consume over 80% of GPU resources. Moreover, TensorRT could remarkably increase inference speed (i.e., four times faster) and reduce the central processing unit (CPU) and memory consumption in half. By analyzing such metrics in detail, we establish research foundations on edge device-based 3D object detection for the efficient operation of various robotic applications.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) fuse data from multiple sensors and sensing modalities to impart a measure of robustness when operating in adverse conditions. Radars and cameras are popular choices for use in sensor fusion; although radar measurements are sparse in comparison to camera images, radar scans penetrate fog, rain, and snow. However, accurate sensor fusion depends upon knowledge of the spatial transform between the sensors and any temporal misalignment that exists in their measurement times. During the life cycle of an AV, these calibration parameters may change, so the ability to perform in-situ spatiotemporal calibration is essential to ensure reliable long-term operation. State-of-the-art 3D radar-camera spatiotemporal calibration algorithms require bespoke calibration targets that are not readily available in the field. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for targetless spatiotemporal calibration that does not require specialized infrastructure. Our approach leverages the ability of the radar unit to measure its own ego-velocity relative to a fixed, external reference frame. We analyze the identifiability of the spatiotemporal calibration problem and determine the motions necessary for calibration. Through a series of simulation studies, we characterize the sensitivity of our algorithm to measurement noise. Finally, we demonstrate accurate calibration for three real-world systems, including a handheld sensor rig and a vehicle-mounted sensor array. Our results show that we are able to match the performance of an existing, target-based method, while calibrating in arbitrary, infrastructure-free environments.

AB Landmine contamination is a significant problem that has devastating consequences worldwide. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can play an important role in solving this problem. The technology has the potential to expedite, simplify, and improve the safety and efficacy of the landmine detection process prior to physical intervention. Although the process of detecting landmines in contaminated environments is systematic, it is proven to be rather costly and overwhelming, especially if prior information about the location of the lethal objects is unknown. Therefore, automation of the process to orchestrate the search for landmines has become necessary to utilize the full potential of system components, particularly the UAV, which is the enabling technology used to airborne the sensors required in the discovery stage. UAVs have a limited amount of power at their disposal. Due to the complexity of target locations, the coverage route for UAV-based surveys must be meticulously designed to optimize resource usage and accomplish complete coverage. This study presents a framework for autonomous UAV-based landmine detection to determine the coverage route for scanning the target area. It is performed by extracting the area of interest using segmentation based on deep learning and then constructing the coverage route plan for the aerial survey. Multiple coverage path patterns are used to identify the ideal UAV route. The effectiveness of the suggested framework is evaluated using several target areas of differing sizes and complexities.

AB A novel robust Kalman filter (KF)-based controller design approach is proposed to accurately track a specified trajectory under unknown stochastic disturbance, known deterministic disturbance, and measurement noise. The system is nonlinear and is approximated by a piecewise-linear dynamic model. The Box-Jenkins model is an augmented model of the signal and the disturbance, is non-controllable and observable, while the signal model is controllable and observable. An emulator-based two-stage identification is employed to obtain an accurate system model needed to design the robust controller. The system and its KF are identified, and the signal and output errors are estimated. From the identified models, the signal, its KF, the disturbance model, and the whitening filter are all obtained using balanced model reduction techniques. It is shown that the signal model is a transfer matrix description relating the system output and KF residual, and the residual is the whitened output error. The disturbance model is identified by inverse filtering. A new combined feedforward-feedback controller is designed and implemented using an internal model of the reference driven by both the error between the reference and the signal estimate, and by the feedforwarded reference signal. The proposed scheme was successfully evaluated on a simulated autonomously guided drone.

AB Several cities worldwide have been attempting to adopt "car-lite" policies to reduce traffic congestion and urban pollution. In addition to measures such as re-designing neighbourhoods and encouraging active modes, much expectation has been placed on the adoption of new and innovative modes, particularly shared AVs, or Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMOD). Although the realisation of AMOD appears to be imminent, little is known about its potential effects on current transport systems. In this paper, using SimMobility, an agent-based microsimulation platform, we explored the impact of AMOD on public transport (PT). Two AV adoption scenarios were simulated: (1) "Partial Automation" where AMOD is introduced alongside existing modes, and (2) "Full Automation" where the use of private human-driven vehicles is prohibited upon the implementation of AMOD. We found that, compared to the base case (where there is no AMOD), the share of PT usage decreased significantly in the Partial Automation scenario whereas it increased in the Full Automation scenario. While the overall congestion level was reduced in the Full Automation scenario, road in the Partial Automation scenario tended to suffer from high travel demand. The increased demand for PT also prompts for a revision of current service schedules. The temporal and spatial analyses of PT demand between scenarios have brought some useful implications on the implementation of AMOD for urban and transport planners.

AB We propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) failure detection system as the first step of a three-step autonomous emergency landing safety framework for UAVs. We showed the effectiveness and feasibility of using vibration data with the k-means clustering algorithm in detecting mid-flight UAV failures for that purpose. Specifically, we measured vibration signals for different faulty propeller cases during several test flights, utilizing a custom-made hardware system. After we made the vibration graphs and extracted the data, we investigated to determine the combination of acceleration and gyroscope parameters that results in the best accuracy of failure detection in quadcopter UAVs. Our investigations show that considering the gyroscope parameter in the vertical direction (gZ) along with the accelerometer parameter in the same direction (aZ) results in the highest accuracy of failure detection for the purpose of emergency landing of faulty UAVs, while ensuring a quick detection and timely engagement of the safety framework. Based on the parameter set (gZ-aZ), we then created scatter plots and confusion matrices, and applied the k-means clustering algorithm to the vibration dataset to classify the data into three health state clusters-normal, faulty, and failure. We confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system with flight experiments, in which we were able to detect faults and failures utilizing the aforementioned clusters in real time.

DE semantic segmentation training dataset; unmanned surface vehicle;

AB Obstacle detection for autonomous navigation through semantic image segmentation using neural networks has grown in popularity for use in unmanned ground and surface vehicles because of its ability to rapidly create a highly accurate pixel-wise classification of complex scenes. Due to the lack of available training data, semantic networks are rarely applied to navigation in complex water scenes such as rivers, creeks, canals, and harbors. This work seeks to address the issue by making a one-of-its-kind River Obstacle Segmentation En-Route By USV Dataset (ROSEBUD) publicly available for use in robotic SLAM applications that map water and non-water entities in fluvial images from the water level. ROSEBUD provides a challenging baseline for surface navigation in complex environments using complex fluvial scenes. The dataset contains 549 images encompassing various water qualities, seasons, and obstacle types that were taken on narrow inland rivers and then hand annotated for use in semantic network training. The difference between the ROSEBUD dataset and existing marine datasets was verified. Two state-of-the-art networks were trained on existing water segmentation datasets and tested for generalization to the ROSEBUD dataset. Results from further training show that modern semantic networks custom made for water recognition, and trained on marine images, can properly segment large areas, but they struggle to properly segment small obstacles in fluvial scenes without further training on the ROSEBUD dataset.

AB Path planning for the three-dimensional (3D) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is a very important element of the whole UAV autonomous control system. In this paper, a modified central force optimization (MCFO) method is introduced to solve this complicated path-optimization problem for the rotary wing vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. In the path planning process, the idea from the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the mutation operator of the genetic algorithm (GA) are applied to improve the original CFO method. Furthermore, the convergence analysis of the whole MCFO method is established by the linear difference equation method. Then, in order to verify the effectiveness and practicality of this new path planning method, the path following process is put forward based on the six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor helicopter control system. At last, the comparison simulations among the six algorithms show that the trajectories produced by the whole MCFO method are more superior than the original CFO algorithm, the GA, the Firefly algorithm (FA), the PSO algorithm, the random search (RS) way and the other MCFO algorithm under the same conditions. What is more, the path following process results show that the path planning results are practical for the real dynamic model of the quadrotor helicopter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a robot navigation scheme using wireless visual sensors deployed in an environment. Different from the conventional autonomous robot approaches, the scheme intends to relieve massive on-board information processing required by a robot to its environment so that a robot or a vehicle with less intelligence can exhibit sophisticated mobility. A three-state snake mechanism is developed for coordinating a series of sensors to form a reference path. Wireless visual sensors communicate internal forces with each other along the reference snake for dynamic adjustment, react to repulsive forces from obstacles, and activate a state change in the snake body from a flexible state to a rigid or even to a broken state due to kinematic or environmental constraints. A control snake is further proposed as a tracker of the reference path, taking into account the robot's non-holonomic constraint and limited steering power. A predictive control algorithm is developed to have an optimal velocity profile under robot dynamic constraints for the snake tracking. They together form a unified solution for robot navigation by distributed sensors to deal with the kinematic and dynamic constraints of a robot and to react to dynamic changes in advance. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the capability of a wireless sensor network to carry out low-level control activities for a vehicle.

AB Steer-by-wire (SbW) systems substitute the typical mechanical linkage between the steering wheel and the front wheel with electromechanical actuators, resulting in that the steering performance of SbW systems depends on the control of electromechanical actuators. To guarantee the transient and steady-state performance of SbW systems, this paper proposes an event-triggered adaptive fuzzy control for the SbW system subject to the unavailable steering angular velocity, the time-varying disturbance, and the limited communication resources. First, to solve the problem of uncertainty modeling and external interference, an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS) and a disturbance observer are used to approximate the unknown SbW system dynamics and disturbance, respectively. Second, considering the angular velocity of the front wheels is difficult to measure, an adaptive observer is developed to estimate the steering angular velocity. The observation error is proved by the Lyapunov theory to converge in finite time. Third, to guarantee the transient and steady-state performance of the SbW system, this paper develops an output feedback controller for the automated vehicles based on event-triggered control (ETC) and prescribed performance control (PPC). Theoretical analysis proves that the tracking error can converge to a preset range within the set time, and the communication data between the controller and the actuator is reduced. Finally, simulation and experiment verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. From the analysis of the estimation performance, the designed observer has strong adaptability, which can ensure better observation accuracy even if the system has uncertainty. From the analysis of control performance, the proposed controller can guarantee the output trajectory tracking performance attributes (maximum overshoot, convergence time, maximum steady-state error). More specifically, in the experiment, the tracking error can converge to within 0.075 rad in 5 s. Additionally, the RMSE of the experimental results of the designed method is 44.7% higher than that of the output-feedback adaptive neural controller. From the perspective of communication data, the control signal transmitted to the motor driver is effectively saved by 19.3 %.

AB Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are one of the core technologies for building unmanned autonomous integrated automated electric meter verification workshops in metrology centers. However, complex obstacles on the verification lines, frequent AGV charging, and multi-AGV collaboration make the scheduling problem more complicated. Aiming at the characteristics and constraints of AGV transportation scheduling for metrology verification, a multi-AGV scheduling model was established to minimize the maximum completion time and charging cost, integrating collision-avoidance constraints. An improved snake optimization algorithm was proposed that first assigns and sorts tasks based on AGV-order-address three-level mapping encoding and decoding, then searches optimal paths using an improved A* algorithm solves multi-AGV path conflicts, and finally finds the minimum-charging-cost schedule through large neighborhood search. We conducted simulations using real data, and the calculated results reduced the objective function value by 16.4% compared to the traditional first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. It also reduced the number of charges by 60.3%. In addition, the proposed algorithm is compared with a variety of cutting-edge algorithms and the results show that the objective function value is reduced by 8.7-11.2%, which verifies the superiority of the proposed algorithm and the feasibility of the model.

AB Navigating unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in the intricate and unpredictable oceanic environment poses an indispensable challenge for path planning, necessitating meticulous strategies and unwavering resolve. In this paper, under complex and unforeseen circumstances, a novel path planning framework incorporating the multiobjective optimization and a sensory-vector replanning strategy is created for a USV. First, by encapsulating the intricate nature of ocean environment and ship dynamics, a nonlinear multi-objective path planning problem is designed, thereby providing a comprehensive and in-depth portrayal of the underlying mechanism. By integrating the principles of candidate set random testing and adaptive crowding distance, an adaptive enhanced non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (AENSGA-II) is devised to fully exploit the underlying optimization problem in constrained dynamics. To avoid over-subjective choice in the Pareto set, a fuzzy-linguistic satisfactory degree is deliberately designed, where the linguistic importance preference of the objectives is re-evaluated in the Pareto set, facilitating the decision-making. By inserting virtual sensory vector onto the USV, a seamless interface between global planning and COLREG-compliant replanning mechanism is devised, thereby contributing to the entire hierarchical scheme. Eventually, the framework merits autonomous global-planning and localreaction in an organically way. Comprehensive simulations and comparisons in various ocean scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed path planning framework.

AB In this work, we aim to improve the positioning accuracy of the visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) through actively controlling the gaze of the positioning camera mounted on an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV). A panoramic cost map (PCM)-based gaze control method (PGC) is proposed for the active VSLAM. Different from traditional method, a panoramic camera is added beside the positioning camera to aid the gaze control of the positioning camera. The panoramic camera is used to perceive the environment and evaluate the potential performance of each available orientation of the positioning camera. The evaluation of all the available orientations will make up a panoramic cost map. The cost map is then used to help the gaze control method to select an optimal target gaze for the positioning camera. In the calculation of the panoramic cost map, the effective factors of the VSLAM, such as feature points and moving objects, are taken into consideration. In the gaze control method, we also take into consideration of errors of the system, the time delay of the proposed method, and the velocity of the AGV. The test results in different scenes with different VSLAM algorithms show that the proposed method can improve the positioning accuracy of all the tested VSLAM algorithms compared to fixed camera gaze.

AB The creation of a Marine Internet of Things platform, including the Underwater Internet of Things, is needed to ensure the interaction and digital navigation of heterogeneous marine robotic agents. It is necessary to combine the following robotic agents: autonomous underwater vehicles, remotely operated vehicles, active and passive marine sensors, buoys, underwater sonar stations, coastal communication posts, and other elements of the platform. To ensure the interaction of all these elements, it is necessary to use a common communication system within the platform, as well as a common navigation and control system to solve complex problems of the navigation and control of the movement of robotic agents in order to implement a joint mission to collect and transmit data, including video information in real time. The architecture of the Marine Internet of Things platform must first be defined in order to use a unified approach to data exchange. This article provides an overview of approaches to determining the architectures of network underwater and marine communication systems based on the concept of the Internet of Things. This paper provides a comprehensive study of MIoT applications, challenges, and architectures. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: we introduce potential MIoT applications; we point out the challenges of MIoT (i.e., the differences between MIoT and IoT); and we analyze the MIoT system architecture.

AB Objective This study aims to identify expectations and perceptions of Passenger Air Vehicles (PAVs). Specifically, (1) what are the initial perceptions of PAVs by the public, and (2) what are the differences between early and laggard adopters of PAVs. Background The emergence of Urban Air Mobility presents an opportunity to increase transportation capacity in densely populated metropolitan areas. However, successful integration is largely dependent on adoption and acceptance from communities. Method A survey of 407 respondents across the United States provides insights from potential users. The Technology Adoption Life Cycle and Technology Acceptance Model are used to characterize adopter profiles and rates of adoption. Results Respondents not only expect the same level of safety standards as conventional aircraft (i.e., seatbelts, air quality), but even more feedback (i.e., displays on current and projected flight operations). PAVs are not an immediate replacement for daily trips once available. In-cabin noise is not a crucial deterrent to ridership. Earlier PAV adopters are trusting of the technology, willing to pay more to ride, and exhibit overall riskier behaviors. Later PAV adopters need more feedback in-flight and a pilot on-board. Conclusion PAV manufacturers, operators, and policymakers can utilize these findings to incorporate crucial design elements needed for PAVs to satisfy user expectations. These findings identify priorities that should be targeted in relative timeframes to satisfy near-term and long-term PAV users appropriately.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks, and determining collision-free trajectories for multiple UAVs while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) is a challenging task. In this paper, we consider non-cooperative multi-UAV scenarios, in which multiple UAVs need to fly from initial locations to destinations, while satisfying collision avoidance, wireless connectivity, and kinematic constraints. We aim to find trajectories for the UAVs with the goal to minimize their mission completion time. We first formulate the multi-UAV trajectory optimization problem as a sequential decision making problem. We, then, propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is developed to obtain values given the agent's joint state (including the agent's information, the nearby agents' observable information, and the locations of the nearby GBSs). A signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-prediction neural network is also designed, using accumulated SINR measurements obtained when interacting with the cellular network, to map the GBSs' locations into the SINR levels in order to predict the UAV's SINR. Numerical results show that with the value network and SINR-prediction network, real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed in various environments with high success rate.

AB Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a special class of artificial muscles that have been used to construct animal-like soft robotic systems. However, compared with state-of-the-art rigid actuators such as piezoelectric bimorphs and electromagnetic motors, most DEAs require higher driving voltages, and their power density and lifetime remain substantially lower. These limitations pose significant challenges for developing agile and powered autonomous soft robots. Here, a low-voltage, high-endurance, and power-dense DEA based on novel multiple-layering techniques and electrode-material optimization, is reported. When operated at 400 Hz, the 143 mg DEA generates forces of 0.36 N and displacements of 1.15 mm. This DEA is incorporated into an aerial robot to demonstrate high performance. The robot achieves a high lift-to-weight ratio of 3.7, a low hovering voltage of 500 V, and a long lifetime that exceeds 2 million actuation cycles. With 20 s of hovering time, and position and attitude error smaller than 2.5 cm and 2 degrees, respectively, the robot demonstrates the longest and best-performing flight among existing sub-gram aerial robots. This important milestone demonstrates that soft robots can outperform their state-of-the-art rigid counterparts, and it provides an important step toward realizing power autonomy in soft robotic flights.

AB Digital technologies engaged in urban metabolism for efficiency provide policymakers, urban managers, and planners with useful instruments to collect, monitor, analyze, and evaluate the circularity of environmental, social, and economic resources to improve their effectiveness and quality. At present, the digital technology-based approach is strategic for circular cities engaged in the development of smart and sustainable actions in the fields of mobility, energy, environment, waste, telecommunications, and security. Through the 'Circular Resource Efficiency Management Framework' developed by the European Commission, this paper generates insights into the digitalization practices of the circularity of urban metabolism by analyzing the initiatives implemented by the municipalities of Kaunas, Flanders region, Porto, Prato, The Hague, and Oslo, which constitute the Partnership on Circular Economy (PCE) of the Urban Agenda of the European Union. The results of the analysis provide a wide range of practices such as real-time monitoring stations for water and energy consumption, digital cameras for controlling vehicle flows, web platforms for sharing goods and services, and tracking sensors for public transport, which aim to optimize the efficiency of the circularity of urban metabolic flows. This study increases the understanding and awareness of digital technologies in this paradigm shift.

ID MOBILE ROBOT
AB A real-time roundabout detection and navigation system for smart vehicles and cities using laser simulator-fuzzy logic algorithms and sensor fusion in a road environment is presented in this paper. A wheeled mobile robot (WMR) is supposed to navigate autonomously on the road in real-time and reach a predefined goal while discovering and detecting the road roundabout. A complete modeling and path planning of the road's roundabout intersection was derived to enable the WMR to navigate autonomously in indoor and outdoor terrains. A new algorithm, called Laser Simulator, has been introduced to detect various entities in a road roundabout setting, which is later integrated with fuzzy logic algorithm for making the right decision about the existence of the roundabout. The sensor fusion process involving the use of a Wi-Fi camera, laser range finder, and odometry was implemented to generate the robot's path planning and localization within the road environment. The local maps were built using the extracted data from the camera and laser range finder to estimate the road parameters such as road width, side curbs, and roundabout center, all in two-dimensional space. The path generation algorithm was fully derived within the local maps and tested with a WMR platform in real-time.

TI A Novel Water-Shore-Line Detection Method for USV Autonomous Navigation

   segment detector); epipolar constraint
AB For the navigation of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV), detection and recognition of the water-shore-line (WSL) is an important part of its intellectualization. Current research on this issue mainly focuses on the straight WSL obtained by straight line fitting. However, the WSL in the image acquired by boat-borne vision is not always in a straight line, especially in an inland river waterway. In this paper, a novel three-step approach for WSL detection is therefore proposed to solve this problem through the information of an image sequence. Firstly, the initial line segment pool is built by the line segment detector (LSD) algorithm. Then, the coarse-to-fine strategy is used to obtain the onshore line segment pool, including the rough selection of water area instability and the fine selection of the epipolar constraint between image frames, both of which are demonstrated in detail in the text. Finally, the complete shore area is generated by an onshore line segment pool of multi-frame images, and the lower boundary of the area is the desired WSL. In order to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, field experiments were carried out in the inland river scene. Compared with other detection algorithms based on image processing, the results demonstrate that this method is more adaptable, and can detect not only the straight WSL, but also the curved WSL.

AB In cognitive electronic warfare, when a typical combat vehicle, such as an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), uses radar sensors to explore an unknown space, the target-searching fails due to an inefficient servoing/tracking system. Thus, to solve this problem, we developed an autonomous reasoning search method that can generate efficient decision-making actions and guide the UCAV as early as possible to the target area. For high-dimensional continuous action space, the UCAV's maneuvering strategies are subject to certain physical constraints. We first record the path histories of the UCAV as a sample set of supervised experiments and then construct a grid cell network using long short-term memory (LSTM) to generate a new displacement prediction to replace the target location estimation. Finally, we enable a variety of continuous-control-based deep reinforcement learning algorithms to output optimal/sub-optimal decision-making actions. All these tasks are performed in a three-dimensional target-searching simulator, i.e., the Explorer game. Please note that we use the behavior angle (BHA) for the first time as the main factor of the reward-shaping of the deep reinforcement learning framework and successfully make the trained UCAV achieve a 99.96% target destruction rate, i.e., the game win rate, in a 0.1 s operating cycle.

AB Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) are effective instruments for monitoring marine environments and surveying seabed resources, it is important to improve their security protection, including source location privacy protection. Numerous strategies have been presented by researchers to strengthen location privacy, however, the majority of these plans have expensive energy costs. Therefore, a backbone-network-construction-based multiautonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) collaboration source location privacy protection (BNCSLP) algorithm has been enhanced to address this issue. First, the nodes in the network are split into various clusters, and an entire network is segmented into various regions. The backbone network is built using clusters that house the source. To prevent the adversary's tracking, the AUV alternately chooses alternative backbone nodes and relays the source and fake data. Then, the cluster head determines whether to update the clusters by calculating how similar the data are with nearby clusters. The nearest neighbor technique is used by the updated cluster to anticipate the data and to reduce the energy utilization of forwarding the data packets, resulting in that there is less chance of data packets being intercepted and the source location being revealed. Finally, the AUV replans the trajectory, which shortens the AUV's traveling path because only fewer cluster heads need to be accessed, decreasing the time it takes for data to be transmitted.

AB The field of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has reached a high level of maturity in the last few years. Hence, bringing such platforms from closed labs, to day-to-day interactions with humans is important for commercialization of UAVs. One particular human-UAV scenario of interest for this paper is the payload handover scheme, where a UAV hands over a payload to a human upon their request. In this scope, this paper presents a novel real-time human-UAV interaction detection approach, where Long short-term memory (LSTM) based neural network is developed to detect state profiles resulting from human interaction dynamics. A novel data pre-processing technique is presented; this technique leverages estimated process parameters of training and testing UAVs to build dynamics invariant testing data. The proposed detection algorithm is lightweight and thus can be deployed in real-time using off the shelf UAV platforms; in addition, it depends solely on inertial and position measurements present on any classical UAV platform. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a payload handover task between multirotor UAVs and humans. Training and testing data were collected using real-time experiments. The detection approach has achieved an accuracy of 96%, giving no false positives even in the presence of external wind disturbances, and when deployed and tested on two different UAVs.

AB Fifth generation (5G) wireless networks are designed to meet various end-user quality of service (QoS) requirements through high data rates (typically of gigabits per second) and low latencies. Coupled with fog and mobile edge computing, 5G can achieve high data rates, enabling complex autonomous smart city services such as the large deployment of self-driving vehicles and large-scale artificial-intelligence-enabled industrial manufacturing. However, to meet the exponentially growing number of connected IoT devices and irregular data and service requests in both low- and high-density locations, the process of enacting traditional cells supported through fixed and costly base stations requires rethought to enable on-demand mobile access points in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for diversified smart city scenarios. This article envisions a 5G network environment that is supported by blockchain-enabled UAVs to meet dynamic user demands with network access supply. The solution enables decentralized service delivery (drones as a service) and routing to and from end users in a reliable and secure manner. Both public and private blockchains are deployed within the UAVs, supported by fog and cloud computing devices and data centers to provide a wide range of complex authenticated service and data availability. Particular attention is paid to comparing data delivery success rates and message exchange in the proposed solution against traditional UAV-supported cellular networks. Challenges and future research are also discussed with highlights on emerging technologies such as federated learning.

DE visual bug algorithm; entropy search; visual topological maps; internal

AB We introduce a hybrid algorithm for the self-semantic location and autonomous navigation of robots using entropy-based vision and visual topological maps. In visual topological maps the visual landmarks are considered as leave points for guiding the robot to reach a target point (robot homing) in indoor environments. These visual landmarks are defined from images of relevant objects or characteristic scenes in the environment. The entropy of an image is directly related to the presence of a unique object or the presence of several different objects inside it: the lower the entropy the higher the probability of containing a single object inside it and, conversely, the higher the entropy the higher the probability of containing several objects inside it. Consequently, we propose the use of the entropy of images captured by the robot not only for the landmark searching and detection but also for obstacle avoidance. If the detected object corresponds to a landmark, the robot uses the suggestions stored in the visual topological map to reach the next landmark or to finish the mission. Otherwise, the robot considers the object as an obstacle and starts a collision avoidance maneuver. In order to validate the proposal we have defined an experimental framework in which the visual bug algorithm is used by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in typical indoor navigation tasks.

AB Many studies using a laser scanner have been conducted in order to study the environment of vehicles in real time. The method to find the driving area using a two-dimensional lidar sensor is divided into a forward-looking lidar sensor and a downward-looking lidar sensor based on the installation method. A downward-looking lidar sensor looks at the ground, enabling it to recognize kerbs and ditches which are lower than the installation position of the sensor. However, a downward-looking lidar sensor requires pre-processing to find the road boundary. The existing sensor models cannot generate an occupancy grid map without support, as the driving area recognized through a downward-looking lidar sensor forms a circular sector shape from the sensor installation position to the road boundary. This paper proposes a road sensor model that is capable of modelling an occupancy grid. We also propose a method to generate an occupancy grid map more suitable for autonomous vehicles by presenting the occupancy grid map in curvilinear space. The proposed method was validated by an experiment at Hanyang University campus and the quantitative results obtained from that experiment. We also compared this method with three conventional sensor model methods. The experimental results show that our method performs better than the conventional methods do in terms of both visual qualities and metric qualities.

AB Conventional battery management systems (BMSs) for electric vehicles (EVs) are designed in an ad hoc way, causing the supply of EVs to fall behind the market demand. A well-designed and combined hardware-software architecture is essential for the efficient management of a large-scale battery pack that may consists of thousands of battery cells as in Tesla Motors and GM Chevy Volt. We propose a Dependable, Efficient, Scalable Architecture (DESA) that effectively monitors a large number of battery cells, efficiently controls, and reconfigures, if needed, their connection arrangement. DESA supports hierarchical, autonomous management of battery cells, where a global BMS orchestrates a group of local BMSs. A local controller on each local BMS autonomously manages an array of battery cells, and the global controller reconfigures the connectivity of such battery-cell arrays in coordination with the local controllers. Also, DESA allows individual arrays and local BMSs to be selectively powered-off for energy savings. The performance of this energy-saving capability is modeled and evaluated using a Markov chain. Our evaluation results show that DESA effectively tolerates battery-cell failures by an order-of-magnitude-while achieving 7.4 x service cost savings-better than a conventional BMS. This superior performance not only extends the battery life significantly, but also provides the flexibility in supporting diverse electric power demands from a growing number of on-board applications.

AB Nowadays, research on electromagnetic devices increasingly focuses on multiphysics three-dimensional complex systems. However, this kind of simulations require huge computational resources and consequently very high CPU time. Ristagno et al. proposed a level-set based method allowing meshing step savings in any iterative processes (as movement modeling or optimization processes). The level-set method lies in implicit description of moving fronts as described in the study by Osher et al. (1988). Inspired by Raisanen et al., all physical parameters (material properties, supply or armature movement) are implemented by projection of mathematical functions. In this paper, the authors proposes to study and design a new kind of mechanical commutator for DC machines thanks to this coupled method. Indeed, there is a renewed interest in DC machines because they can be suitable for small mobilities. To be noted, small mobility concerns all kind of vehicles (2 wheels-4 wheels-autonomous vehicles such as drones) that have speeds below 50 km/h. However, specifications for traction applications are difficult to achieve for such a rustic machine and requires some modifications. That is why, inspired by usual synchronous machine, the commutator has been redesigned to obtain expected theoretically signal waveform. Furthermore, numerical coupled simulations have been used to design both machine and supply simultaneously. This work has led to the manufacture of a proof of concept and preliminary results are very promising.

AB Automated driving is expected to support a wide range of transportation applications in the near future. However, especially in urban environments, not all streets may be feasible for automated driving which restricts the operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to certain zones. Outside of these zones, AVs may be safely navigated by a leading vehicle that is operated by a human driver using the concept of platooning. In this paper, we consider the service network design problem of a service provider that offers platooning services to AV operators in an urban environment in exchange for monetary compensation. Tactical planning decisions comprise determining the fleet size and scheduling platooning services for a planning horizon such as a season. Those decisions are supported by the quoting of rates to potential customers that reflect their willingness to pay depending on the received service level. A second stage of decisions, made on each day of the planning horizon, comprises the acceptance or rejection of individual platooning requests and the routing of AVs through the platooning services. Since the platooning demand is assumed to be stochastic, we model the problem as a two-stage stochastic integer program. On a real-world based network, we perform computational experiments that indicate potential profits for a platooning service provider and considerable savings for AV operators with different demand characteristics. We further assess the value of considering uncertainty.

AB Thanks to the inherent characteristics of flexible mobility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will inevitably be integrated into 5G/B5G cellular networks to assist remote sensing for real-time assessment and monitoring applications. Most existing UAV-assisted data collection schemes focus on optimizing energy consumption and data collection throughput, which overlook the temporal value of collected data. In this article, we employ Age of Information (AoI) as a performance metric to quantify the temporal correlation among data packets consecutively sampled by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and investigate an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for UAV-assisted IoT networks. We aim to minimize the weighted sum of expected average AoI, propulsion energy of UAV, and the transmission energy at IoT devices, by jointly optimizing the UAV flight speed, hovering locations, and bandwidth allocation for data collection. Considering the system dynamics, the optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process. To cope with the multidimensional action space, we develop a twin-delayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy gradient-based UAV trajectory planning algorithm (TD3-AUTP) by introducing the deep neural network (DNN) for feature extraction. Through simulation results, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the deep Q-network and actorcritic-based algorithms in terms of achievable AoI and energy efficiency.

AB Development of autonomous drive and control technology for vehicles such as a car or a train has become major trends, so there are great needs for a 3D measuring system which detects terrains or obstructs on forward area of the vehicle.
   The authors developed simplified receiver optical system using the line scan type laser scanner which is one of the 3D measurement methods used for laser ranging and mirror scanning. The developed receiver enabled to acquire the 3D data from wide field of view with a common low aspect pixel format 1D detector array and without a receiver scanner mirror. For the operation, the receiver optics spatially resolved the measured area horizontally and measured the whole vertical FOV (Field Of View) without scanning.
   The arrangement of the system was derived by a simulation, then its function and performance were evaluated thorough a laboratory test. As a result of the test, the horizontal spatial resolution of 0.05 deg was obtained, and for the vertical direction the view angle of one pixel was extended 28 times compared to an existing system. With this novel receiver optics, the FOV of a 1D line detector array is expanded to 2D area from its original 1D line shape view. The receiver also enables to obtain 3D information without a receiver scanner mirror and a special pixel format detector with large aspect ratio. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is invariably equipped with a self-contained power supply. If the power consumption of the vehicle is lowered, its working time and performance will be enhanced. For the foregoing purpose, the research aims at developing high-brightness LED headlights to replace conventional high-pressure mercury lamps. In the research, high-brightness LEDs often develop hot-spot problems which result in a huge increase of local temperatures and reduces their service life and brightness. Therefore, the paper presents self-adaptive micro heat spreaders to eliminate the problem of high thermal density, approximately 100 W/cm(2), and to provide constant high-brightness illumination in agreement with the various undersea positions of the AUV. A composite moisture-retaining structure is fabricated using a LIGA-like process and it is incorporated by the self-adaptive micro heat spreader. The unique structure improves the moisture-retaining efficiency of the micro devices in the heat spreader. As a result, the newly-designed heat spreader maintains the original thermal equilibrium and heat dissipation capabilities, eliminates the effect of gravity on the working fluid, and lifts the restraint imposed on the two-phase heat-dissipation device in the dynamic mechanism. With this feature, the new heat spreader is suitable for LED headlights of AUVs. helping reduce power consumption. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd

AB The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for the detection of buried mines is an area of current interest to the Mine CounterMeasures (MCM) community. AUVs offer the advantages of lower cost, stealth, reduced operator risk, and potentially improved coverage rates over more traditional mine hunters. However, AUVs also come with their own set of difficulties, including significant error in navigation and low communication rates with the mother platform and each other. In the case of bistatic detection scenarios, AUVs will therefore have difficulty knowing where exactly in space they are and the trigger time of sources on other platforms, be they ships or other AUVs. However, the potential improvement in detection and coverage rates offered by bistatic sonar concepts makes resolution of these issues a high priority. In this paper, the problems of inaccurate navigation and source timing information are addressed for the Generic Oceanographic Array Technology data set. In this experiment, conducted off Marciana Marina during June 1998, a MIT AUV with a SACLANTCEN acoustic array and acquisition system was used together with a TOPAS parametric sonar to explore issues of buried target detection using AUVs. In this paper, solutions to the navigation and timing problems are proposed which enable the effective use of bistatic synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) concepts for the detection of buried objects in the mid-frequency regime of 2-20 kHz.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are becoming increasingly popular for large number of civil and military applications, such as environmental monitoring, oceanography, archaeology, or mine warfare. Operational safety issue still prevents the exploitation of the full potential of AUVs. Operations of AUVs are limited by constraints including the need to guarantee no collision with manned surface vehicles. To avoid collisions, a solution is to relay surface vessel positions to the AUVs by an underwater communication link. The communication must be optimized to establish a robust and reliable link at various range and depth. Commercial underwater acoustic modems are often dedicated for specific distances and bit rates with performances strongly dependent on the environmental conditions. For the considered application, the modem must be adaptive at the time and frequency selectivity of the channel which is varying according to the operation context. In this work, we propose an adaptive underwater acoustic waveform optimized to exploit at the best the time and frequency diversity the channel. To show the potential gain obtained by using diversity, the performance of the designed modem is evaluated using theoretical and realistic underwater channels. In addition, we propose a method for adapting the waveform based only on the knowledge of the transmission geometry. Finally, the proposed modem is tested to relay Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) picture of an area to AUVs.

ID ORBIT DETERMINATION
AB When the deep space vehicles operate near or above the altitude of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in the space service volume (SSV), the number of visible GNSS satellites becomes insufficient for the GNSS positioning, which leads to the divergence in navigation solution and significantly limits the GNSS applications in SSV. To overcome the issue, this article proposes a constraint navigation filter (CNF) with an orbital dynamics model as a constraint to force the deficient GNSS measurement away from divergence. In the CNF design, a simple orbit propagator (OP) is combined with the GNSS measurements in a tightly coupled integration mode by considering the computational complexity and positioning accuracy. The CNF is implemented as a sequential iteration manner to cope with arbitrary GNSS measurement variations. To testify the performance of the CNF design, the simulation is conducted via a self-developed SSV simulation platform. Two typical SSV scenarios in medium and high orbital plane with GPS and BDS measurements, i.e., medium earth orbit (MEO) and highly-inclined elliptical orbit (HEO) are generated, analyzed and compared respectively. The iterative filter gains as well as the positioning errors are investigated. The simulation results show that the typical GNSS positioning results will diverge with time when the visible GNSS satellites are less than 4, while the proposed CNF method can provide stable navigation solutions even there is only 1 GNSS satellite measurement available.

AB In order to safely and comfortably navigate in the complex urban traffic, it is necessary to make multi-modal predictions of autonomous vehicles for the next trajectory of various traffic participants, with the continuous movement trend and inertia of the surrounding traffic agents taken into account. At present, most trajectory prediction methods focus on prediction on future behavior of traffic agents but with limited, consideration of the response of traffic agents to the future behavior of the ego-agent. Moreover, it can only predict the trajectory of single-type agents, which make it impossible to learn interaction in a complex environment between traffic agents. In this paper, we proposed a graph-based heterogeneous traffic agents trajectory prediction model LSTGHP, which consists of the following three parts: (1) layered spatio-temporal graph module; (2) ego-agent motion module; (3) trajectory prediction module, which can realize multi-modal prediction of future trajectories of traffic agents with different semantic categories in the scene. To evaluate its performance, we collected trajectory datasets of heterogeneous traffic agents in a time-varying, highly dynamic urban intersection environment, where vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians interacted with each other in the scene. It can be drawn from experimental results that our model can improve its prediction accuracy while interacting at a close range. Compared with the previous prediction methods, the model has less prediction error in the trajectory prediction of heterogeneous traffic agents.

AB In the past two decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated their efficacy in supporting both military and civilian applications, where tasks can be dull, dirty, dangerous, or simply too costly with conventional methods. Many of the applications contain tasks that can be executed in parallel, hence the natural progression is to deploy multiple UAVs working together as a force multiplier. However, to do so requires autonomous coordination among the UAVs, similar to swarming behaviors seen in animals and insects. This paper looks at flocking with small fixed-wing UAVs in the context of a model-free reinforcement learning problem. In particular, Peng's Q(lambda) with a variable learning rate is employed by the followers to learn a control policy that facilitates flocking in a leader-follower topology. The problem is structured as a Markov decision process, where the agents are modeled as small fixed-wing UAVs that experience stochasticity due to disturbances such as winds and control noises, as well as weight and balance issues. Learned policies are compared to ones solved using stochastic optimal control (i.e., dynamic programming) by evaluating the average cost incurred during flight according to a cost function. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed learning approach at enabling agents to learn how to flock in a leader-follower topology, while operating in a nonstationary stochastic environment.

AB Tractor-trailer systems have been widely used to increase load transportation capacity. Control of these systems started from motion aid facilities in human-driven vehicles to fully autonomous mobile robots in recent years. In fact, tractor-trailer wheeled robot has been proposed as a modular robotic system in which an actuated mobile robot tows a passive trailer. This is a highly nonlinear underactuated system subjected to nonholonomic kinematic constraints, stable tracking control of which is investigated in this article. To this end, first dynamic model and nonholonomic constraints of the system will be developed in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. Next, feasible reference trajectories for the system are generated considering the system constraints, and a Lyapunov kinematic control law is used to stabilize tracking errors. Then, an adaptive dynamic sliding mode controller is presented to control the wheeled mobile robot in the presence of external disturbances and uncertainties. Appropriate adaptive rules based on vigorous Lyapunov stability theorems are designed to compensate the wheeled mobile robot upper-bounded lumped uncertainties and automatically update controller gains. Next, the experimental setup is described, and the obtained results are presented and discussed. Experimental and comparative results reveal merits of the proposed approach in successful control of the overall system, that is, a wheeled mobile robot towing a passive trailer, leading to asymptotic tracking of reference trajectories.

AB The personalization of autonomous vehicles or advanced driver assistance systems has been a widely researched topic, with many proposals aiming to achieve human-like or driver-imitating methods. However, these approaches rely on an implicit assumption that all drivers prefer the vehicle to drive like themselves, which may not hold true for all drivers. To address this issue, this study proposes an online personalized preference learning method (OPPLM) that utilizes a pairwise comparison group preference query and the Bayesian approach. The proposed OPPLM adopts a two-layer hierarchical structure model based on utility theory to represent driver preferences on the trajectory. To improve the accuracy of learning, the uncertainty of driver query answers is modeled. In addition, informative query and greedy query selection methods are used to improve learning speed. To determine when the driver's preferred trajectory has been found, a convergence criterion is proposed. To evaluate the effectiveness of the OPPLM, a user study is conducted to learn the driver's preferred trajectory in the curve of the lane centering control (LCC) system. The results show that the OPPLM can converge quickly, requiring only about 11 queries on average. Moreover, it accurately learned the driver's favorite trajectory, and the estimated utility of the driver preference model is highly consistent with the subject evaluation score.

ID TRANSITION; REQUESTS; BEHAVIOR; LEVEL
AB Advanced driver assistance systems and conditional automation (SAE level L3) bring full of challenges, central to the human role in such automated driving and are the transitions from automated to manual driving mode: driver monitoring systems should be able to adapt to the detected human state adjusting time given for takeover request. In this study, the human driver's control authority during the transition from the automated system is evaluated by using a large set of sensors, including the galvanic skin response sensor, the speed, and the current sensor of the electric vehicle. The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method detects the driver's readiness to take control during the control authority transition transient stage. Eighteen drivers (8 females and 10 males) between 24 and 65 years of age participate in the experimental evaluation and data collection campaign. Takeover request time analysis evaluates each driver and three driver categories, such as experienced, semiexperienced, and inexperienced, and the questionnaire validates the takeover request time analysis. Galvanic skin response measurements and the LOF approach illustrate successful detection of the driver's status about his/her readiness to take over and regulate the driving task when the transition of driving authority from the automated system is requested in a real road driving scenario. The takeover request time is personalized for each driver, which may improve the current conditional automated driving technologies' penetration and acceptance.

AB Trust is a crucial aspect for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and automated driving systems (ADSs) that maintains humans' acceptance of such functions. However, trust dynamic models describing the human-vehicle relationship rarely exist. To this end, this paper develops a quantitative trust dynamic model of the driver to an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system and applies the proposed model to a trust-based ACC. Driver's trust level is modeled as an objective evaluation index for assessing the individual perceived trustworthiness on automation. Three contributions have been made in this work: 1) a novel quantitative dynamic model describing the driver's trust on ACC is proposed for the first time considering the effects of the driver's taking-over and handing-over operations as well as the steady-state driving scenarios; 2) an improved control barrier function approach with guaranteed system stability and prescribed asymptotic performance is proposed to design the trusted-based ACC, satisfying the state, input, and safety constraints; and 3) a new prescribed performance function that does not require accurate value of the initial condition is proposed to restrict the tracking errors within the predefined asymptotic boundaries, given that the initial value of the trust is hard to obtain. High-fidelity CarSim-based simulations demonstrate the rationality of the proposed trust model and the validity of the proposed control approach.

So far, a variety of works have been devoted on the formation control design for MASs [9?12]. Meng et al. [13] investi
   In this work, the distributed fixed-time formation control problem for a group of second order multi-agent systems is investigated with consideration of collision avoidance, external disturbances, and connected undirected topology. As a stepping stone, a novel distributed fixed-time sliding manifold is proposed to achieve the predefined convergence performance. Furthermore, by combining repulsive potential function with the presented sliding manifold, an adaptive fixed-time formation protocol is developed to guarantee the tracking errors converge to small regions of zero, whilst providing collision avoidance ability for multiple agents. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

AB The joint control problem of the underwater manipulator is addressed in this paper, under the influence of uncertainty factors such as model uncertainty, external disturbance, and manipulator joint lag. In general, for the uncertainty factors, it is usually approximated online, but it is difficult to select a reasonable value for the approximation error boundary, too conservative estimated values would cause chattering problem easily. And the influence of joint lag on the manipulator control should be considered in actual work. Unlike most previous control method, in this paper, the function approximation technique (FAT), which uses the Legendre polynomial, is adopted to approximate the uncertainty factors online. Then, based on the proportion integral differential (PID) sliding manifold with the integral and differential of tracking error, a sliding model PID controller is designed to speed up the response and reduce the effects of joint lag. For the error boundary, the adaptive law is proposed, and it will reduce chattering of the control quantity under the steady state of the system. It was proved that the joint error of the control system is uniformly asymptotic convergence through the stability analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with pool comparison experiments of the underwater manipulator installed in the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).

AB To support an increasing number of commercial multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, robust UAV-to-UAV communication is critical. A promising solution is aerial communication using directional antennas (ACDA), with features like long communication distance, low power consumption, broad bandwidth, and interference rejection. Nevertheless, ACDA requires the automatic alignment of directional antennas, which is not easy to achieve considering the imperfect communication environment unknown in advance and the limited sensing devices onboard due to the constrained payloads and power sources. In this study, the authors design and implement a new ACDA system, including the platform, communication, computing, control, middleware, and interface components. Practical implementation issues for the emergency response application are also considered. The ACDA system features a communication and control co-design, where the communication quality indicator, received signal strength indicator, serves as the goal function for antenna alignment. The solution also features a reinforcement learning-based directional antenna control algorithm that learns the unknown communication environment models. The performance of the ACDA system is verified using simulation studies, field tests, and disaster drills.

AB Decision-making is a crucial cognitive function for various animal species surviving in nature, and it is also a fundamental ability for intelligent agents. To make a step forward in the understanding of the computational mechanism of human-like decision-making, this paper proposes a brain-inspired decision-making spiking neural network (BDM-SNN) and applies it to decision-making tasks on intelligent agents. This paper makes the following contributions: (1) A spiking neural network (SNN) is used to model human decision-making neural circuit from both connectome and functional perspectives. (2) The proposed model combines dopamine and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms to modulate the network learning process, which indicates more biological inspiration. (3) The model considers the effects of interactions among sub-areas in PFC on accelerating the learning process. (4) The proposed model can be easily applied to decision-making tasks in intelligent agents, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying through a window and a UAV avoiding an obstacle. The experimental results support the effectiveness of the model. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning and existing biologically inspired methods, our method contains more biologically-inspired mechanistic principles, has greater accuracy and is faster.

AB In 2003, the Chapopote asphalt flow was discovered in the southern Gulf of Mexico at a depth of 2,900 m. Subsequent exploration has expanded the known extent of asphalt volcanism across abyssal depths in much of this region. Aspects of asphalt flow morphology are analogous to ropy pahoehoe flows known from eruptions of basaltic lava on land, but the timing and formation sequence of asphalt flows has been difficult to infer because limited visibility in the deep ocean makes it challenging to image large areas of the seafloor. Combining data from autonomous under-water vehicle mapping and remotely operated vehicle navigation with powerful optical mosaicking techniques, we assembled georeferenced images of the Chapopote asphalt flows. The largest image captured an area of 3,300 m(2) with over 15 billion pixels and resolved objects at centimeter scale. Augmenting this optical resolution with microbathymetry led to the recognition that very large asphalt pavements exhibiting highly varied morphologies and weathering states comprised a series of at least three separate flow units, one on top of another. The Chapopote asphalt volcano likely erupts during phases of intensified activity separated by periods of reduced activity. After extrusion, chemical and physical changes in the asphalt generate increasing viscosity gradients both along the flow path and between the flow's surface and core. This allows the asphalt to form pahoehoe lava-like shapes and to support dense chemosynthetic communities over timescales of hundreds of years.

AB Surveying the oceans' floors represents at the same time a demanding and relevant task to operators concerned with marine biology, engineering or sunken cultural heritage preservation.
   Scientific researchers and concerned persons combine their effort to pursue optimized solutions aiming at the mapping of underwater areas, the detection of interesting objects and, in case of archeological survey mission, the safeguard of the detected sites.
   Among the typical tools exploited to perform the cited operations the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) represent a validated and reliable technology. These vehicles are typically equipped with properly selected sensors that collect data from the surveyed environment. This data can be employed to detect and recognize targets of interest, such as manmade artifacts located on the seabed, both in an online or offline modality. The adopted approach consists in laying emphasis on the amount of regularity contained in the data, referring to the content of geometrical shapes or textural surface patterns.
   These features can be used to label the environment in terms of more or less interesting areas, where more interesting refers to higher chances of detecting the sought objects (such as man-made objects) in the surveyed area.
   This paper describes the methods developed to fulfill the purposes of mapping and object detection in the underwater scenario and presents some of the experimental results obtained by the implementation of the discussed techniques in the underwater archeology field.

AB This paper presents an innovative control law for distributed dc generation supplied by a fuel cell (FC) (main source) and supercapacitor (auxiliary source). This kind of system is a multiconverter structure and exhibits nonlinear behavior. The operation of a multiconverter structure can lead to interactions between the controls of the converters if they are designed separately. Typically, interactions between converters are studied using impedance criteria to investigate the stability of cascaded systems. In this paper, a nonlinear control algorithm based on the flatness properties of the system is proposed. Flatness provides a convenient framework for meeting a number of performance specifications for the hybrid power source. Using the flatness property, we propose simple solutions to hybrid energy management and stabilization problems. The design controller parameters are autonomous of the operating point; moreover, interactions between converters are taken into account by the controllers, and high dynamics in disturbance rejection is achieved. To validate the proposed method, a hardware system is realized with analog circuits, and digital estimation is accomplished with a dSPACE controller. Experimental results with small-scale devices (a polymer electrolyte membrane FC of 1200 W, 46 A and a supercapacitor module of 100 F, 500 A, and 32 V) in a laboratory corroborate the excellent control scheme during a motor-drive cycle.

AB The emergence of automated mobility-on-demand (AMoD) services in urban regions has underscored crucial issues concerning the sustainable advancement of urban mobility. In particular, the impact of various AMoD implementation strategies in dense, transit-oriented cities has yet to be investigated in a generalized manner. To address this gap, we quantify the effects of AMoD on trip patterns, congestion, and energy and emissions in a dense, transit-oriented prototype city via high-fidelity simulation. We employ an activity- and agent-based framework, with specific demand and supply considerations for both single and shared AMoD rides. Our findings suggest that, in densely populated, transit-oriented cities such as the Tel Aviv metropolis, AMoD contributes to higher congestion levels and increased passenger vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT). However, when AMoD is integrated with public transit systems or introduced alongside measures to reduce household car ownership, it helps alleviate the VKT impact. Furthermore, these combined approaches effectively counter the negative impact of AMoD on public transit ridership. None of the AMoD strategies analyzed in our study reduce the congestion effects of AMoD and all strategies cannibalize active mobility in dense, transit-oriented cities compared to the base case. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals that a policy leading to decreased car ownership proves to be a more efficient measure in curbing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

AB With new technologies and the further development of vehicles, such as the electrification of the powertrain or autonomous driving, the proportion of electronics in vehicles continues to increase. The reliability of these electronic components is of the utmost relevance, especially in safety-relevant areas.One cause of failure of the electronics is thermo-mechanical fatigue of solder joints. This research investigates the thermomechanical fatigue of two-pole components. The attributes of solder joints are studied in high detail and with large number of samples to ensure the statistical significance. Here, the focus is not only on the cor-relations of the attributes themselves, but also on their influence on the damage behavior of the solder joints under temperature cycling load. 3D profilometry and radioscopy are used to investigate in detail the solder joint shape, the component position, the void ratio in the solder and the amount of solder paste applied. The degree of damage to the solder joints is determined using the shear test.This study shows the relationships between solder joint attributes of unstressed devices as well as the change of the attributes under thermal cycling. In addition, the dependencies between shear forces and attributes are investigated. Based on cross-section and X-ray images, an alternative failure limit to the commonly applied 50 % residual shear force, is presented.

AB As National parks are one of the best places of attraction to the tourists, the so-called abode of the animals has to be protected due to the frequent intervention of human beings. On the other hand, the lives of human beings have also to be insulated from the sudden and vulnerable attack of the animals. When it comes to 'life', it becomes a vital factor for humans and animals. Therefore, here arises a dire need to create a system which can protect the life and safety of human beings as well as animals. However, when it comes to mutual safety of both, there has not been an effective solution till date that can practically be implemented in a national park or a sanctuary. In this scenario, 'Video Object Identifying' using Machine Learning Technique has been proven to render promising results in terms of accuracy and performance. Classifying and identifying objects using Customized Convolutional Neural-Network Model in order to detect the multi-class objects (vehicle and animal) become the aim of this present research. In this research, five categories of data sets namely lion, elephant, tiger, car and motorcycle have been used for training and testing. The custom model for video object detection renders with an accuracy of 82% which proves its efficiency in detecting the multi class datasets.

AB This paper proposes an approach to implementing modern technology farming, namely agricultural drones, to help farmers enhance crop spraying efficiency, with a case study on conventional paddy fields in West Kalimantan province, Indonesia. Traditional spraying operations in paddy fields are dangerous as operators must deal with prolonged and frequent exposure to toxic chemicals. In the field experiment, an agricultural drone sprayed fertilizer and pesticides in the 1.5 ha paddy field in Parit Keladi Village, Kubu Raya Regency, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. For fertilizer and pesticide spraying, the impact on the paddy was measured periodically, involving leaves length and tiller number, randomly in the same field. Implementation in the area shows that the ground area coverage by the spraying drone was 6-7.5 m when it had an altitude is 4 m, with four nozzles and a 1.6 l/m spraying flow rate. This study implemented drone technology in the conventional paddy field, one of the famous agricultural commodities in Indonesia and other Asian countries. With this agricultural drone technology approach, we believe that semi-modernization or even modernization of conventional paddy fields can be achieved and accepted by the farmer community to increase the efficiency of farming activities and pave the way for smart farming.

AB This article proposes an environmental cognition method for execution on a graphics processing unit (GPU) oriented single-board computer (SBC). We develop a lightweight environmental cognition system for real-time mapping by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by considering the weight of a cognition system as a tradeoff between the flight time and mapping efficiency and loss of environmental cognition capabilities. Heavy systems consume battery power rapidly while ensuring high computational performance and impacting flight envelope. The proposed method enhances real-time mapping speed by using GPU parallelism and minimizing the data transfer between the embedded central processing unit (CPU) and GPU. Specifically, the point cloud data (PCD) from the light detection and ranging are transformed into global coordinates and voxelized. The occupancies of the voxels are updated in a probabilistic manner to eliminate dynamic noise. The analysis of field tests confirms that the proposed method generated and updated the voxel map in real time without losses. In contrast, Octomap executed on a CPU- or GPU-oriented SBC generated and updated the voxel map in a limited manner, resulting in the significant loss of PCD due to the computational burden or heavy data transfer traffic from GPU to CPU. The proposed method contributes to develop a smart environmental cognition system for the autonomous flight of UAVs.

ID PLACEMENT; AGE
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as aerial base stations to establish wireless communication networks in various challenging scenarios, such as emergency disaster areas and rural areas. Under large regions, the aerial communication networks would require UAVs to form wireless (backhaul) links among each other to provide end-to-end wireless services between two or more ground users (via one or more UAVs). Such UAV backhauling in aerial communication networks may be severely compromised if one or more UAVs are knocked off during the time of operation - it may be due to UAV hardware/software faults, limited battery, malicious attacks, etc. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for learning tasks with large state and continuous action spaces. In this paper, we leverage emerging DRL to achieve reliable backhauling in an aerial communication network that remains functional and supports end-to-end wireless services even under various random and/or targeted UAV node failures. The proposed method (i) maximizes the reliability of UAV backhauling with joint consideration for communication coverage, (ii) learns the complex environment and its dynamics, and (iii) makes 3D positioning decisions for each UAV under the guidance of two deep neural networks. Our performance evaluation reveals that the proposed DRL approach outperforms the baseline method in terms of wireless coverage and network reliability against UAV failures.

AB This article introduces a novel vision-based guidance algorithm to make a camera-equipped drone capable of collision-free entrance to a building through its windows. To eliminate the reliance on any extra sensor (ultrasonic range finders, lidars, depth sensors, stereo cameras, etc.), which are frequently used in the literature, we introduce an image-based optimization scheme to detect the exact boundaries of a window portal section. The optimization is based on a common facade segmentation technique, referred to as projected profiles, and relies on the assumption that the window portal is one of the least light-reflective segments in a facade structure. In combination with a visual tracking algorithm, our method elevates the tracking performance to avoid any guidance failures due to tracking drifts. As a result, the drone gets a rich extent of navigation data during the flight enabling it to reliably enter through the window. The window portal detection is evaluated using two online facade datasets, suggesting a 75% success rate in finding the correct entrance passage. Also, it is shown that the visual tracking performance is improved up to 58% in the specific case of tracking an entrance portal. The efficacy and real-time capability of the overall vehicle guidance are experimentally demonstrated using a rotorcraft micro aerial vehicle.

AB Efficient multi-sensor fusion is crucial to provide accurate pose estimates for navigating various next-generation autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars, personal air vehicles, urban air mobilities, and electronic vertical take-off and landing aircraft with respect to a unified global reference frame. The integration of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) provides globally uniform coordinate information, and the Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) gives stable and accurate local pose estimates. However, the error of the integrated INS/GNSS increases rapidly in GNSS-challenged environments, and the VIO system suffers from the long-term error accumulation. To cope with these difficulties, this paper proposes a new tightly coupled Visual-Inertial-GNSS (VIG) system to achieve robust and drift-free pose estimation utilising GNSS raw measurements, image features, and inertial measurements. A novel compressed state constraint Kalman Filter (CSCKF) is formulated to combine time-propagated feature measurements and differential GNSS observations to aid INS. Compared to the conventional integrated navigation systems, the proposed CSCKF-based VIG system is advantageous in maintaining the minimum number of states without unnecessary state augmentation and no loss of performance. The proposed system is evaluated by field experiments in different GNSS availability situations. The results show that accuracy is improved significantly in GNSS-degraded environments compared to that of the conventional systems.

AB In this paper, an adaptable fuzzy control mechanism for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to manipulate its mechanical actuators is provided. The mission (landing) for the UAV is defined to track (land on) an object that is detected by a deep learning object detection algorithm. The inputs of the controller are the location and speed of the UAV that have been calculated based on the location of the detected object. Two separate fuzzy controllers are proposed to control the UAV's motor throttle and its roll and pitch over the mission and landing time. Fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is an intelligent controller that can be used to compensate for the non-linearity behaviour of the UAV by designing a specific fuzzy rule base. These rules will be utilized to adjust the control parameters during the mission and landing period in runtime. To add the effect of the ground for tuning the FLC membership function over the landing operation, a computational flow dynamic (CFD) modeling has been investigated. The proposed techniques is evaluated on MATLAB/Simulink simulation platform and real environment. Statistical analysis of the UAV location reported during stabilization and landing process, on both simulation and real platform, show that the proposed technique outperforms the similar state-of-art control techniques for both mission and landing control.

AB This paper presents a novel model-based observer algorithm to address issues associated with nonlinear suspension system state estimation using interacting multiple model unscented Kalman Filters (IMMUKF) under various road excitation. Due to the fact that practical working condition is complex for the suspension system, e.g. additional load. Meanwhile, the changed sprung mass parameter will induce model changed of suspension system, and it can lead to state transition between various models. To tackle the mentioned issue, the models of road profile and suspension system are first established to describe the nonlinear suspension dynamics. Then, considering the variation of sprung mass under various movement conditions, an unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm is proposed to identify the sprung mass. Based on the interacting multiple model (IMM) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) theory, a novel IMMUKF observer is developed to estimate the movement state of suspension system. The stability conditions for the proposed observer is calculated using the stochastic stability theory. Finally, simulations and validations are performed on a quarter vehicle suspension system under various ISO road excitations, to validate the UKF and IMMUKF algorithms for acquiring suspension system states, and results illustrate that the maximum root mean square error of state estimation for the proposed algorithm is less than 7.5 %.

AB This paper presents an approach to planning under uncertainty in resource-constrained environments. We describe our novel method for online plan modification and execution monitoring, which augments an existing plan with pre-computed plan fragments in response to observed resource availability. Our plan merging algorithm uses causal structure to interleave actions, creating solutions online using observations of the true state without introducing significant computational cost. Our system monitors resource availability, reasoning about the probability of successfully completing the goals. We show that when the probability of completing a plan decreases, by removing low-priority goals our system reduces the risk of plan failure, increasing mission success rate. Conversely, when resource availability allows, by including additional goals our system increases reward without adversely affecting success rate.
   We evaluate our approach using the example domain of long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions, in which a vehicle spends months at sea with little or no opportunity for intervention. We compare the performance to a state-of-the-art oversubscription planner. Planning within such domains is challenging because significant resource usage uncertainty means it is computationally infeasible to calculate the optimal strategy in advance. We also evaluate the applicability of our plan merging algorithm to existing IPC domains, presenting a discussion of the domain characteristics which favour the use of our approach.

AB Channel estimation is crucial to beamforming techniques in directional millimetre wave (mmWave) communications, which is generally designed based on channel state information static. However, due to the Doppler effect caused by the mobility of users, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, high-speed trains and autonomous vehicles, the mmWave channel is changing rapidly. Spatial channel covariance, defined by long-term statistic information of channels, is a promising solution to reduce channel estimation frequency and can be used to design hybrid precoders. In this paper, we first proposed a highly mobile hybrid mmWave multi-user (MU) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system based on transition probabilities which can represent moving action of the MU. Secondly, we investigate compressive sensing based spatial channel covariance estimation based on the proposed dynamic system. We then propose a dynamic covariance forward-backward pursuit (DCFBP) algorithm which introduces forward and backward mechanisms to reconstruct the Hermitian sparse covariance matrix. We further explore the constructed MU sensing matrix quality for conventional sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. The updated sparse Bayesian learning (Updated-SBL) algorithm is developed to reduce the total squared coherence of a constructed sensing matrix with updated receive precoder. Numerical analysis demonstrates the proposed DCFBP method outperforms the benchmark methods. The total squared coherence of the proposed Updated-SBL algorithm is dramatically reduced. and the superiority of this algorithm is validated compared with other benchmark methods with comparable computation complexity.

AB Insect- and bird-size drones micro air vehides (MAV) that can perform autonomous flight in natural and man-made environments are now an active and well-integrated research area. MAVs nornially operate at a low speed in a Reynolds number regime of 10(4)-10(5) or lower, in which most flying animals of insects, birds and bats fly, and encounter unconventional challenges in generating sufficient aerodynamic forces to stay airborne and in controlling flight autonomy to achieve complex manoeuvres. Flying insects that power and control flight by flapping wings are capable of sophisticated aerodynamic force production and precise, agile manoeuvring, through an integrated system consisting of wings to generate aerodynamic force, musdes to move the wings and a control system to modulate power output from the muscles. In this article, we give a selective review on the state of the art of biomechanics in bioinspired flight systems in terms of flapping and flexible wing aerodynamics, flight dynamics and stability, passive and active mechanisms in stabilization and control, as well as flapping flight in unsteady environments. We further highlight recent advances in biomimetics of flapping-wing MAVs with a specific focus on insect-inspired wing design and fabrication, as well as sensing systems. This article is part of the themed issue 'Moving in a moving medium: new perspectives on flight'.

TI Continuous-Time Three-Dimensional Mapping for Micro Aerial Vehicles with
   a Passively Actuated Rotating Laser Scanner
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The ability to generate accurate and detailed three-dimensional (3D) maps of a scene from a mobile platform is an essential technology for a wide variety of applications from robotic navigation to geological surveying. In many instances, the best vantage point is from above, and as a result, there is a growing demand for low-altitude mapping solutions from micro aerial vehicles such as small quadcopters. Existing lidar-based 3D airborne mapping solutions rely on GPS/INS solutions for positioning, or focus on producing relatively low-fidelity or locally focused maps for the purposes of autonomous navigation. We have developed a general-purpose airborne 3D mapping system capable of continuously scanning the environment during flight to produce accurate and dense point clouds without the need for a separate positioning system. A key feature of the system is a novel passively driven mechanism to rotate a lightweight 2D laser scanner using the rotor downdraft from a quadcopter. The data generated from the spinning laser is input into a continuous-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solution to produce an accurate 6 degree-of-freedom trajectory estimate and a 3D point cloud map. Extensive results are presented illustrating the versatility of the platform in a variety of environments including forests, caves, mines, heritage sites, and industrial facilities. Comparison with conventional surveying methods and equipment demonstrates the high accuracy and precision of the proposed solution.

TI Circumventing the Feature Association Problem in SLAM
SO IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB In autonomous applications, a vehicle requires reliable estimates of its location and information about the world around it. To capture prior knowledge of the uncertainties in a vehicle's motion response to input commands and sensor measurements, this fundamental task has been cast as probabilistic Simultaneous Localization and Map building (SLAM). SLAM has been investigated as a stochastic filtering problem in which sensor data is compressed into features, which are consequently stacked in a vector, referred to as the map.
   Inspired by developments in the tracking literature, recent research in SLAM has recast the map as a Random Finite Set (RFS) instead of a random vector, with huge mathematical consequences. With the application of recently formulated Finite Set Statistics (FISST), such a representation circumvents the need for fragile feature management and association routines, which are often the weakest component in vector based SLAM algorithms.
   This tutorial demonstrates that true sensing uncertainty lies not only in the spatial estimates of a feature, but also in its existence. This gives rise to sensor probabilities of detection and false alarm, as well as spatial uncertainty values. By re-addressing the fundamentals of SLAM under an RFS framework, it will be shown that it is possible to estimate the map in terms of true feature number, as well as location. The concepts are demonstrated with short range radar, which detects multiple features, but yields many false measurements. Comparison of vector, and RFS SLAM algorithms shows the superior robustness of RFS based SLAM to such realistic sensing defects.

AB A conventional spraying mode and a fully autonomous fruit tree operation mode using a model DJ T30 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were used to control aphids control on elm trees and to clarify the distribution of droplets in elm trees sprayed by a UAV. The effects of six aviation spray adjuvants on elm canopy droplet deposition and aphid control were evaluated. ImageJ software was used to analyze and measure the droplet density and deposition of water sensitive paper in two modes; this was done to calculate the droplet uniformity, depositional penetration, and droplet penetration, and to verify the aphid control effect. The results showed that the droplet density increased by 79.7%-100.7% in the upper canopy and 0-394.1% in the lower canopy without adjuvants in the fully autonomous fruit tree operation mode. The upper canopy deposits increased by 65.7%-179.3%, and the lower canopy increased by 0-152.8%. When adjuvants were added, the droplet density in the upper canopy increased by 49.7-56.1% using Jiexiaofeng (JXF), and the lower canopy increased by 138.2%-177.8% using JXF, 45.8%-141.3% using Beidatong (BDT), 45.5%-92.9% using Gongbei (GB), 0-93.5% using Maisi (MS), and 0-95.2% using Manniu (MN). The deposits of the upper canopy increased by 888.1-1 154.2% using JXF, 0-1 298.3% using MN, 0-343.9% using BDT, 0-422.5% using GB, 0-580.3% using MS. The lower canopy increased by 746.4%-1 426.0% using JXF, 226.2%-231.0% using BDT, 435.8%-644.0% using GB, 255.0%-322.4% using MS, and 249.3%-360.0% using MN. When JXF was added, the droplet uniformity, droplet penetration and depositional penetration were better than when using other adjuvants. The effects of JXF, BDT and GB in controlling aphids was significantly better than other adjuvants (p<0.05). The following control effects were observed; 94.1% with JXF, 93.1% with BDT, and 93.3% with GB after 3 d of application, and 97.9% with JXF, 95.6% with BDT, and 97.1% with GB after 7 d of application. At the same time, the application of the fully autonomous fruit tree operation mode and JXF can effectively improve the density and deposits, which will produce a superposition optimization effect. Our study focuses on the prevention and control of elm aphid infestations based on the operation mode of a UAV and aviation spray adjuvants, which can provide a baseline for the control of diseases and insect pests using UAVs in agriculture and forestry.

AB This paper investigates the issue of searching and geolocating a radio frequency (RF) emitter with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a rich scattering environment. The absence of knowledge of the characteristics of the target RF signals, the ground-to-air channels, and the potential geographical distribution of the RF emitter makes efficient trajectory planning (TP) and geolocating intractable. Since the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the signal captured by the UAV changes across the search area, state-of-the-art TP is inapplicable due to the assumption of a single problem domain, according to the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. In contrast, we develop a cognitive multi-stage search and geolocation (CMSG) framework, which adjusts the adopted TP algorithms in various search stages. In the stage with extremely-low SNRs, a random-walk-based TP is proposed to avoid meaningless detours. For stages with higher SNRs, the TP follows policies optimized by a novel search method based on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and reinforcement learning. To alleviate the impairment of unreliable DOA estimations, empirical emitter position estimations are exploited to find the best flight directions. Simulation results confirm the advantages of the proposed CMSG over various baselines in lowering both failure rate and time consumption.

AB This article deals with predictive maintenance of infrastructure objects, focusing on the inspection of bridges. To achieve this goal, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) place measuring units for data collection at different points of the bridge. This work deals with the question of how these measuring units can be found and removed by them later. For this purpose, a magnetic localization method based on the scalar triangulation and ranging (STAR) method is presented. In contrast to the STAR method, which only detects the center of a magnetic target, a modified version called scalar ranging with improved orientation detection (SRIOD) is implemented here, where the orientation of the magnetic target can also be detected. This is essential information if the UAV is to grab the measuring unit with a robotic arm. In this regard, two identical permanent magnets (PMs) are integrated into the measuring unit, whose gradient tensor contraction of the magnetic flux density distribution has a directed asymmetric surface when considering the contours of constant values. This creates a magnetic invisible reference plane that can be detected with a magnetic gradiometer. The method is verified both in simulation and experimentally in a laboratory setup.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided communications is a promising emerging technology that will be adopted in the next generation communication networks. In this paper, a number of advanced cooperative UAV-aided communication solutions is proposed and evaluated, which considerably improve the performance of traditional terrestrial networks. Specifically, two generalized multi-UAV-selection schemes are introduced, depending on whether a direct link between the source and the destination is available or not. Once the UAVs have been selected, they may retransmit the source message to the destination using distributed space-time coding, or, in the presence of channel state information, distributed beamforming. A number of metrics to evaluate the performance on a realistic channel model was adopted, including the end-to-end outage probability (OP), the so-called goodput, and the average number of path estimations, as well as the total UAV communications power consumption. Exact expressions for the OP were obtained in terms of finite sums. Moreover, convenient closed-form expressions for the asymptotic OP were derived, valid for large numbers of UAVs, which are also very accurate for few UAVs. All results were compared with numerical simulations, which clearly depict the performance improvement induced by the proposed schemes as well as the impact of various system and channel parameters to the performance.

AB Finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) provide a powerful approach to compute time-varying analogs of invariant manifolds in unsteady fluid flow fields. These manifolds are useful to visualize the transport mechanisms of passive tracers advecting with the flow. However, many vehicles and mobile sensors are not passive, but are instead actuated according to some intelligent trajectory planning or control law; for example, model predictive control and reinforcement learning are often used to design energy-efficient trajectories in a dynamically changing background flow. In this work, we investigate the use of FTLE on such controlled agents to gain insight into optimal transport routes for navigation in known unsteady flows. We find that these controlled FTLE (cFTLE) coherent structures separate the flow field into different regions with similar costs of transport to the goal location. These separatrices are functions of the planning algorithm's hyper-parameters, such as the optimization time horizon and the cost of actuation. Computing the invariant sets and manifolds of active agent dynamics in dynamic flow fields is useful in the context of robust motion control, hyperparameter tuning, and determining safe and collision-free trajectories for autonomous systems. Moreover, these cFTLE structures provide insight into effective deployment locations for mobile agents with actuation and energy constraints to traverse the ocean or atmosphere.

AB The use of thermal sensors is increasing in response to dealing with the problems of the visible light spectrum. These sensors measure the temperature of the object and convert it to some readable output. There is a diverse range of temperature sensors, and different sensors are used for different purposes. The choice of the sensor depends on the cost of the sensor, resolution, and level of accuracy. For instance, an IR camera combined with the RGB sensor can produce better human activity recognition. However, increase the cost of the machine. For some applications, a high resolution is not required and a low-cost sensor can satisfy the need. In this survey, we discuss the employment of thermal sensors in HVAC systems, vehicle, and manufacturing industries as they are heavily used in these industries. We reported the types of available thermal sensors and the sensors commonly used in each industry. This is followed by a comprehensive review of the application-specific methods. In the end, we may say that the selection of the thermal sensor has much importance as well as the choice of the suitable algorithms according to the given conditions to avail the maximum accuracy in our results.

AB Autonomous tracking of dynamic targets by the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging problem that has practical applications in many scenarios. In this context, a fundamental aspect that must be addressed has to do with the position estimation of aerial robots and a target to control the flight formation. For non-cooperative targets, their position must be estimated using the on-board sensors. Moreover, for estimating the position of UAVs, global position information may not always be available (GPS-denied environments). This work presents a cooperative visual-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system that allows a team of aerial robots to autonomously follow a non-cooperative target moving freely in a GPS-denied environment. One of the contributions of this work is to propose and investigate the use of a target-centric SLAM configuration to solve the estimation problem that differs from the well-known World-centric and Robot-centric SLAM configurations. In this sense, the proposed approach is supported by theoretical results obtained from an extensive nonlinear observability analysis. Additionally, a control system is proposed for maintaining a stable UAV flight formation with respect to the target as well. In this case, the stability of control laws is proved using the Lyapunov theory. Employing an extensive set of computer simulations, the proposed system demonstrated potentially to outperform other related approaches.

AB Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), which have been popular in the military context, have recently attracted attention of many researchers because of their potential civilian applications. However, before UAVs can fly in civilian airspace, they need to be able to navigate safely to their goal while maintaining separation with other manned and unmanned aircraft during the transit. Algorithms for autonomous navigation of UAVs require access to accurate information about the state of the environment in order to perform well. However, this information is often uncertain and dynamically changing. In this paper, a Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) based algorithm is proposed to find the optimal UAV trajectory in presence of moving obstacles, referred to as Intruder Aircraft (lAs), with unknown trajectories. The solution uses an efficient Bayesian formalism with a notion of cell weighting based on Distance Based Value Function (DBVF). The assumption is that the UAV is equipped with the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and is provided with the position of lAs either via the ADS-B or ground based radar. However, future trajectories of the lAs are unknown to the UAV. The proposed method is verified using simulations performed on multiple scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in solving the trajectory planning problem of the UAVs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

DE Semantic segmentation; Geodesic distance; Classification; Context
ID MULTICLASS
AB Scene understanding is an important class of computer vision problems that is an enabler for a wide variety of applications such as advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles or mobile assistive robots. Semantic segmentation is one of the common ways to address this problem. Unlike the more standard approaches based on a probabilistic graphical model, in this paper we present a two stage classification framework based on the concept of pixel neighborhoods. In the first stage, every pixel is classified based on its appearance. The output of the first classifier in a specific region around every pixel, which we call the pixel neighborhood, is summarized by a novel voting histogram feature and given as input to a second classifier. We show how to define the pixel neighborhood by using the geodesic distance in a way that it is able to capture both local image context as well as more global object relations.
   We perform a quantitative and qualitative evaluation on six well-known and challenging datasets and show that our model is able to natively handle both 2D and 3D data. We compare our method to several baselines and multiple closely related methods and show state-of-the-art performance. We also present a real world application of our method in a system that automatically detects parking spaces from a moving vehicle in real time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   analysis; loosely coupled models; uncertainty
AB Problem, research strategy, and findings: Planners today are confronted with unprecedented uncertainty in economic, political, and technological environments, especially at the regional scale. An increasingly common approach to addressing such uncertainty is exploratory scenario analysis. To provide new insights into the methods and utility of such analyses, we conducted a scenario analysis of the Baltimore (MD)-Washington (DC) region by engaging a technical advisory committee and exercising a loosely coupled suite of advanced transportation, land use, and environmental impact models. Our analysis suggests the future is indeed uncertain and may evolve into plausible but quite different alternative scenarios. Key drivers of these scenarios include fuel prices; the rate and form of technological change, especially in the transportation sector; and the restrictiveness of land use controls. Takeaway for practice: By developing exploratory scenario analyses and analyzing them using advanced computational models, planners can gain insights into how best to address uncertain development trends, such as how and to what degree planners can influence the adoption of electric and automated vehicles, how and where to guide development patterns through land use controls, and how best to respond to variation in the cost of energy, which could have dramatic impacts on the future sustainability of cities and regions. Although such scenario analyses cannot in most circumstances provide unambiguous robust or contingent policy prescriptions, they can provide important insights for raising public awareness and provide the foundation for further policy evaluation.

AB Associated with multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems, the optical sensors with short working range can be reconsidered, which can provide more detailed and more comprehensive descriptions of the seabed than acoustical sensors and can assist in communications among neighbouring AUVs. The typical achievable tasks for these multi-AUV systems equipped with optical sensors mainly include to study the seabed sediments, search small objects at the seabed, collect colourful biological samples, and monitor the underwater infrastructures, etc. The purpose of this research is to develop a new coordination strategy to make a fleet of AUVs build a geometrical pattern suitable for optical sensing at the seabed. This new coordination strategy includes two parts: designing a predefined pattern (a planar pyramid pattern) and proposing an associated formation control method (an improved asynchronous discrete consensus algorithm with a time-variant digraph via the displacement-based control, inspired from the fish schooling problem) to update the trajectories of AUVs in real-time and reach this pattern from a disorder distribution. Before it is tested at sea with six AUVs, the performance of this new coordination method is verified in the simulation environments constructed in Blender and Matlab respectively. The simulation results show the good convergence of this new coordination method.

AB The sensor faults and the communication burden are the core issues in fields of the intelligent maritime search control. In this paper, a robust adaptive event-triggered control strategy is presented for the underactuated surface vessel-unmanned aerial vehicles (USV-UAVs) cooperative system to implement the maritime parallel search mission. The proposed scheme is comprised of two parts, i.e., the three-dimensional (3D) search guidance principle and the cooperative formation control law. The developed guidance principle can generate the reference signals for the USV and UAVs, which the maneuvering characteristics of the heterogeneous agents are considered at the waypoints. Linked with the guidance term, a robust adaptive event-triggered control algorithm is designed for the cooperative system by fusing the dynamic event-triggered mechanism and sensor-tolerant technique. The dynamic triggered threshold is constructed on basis of the state error rather than the predefined parameters. Besides, the constrains of the sensor faults and the model uncertainties are tackled by constructing the adaptive parameter and robust neural damping term. Through the Lyapunov theorem, the semi-global uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability is guaranteed for all state variables. Finally, the advantages of the proposed scheme are evaluated on simulation platform, exhibiting the good tracking accuracy and tolerant performance in presence of the external disturbances.

AB Increasingly complex and long-range donor organ allocation routes coupled with implementation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have prompted investigations of the conditions affecting organs once packaged for shipment. Our group has previously demonstrated that different modes of organ transport exert unique environmental stressors, in particular vibration. Using a mouse heart transplant model, we demonstrated that vibrational forces exert tangible, cellular effects in the form of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cytoskeletal derangement. Functionally, these changes translated into accelerated allograft loss. Notably, administration of an apoptosis inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, helped to ameliorate the detrimental cellular and functional effects of mechanical vibration in a dose-dependent manner. These findings constitute one of the first reports of the negative impact of transit environment on transplant outcomes, a contributing mechanism underpinning this effect, and a potential agent to prophylax against this process. Given current limitations in measuring donor organ transit environments in situ, further study is required to better characterize the impact of transport environment and to potentially improve the care of donor organs during shipment. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement: We show that apoptosis inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, ameliorated transport-related vibrational stress in murine heart transplants, which presents a potential therapeutic or preservation solution additive for future use in transporting donor organs.

ID UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones presently are enhanced with miniature sensors that can provide information relative to their environment. As such, they can detect changes in temperature, orientation, altitude, geographical location, electromagnetic fluctuations, lighting conditions, and more. Combining this information properly can help produce advanced environmental awareness; thus, the drone can navigate its environment autonomously. Wireless communications can also aid in the creation of drone swarms that, combined with the proper algorithm, can be coordinated towards area coverage for various missions, such as search and rescue. Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is the field that studies how drones, independently or in swarms, can cover an area of interest efficiently. In the current work, a CPP algorithm is proposed for a swarm of drones to detect points of interest and collect information from them. The algorithm's effectiveness is evaluated under simulation results. A set of characteristics is defined to describe the coverage radius of each drone, the speed of the swarm, and the coverage path followed by it. The results show that, for larger swarm sizes, the missions require less time while more points of interest can be detected within the area. Two coverage paths are examined here-parallel lines and spiral coverage. The results depict that the parallel lines coverage is more time-efficient since the spiral increases the required time by an average of 5% in all cases for the same number of detected points of interest.

ID CHALLENGES; DESIGN
AB We propose a novel distributed beamforming framework for UAVs, called SABRE, wherein airborne transmitters synchronize their operations for data communication with target receivers. SABRE chooses the best-suited subset of transmitters that maximizes user-defined QoS, considering relative distances from receivers, traffic characteristics, cumulative SNR desired at the receiver, and individual SNR estimated for each link. This paper makes three main contributions: (i) It shows how to achieve distributed beamforming in challenging, aerial hovering conditions by accurately synchronizing start-times and eliminating relative clock offsets. (ii) It proposes an algorithm with polynomial complexity that groups transmitters and chooses the receiver, maximizing the number of satisfied receivers in each round. (iii) It experimentally validates the concept of aerial beamforming in a testbed composed of four DJI-M100 UAVs in realistic outdoor environments. We follow this up with at-scale emulation involving beamforming with multiple candidate UAV transmitters in Colosseum, the world's largest RF emulator. SABRE keeps the overall network frame error rate below 10% with a probability of 0.95 and manifests a 40% improvement in meeting user QoS thresholds over classical resource allocation methods. From a community viewpoint, the beamforming code, UAV interfacing designs, and the Colosseum container will be released publicly, allowing further independent investigations.

AB Immersive technology is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool for enhancing the digital transformation in transportation to deal with the complexity, high cost, and uncertainty in the dynamic traffic environment. In this study, we investigate the innovations induced by immersive technologies for transportation fields. The literature (153 articles) published over the past five years were collected and analyzed systematically, pertaining to the lifecycle model of the product-service system, i.e., design, development, evaluation, and applications. The review indicated that immersive systems and scenarios have been developed and applied in various transportation areas, such as air traffic management, autonomous vehicles, railways, highways, and vehicle maintenance. Additionally, the review indicated that immersive technology brings significant benefits to the transportation field and induces significant changes in the interactions between humans and the physical world. These changes are expected to induce digital transformation in several aspects, e.g., digital testbeds for theoretical models and algorithms, immersive and safe digital environments for user studies, and digital training. Based on the review, a novel framework and conceptual lifecycle model of developing immersive technology-enabled digital transformation in transportation is proposed, a novel evaluation matrix for measuring the immersive experience level is established. The results provide essential references for practitioners to apply immersive technology and guidance regarding potential future research directions.

AB When an aerial robot carries a bulky and heavy payload, it suffers from a wavering effect because of the large inertia of the heavy mass of a payload, which can cause a serious crash or fall to the ground. We propose the path-planning algorithm for an aerial robot to pass a narrow space while transporting a bulky payload to resolve the issue. Unlike the existing conventional path-planning method that treats the payload as a point-mass, this paper generates the trajectory considering the shape of a payload and passage size of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). First, we design a map-generation algorithm with the Voronoi diagram by exploiting the fact that the UAV has an ellipsoidal shape in transport operation with a bulky object. The modified map data can be exploited for the global path generation such as A* path-planner. For the rotational motion of the UAV, the heading angle was determined by considering the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse. The global path was optimized based on the elastic band optimization algorithm to solve the jerky motion on the trajectory. Through the simulations and experiments, we validate the efficiency of our algorithm in the environment with the narrow space. Experimental results showed that the proposed path-planning algorithm could be used for safe aerial transportation in realistic environments.

The design objective of the surrogate bicycle is to produce similar optical appearance and radar response in a 76-78 GHz band as a real bicycle selected based on its popularity (in 2014) in the United States. In addition, the surrogate bicyclist needs to be able to withstand the impact of the test vehicle traveling at 30 mph (or 48 kph) should it fail to detect the surrogate target. Our design approach differs from the only other surrogate bicyclist developed by a European research group in that our surrogate bicyclist produces similar radar response as a real bicyclist over the entire 360 degrees of azimuth angles. Our design approach began with experimental characterizing the radar cross section (RCS) patterns of real bikes of different types as well as identifying RCS contributions of different parts on a bike via accurate simulations, which were also used for design optimizations. The RCS performance of the fabricated surrogate bicycle was verified via 360 degrees azimuth pattern measurement comparison with a real bicycle. Its physical performance was tested via actual field testing on a test track with two commercial vehicles equipped with AEB and PCS systems.

AB Although unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have been extensively researched and applied to many typical scenarios, high-performance autonomous control is still an open problem. One of their major problem stems from the difficulty in constructing a sufficient accurate and sufficient simple control-oriented dynamics model. Owing to the highly complicated physical mechanisms of hydrodynamics, USV systems possess strong nonlinearities and coupling, whichmake it exceptionally difficult to develop an accurate model structure. In real applications, extensively existing uncertainties, such as external disturbances due to wind, wave, current, and measurement noise in the onboard sensor, will unavoidably influence identification precision with respect to the parameters in the USV's model. Thus, in this paper, a new kind of nonlinear modeling scheme-the active modeling enhanced quasi-linear parameter-varying (qLPV) model-is proposed for a water-jet propulsion USV system. First, a qLPV-structured model is derived by simplifying the real dynamics model, which has a simple quasi-linear structure and can approximate the nonlinearities of the hydrodynamics. Subsequently, a nonlinear version of the Kalman filter-based active modeling method is proposed to provide online estimates of the unstructured model to eliminate the errors due to the structure inaccuracy between the qLPV-structured model and the real system. Finally, the newly proposed modeling scheme is tested on a real USV system and its superiority is shown through comparisons to some other traditional modeling methods.

AB A great amount of effort has been devoted to the study on Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) due to an increasing demand for their use in a variety of maritime applications. Real-time autonomous collision avoidance system is the pivotal issue here, in which reliable collision risk detection and the adoption of a plausible collision avoidance maneuver play a key role. Existing studies on this subject seldom integrate the COLREGS guidelines, however, and in order to ensure maritime safety, it is of fundamental importance that they should be obeyed at all times. In this paper, we presented an approach to real-time collision avoidance that complies with the COLREGS rules for USV. The Evidential Reasoning (ER) theory is employed to evaluate the collision risks with obstacles encountered and trigger a prompt warning of a potential collision. Then, we extend and adopt the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) algorithm so as to determine a collision avoidance maneuver that is COLREGS compliant. The proposed approach takes into consideration the fact that other obstacles also sense their surroundings and react accordingly, conforming to a practical marine situation when making a decision concerning collision-free motion. A number of simulations have been conducted in order to confirm the validity of the theoretic results obtained. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Micro aerial vehicles (MAV) are restricted in their size and weight, making the design of sensory systems for these vehicles challenging. We designed a small and lightweight continuously rotating 3D laser scanner - allowing for environment perception in a range of 30 m in almost all directions. This sensor is well suited for applications such as 3D obstacle detection, 6D motion estimation, localisation, and mapping.
   Reliably perceiving obstacles in the surroundings of the MAY is a prerequisite for fully autonomous flights in complex environments. Due to varying shape and reflectance properties of objects, not all obstacles are perceived in every 3D laser scan (one half rotation of the scanner). Especially farther away from the MAV, multiple scans may be necessary in order to adequately detect an obstacle. In order to increase the probability of detecting obstacles, we aggregate acquired scans over short periods of time in an egocentric grid-based map. We register acquired scans against this local map to estimate the motion of the MAY and to consistently update the map.
   In experiments, we show that our approaches to pose estimation and laser scan matching allow for reliable aggregation of 3D scans over short periods of time, sufficiently accurate to improve detection probability without causing inaccuracies in the estimation of the position of detected obstacles. Furthermore, we assess the probability of detecting different types of obstacles in varying distances from the MAY.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as users to access the cellular network over the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum form a promising solution to guarantee high data rate transmission. Due to the narrow beams in the mmWave systems and the high mobility of the UAVs, a key challenge of mmWave UAV communications is to design efficient and seamless handover schemes, especially in windy scenarios. In this paper, we first investigate the signaling interaction procedure of the hard handover strategy in 3GPP 5G new radio (NR) standard. For providing better connectivity and lower outage probability, a soft handover scheme named double-beam soft handover (DB-SH) is designed for the mmWave UAV system. Considering the dynamic wind effects, we formulate a random walk (RW) model for quantifying the angle offsets of the beams at the UAVs, as the orientations of the UAVs suffer from the fluctuations over time due to the dynamic wind load. Considering the RW model and the beam training, we further analyze the outage probabilities of the 3GPP 5G NR hard handover scheme and the DB-SH scheme for the mmWave UAV communication systems. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of the presented theoretical analysis which provides insights for mmWave UAV system designs.

AB There is a great demand for vision-based robotics solutions that can operate using Global Positioning Systems (GPS), but are also robust against GPS signal loss and gyroscope failure. This paper investigates the estimation and tracking control in application to a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). A full state observer for the estimation of VTOL-UAV motion parameters (attitude, angular velocity, position, and linear velocity) is proposed on the Lie Group of SE2 (3) x R-3 = SO (3) x R-9 with almost globally exponentially stable closed-loop error signals. Thereafter, a full state observer-based controller for the VTOL-UAV motion parameters is proposed on the Lie Group with a guaranteed almost global exponential stability. The proposed approach produces good results without the need for angular and linear velocity measurements (without a gyroscope and GPS signals) utilising only a set of known landmarks obtained by a vision-aided unit (monocular or stereo camera). The equivalent quaternion representation on S-3 x R-9 is provided in the Appendix. The observer-based controller is presented in a continuous form while its discrete version is tested using a VTOL-UAV simulation that incorporates large initial error and uncertain measurements. The proposed observer is additionally tested experimentally on a real-world UAV flight dataset.

AB Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) cooperated with the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) can reinforce the desired signal and deal with the energy supply problem effectively. By leveraging the on-demand mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the IRS cooperated SWIPT can be deployed in more flexible and reliable scenarios. In this article, we investigate the UAV-mounted IRS-assisted SWIPT for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In particular, a UAV-mounted IRS is deployed to assist the information transmission and power transfer from the access point to several IoT devices simultaneously. Taking full advantage of the UAV-mounted IRS in attending multiple IoT devices flexibly, a time division multiple access (TDMA)-based scheduling protocol is proposed to serve different IoT devices alternatively during the UAV flying along an optimized trajectory with the information and power transfer executed. Then, an optimization problem of maximizing the minimum average achievable rate of multiple devices is formulated with the specific energy harvesting requirement guaranteed. To solve the nonconvex problem, we leverage the successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent methods to develop an iterative algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that with the help of the more flexible and reliable UAV-mounted IRS, the minimum achievable rate of the IoT network can be significantly improved.

AB Power networks are an important infrastructure that requires close monitoring and recurring assessment during and following a catastrophic event. The drone's unique aerial and unmanned nature has made it an efficient and powerful tool for damage assessment of the power networks. In this article, we propose a drone-routing framework to enable the systematic and automatic assessment of power networks considering wireless charging of the drone during the scanning. This article incorporates the resilience-oriented line priority index to periodically prioritize the power lines based on their specifications and conditions, and by doing so, this improves the efficiency of the assessment. A multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to dynamically determine the drone's optimal routing and speed in order to assure that the drone gathers sufficient data while completing the assessment mission in the shortest period of time. Since the proposed optimization algorithm needs to be solved multiple times for different sections of the power network, we propose a set of solution algorithms to reduce the computational burden and allow the proposed algorithm to reach the optimal solution quickly. Simulation results on a power network consisting of 77 nodes and 73 lines illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in performing network-wide dynamic assessment using a drone.

AB The first analytical stochastic and dynamic model for optimizing transit service switching is proposed for "smart transit" applications and for operating shared autonomous transit fleets. The model assumes a region that requires many-to-one last mile transit service either with fixed-route buses or flexible-route, on-demand buses. The demand density evolves continuously over time as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The optimal policy is determined by solving the switching problem as a market entry and exit real options model. Analysis using the model on a benchmark computational example illustrates the presence of a hysteresis effect, an indifference band that is sensitive to transportation system state and demand parameters, as well as the presence of switching thresholds that exhibit asymmetric sensitivities to transportation system conditions. The proposed policy is computationally compared in a 24-hour simulation to a "perfect information" set of decisions and a myopic policy that has been dominant in the flexible transit literature, with results that suggest the proposed policy can reduce by up to 72% of the excess cost in the myopic policy. Computational experiments of the "modular vehicle" policy demonstrate the existence of an option premium for having flexibility to switch between two vehicle sizes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Quantifying the Effects of Uncertainty in a Decentralized National
   Airspace System
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Modernization of the National Air Traffic Control System is on the horizon and with it the likely introduction of autonomous air vehicles into the national airspace. With the increase in air traffic to an already congested management scheme, the implementation of a decentralized control protocol may be the answer to replace the current classical centralized management system. Equipping each aircraft with the information necessary to navigate safely through integrated airspace becomes an information-sharing problem: How much information about other aircraft is required for a pilot to fly the gamut of a heavily populated airspace safely? What paradigm shifts may be necessary for safe and efficient use of available airspace? This paper describes the development of a tool for testing alternative traffic management systems-centralized and decentralized-in the presence of uncertainty. Applying a computational fluid dynamics-inspired approach to the problem both creates a simulation tool to model the movement of traffic within the airspace and allows study of the effects of interactions between vehicles. With incorporation of a model based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics, discrete particle aircraft each carry a set of unique deterministic and stochastic properties. With this model, aircraft interaction can be studied for better understanding of how variations in the nondeterministic properties of the system affect its overall efficiency and safety. The tool is structured to be sufficiently flexible to allow incorporation of different governing equations (right-of-way rules) for aircraft traffic management.

AB In many automated motion planning systems, vehicles are tasked with tracking a reference path or trajectory that is safe by design. However, due to various uncertainties, real vehicles may deviate from such references, potentially leading to collisions. This paper presents rigorous reachable set bounding methods for rapidly enclosing the set of possible deviations under uncertainty, which is critical information for online safety verification. The proposed approach applies recent advances in the theory of differential inequalities that exploit redundant model equations to achieve sharp bounds using only simple interval calculations. These methods have been shown to produce very sharp bounds at low cost for nonlinear systems in other application domains, but they rely on problem-specific insights to identify appropriate redundant equations, which makes them difficult to generalize and automate. Here, we demonstrate the application of these methods to tracking problems for the first time using three representative case studies. We find that defining redundant equations in terms of Lyapunov-like functions is particularly effective. The results show that this technique can produce effective bounds with computational times that are orders of magnitude less than the planned time horizon, making this a promising approach for online safety verification. This performance, however, comes at the cost of low generalizability, specifically due to the need for problem-specific insights and advantageous problem structure, such as the existence of appropriate Lyapunov-like functions.

AB This study is part of an investigation on application of LiDAR sensors to roadside to create a human-in-the-loop system that actively protects all road users, especially pedestrians and cyclists. The primary challenge for implementing such a system in the field is its computational efficiency. Unlike on-board LiDAR sensors used in autonomous vehicles, roadside applications must perform complete background filtering and monitor entire realtime traffic movements. This paper presents an innovative method for fast filtering background objects from roadside LiDAR data and demonstrates its capabilities to achieve higher accuracy, faster processing speed, and require less data storage. The proposed method is innovative in that it embeds background filtering within the decoding process to exclude irrelevant information, thus saving computational expense on analyzing background points that are not of interest. A 2D channel-azimuth background table is generated by learning the critical distance information of both static and dynamic backgrounds, which is more accurate than traditional background models that only focus on static backgrounds. Performance measurements and comparison analysis were conducted using data from our testbeds and open source. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the new method achieves faster processing speed (0.65 ms/frame and 0.90 ms/frame) and requires less data storage (225 KB and 450 KB memory) when processing 16- and 32-laser LiDAR data collected at 10 Hz.

DE Multi-connectivity; V2X; sidelink; 5G core
ID LTE
AB Enhanced vehicle-to-everything (eV2X) communication is one of the most challenging use cases that the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile communications must address. In particular, eV2X includes some 5G vehicular applications targeting fully autonomous driving which require ultra-high reliability. The usual approach to providing vehicular communication based on single-connectivity transmission, for instance, through the direct link between vehicles (PC5 interface), often fails at guaranteeing the required reliability. To solve such a problem, in this paper, we consider a scheme where the radio path followed by eV2X messages can be proactively and dynamically configured to either transmit through a single interface (chosen between the PC5 and the Uu interface for infrastructure-based communication) or through both interfaces simultaneously, depending on the requirements and particular situation. After describing some path management general considerations, we propose a new network function and a procedure to enhance the current capabilities of the 3GPP 5G system. Next, we propose different architectures to support our proposal following the four 5G eV2X architectural options defined by the 3GPP. For each alternative, the necessary signaling for the dynamic configuration of the radio paths is detailed. Finally, an exemplary use case of our proposal is presented in detail to illustrate the feasibility of our proposed functional architectures, and, for that use case, system-level simulation results are provided to demonstrate the benefit achieved with dynamic path management.

AB Motivated by the trade-off between speed and stability for off-road navigation, a novel active anti-roll system has been developed in the context of a multidisciplinary project which aims at developing a high-speed and agile autonomous off-road rover. This paper presents the design, simulation and experimental validation of an active anti-roll system and its associated control. The proposed system possess the advantage of having a modular design that can be installed on any off-road chassis with independent suspensions. The proposed system controls directly the roll angle of the rover which is usually uncontrollable in conventional vehicles, hence improving off-road stability while maneuverings at high speed over uneven terrain. Furthermore, the control of the proposed active anti-roll system is based on a model predictive control (MPC) for the roll dynamics, which minimizes the load transfer during cornering and the energy consumed by the actuators. The control model is based on a dynamic model of the rover and on a stability criteria defined by the lateral load transfer (LLT). Moreover, this paper presents, simulation results from the high fidelity virtual platform modeled in MSC. Adams (R), as well as, results from recent field tests demonstrating the effectiveness of a hydraulic active anti-roll system mounted on, an especially developed experimental platform, SPIDO ROBOT while cornering at a high speed reaching 8 m/s.

AB Global agriculture is challenged to provide food for a human population that is larger than ever before and still increasing. This is accompanied by the need to reduce the large global impacts of agriculture while increasing yields. Early identification of plant stress enables fast intervention to limit crop losses and optimized application of pesticides and fertilizer to reduce environmental impacts. Current image-based approaches identify plant stress responses hours or days after the stress event, usually only after substantial damage has occurred and visual cues become apparent. In contrast, plant volatiles are released seconds to hours after stress events and can quickly indicate both the type and severity of stress. An automatable and nondisruptive sampling method is needed to enable the use of plant volatiles for monitoring plant stress in precision agriculture. In this work, we detail the development of a plant volatile sampler that can be deployed and collected with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV). The effect of sampling flow rate, horizontal distance to volatile source, and overhead downwash on collected volatiles is investigated, along with the deployment accuracy and retrieval successes with manual flight. Finally, volatile sampling is validated in outdoor tests. The possibility of robotic collection of plant volatiles is a first and important step toward the use of chemical signals for early stress detection and opens up new avenues for precision agriculture beyond visual remote sensing.

AB Deployment of technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) involves the installation of Road Side Units (RSU) on the roadway and On-Board Units (OBU) inside vehicles. In this direction, 5G technologies will make a great impulse providing low latency communication and computation at the edge of the network. First, this paper defines VMEC-in-a-Box, a smart RSU combined with a MEC station, aimed at providing edge computing for vehicular applications by enabling job offloading from vehicles. VMEC-in-a-Box is equipped with a microeolic power generator to be autonomous and self-consistent even in presence of low levels of wind. The behavior of VMEC-in-a-Box is controlled by artificial intelligence to vary its computing capacity dynamically to pursue the best tradeoff between performance and power consumption, and to cooperate by offloading jobs to each other (horizontal offload) to improve performance and reliability of the system. Hence, the paper defines a Markov model to support decisions to optimize by means of Reinforcement Learning the system behavior according to two reward functions defined at the MEC and at the Vehicular Domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing an integrated framework to maximize reliability and performance at both Vehicular and MEC Domains.

AB Off-road semantic segmentation with fine-grained labels is necessary for autonomous vehicles to understand driving scenes, as the coarse-grained road detection can not satisfy off-road vehicles with various mechanical properties. Fine-grained semantic segmentation in off-road scenes usually has no unified category definition due to ambiguous nature environments, and the cost of pixel-wise labeling is extremely high. Furthermore, semantic properties of off-road scenes can be very changeable due to various precipitations, temperature, defoliation, etc. To address these challenges, this research proposes an active and contrastive learning-based method that does not rely on pixel-wise labels, but only on patch-based weak annotations for model learning. There is no need for predefined semantic categories, the contrastive learning-based feature representation and adaptive clustering will discover the category model from scene data. In order to actively adapt to new scenes, a risk evaluation method is proposed to discover and select hard frames with high-risk predictions for supplemental labeling, so as to update the model efficiently. Experiments conducted on our self-developed off-road dataset and DeepScene dataset demonstrate that fine-grained semantic segmentation can be learned with only dozens of weakly labeled frames, and the model can efficiently adapt across scenes by weak supervision, while achieving almost the same level of performance as typical fully supervised baselines.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) path planning in complex marine environments meets many chanllenges, such as many influencing factors, complex models and the performance of the optimization algorithm to be improved. To find a path with minimum cost of the actual environmental threats, navigation height changes and the minimum energy consumption of the AUV, an improved sparrow search algorithm is designed under the impact of the time-varying characteristics of the current in the complex marine environment on the AUV and the physical constraints of the AUV movement. In the proposed algorithm, an adaptive weight factor balance strategy is introduced into the position update of the discoverer to improve the convergence speed and search ability. In the follower position, the variable spiral search strategy is improved based on the position update formula to enhance the local jumping ability of the algorithm. After the position update, Levy flying strategy is added, and Cauchy-Gaussian mutation is performed on the optimal individual to increase the population diversity, which improves the anti-stagnation ability of the algorithm. Finally, the AUV global path with minimum cost in the sense of multi-objective weighting is obtained. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can plan a path with less cost and quickly converge to an optimized point, and finally it can meet the global path planning requirements of AUV when navigating in complex sea areas.

AB Different from the existing works that focus on transceiver design of over-the-air computation (AirComp) over static networks, we in this paper consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided AirComp system, where the UAV as a flying base station aggregates data from mobile sensors. The trajectory design of the UAV provides an additional degree of freedom to improve the performance of AirComp. We aim to minimize the time-averaged mean-squared error (MSE) of AirComp by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, receive normalizing factors, and sensors' transmit power. To this end, we first propose a novel and equivalent problem transformation by introducing intermediate variables. This reformulation leads to a convex subproblem when fixing any other two blocks of variables, thereby enabling efficient algorithm design based on the principle of block coordinate descent and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) techniques. In particular, we derive the optimal closed-form solutions for normalizing factors and intermediate variables optimization subproblems. We also recast the convex trajectory design subproblem into an ADMM form and obtain the closed-form expressions for each variable updating. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a smaller time-averaged MSE while reducing the simulation time by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB In this study, experimental investigations are used to explore the wake propagation and characteristics of a multi-rotor unmanned air vehicle (UAV) in a forward flight mission. Qualitative smoke visualization is used first to gain a qualitative understanding of wake characteristics above and below the body of the multi-rotor UAV which is used as guidance for quantitative particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments which better resolve the region in the vicinity of the multi-rotor UAV body. The experimental results over a wide range of advance ratios show that as the advance ratio increases, achieved by either lower rotor speeds or higher flight speeds, the distance by which the wake propagates below the UAV is reduced. While above the UAV, the flow returns to the freestream flow closer to the body as the advance ratio increases. Therefore, this study concludes that proximity effects are reduced as the advance ratio increases. Findings from this study can be used to inform in situ sensor placement so that sensor readings are minimally affected by the wake from the multi-rotor UAV. Velocity measurement corrections are provided for sensors mounted above the UAV which can be used to improve sensor data reliability in forward flight. These results can advance autonomous sensing and increase the utility of multi-rotor UAV observations while providing designers and users further guidance to avoid proximity effects.

AB This paper proposed a multi-objective guaranteed feasible connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon control method for signalized isolated intersections with priorities. Specifically, we prioritized the intersection throughput and traffic efficiency under a pre-defined signal cycle, based on which we minimized fuel consumption and emissions for CAV platoons. Longitudinal safety was also considered as a necessary condition. To handle the aforementioned targets, we firstly designed a vehicular sub-platoon splitting algorithm based on Farkas lemma to accommodate a maximum number of vehicles for each signal green time phase. Secondly, the CAV optimal trajectories control algorithm was designed as a centralized cooperative model predictive control (MPC). Moreover, the optimal control problem was formulated as discrete linear quadratic control problems with constraints with receding predictive horizons, which can be efficiently solved by quadratic programming after reformulation. For rigor, the proofs of the recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of our proposed predictive control model were provided. For evaluation, the performance of the control algorithm was compared against a non-cooperative distributed CAV control through simulation. It was found that the proposed method can significantly enhance both traffic efficiency and energy efficiency with ensured safety for CAV platoons at urban signalized intersections.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit great agility but usually require an experienced pilot to operate them in certain applications such as inspection for disaster scenarios or buildings. The reduction of cognitive overload when driving this kind of aerial robot becomes a challenge and several solutions can be found in the literature. A new virtual control scheme for reducing this cognitive overload when controlling an aerial robot is proposed in this paper. The architecture is based on a novel interaction Drone Exocentric Advanced Metaphor (DrEAM) located in a Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE) and a real robot containing an embedded controller based on quaternion formulation. The testing room, where real robots are evolving, is located away from the CAVE and they are connected via UDP in a ground station. The user controls manually a virtual drone through the DrEAM interaction metaphor, and the real robot imitates autonomously in real time the trajectory imposed by the user in the virtual environment. Experimental results illustrate the easy implementation and feasibility of the proposed scheme in two different scenarios. Results from these tests show that the mental effort when controlling a drone using the proposed virtual control scheme is lower than when controlling it in direct view. Moreover, the easy maneuverability and controllability of the real drone is also demonstrated in real time experiments.

AB Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become a widely popular technology with remarkable growth and unprecedented attention. However, UAV communication networks are susceptible to various cyber-intrusions/threats due to their limited computation and communication capabilities. Such intrusions/misbehaviors tend to be processed as normal packets through the UAV communication networks. In this work, we present an autonomous intrusion detection system that can efficiently detect the malicious threats invading UAV using deep convolutional neural networks (UAV-IDS-ConvNet). Specifically, the proposed system considers encrypted Wi-Fi traffic data records of three types of commonly used UAVs: Parrot Bebop UAVs, DBPower UDI UAVs, and DJI Spark UAVs. To evaluate the developed system, we employed the UAV-IDS-2020 dataset which includes various attacks on UAV networks in unidirectional and bidirectional communication flow modes. Moreover, we emulate the context of homogeneous and heterogeneous networked UAVs. Our best experimental outcomes exhibited a victorious intrusion detection accuracy of 99.50% for the two-class classifier model (normal UAV vs. anomaly) with 2.77 ms prediction time. Besides, the proposed system was evaluated using other performance metrics including confusion matrix parameters, false alarm rate, detection precision, detection sensitivity, and prediction overhead. The performance analysis showed that our UAV-IDS-ConvNet system outperforms several recent existing intrusion detection systems developed to secure the UAV communication networks by (6-23) %.

AB Classical haptic teleoperation systems heavily rely on operators' intelligence and efforts in aerial robot navigation tasks, thereby posing significantly users' workloads. In this paper, a novel shared control scheme is presented facilitating a multirotor aerial robot haptic teleoperation system that exhibits autonomous navigation capability. A hidden Markov model filter is proposed to identify the intention state of operator based on human inputs from haptic master device, which is subsequently adopted to derive goal position for a heuristic sampling based local path planner. The human inputs are considered as commanded velocity for a trajectory servo controller to drive the robot along the planned path. In addition, vehicle velocity is perceived by the user via haptic feedback on master device to enhance situation awareness and navigation safety of the user. An experimental study was conducted in a simulated and a physical environment, and the results verify the effectiveness of the novel scheme in safe navigation of aerial robots. A user study was carried out between a classical haptic teleoperation system and the proposed approach in the identical simulated complex environment. The flight data and task load index (TLX) are acquired and analyzed. Compared with the conventional haptic teleoperation scheme, the proposed scheme exhibits superior performance in safe and fast navigation of the multirotor vehicle, and is also of low task and cognitive loads.

AB Marine-geophysical evidence on sea-floor morphology and shallow acoustic stratigraphy are used to examine the substrate around the location at which Sir Ernest Shackleton's shipEndurancesank in 1915 and on the continental slope-shelf sedimentary system above this site in the western Weddell Sea. Few signs of turbidity-current and mass-wasting activity are found near or upslope of the wreck site, and any such activity was probably linked to full-glacial higher-energy conditions when ice last advanced across the continental shelf. The wreck is well below the maximum depth of iceberg keels and will not have been damaged by ice-keel ploughing. The wreck has probably been draped by only a few centimetres of fine-grained sediment since it sank in 1915. Severe modern sea-ice conditions hamper access to the wreck site. Accessing and investigating the wreck ofEndurancein the Weddell Sea therefore represents a significant challenge. An ice-breaking research vessel is required, and even this would not guarantee that the site could be reached. Heavy sea-ice cover at the wreck site, similar to that encountered byAgulhus IIduring the Weddell Sea Expedition 2019, would also make the launch and recovery of autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles deployed to investigate theEndurancewreck problematic.

AB The recent boost in undersea operations has led to the development of high-resolution sonar systems mounted on autonomous vehicles. These vehicles are used to scan the seafloor in search of different objects such as sunken ships, archaeological sites, and submerged mines. An important part of the detection operation is the segmentation of sonar images, where the object's highlight and shadow are distinguished from the seabed background. In this paper, we focus on the automatic segmentation of sonar images. We present our enhanced fuzzy-based with Kernel metric (EnFK) algorithm for the segmentation of sonar images which, in an attempt to improve segmentation accuracy, introduces two new fuzzy terms of local spatial and statistical information. Our algorithm includes a preliminary de-noising algorithm which, together with the original image, feeds into the segmentation procedure to avoid trapping to local minima and to improve convergence. The result is a segmentation procedure that specifically suits the intensity inhomogeneity and the complex seabed texture of sonar images. We tested our approach using simulated images, real sonar images, and sonar images that were created in two different sea experiments, using multibeam sonar and synthetic aperture sonar. The results show accurate segmentation performance that is far beyond the state-of-the-art results.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed for a wide range of applications. Their use in wilderness search and rescue (WiSAR), in particular, has been investigated for fast search-area coverage from a high vantage point. The probability of success in such searches, however, can be further improved utilizing cooperative systems that employ both UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). In this paper, we present a new coordinated-search planning method, for collaborative UAV-UGV teams. The proposed method, particularly developed for WiSAR, considers the search area to be continuously growing and that the search is sparse. It is also assumed that targets detected by UAVs must be identified by a ground-level searcher. The UAV/UGV motion-planning method presented herein, therefore, has two major components: (i) coordinated search and (ii) joint target identification. The novelty of the proposed method lies in its use of (i) time-dependent target-location iso-probability curves, and (ii) an effective and efficient coordinated target-identification algorithm. The method has been validated via numerous simulated WiSAR searches for varying scenarios. Furthermore, extensive comparative experiments with other methods have shown that our method has higher rates of target detection and shorter search times, significantly outperforming alternative techniques by 75% - 255% in terms of target detection probability.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication with the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system has attracted lots of attention to improve spectral efficiency and channel capacity. The large antenna spacing is often required to reduce the spatial correlation between subchannels. However, this requirement cannot be well satisfied in practical scenarios due to the limited dimension of UAV platforms. Therefore, polarization diversity is a promising approach for UAV MIMO systems. In this work, we propose a three-dimensional (3-D) geometrical-based polarized model for UAV-correlated MIMO channels. By utilizing the geometrical theory of polarization, we describe the channel depolarization caused by the terrestrial scattering environment based on the multicylinder geometrical model and then acquire the channel polarization function and polarized channel impulse response (CIR). Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the key factors, such as the UAV tilt rotation, cross-polarization, and limited antenna spacing on the UAV MIMO channel capacity. To validate the proposed UAV channel model, we compare the spatial correlations of the numerical simulation and UAV field measurement results for the co- and cross-polarized channels, and the close agreements between them are observed. This work can provide useful guidance and support for the design and performance evaluation of UAV communication networks.

AB Recently, road scene-graph representations used in conjunction with graph learning techniques have been shown to outperform state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in tasks including action classification, risk assessment, and collision prediction. To enable the exploration of applications of road scene-graph representations, we introduce ROADSCENE2VEC: an open-source tool for extracting and embedding road scene-graphs. The goal of ROADSCENE2VEC is to enable research into the applications and capabilities of road scene-graphs by providing tools for generating scene-graphs, graph learning models to create spatitemporal scene-graph embeddings, and tools for visualizing and analyzing scene-graph-based methodologies. The capabilities of ROADSCENE2VEC include (i) customized scene-graph generation from either video clips or data from the CARLA simulator, (ii) multiple configurable spatiotemporal graph embedding models and baseline CNN-based models, (iii) built-in functionality for using graph and sequence embeddings for risk assessment and collision prediction applications, (iv) tools for evaluating transfer learning, and (v) utilities for visualizing scene-graphs and analyzing the explainability of graph learning models. We demonstrate the utility of ROADSCENE2VEC for these use cases with experimental results and qualitative evaluations for both graph learning models and CNN-based models.

AB The underwater environment poses a complex problem for developing control systems for underwater manipulators. Modeling the system is a complicated and costly process due to the highly nonlinear dynamics and the presence of unknown hydrodynamical effects. Furthermore, manipulators are usually deployed on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) which further influence and change the dynamics of the arm. This is aggravated in underwater operations where manipulating different objects is necessary. These diverse manipulation tasks introduce external disturbances to the system and can lead to a fast degradation of the control system performance. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive controller for underwater robot manipulators that have to handle varying payloads with different masses, geometries, and buoyant forces. The proposed control strategy utilizes a data-driven model of the system in an optimal control formulation based on neural networks. Moreover, we developed an online tuning strategy, based on the adaptive interaction theory, which allows the gains of the controller to be updated online with respect to a set of performance metrics. Experiments were performed with the robotic arm manipulating a variety of payloads while mounted on both a fixed base and a free-floating vehicle. We present a number of simulated and experimental results that illustrate the benefits of the proposed strategy. In addition, a comparative study against a classical Model Predictive Control (MPC) demonstrates the benefits of our adaptive proposal.

AB In the present two-dimensional numerical study, we investigate the roles of geometrical parameters of a hydrofoil (shape/curvature of the leading and trailing edges and thickness) and kinematic parameters (phase difference between heave and pitch (phi)) on the propulsive performance of different-shaped hydrofoils oscillating at maximum angles of attack up to alpha max=30 circle. The study was carried out at a fixed non-dimensional maximum heave to chord ratio h circle/C=0.75, Strouhal number St=0.25, and Reynolds number Re=5000. Our findings reveal that hydrofoil performance and stability improve with leading and trailing edge curvatures but decline as thickness increases. By analyzing the near-wake structure, we establish that even minimal flow separation increases power consumption while moderate flow separation enhances thrust. Over the range of different-shaped hydrofoils at different alpha max and phi, maximum propulsion efficiency occurs for those parameters for which there is a small degree of flow separation but with no roll-up of a separating vortex. In comparison, maximum thrust generation occurs when there is a moderately strong flow separation but without induction of a significant amount of fluid around the trailing edge. These insights offer valuable knowledge for understanding fish propulsion efficiency and have applications in designing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and micro-air vehicles (MAVs).

AB This work proposes a two-phase motion control mechanism, which includes manoeuver preparation and maneuver execution phases. Compared with the state-of-art methodologies, this study has the following distinguishing features: Firstly, this method actively prepares a sequence of maneuvers ahead to be executed under cut-in scenarios with initially unsatisfied execution conditions. Therefore, the behavior-reachable region is considered as a constraint to resolve unsatisfied execution conditions with model predictive control in the maneuver preparation phase. Secondly, the proposed method designs the dynamic-related sliding boundary as the terminal region of model predictive control, enabling the system state-variables to enter the initial safety region of the barrier Lyapunov function. In this way, the barrier Lyapunov function-based controller can effectively finish driving tasks computationally while keeping state-variables constrained in a predefined zone in the next maneuver execution phase. Thirdly, with the designed time Synchronized Control Governor (SCG), the state-variables converge to the origin synchronically in finite time with less fluctuation/overshot. In the simulation, the parameter for dynamic-related sliding boundaries is first evaluated. The comparison between stabilization control and the time-synchronized control governor is made to verify superior performance of the proposed approach in fluctuation/overshot. Finally, three scenarios are simulated to be compared, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the designed dynamic-related sliding boundary.

AB Advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) are primarily designed to increase driving safety and reduce traffic congestion without paying too much attention to passenger comfort or motion sickness. However, in view of autonomous cars, and taking into account that the lack of comfort and motion sickness increase in passengers, analysis from a comfort perspective is essential in the future car investigation. The aim of this work is to study in detail how passenger's comfort evaluation parameters vary depending on the driving style, car or road. The database used has been developed by compiling the accelerations suffered by passengers when three drivers cruise two different vehicles on different types of routes. In order to evaluate both comfort and motion sickness, first, the numerical values of the main comfort evaluation variables reported in the literature have been analyzed. Moreover, a complementary statistical analysis of probability density and a power spectral analysis are performed. Finally, quantitative results are compared with passenger qualitative feedback. The results show the high dependence of comfort evaluation variables' value with the road type. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the driving style and vehicle dynamics amplify or attenuate those values. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that contributions from longitudinal and lateral accelerations have a much greater effect in the lack of comfort than vertical ones. Finally, based on the concrete results obtained, a new experimental campaign is proposed.

AB Visual 3D perception is a key interface between vehicles and the environment which provides rich perception information for autonomous vehicles. In vehicular visual 3D perception, camera position uncertainty can often degrade the perception and localization performance, and the information coupling and propagation among 3D points and cameras exist ubiquitously. However, these factors do not receive the deserving concern in previous algorithms which mainly focus on the consideration of efficiency. In this paper, we develop a statistical framework for visual 3D perception in vehicular networks from the perspective of information gains. Specifically, we first derive the influence of camera position uncertainty on perception and localization quality with geometric interpretations given by the information ellipsoid, and also present the perception loss caused by uncertainty in the camera deployment application. Then we determine the information coupling and propagation among 3D points and cameras in the vehicular network, propose the visual information graph to characterize the coupling, and derive the hierarchical structure in propagation. Moreover, we also propose the equivalent circuit for the quasi-tree network to interpret the hierarchical structure and derive the blocking and the end-link effects for network reduction. Our results provide guidelines for the development of efficient uncertainty- and coupling-aware visual 3D perception techniques in vehicular networks.

AB Object detection is the most critical and foundational sensing module for the autonomous movement platform. However, most of the existing deep learning solutions are based on GPU servers, which limits their actual deployment. We present an efficient multi-sensor fusion based object detection model that can be deployed on the off-the-shelf edge computing device for the vehicle platform. To achieve real-time target detection, the model eliminates a large number of invalid point clouds through ground filtering algorithm, and then adds texture information (fused from camera image) through point cloud coloring to enhance features. The proposed PV-EncoNet efficiently encodes both the spatial and texture features of each colored point through point-wise and voxel-wise encoding, and then predicts the position, heading and class of the objects. The final model can achieve about 17.92 and 24.25 Frame per Second (FPS) on two different edge computing platforms, and the detection accuracy is comparable with the state-of-the-art models on the KITTI public dataset (i.e., 88.54% for cars, 71.94% for pedestrians and 73.04% for cyclists). The robustness and generalization ability of the PV-EncoNet for the 3D colored point cloud detection task is also verified by deploying it on the local vehicle platform and testing it on real road conditions.

AB Purpose
   This paper aims to enable the unmanned aerial vehicles to inspect the surface condition of wind turbine in close range when the global positioning system signal is not reliable, and further improve its intelligence. So a visual-inertial odometry with point and line features is developed.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Visual front-end combining point and line features, as well as its purification strategies, are first presented to improve the robustness of feature tracking in low-textured scene and rapidity of segment detector. Additionally, the inertial measurement is integrated between keyframes as constrain to reduce tracking error existed in visual-only system. Second, the graph-based visual-inertial back-end is constructed. To parameterize line features effectively, the infinite line representation not sensitive to outdoor light is employed, in which Plucker and Cayley are selected for line re-projection and nonlinear optimization. Furthermore, Jacobians of the line re-projection errors are analytically derived for better accuracy.
   Findings
   Experiments are performed in various scenes of the wind farm. The results demonstrate that the tight-coupled visual-inertial odometry with point and line features is more precise on all the samples than conventional algorithms in complex wind farm environments. Additionally, the constructed line feature map can be used in the following research for autonomous navigation.
   Originality/value
   The proposed visual-inertial odometry works robustly in strong electromagnetic interference, low-textured and illumination-change wind farm.

AB The time-varying ocean currents and the delay of underwater acoustic communication have caused the uncertainty of single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) tracking target and the inconsistency of multi-AUV coordination, which make it difficult for multiple AUVs to form a hunting alliance. To solve the above problems, this article proposes the multi-AUV consistent collaborative hunting method based on generative adversarial network (GAN). Firstly, the three-dimensional (3D) kinematic model of AUV is established for the underwater 3D environment. Secondly, combined with the Laplacian matrix, the topology of the hunting alliance in the ideal environment is established, and the control rate of AUV is calculated. Finally, using the GAN network model, the control relationship after environmental interference is used as the input of the generative model. The control rate in the ideal environment is used as the comparison object of the discriminative model. Using the iterative training of GAN to generate a control rate that adapts to the current interference environment and combining multi-AUV topological hunting model to achieve successful hunting of noncooperative target, the experimental results show that the algorithm reduces the average hunting time to 62.53 s and the success rate of hunting is increased to 84.69%, which is 1.17% higher than the particle swarm optimization-constant modulus algorithm (PSO-CMA) algorithm.

AB The characteristics of the radar returns for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are useful for radar detection and classification of the UAV. In this study, the authors carried out an experiment in an anechoic chamber to measure the fully polarimetric echoes of a fixed-wing UAV in X-band. With the measured data, they analysed the distribution of the radar cross-section of the UAV. They also analysed the distributions of the phases and polarisation ratios of the UAV returns in various polarisation modes. They found that the radar cross-sections of the fixed-wing UAV in HH and VV polarisation modes obey lognormal distribution. The radar cross-sections of the UAV in VH and HV polarisation modes obey Weibull distribution. The means of the radar cross-section in co-polarisation modes are 8-10 dBsm higher than those in cross-polarisation modes. The phases of the UAV echo in HH, HV, VH and VV polarisation modes are uniformly distributed within 0 and 2 pi. The amplitudes of the polarisation ratios of the UAV echo are well fitted by lognormal distribution.

AB 3-dimensional, accurate, and up-to-date maps are essential for vehicles with autonomous capabilities, whose functionality is made possible by machine learning-based algorithms. Since these solutions require a tremendous amount of data for parameter optimization, simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) methods have been proven immensely useful for training data generation. For creating realistic models to be used for synthetic data generation, crowdsourcing techniques present a resource-efficient alternative. In this paper, we show that using the Carla simulation environment, a crowdsourcing model can be created that mimics a multi-agent data gathering and processing pipeline. We developed a solution that yields dense point clouds based on monocular images and location information gathered by individual data acquisition vehicles. Our method provides scene reconstructions using the robust Structure-from-Motion (SfM) solution of Colmap. Moreover, we introduce a solution for synthesizing dense ground truth point clouds originating from the Carla simulator using a simulated data acquisition pipeline. We compare the results of the Colmap reconstruction with the reference point cloud after aligning them using the iterative closest point algorithm. Our results show that a precise point cloud reconstruction was feasible with this crowdsourcing-based approach, with 54\% of the reconstructed points having an error under 0.05 m, and a weighted root mean square error of 0.0449 m for the entire point cloud.

ID VERIFICATION
AB Cyber-physical systems are becoming more intelligent with the adoption of heterogeneous sensor networks and machine learning capabilities that deal with an increasing amount of input data. While this complexity aims to solve problems in various domains, it adds new challenges for the system assurance. One issue is the rise in the number of abnormal behaviors that affect system performance due to possible sensor faults and attacks. The combination of safety risks, which are usually caused by random sensor faults and security risks that can happen during any random system state, makes the full coverage testing of the cyber-physical system challenging. Existing techniques are inadequate to deal with complex safety and security co-risks against cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose AST-SafeSec, an analysis methodology for both safety and security aspects that utilizes reinforcement learning to identify the most likely adversarial paths at various normal or failure states of a cyber-physical system that can influence system behavior through its sensor data. The methodology is evaluated using an autonomous vehicle scenario by incorporating a security attack into the stochastic sensor elements of a vehicle. Evaluation results show that the methodology analyzes the interaction of malicious attacks with random faults and identifies the incident caused by the interactions and the most likely path that leads to the incident.

AB The major component for the effective functioning of airborne unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an antenna. The unified integration of an antenna with UAVs without disturbing the other components of UAVs, compact size, thin, and wideband antennas are preferred. Based on these prerequisites, a low-profile and a wideband antenna is presented for autonomous UAVs for C-band applications. The antenna is designed on an extremely thin substrate of size 0.01 lambda(0) without compromising the antenna's broad bandwidth. The antenna structure comprises a corrugated U-shaped patch, a few parasitic patches along with the partial ground. Initially, only a single mode was excited using a U-shaped patch, then further on introducing a few more parasitic patches along with corrugations in a U-shaped patch other modes were also coupled leading to enhancement in the bandwidth of the antenna. The proposed antenna along with a 2 x 2 quad-port multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) antenna is designed and fabricated. The measured results are found to be in good agreement with the simulated results. A broad bandwidth of 74.5% (4.1-9.0 GHz) with 5.02 dBi peak gain at 6.6 GHz is exhibited by the fabricated MIMO antenna. Thus, the designed antenna proves to be an effective candidate for UAV-based C-band applications.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Base Station (BS) placement optimization is an essential operational task to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) in UAV-aided wireless cellular networks. The existing approaches are almost zeroth order methods, and the few first order methods mainly ignore the allocation fairness, computational efficiency, and backhaul constraints. In this paper, we formulate the UAV placement problem as a constrained optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the fair coverage versus energy consumption while satisfying the backhaul constraints at different time nodes. To guarantee fair QoS allocation, we introduce a novel fairness index to ensure fair communication opportunity and the novel region coverage ratio to avoid excess QoS on covered spots. An accurate and efficient proximal stochastic gradient descent based alternating algorithm that iteratively executes two optimization steps is proposed to optimize the UAV locations, which enables the fast single point-based first order methods to solve the complex problems with constraints. Experiment results manifest that the proposed algorithm performs well both in synthetic data scenario and in real city scenario. Furthermore, the proposed first order algorithm is more efficient than the existing zeroth order algorithm, typically referring to the meta-heuristic method.

AB Ring stiffened cylindrical shells find wide applications in marine vehicles such as submersibles, submarine, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and torpedoes. The structures used for military applications are susceptible to shock loadings from an underwater explosion. It is imperative to understand the shock damage mechanism of such structures to design for survivability. The problem is quite complex involving explosive-fluid interaction, fluid-structure interaction, material, geometric nonlinearity and strain rate effects. In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the shock response of a ring stiffened cylindrical shell of length 1000 mm, diameter 600 mm and thickness 6 mm shock tested using small explosive charge of 70 gm PEK I. The numerical study is performed using LS-DYNA finite element code considering the fluid-structure interaction, strain rate effects, geometric and material nonlinearity. The stiffened cylinder under consideration is modelled using Belytschko-Tsay shell element and the fluid and explosive using Eulerian solid element. The explosive is modelled using JWL equation of state, the fluid using Gruneisen equation of state and the stiffened cylinder fluid interaction using ALE coupling. The permanent deformation obtained from the numerical study compares well with experimental results within 5% accuracy. Subsequently, parametric investigation has been carried out for various charge weights with different cylindrical shell thickness and the results of permanent deformation, effective plastic strain are presented.

AB Images acquired by a fisheye lens camera contain geometric distortion that results in deformation of the object's shape. To correct the lens distortion, existing methods use prior information, such as calibration patterns or lens design specifications. However, the use of a calibration pattern works only when an input scene is a 2-D plane at a prespecified position. On the other hand, the lens design specifications can be understood only by optical experts. To solve these problems, we present a novel image-based algorithm that corrects the geometric distortion. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages: i) feature detection, ii) distortion parameter estimation, and iii) selection of the optimally corrected image out of multiple corrected candidates. The proposed method can automatically select the optimal amount of correction for a fisheye lens distortion by analyzing characteristics of the distorted image using neither prespecified lens design parameters nor calibration patterns. Furthermore, our method performs not only on-line correction by using facial landmark points, but also off-line correction described in subsection III-C. As a result, the proposed method can be applied to a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) camera with two fisheye lenses in a field-of-view (FOV) of 195 degrees, autonomous vehicle vision systems, wide-area visual surveillance systems, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cameras.

AB The smart electric power grid will evolve into a very complex adaptive system under semi-autonomous distributed control. Its spatial and temporal complexity, non-convexity, non-linearity, non-stationarity, variability and uncertainties exceed the characteristics found in today's traditional power system. The distributed integration of intermittent sources of energy and plug-in electric vehicles to a smart grid further adds complexity and challenges to its modeling, control and optimization. Innovative technologies are needed to handle the growing complexity of the smart grid and stochastic bidirectional optimal power flows, to maximize the penetration of renewable energy, and to provide maximum utilization of available energy storage, especially plug-in electric vehicles.
   Smart grids will need to be monitored continuously to maintain stability, reliability and efficiency under normal and abnormal operating conditions and disturbances. A combination of capabilities for system state prediction, dynamic stochastic power flow, system optimization, and solution checking will be necessary. The optimization and control systems for a smart-grid environment will require a computational systems thinking machine to handle the uncertainties and variability that exist. The importance and contributions of the computational intelligence field for developing the dynamic, stochastic, computational, and scalable technologies needed for sense-making, situational awareness, control and optimization in smart grids are presented in this paper.

AB This paper explores Engineering self-recoveries theory, which emerged from the research of Bionics to meet the great demand of modern high-risk process manufacturing and the development of aerospace vehicles. Bionics opens a new era in which artefact s learn from natural objects. With the rapid development of the industrial Internet and Artificial intelligence technology, we have gained a deep understanding of the law of fault generation and development, which provides an opportunity for the emergence of Engineering self-recoveries theory. Engineering self-recoveries expands the research field of Cybernetics and Engineering cybernetics, endows machines with the self-recovery mechanism, which is unique to humans and animals, and enables machines to store, supplement and activate self-recovery power to maintain body health. Bionics research on Artificial intelligence has greatly enhanced the function of imitating the human brain, but has ignored the important system and function of humans and animals to maintain their own health-the self-recovery system and self-recovery function. Artificial intelligence imitates the conscious thinking control behaviour of the human brain to realize automation and intellectualization, making machines smarter. Artificial self-recovery can imitate the self-recovery mechanism of human unconscious thinking, and prevent and suppress faults in operation to realize self-recovery, possibly making machines healthier. Artificial self-recovery technology includes self-repair, compensation, self-protection and self-recovery regulation. Engineering self-recoveries is the basis of the autonomous health of machines and even artificial systems, and a new research field of Bionics. This has broad application prospects in engineering.

TI A gain-scheduling control strategy and short-term path optimization with
   genetic algorithm for autonomous navigation of a sailboat robot
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Unmanned surface vehicle (USV); gain-scheduling PID; sailboat robot;
   genetic algorithms; path optimization; nonlinear control
AB The development of a navigation system for autonomous robotic sailing is a particularly challenging task since the sailboat robot uses unpredictable wind forces for its propulsion besides working in a highly nonlinear and harsh environment, the water. Toward solving the problems that appear in this kind of environment, we propose a navigation system which allows the sailboat to reach any desired target points in its working environment. This navigation system consists of a low-level heading controller and a short-term path planner for situations against the wind. For the low-level heading controller, a gain-scheduling proportional-integral (GS-PI) controller is shown to better describe the nonlinearities inherent to the sailboat movement. The gain-scheduling-PI consists of a table that contains the best control parameters that are learned/defined for a particular maneuver and perform the scheduling according to each situation. The idea is to design specialized controllers which meet the specific control objectives of each application. For achieving short-term path-planned targets, a new approach for optimization of the tacking maneuvering to reach targets against the wind is also proposed. This method takes into account two tacking parameters: the side distance available for the maneuvering and the desired sailboat heading when tacking. An optimization method based on genetic algorithm is used in order to find satisfactory upwind paths. Results of various experiments verify the validity and robustness of the developed methods and navigation system.

AB Automated feature tracking and vehicle navigation have the potential to facilitate autonomous surveys of ocean eddies by increasing sampling quality and/or decreasing operator workload. During an observational campaign in late 2013 and early 2014, methods for automated tracking were used to direct multiple ocean gliders during persistent surveys of a California Undercurrent eddy in Washington and British Columbia, Canada, coastal waters over a 3-month period. Glider observations of depth-averaged currents in the ocean's upper kilometer and vertical separation of selected isopycnals were assimilated into a simple model describing eddy position, size, strength, and background flows using an extended Kalman filter. Though differing in detail from observations, results show the assumed eddy structure was sufficient to describe its essential characteristics and stably estimate eddy position through time. Forecast eddy positions and currents were used to select targets automatically to guide multiple gliders along transects through the eddy center as it translated. Transects performed under automated navigation had comparable or better straightness and distance from the eddy center when compared to navigation based on manual interpretation of the eddy scale and position. The tracking results were relatively insensitive to model choices at times when the eddy was well sampled, but they were more sensitive during sampling gaps and redundancies or rapid eddy translation. Overall, the results provide evidence that automated tracking and navigation are feasible with potential for widespread application in autonomous eddy surveys.

AB This paper presents a new position error-constrained line-of-sight (PECLOS) path-following (PF) control strategy for an underactuated AUV under multiple disturbances and input constraints. Firstly, considering that many previous studies ignored the influence of stochastic noises, which may degrade the designed controller performance or even lead to instability in practical applications, the multiple disturbances are divided into two categories based on their features, i.e., the slowly time-varying deterministic disturbances and the stochastic noises. On this basis, the time-varying deterministic disturbances are further treated as a single equivalent disturbance and a linear stochastic differential model of underactuated AUV is established by augmenting the equivalent disturbance as an extended state. Secondly, a novel PF control strategy is proposed based on an extended state based Kalman-Bucy filter (ESKBF) and auxiliary dynamic compensators. The PECLOS guidance law is established to maintain the PF errors within the specified time-varying bounds, the ESKBF technology is utilized to estimate and compensate for the equivalent disturbances under the stochastic noises, and the auxiliary dynamic compensators are adopted to overcome the input constraints. Eventually, the stability of the overall closed-loop system is verified. Simulation and comparative analysis are presented to demonstrate the enhanced performance of the presented controller.

AB Aiming to energy-efficient, short path, and safety, an online dynamic multi-objective path planning method for the wave glider (WG) is proposed to make the WG operate efficiently in the uncertain marine environment. In this paper, a novel kinematic constrained safe rapidly-exploring random tree (KS-RRT*) path planning algorithm is developed, which is subject to the safe area boundaries and kinematics. Biased random sampling method is introduced which the kinematic constraints is used as heuristic function and the KS-RRT* can reduce the extended area of random points. And a path safe (PS) scheme is developed, which can ensure that the WG safely passes through the planned path. In addition, energy cost, path length, and safety metric (SM) of each feasible trajectory are obtained by the KS-RRT*, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal situation (TOPSIS) is utilized to solve multi-objective path optimization problem, and the final path is smoothed by the B -spline algorithm. The results of simulations show that the proposed KS-RRT* is more suitable for the WG's path planning than traditional path planning algorithm and the proposed multi-objective path optimization method can solve the path planning problem of the WG in complex marine environments.

DE Acoustic landmark; object recognition; multibeam forward looking sonar
ID UNDERWATER VEHICLE; IMAGE; CLASSIFICATION; TRACKING
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely used for many risky underwater tasks. For these tasks, AUVs require navigational aids, such as active beacon-type underwater acoustic landmarks, which are the most widely used. It requires heavy installation loads and regular maintenance with high price sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel localization method in shallow water with a multi-beam forward looking sonar (MFLS), where positioning is based on passive-type acoustic landmarks. The proposed landmark comprises a combination of concrete pillars with a highly reliable and efficient recognition method for the real-time use of AUVs. The proposed landmark system has many advantages in the practical use, such as no maintenance, being strong on the marine bio-fouling, and light installation load with low price concrete pillars. The proposed recognition method is divided into two processes to verify the landmark. First, a pillarlike object is separated from the background, and the height of the pillar is calculated by the length of the shadow, which has a very high recognition rate and accuracy. Through modeling, the distance from the landmark to the MFLS can be calculated. The proposed method stochastically updates the navigation data based on the positional relationship with the landmark. The performance of the proposed landmark and its recognition method is verified through a water tank and field experiments using the AUV (Cyclops). The recognition rate and accuracy are also discussed.

AB This paper presents the control of an indoor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using multi-camera visual feedback. For the autonomous flight of the indoor UAV, instead of using onboard sensor information, visual feedback concept is employed by the development of an indoor flight test-bed. The indoor test-bed consists of four major components: the multi-camera system, ground computer, onboard color marker set, and quad-rotor UAV. Since the onboard markers are attached to the pre-defined location, position and attitude of the UAV can be estimated by marker detection algorithm and triangulation method. Additionally, this study introduces a filter algorithm to obtain the full 6-degree of freedom (DOF) pose estimation including velocities and angular rates. The filter algorithm also enhances the performance of the vision system by making up for the weakness of low cost cameras such as poor resolution and large noise. Moreover, for the pose estimation of multiple vehicles, data association algorithm using the geometric relation between cameras is proposed in this paper. The control system is designed based on the classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, which uses the position, velocity and attitude from the vision system and the angular rate from the rate gyro sensor. This paper concludes with both ground and flight test results illustrating the performance and properties of the proposed indoor flight test-bed and the control system using the multi-camera visual feedback.

AB Tractors with multiple trailers are widely applied means of transport in manufacturing systems. There exist numerous designs of trailers and tractors, making the estimation of the system trajectory and the required transportation corridor a complex task. It is also difficult to achieve the same trajectory for a manually operated tractor for multiple runs. The problem is complicated if there are multiple towed trailers or a dynamic drive on slippery ground. One approach is to replace the driver with an automated steering system. This paper presents a dynamic model of a tractor with multiple trailer system, based on the Lagrange formalism, which is controlled by artificial neural networks. To account for the slip phenomenon, a sigmoidal tire model was used. The algorithm of the artificial neural network provides the most appropriate input parameters for tractor steering for a given transportation area. The input parameters are the torques applied to the tractor wheels and are determined by the algorithm based on the data collected by the LiDAR scanner during the train run. These data include distances for each unit from the obstacle (e.g., wall), information about the occurrence of a collision, and the distance traveled by the tractor. The simulation results of the integration of the dynamic model and the neural network modeled are presented in a graphic form. The proposed algorithm ensures a collision-free ride of the system.

AB Objective: Vehicular lane-changing is one of the riskiest driving maneuvers. Since vehicular automation is quickly becoming a reality, it is crucial to be able to identify when such a maneuver can turn into a risky situation. Recently, it has been shown that a qualitative approach: the Point Descriptor Precedence (PDP) representation, is able to do so. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether the PDP representation can detect hazardous micro movements during lane-changing maneuvers in a situation of structural congestion in the morning and/or evening.Method: The approach involves analyzing a large real-world traffic dataset using the PDP representation and adding safety distance points to distinguish subtle movement patterns.Results: Based on these subtleties, we label four out of seven and five out of nine lane-change maneuvers as risky during the selected peak and the off-peak traffic hours respectively.Conclusions: The results show that the approach can identify risky movement patterns in traffic. The PDP representation can be used to check whether certain adjustments (e.g., changing the maximum speed) have a significant impact on the number of dangerous behaviors, which is important for improving road safety. This approach has practical applications in penalizing traffic violations, improving traffic flow, and providing valuable information for policymakers and transport experts. It can also be used to train autonomous vehicles in risky driving situations.

AB This paper studies the flight trajectory of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to provide fifth-generation (5G) cellular service in a given area. We consider a single UAV launched from the fixed initial to the final location, during which it serves the ground users that are distributed in a circular field. UAV's limited on-board energy has been a major concern affecting the system's performance. Therefore, in this work, we minimize the average outage probability of the system by optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the UAV while considering the velocity and on-board energy as constraints. To solve this problem, we propose two approaches: the low-complexity vertex and the high-performance sequential approach. The vertex approach involves two steps. Firstly, it obtains the optimal solution while relaxing the velocity and on-board energy constraints. Secondly, a greedy solution is proposed for the original problem. The sequential approach finds the optimal location in each time slot sequentially. Simulation results compare the two approaches and show that our proposed strategies provide on an average 41% improvement in average outage probability over the benchmark schemes. Additionally, we show that the sequential approach is better than the vertex approach, though at the cost of high computational complexity.

AB Air pollution monitoring, finding the hazardous zone, and future air quality predictions have recently become a significant issue for many researchers. With the adverse effect of low air quality on human health, it has become necessary for predicting the air quality index (AQI) accurately and on time. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can collect air quality data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Using a fleet of UAVs could be considered a good option. In the proposed work, we implement a distributed federated learning (FL) algorithm within a UAV swarm that collects air quality data using built-in sensors. A scheme for finding the area with the highest AQI value is proposed using swarm intelligence. The collected data are then fed to a CNN-LSTM model to predict the AQI. The trained local model is sent to the central server, and the server aggregates the received models from UAVs in the swarm. A global model is created and is transmitted to the UAV swarm again in the next iteration. The proposed architecture is compared with other time-series models. The results show that the proposed model predicts AQI daily with a minimal error rate on a real-time data set from Delhi.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Automatic visual navigation flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays an important role in the highway maintenance field. Automatic highway center marking detection is the most important part of the visual navigation flight of a UAV. In this study, the UAV-viewed highway data are collected from the UAV perspective. This paper proposes a model named the YOLO-Highway that uses an improved form of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to enhance the real-time detection of highway marking problems. The proposed model is mainly designed by optimizing the network structure and the loss function of the original YOLOv3 model. The proposed model is verified by the experiments using the highway center marking dataset, and the results show that the average precision (AP) of the trained model is 82.79%, and the frames per second (FPS) is 25.71 f/s. In comparison with the original YOLOv3 model, the detection accuracy of the proposed model is improved by 7.05%, and its speed is improved by 5.29 f/s. Moreover, the proposed model had stronger environmental adaptability and better detection precision and speed than the original model in complex highway scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed YOLO-Highway model can accurately detect the highway center markings in real-time and has high robustness to changes in different environmental conditions. Therefore, the YOLO-Highway model can meet the real-time requirements of the highway center marking detection.

AB This paper proposes a family of N-Branch hybrid switched inductor and capacitor (SLC) converters. With the single circuit, the multi-level output voltage or current could be generated. The proposed converter is suitable both for the voltage source and the current source. The same LC network is reused for different LC branches. The proposed converter is controlled by the phase shift control method with a time domain multiplexing concept. The N level circuit is operated with the same frequency. One cycle period is divided into N small time cycles for each branch. The phase shift for each branch is 360 degrees/N. The load voltage could be changed by modifying the duty cycle of the transistor. When the SLCs work in the resonant condition, the soft switching will be acquired. The power loss of transistors could be sharply reduced. In this paper, a 300 W SLC converter is constructed to verify the theoretical analysis and operation mechanism in the resonant condition and hard switching condition. With the experimental and simulated verification, the soft switching and the stable multi-level output voltage or current are achieved. The proposed SLC converter could be used for the multi-level voltage power supply system, such as the electric vehicle, the electric aircraft, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and a new energy generation system.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) are seen as an emerging technology for maritime exploration but are still restricted by the availability of short range, accurate positioning methods necessary, e.g., when docking remote assets. Typical techniques used for high-accuracy positioning in indoor use case scenarios, such as systems using ultra-wide band radio signals (UWB), cannot be applied for underwater positioning because of the quick absorption of the positioning medium caused by the water. Acoustic and optic solutions for underwater positioning also face known problems, such as the multi-path effects, high propagation delay (acoustics), and environmental dependency. This paper presents an oscillating magnetic field-based indoor and underwater positioning system. Unlike those radio wave-based positioning modalities, the magnetic approach generates a bubble-formed magnetic field that will not be deformed by the environmental variation because of the very similar permeability of water and air. The proposed system achieves an underwater positioning mean accuracy of 13.3 cm in 2D and 19.0 cm in 3D with the multi-lateration positioning method and concludes the potential of the magnetic field-based positioning technique for underwater applications. A similar accuracy was also achieved for various indoor environments that were used to test the influence of cluttered environment and of cross environment. The low cost and power consumption system is scalable for extensive coverage area and could plug-and-play without pre-calibration.

AB Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are emerging as attractive power sources for light-weight applications (e.g., unmanned aerial and autonomous underwater vehicles) and large electric vehicles (such as trucks and buses) incentivized by their low-cost and high theoretical gravimetric energy density. The replacement of liquid electrolytes with solid-state electrolytes offers a perfect opportunity to improve the safety and energy density of Li-S batteries; however, poor interfacial contact and/or low ionic conductivity at room temperature in the absence of liquid components severely handicap the electrochemical performance of all solid-state Li-S batteries. With the addition of a minimum amount of a liquid plasticizer, a compound which can effectively mitigate the interfacial issues and enhance the ionic transport in both electrolyte and electrode, quasi-solid-state electrolytes (QSSEs) for Li-S batteries, have gained significant attention in recent years. In this review, recent advances and progresses on the development of quasi-solid-state Li-S batteries (QSSLSBs) are scrutinized. Strategies on building high-performance QSSLSBs using polymer-based and inorganic-based QSSEs are intensively discussed on the basis of estimated practical energy density in each cell configuration. Challenges and future directions on the improvement of QSSLSBs are also presented.

TI Persistent Stereo Visual Localization on Cross-Modal Invariant Map

DT Article
DE Visual localization; persistent autonomy; map maintenance; map
   incorporated bundle adjustment
ID SLAM; NAVIGATION; FRAMEWORK
AB Autonomous mobile vehicles are expected to perform persistent and accurate localization with low-cost equipment. To achieve this goal, we propose a stereo camera based visual localization method using a modified laser map, which takes the advantage of both the low cost of camera, and high geometric precision of laser data to achieve long-term performance. Considering that LiDAR and camera give measurements of the same environment in different modalities, the cross-modal invariance is investigated to modify the laser map for visual localization. Specifically, a map learning algorithm is introduced to sample the robust subsets in laser maps that are useful for visual localization using multi-session visual and laser data. Further, a generative map model is derived to describe this crossmodal invariance, based on which two types of measurements are defined to model the laser map points as appropriate visual observations. Tightly coupling these measurements within the local bundle adjustment during online sliding-window based visual odometry, the vehicle can achieve robust localization even one year after the map was built. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both the public KITTI datasets and self-collected datasets in our campus, which include seasonal, illumination and object variations. On all experimental localization sessions, our method provides satisfactory results, even when the direction is opposite to that in the mapping session, verifying the superior performance of the laser map based visual localization method.

AB The main interest of this paper is to analyze the mobility acceptance factors of an automated shuttle bus last-mile service. There is limited research on the passengers' perception of security and safety of automated mobility, whereas prior research is mostly based on surveys interested in attitudes towards self-driving vehicles, without being linked to the experience. We, on the other hand, are interested in passengers' feeling of security and safety, after taking a ride with an automated shuttle in an open urban environment. For studying this, we conducted an automated shuttle bus last-mile pilot during a four-month period in the city of Tallinn in late 2019. The method is a case study focusing on one city with several tools for data collection applied (surveys, interviews, document analysis). The pilot, open and free for everybody, attracted approximately 4000 passengers, out of which 4% responded to the online feedback survey. For studying the operational capacity, we had a panel interview with operators of the shuttle service, in addition to analyzing daily operational log files. The results indicate that passengers' perceived feeling of security and safety onboard was remarkably high, after taking a ride (and lower without a ride, in a different control group). The bus was operated only if operational capacity was secured, thus having significant downtime in service due to environment, technology and traffic-related factors.

AB Special approaches are required to integrate low-cost MEMS-based inertial navigation system (MEMS-INS) with global navigation satellite system (GNSS). This article proposes a robust GNSS/MEMS-strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), the tightly coupled navigation approach aided by non-holonomic constraint (NHC). The tight integration model is adopted to overcome the accuracy degradation caused by changing satellite geometry and frequent GNSS outages in urban areas. The innovation-based test statistic is devised to enhance the filtering with the resistance to GNSS outliers. To further improve the stand-alone accuracy during relatively long GNSS outages, the virtual measurement is also introduced using the NHC condition that land vehicle does not slip and always remain in contact with the ground. The field test results with continuous GNSS aiding indicate that the proposed algorithm can improve overall accuracy in position, velocity, and attitude by about 16, 43, and 19% with immunity from GNSS outliers, compared with the traditional loosely coupled (LC) method. Even during 60-s GNSS outages, the proposed algorithm can effectively compensate MEMS-SINS errors, accomplishing the overall accuracy improvements by about 46% (position), 35% (velocity), and 15% (attitude), compared with the traditional LC counterpart.

TI Motion Planning Under Uncertainty with Complex Agents and Environments
   via Hybrid Search
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB As autonomous systems and robots are applied to more real world situations, they must reason about uncertainty when planning actions. Mission success oftentimes cannot be guaranteed and the planner must reason about the probability of failure. Unfortunately, computing a trajectory that satisfies mission goals while constraining the probability of failure is difficult because of the need to reason about complex, multidimensional probability distributions. Recent methods have seen success using chance-constrained, model-based planning. However, the majority of these methods can only handle simple environment and agent models. We argue that there are two main drawbacks of current approaches to goal-directed motion planning under uncertainty. First, current methods suffer from an inability to deal with expressive environment models such as 3D non-convex obstacles. Second, most planners rely on considerable simplifications when computing trajectory risk including approximating the agent's dynamics, geometry, and uncertainty. In this article, we apply hybrid search to the risk-bound, goal-directed planning problem. The hybrid search consists of a region planner and a trajectory planner. The region planner makes discrete choices by reasoning about geometric regions that the autonomous agent should visit in order to accomplish its mission. In formulating the region planner, we propose landmark regions that help produce obstacle-free paths. The region planner passes paths through the environment to a trajectory planner; the task of the trajectory planner is to optimize trajectories that respect the agent's dynamics and the user's desired risk of mission failure. We discuss three approaches to modeling trajectory risk: a CDF-based approach, a sampling-based collocation method, and an algorithm named Shooting Method Monte Carlo. These models allow computation of trajectory risk with more complex environments, agent dynamics, geometries, and models of uncertainty than past approaches. A variety of 2D and 3D test cases are presented including a linear case, a Dubins car model, and an underwater autonomous vehicle. The method is shown to outperform other methods in terms of speed and utility of the solution. Additionally, the models of trajectory risk are shown to better approximate risk in simulation.
