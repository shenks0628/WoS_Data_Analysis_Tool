AB The fact that real-time autonomous vehicle (AV) traffic volume can be collected without a field detector by virtue of advanced global positioning system (GPS) and wireless communication technologies can render a promising solution to online monitoring of traffic volume in the upcoming AV era. To demonstrate this opportunity, this paper proposes a newmethod tomonitor real-time motorway traffic volumes for road locations where no detector is installed using AV traffic volume. Themodeling concept is based on the obvious fact that AV traffic volume is a direct portion of total traffic volume. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated through an experimental study using real-world GPS-enabled smartphone vehicle navigation data. The results show that online motorway traffic volume can be effectively monitored throughout the day with 5.69% average error at the 14.91% penetration rate of AVs during the daytime. Therefore, it is expected that AVs can at least be used as complementary means for the role of vehicle detectors in the near future due to the fact that the detection range of AVs is not spatially constrained.

AB This paper addresses a neural network-based formation control of underactuated AUVs with limited torque input under environmental disturbances in three-dimensional space. For this purpose, a second order dynamic model is developed based on a coordinate transformation for underactuated AUV5. Then, a saturated formation controller is proposed by employing saturation functions in order to bound closed loop error variables. This technique effectively reduces the risk of actuators saturation by decreasing the amplitude of generated control signals. Multi-layer neural networks are combined with an adaptive robust control strategy to deal with the actuator saturation and model uncertainties including unknown vehicle parameters, approximation errors, and constant or time-varying environmental disturbances induced by waves and ocean currents. A Lyapunov synthesis is used to guarantee semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking errors for all AUVs. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed formation controller. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on sensors such as camera and LiDAR, which provide real-time information about their surroundings for the tasks of perception, planning and control. Typically, a LiDAR can only provide sparse point cloud owing to a limited number of scanning lines. By employing depth completion, a dense depth map can be generated by assigning each camera pixel a corresponding depth value. However, the existing depth completion convolutional neural networks are very complex that requires high-end GPUs for processing, and thus they are not applicable to real-time autonomous driving. In this article, a light-weight network is proposed for the task of LiDAR point cloud depth completion. With an astonishing 96.2% reduction in the number of parameters, it still achieves comparable performance (9.3% better in MAE but 3.9% worse in RMSE) to the state-of-the-art network. For real-time embedded platforms, depthwise separable technique is applied to both convolution and deconvolution operations and the number of parameters decreases further by a factor of 7.3, with only a small percentage increase in error performance. Moreover, a system-on-chip architecture for depth completion is developed on a PYNQ-based FPGA platform that achieves real-time processing for HDL-64E LiDAR at the speed 11.1 frame per second.

AB This work presents an algorithmic approach to the problem of strategy assignment to the members of a swarm of autonomous vehicles. The proposed methodology draws inspiration from the artificial immune system (AIS), where a large number of antibodies cooperate in order to protect an organism from foreign threats by local exchange of information. The decentralized nature of the methodology does not suffer from problems like the need of a central control unit, the high maintenance costs and the risks associated with having a single point of system failure, which are common to centralized control techniques. Decentralized and distributed optimization schemes employ simple algorithms, which are fast, robust and can run locally on an autonomous unit due to their low processing power requirements. In contrast to standard AIS-based decentralized schemes, the proposed methodology makes use of a dynamic formulation of the available strategies and avoids the possibility of choosing an invalid strategy, which may lead to inferior swarm performance. The methodology is further enhanced by a dual strategy activation decay technique and a blind threat-follow rule. Statistical testing on different case studies based on "enemy search and engage" type scenarios in a simulated environment demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed algorithm against the standard AIS, an enhanced AIS version and a centralized particle swarm optimization (PSO) based methodology.

AB In this study, a new method was developed to extend the flight distance of unmanned aerial vehicles such as quadcopters that operate on a limited battery capacity. The suggested method consists of a high-altitude flight initiation system, which uses a carrier rocket, and an autonomous ramp flight algorithm. First, a quadcopter, called a mission quadcopter in this research, is loaded onto the carrier rocket by a folding mechanism, and the rocket flies to a designated height. Then, the carrier rocket releases the mission quadcopter at the high altitude and achieves flight deployment after an unfolding process. Subsequently, the airdropped mission quadcopter stabilizes its pose and flights toward the selected target point. During the flight, it adopts an autonomous ramp flying trajectory. Ramp flying is performed from the sky to the ground surface instead of conventional step shape flying to minimize the flight trajectory and energy consumed while flying. Experiments were performed in Nevada, USA during an international rocket-based airdrop competition, ARLISS (A Rocket Launch for International Student Satellite). The mission quadcopter's real-time latitude, longitude, and altitude were measured to confirm the position information regarding the quadcopter's flight trajectory. The mission quadcopter successfully separated from the carrier rocket, deployed for flight at a high altitude, turned to the target point, performed autonomous ramp flying, and landed.

AB With an increasing interest in the deployment of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to support complex ocean operations, high-speed USVs (>= 40 knots) have become an important option, especially in accomplishing demanding tasks such as coastal guarding. At present, there is a vast amount of studies focusing on the development of USVs' autonomous navigation systems, and the results of most of them have only been verified by simulations or demonstrations on low-speed experimental USVs (<= 20 knots). It remains unclear how high-speed USVs would perform in real applications. In particular, when USVs are navigating at high-speed, reliable obstacle detections and robust motion control become increasingly difficult to achieve than in normal conditions. This paper therefore presents a new autonomous navigation system for high-speed USVs with the system software and hardware been designed on the basis for ensuring a safe and reliable operation. Within such a system, a collision avoidance algorithm based on velocity obstacle able to adjust the USV's heading and speed in real-time has been integrated. A local environment modelling method and a heading maintain method by considering Coast Guard International Regulations for Avoiding Collision at Sea are proposed to improve the reliability and stability of the system. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system has been verified and validated by hardware-in-the-loop simulation tests and sea trials on a high-speed USV ("Tianxing No. 1") in practical maritime environments. Results show that the autonomous navigation system adapts to the characteristics of high-speed USVs and can guide high-speed USVs (>= 40 knots) in realising a safe autonomous navigation, which significantly improves the USV's autonomy level.

AB This paper presents an architecture for the development of mobile microgrids using autonomous vehicles for the recovery of electrical power in postdisaster scenarios. The goal is to facilitate the integration of the different disciplines involved and address interrelated challenges in interaction between the disparate components of the system and the physical world. The architecture described in this paper has emerged through a combination of hardware development and experimental studies. The proposed layout will create an autonomous mobile microgrid system consisting of a team of ground robots capable of navigating in a disaster-affected area, making electrical connections, and supplying and controlling the electrical power needed by the loads in the area. This system has the scalability characteristics of an ad hoc system and can reconfigure itself depending on the changes in demanded performance of the microgrid.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper is focused on developing mobile microgrids using autonomous vehicles. An autonomous mobile microgrid can be used to establish microgrids in an area without human intervention or it can be used to achieve energy autonomy for robots. Energy autonomy allows robots perform missions that extend beyond their battery life and helps robots to recharge themselves as they enter a low battery state. The structure of a mobile microgrid heavily relies on two disciplines of robotics and power electrics and can further benefit from communication, optimization, and controls theories. This paper discusses and suggests development directions for different disciplines involved to ease the integration process. Also, the efforts are aimed to improve the overall performance of the mobile microgrid system while keeping limitations and potentials of each discipline in consideration.

Unlike collision avoidance system of other unmanned vehicles, the collision avoidance system for autonomous ship aims at not only deriving a reasonable and safe path to the goal but also keeping COLREGs (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea). The heuristic search based on the fuzzy relational products is adopted to achieve the general purpose of collision avoidance system; deriving a reasonable and safe path. The rule of "action to avoid collision" is adopted for the other necessary and sufficient condition; keeping the COLREGs.

TI Intelligent UUVs: Some issues on ROV dynamic positioning

ID UNDERWATER VEHICLES; THRUSTER DYNAMICS; CONTROL-SYSTEM; DESIGN
AB Intelligent unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) fall under two main group categories: the remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), which are characterized by remote operation and presence of a tether cable; and the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which are characterized by their autonomous behavior and absence of a tether cable. One fundamental issue of the UUV design is the dynamic position control system. This system plays a crucial role together with the sensor architecture in the degree of system autonomy that can be achieved. This paper is concerned with a few issues when dynamically positioning remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs). By restricting the operating regime of ROVs to slow velocity requirements we investigate the implementation of a few decentralized control strategies and compare their performance measures, which are assessed by simulating a nonlinear ROV system model for each control strategy. Issues concerning input tracking, disturbance rejection, and plant variations are discussed. Our evaluations consider the use of linear PID feedback and feedforward variants, and a robust nonlinear control strategies applied to a full order, fully coupled, and nonlinear vehicle model. These evaluations consider a vehicle undertaking standard mission activities where the tether cable dynamics, with load estimates obtained from a lumped mass cable model, and the vehicle actuator system are present. We show that much of the performance deterioration may be attributed mainly due to cable inertia. We also verify that the nonlinear robust control strategy does not necessarily allow for better performance over the linear feedback control strategies implemented when vehicle motions are confined to slow velocity profiles. These and other partial results will aid the design of the control system for an underwater vehicle currently under construction.

AB Driven by the ever-increasing requirements of autonomous vehicles, such as traffic monitoring and driving assistant, deep learning-based object detection (DL-OD) has been increasingly attractive in intelligent transportation systems. However, it is difficult for the existing DL-OD schemes to realize the responsible, cost-saving, and energy-efficient autonomous vehicle systems due to low their inherent defects of low timeliness and high energy consumption. In this paper, we propose an object detection (OD) system based on edge-cloud cooperation and reconstructive convolutional neural networks, which is called Edge YOLO. This system can effectively avoid the excessive dependence on computing power and uneven distribution of cloud computing resources. Specifically, it is a lightweight OD framework realized by combining pruning feature extraction network and compression feature fusion network to enhance the efficiency of multi-scale prediction to the largest extent. In addition, we developed an autonomous driving platform equipped with NVIDIA Jetson for system-level verification. We experimentally demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of Edge YOLO on COCO2017 and KITTI data sets, respectively. According to COCO2017 standard datasets with a speed of 26.6 frames per second (FPS), the results show that the number of parameters in the entire network is only 25.67 MB, while the accuracy (mAP) is up to 47.3%.

AB As connected, electric, and autonomous vehicle (AV) services are developed for cities, the research is conclusive that the use of these services must be shared to achieve maximum efficiency. Yet, few agencies have prioritised designing an AV system that focuses on dynamic ridepooling, and there remains a gap in the understanding of what makes people willing to share their rides. However, in 2017, the Australian transport authority Transport for New South Wales launched over a dozen trials for on-demand, shared public transport, including AVs. In this paper, we investigate the user willingness-to-share, based on experiences from one of these trials. Four focus groups (19 participants in total) were held in New South Wales with active users of either the trialled on-demand dynamic ridepooling service (Keoride) or commercial ridepooling (UberPool). Through thematic analysis of the focus group conversations, the cost, comfort, convenience, safety, community culture, and trust in authority emerged as factors that influenced the willingness-to-share. When presented with driverless scenarios, the focus group participants had significant concerns about the unknown behaviour of their co-passengers, revealing sharing anxiety as a significant barrier to the adoption of shared AVs. This paper identifies previously disregarded factors that influence the adoption of AVs and dynamic ridepooling and offers insights on how potential users' sharing anxiety can be mitigated.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a hot topic in the field of robotic research in the last few decades. Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles (AUV) are being used for different tasks like rescue, search, monitoring, aerial operations as well as underwater operations even AUV can aid where human reachability is impossible. Localization, tracking, and mapping are fundamentals of an autonomous system. The main problem of AUV, which attracts researchers, is the simultaneous localization and mapping, where no external positioning source is available like GPS. There are many proposed techniques and algorithms which can be used to solve this problem of AUV like GPS (Global Positioning System), Motion Capture System (MCS), Visual System, etc. with limitations. Some probabilistic solutions like Graph SLAM, EKF based SALM, and Fast SLAM are also available for this problem. EKF based SLAM is used for the non-linear model but has different issues (like inconsistency) when the map becomes large and complex. It does not work well with the non-Gaussian distribution. Fast SLAM algorithm is used with the non-Gaussian distribution. It can provide high speed computation and good accuracy but has issues during the resampling processes like particle depletion and degeneracy. On the other hand, Graph based SLAM can deal with large and complex maps and can process a large number of landmarks accurately and it can perform much better than EKF and Fast SLAM.

AB For the control of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), most existing methods focus on model-based strategies. They require explicit knowledge of car-following dynamics of human-driven vehicles that are non-trivial to identify accurately. In this paper, instead of relying on a parametric car-following model, we introduce a data-driven non-parametric strategy, called DeeP-LCC (Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control), to achieve safe and optimal control of CAVs in mixed traffic. We first utilize Willems' fundamental lemma to obtain a data-centric representation of mixed traffic behavior. This is justified by rigorous analysis on controllability and observability properties of mixed traffic. We then employ a receding horizon strategy to solve a finite-horizon optimal control problem at each time step, in which input/output constraints are incorporated for collision-free guarantees. Numerical experiments validate the performance of DeeP-LCC compared to a standard predictive controller that requires an accurate model. Multiple nonlinear traffic simulations further confirm its great potential on improving traffic efficiency, driving safety, and fuel economy.

AB This study presents an effective method for detecting and tracking vehicles in front, of a camera-assisted car during nighttime driving. The proposed method identifies vehicles based on detecting and locating vehicle headlights and taillights by using the techniques of image segmentation and pattern analysis. First, to effectively extract bright. objects of interest., a fast bright object segmentation process based on automatic multilevel histogram thresholding is applied on the nighttime road-scene images. This automatic multilevel thresholding approach can provide robustness and adaptability for the detection system to be operated well under various illumination conditions at night. The extracted bright objects are processed by a spatial Clustering and tracking procedure by locating and analyzing the spatial and temporal features of vehicle light patterns, and estimating the distance between the detected vehicles and the camera-assisted car. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting and tracking vehicles at night.

DT Article
AB This article presents a preliminary work domain theory and identifies autonomous vehicle, navigational, and mission capabilities and challenges for small unmanned aerial systems (SUASs) responding to a radiological disaster. Radiological events are representative of applications that involve flying at low altitudes and close proximities to structures. To more formally understand the guidance and control demands, the environment in which the SUAS has to function, and the expected missions, tasks, and strategies to respond to an incident, a discovery experiment was performed in 2013. The experiment placed a radiological source emitting at 10 times background radiation in the simulated collapse of a multistory hospital. Two SUASs, an AirRobot 100B and a Leptron Avenger, were inserted with subject matter experts into the response, providing high operational fidelity. The SUASs were expected by the responders to fly at altitudes between 0.3 and 30 m, and hover at 1.5 m from urban structures. The proximity to a building introduced a decrease in GPS satellite coverage, challenging existing vehicle autonomy. Five new navigational capabilities were identified: scan, obstacle avoidance, contour following, environment-aware return to home, and return to highest reading. Furthermore, the data-to-decision process could be improved with autonomous data digestion and visualization capabilities. This article is expected to contribute to a better understanding of autonomy in a SUAS, serve as a requirement document for advanced autonomy, and illustrate how discovery experimentation serves as a design tool for autonomous vehicles.

AB In recent years, many unmanned vehicle designs and autonomous driving functions have been introduced in the automotive industry to increase the safety and versatility of multiple vehicle designs. It is critical to select a plant vehicle model and a compact uncertainty representation regardless of the vehicle scale for vast deployment. This article introduces a dimensionless representation of a dynamic vehicle model that is suitable for generalized dynamic analysis. Demonstrations included in this article showed that the compact uncertainty bounds of the dimensionless parameters could be used to generate an adaptive observer suitable for full-sized and corresponding scaled vehicles. The proposed dimensionless model-based observer can assess motion states, mass, center of gravity displacement, and the tire stiffness online with common onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU). The effectiveness and sensitivity of the proposed technique are highlighted through simulations and experiments on scaled test vehicles.

ID RISK; NAVIGATION; SYSTEM
AB Collision avoidance protocols such as COLREGS are written primarily for human operators resulting in a rule set that is open to some interpretation, difficult to quantify, and challenging to evaluate. Increasing use of autonomous control of vehicles emphasizes the need to more uniformly establish entry and exit criteria for collision avoidance rules, adopt a means to quantitatively evaluate performance, and establish a road test for autonomous marine vehicle collision avoidance. This paper presents a means to quantify and subsequently evaluate the otherwise subjective nature of COLREGS thus providing a path toward standardized evaluation and certification of protocol-constrained collision avoidance systems based on admiralty case law and on-water experience. Notional algorithms are presented for evaluation of COLREGS collision avoidance rules to include overtaking, head-on, crossing, give-way, and stand-on rules as well as applicable entry criteria. These rules complement and enable an autonomous collision avoidance road test as a first iteration of algorithm certification prior to vessels operating in human-present environments. Additional COLREGS rules are discussed for future development. Both real-time and post-mission protocol evaluation tools are introduced. While the motivation of these techniques applies to improvement of autonomous marine collision avoidance, the concepts for protocol evaluation and certification extend naturally to human-operated vessels. Evaluation of protocols governing other physical domains may also benefit from adapting these techniques to their cases.

AB Advanced cooperative vehicle fleet technology has shown potential for improving safety and efficiency near freeway bottlenecks. This study focuses on resolution strategies for cooperative vehicle fleets for reducing rear-end collision risks near recurrent bottlenecks. Based on different vehicle types and time requirements and intentions, different resolution strategies are proposed to determine the travel rules and sequence of vehicle flows when a cooperative vehicle fleet needs to change its original fixed formation. Then, a series of experimental scenarios is designed by setting different vehicle types (conventional vehicles and connected and automated vehicles), requirements and intentions in different areas of multilane freeways. The experimental scenarios are simulated based on the MATLAB platform to test the proposed strategy. The results show that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce vehicle rear-end collisions, and the average cost savings of the conflict resolution process is 25.71%. The proposed strategies in this research provide autonomous resolutions for vehicle conflicts in different scenarios.

AB The environmental perception and control are the core issues of driverless vehicles. Considering the weak signal of global positioning system (GPS) and the difficulty of road information acceptance in rural area, the DIPLECS autonomous driving datasets is selected. The roads in dataset are classified by support vector machine algorithm (SVM), and established into the road template library. Then, on different roads, images and steering direction are used as the input and labels of the training set for back propagation neural network (BPNN) model. Finally, the effect of the model is verified on the video clip. The results show that the accuracy of road classification reaches 99.8% through SVM, the shortest time consumption of a single frame is 0.9 ms. The highest accuracy of steering prediction is 94.5%, and it only takes 0.224 ms to detect a frame. The algorithm meets the requirements of accuracy and real-time, and it can effectively assist and warn the drivers or automatic driving systems.

AB Reservation-based intersection control for autonomous vehicles has the potential to make greater use of intersection capacity. Indeed, previous studies on the first-come-first-served (FCFS) policy (which prioritizes vehicles by order of their reservation request) have shown improvements over optimized signals. However, in certain situations, such as asymmetric intersections, FCFS easily performs worse than signals. To address this issue, we propose two new reservation policies, WEIGHTED and PHASED. WEIGHTED weights vehicle delay by signal timings, and PHASED simulates a signal but allows red phase turning movements that will not cause a collision. We test these policies on a city network and an arterial bottleneck intersection subnetwork and show that PHASED performs better than WEIGHTED in some scenarios, and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that using a combination of PHASED and WEIGHTED can perform better than using either one alone for the entire network. Results show that these policies provide effective and easily implemented alternatives to FCFS for reservations.

AB Automated driving is predicted to enhance traffic safety, transport efficiency, and driver comfort. To extend the capability of current advanced driver assistance systems, and eventually realize fully automated driving, the intelligent vehicle system must have the ability to plan different maneuvers while adapting to the surrounding traffic environment. This paper presents an algorithm for longitudinal and lateral trajectory planning for automated driving maneuvers where the vehicle does not have right of way, i.e., yielding maneuvers. Such maneuvers include, e.g., lane change, roundabout entry, and intersection crossing. In the proposed approach, the traffic environment which the vehicle must traverse is incorporated as constraints on its longitudinal and lateral positions. The trajectory planning problem can thereby be formulated as two loosely coupled low-complexity model predictive control problems for longitudinal and lateral motion. Simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed trajectory planning algorithm to generate smooth collision-free maneuvers which are appropriate for various traffic situations.

AB This paper presents a new approach for a safe autonomous navigation based on reliable state space reachability analysis. This latter improves an already proposed flexible Navigation Strategy based on Sequential Waypoint Reaching (NSbSWR) framework (Vilca et al., 2015), while considering explicitly different uncertainties in modeling and/or perception. Indeed, NSbSWR is an emergent concept that exploits its flexibility and genericity to avoid frequent complex trajectories' planning/re-planning. The paper's main contribution is to introduce a reachability analysis scheme as a reliable risk assessment and management policy ensuring safe autonomous navigation between the successive assigned waypoints. For this aim, interval analysis is employed to propagate uncertainties influencing the vehicle's dynamics into the navigation system states. By solving an ordinary differential equation with uncertain variables and parameters via an interval Taylor series expansion method, all the vehicle potential reachable state-space is revealed. According to the obtained bounds of the reachable sets, a decision about the navigation safety is made. Once a collision risk is captured, the risk management layer acts to update the control parameters to master the critical situation and guarantee a proper reaching of waypoint, while avoiding any risky state. Several simulation results prove the safety, efficiency and robustness of the overall navigation under uncertainties.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vision-based object detection is an essential component of autonomous driving. Because vehicles typically have limited on-board computing resources, a small-sized detection model is required. Simultaneously, high object detection accuracy and real-time inference detection speeds are required to ensure safety while driving. In this paper, an anchor-free lightweight object detector for autonomous driving called ALODAD is proposed. ALODAD incorporates an attention scheme into the lightweight neural network GhostNet and builds an anchor-free detection framework to achieve lower computational costs and provide parameters with high detection accuracy. Specifically, the lightweight backbone neural network integrates a convolutional block attention model that analyzes the valuable features from traffic scene images to generate an accurate bounding box, and then constructs feature pyramids for multi-scale object detection. The proposed method adds an intersection over union (IoU) branch to the decoupled detector to rank the vast number of candidate detections accurately. To increase the data diversity, data augmentation was used during training. Extensive experiments based on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method offers improved performance compared to the baseline. The proposed method can achieve an increased detection accuracy while meeting the real-time requirements of autonomous driving. The proposed method was compared with the YOLOv5 and RetinaNet models and 98.7% and 94.5% were obtained for the average precision metrics AP50 and AP75, respectively, on the BCTSDB dataset.

DE Helicopter; Autonomous air vehicle; Robotics; Trajectory; Smooth speed
AB This work is centered in the definition of a transition management system for a small autonomous helicopter based on trajectory smoothing and a finite state machine (FSM). A smooth flight schedule decreases transients originated by direction changes and flight mode transitions (e.g., horizontal flight to hover mode). Although previous works have presented trajectory generation and FSM oriented controls, no previous studies have mixed these approaches in a single framework together with speed transitions. The proposed methods are validated in simulation with a realistic dynamic model of a small helicopter.

AB The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has accelerated the development of several systems that are elicited from it. This boom has made the systems vulnerable to security attacks and allows considerable bias in order to handle errors in the system. This puts humans at risk and leaves machines, robots, and data defenseless. Trustworthy AI (TAI) guarantees human value and the environment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art on how to build a Trustworthy and eXplainable AI, taking into account that AI is a black box with little insight into its underlying structure. The paper also discusses various TAI components, their corresponding bias, and inclinations that make the system unreliable. The study also discusses the necessity for TAI in many verticals, including banking, healthcare, autonomous system, and IoT. We unite the ways of building trust in all fragmented areas of data protection, pricing, expense, reliability, assurance, and decision-making processes utilizing TAI in several diverse industries and to differing degrees. It also emphasizes the importance of transparent and post hoc explanation models in the construction of an eXplainable AI and lists the potential drawbacks and pitfalls of building eXplainable AI. Finally, the policies for developing TAI in the autonomous vehicle construction sectors are thoroughly examined and eclectic ways of building a reliable, interpretable, eXplainable, and Trustworthy AI systems are explained to guarantee safe autonomous vehicle systems.

AB Environmental DNA (eDNA) can be used to identify macroorganisms and describe biodiversity, and thus has promise to supplement biological monitoring in marine ecosystems. Despite this promise, scaling sample acquisition to the spatial and temporal scales needed for effective monitoring would require prohibitively large investments in time and human resources. To address this challenge, we evaluated the efficacy of an autonomous eDNA sampling system and compare results obtained to traditional eDNA sampling methods. The autonomous sampling instrument consisted of the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) coupled to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We tested equivalency between the ESP and traditional eDNA sampling techniques by comparing the quantification of eDNA across a broad range of taxa, from microbes (SAR11), phytoplankton (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.), and invertebrates (krill: Euphausia pacifica) to vertebrates (anchovy: Engraulis mordax). No significant differences in eDNA densities were observed between the two sample collection and filtration methods. eDNA filters collected by the ESP were preserved and stable for 21 days, the typical deployment length of the instrumentation. Finally, we demonstrated the unique capabilities of an autonomous, mobile ESP during a deployment near Monterey Bay, CA, by remotely and repeatedly sampling a water mass over 12 h. The development of a mobile ESP demonstrates the promise of utilizing eDNA measurements to observe complex biological processes in the ocean absent a human presence.

AB In autonomous driving, many learning-based methods for motion planing have been proposed in literature, which can predict motion commands directly from the sensory data of the environment, but these methods can neither predict multiple motion commands, such as steering angle, accelerator and brake, nor balance errors among different motion commands. In this paper, we propose a deep cascaded neural network for predicting multiple motion commands which can be trained in an end-to-end manner for autonomous driving. The proposed deep cascaded neural network consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and three long short-term memory (LSTM) units, fed with images from a front-facing camera installed at the vehicle. As the outputs, the proposed model can predict thee motion planning commands simultaneously including steering angle, acceleration, and brake to enable the autonomous driving. In order to balance errors among different motion commands and improve prediction accuracy, we propose a new network training algorithm, where three independent loss functions are designed to separately update the weights in the three LSTMs connected to three motion commands. We conduct comprehensive experiments using the data from a driving simulator and compare our method with the state-of-the-art methods. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed motion planning model achieves better accuracy performance than other models.

AB This paper presents the cooperative adaptive cruise control implementation of Team Mekar at the Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge (GCDC). The Team Mekar vehicle used a dSpace microautobox for access to the vehicle controller area network bus and for control of the autonomous throttle intervention and the electric-motor-operated brake pedal. The vehicle was equipped with real-time kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK GPS) and an IEEE 802.11p modem installed in an onboard computer for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. The Team Mekar vehicle did not have an original-equipment-manufacturers-supplied adaptive cruise control (ACC). ACC/Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) based on V2V-communicated GPS position/velocity and preceding vehicle acceleration feedforward were implemented in the Team Mekar vehicle. This paper presents experimental and simulation results of the Team Mekar CACC implementation, along with a discussion of the problems encountered during the GCDC cooperative mobility runs.

AB With the ever-increasing demand for the content delivery services in autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs), caching popular contents in the edge nodes in advance is expected to reduce the transmission delay. Current works on the contents cached in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) or roadside units (RSUs) are facing the problems of limited caching size and high deployment cost. In this paper, by exploiting the advantages of high caching space and flexibility of truck platoons composed of connected and autonomous trucks (CATs), we propose a secure content delivery service for CATs based on coalition formation game. Firstly, in order to protect the security and privacy of content delivery services, a differential privacy model is proposed to protect the sensitive information of CATs. Meanwhile, the differential privacy model is combined with the incentive based trust evaluation model to monitor the behaviors of CATs. In the incentive based models, CATs are encouraged to improve their trust values to obtain higher utilities and find a balance between confidence levels and utilities. Moreover, a coalition formation game is established among CATs with the same driving route, in which all CATs can maximize their utilities with the formation of several minor coalitions. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.

AB With the emerging interest in the autonomous driving level at 4 and 5 comes a necessity to provide accurate and versatile frameworks to evaluate the algorithms used in autonomous vehicles. There is a clear gap in the field of autonomous driving simulators. It covers testing and parameter tuning of a key component of autonomous driving systems, SLAM, frameworks targeting off-road and safety-critical environments. It also includes taking into consideration the non-idealistic nature of the real-life sensors, associated phenomena and measurement errors. We created a LiDAR simulator that delivers accurate 3D point clouds in real time. The point clouds are generated based on the sensor placement and the LiDAR type that can be set using configurable parameters. We evaluate our solution based on comparison of the results using an actual device, Velodyne VLP-16, on real-life tracks and the corresponding simulations. We measure the error values obtained using Google Cartographer SLAM algorithm and the distance between the simulated and real point clouds to verify their accuracy. The results show that our simulation (which incorporates measurement errors and the rolling shutter effect) produces data that can successfully imitate the real-life point clouds. Due to dedicated mechanisms, it is compatible with the Robotic Operating System (ROS) and can be used interchangeably with data from actual sensors, which enables easy testing, SLAM algorithm parameter tuning and deployment.

AB Over the last few decades, acoustic fish telemetry has developed into a viable approach for remote monitoring of fish behaviour in the marine environment. Simultaneously, unmanned surface and underwater vehicles have found extensive use as scalable, persistent and cost-effective platforms for ocean observation. Equipping such robotic vehicles with fish telemetry receivers constitutes an emerging approach with the potential to significantly push the current operational limits of fish movement studies at sea. Here, we present an energy-autonomous robotic fish telemetry platform realised through the integration of a real-time acoustic receiver into an ocean-going wave- and solar-powered unmanned surface vehicle. The vehicle frame and energy harvesting solutions are based on the commercially available AutoNaut USV, while the vehicle's control and communication systems were developed using open-source software and standard hardware components. The open architecture permitted deep integration of the acoustic receiver as a system-level payload making fish detections and other sensor data available in real-time to the vehicle's onboard control system. The vehicle is thus prepared with local situational awareness to support autonomous control during vehicle-fish encounters, as well as conventional interfaces for remote piloting and data management through long-range wireless communication links and the Internet. The vehicle concept was investigated theoretically and experimentally in an acoustic range test and a full-scale sea trial. When driven passively by waves, tag detection performance was comparable to that of traditional moored receivers, while activation of the auxiliary electric thruster caused a reduction in detection radius of more than 50%, confirming wave-power as the ideal mode of propulsion. Finally, by deploying the AutoNaut over a period of several days at the outskirts of a Norwegian fjord during the seaward migration of Atlantic salmon post-smolts, we demonstrated that the vehicle was able to detect an acoustically tagged post-smolt into the open ocean beyond the reach of the fjord's stationary receiver grid, while using only wave- and solar energy harvesting to power its operation. The ability to observe small individual fish in the ocean environment using an energy-autonomous robotic vehicle creates novel and unprecedented opportunities for scientific inquiry in fish behaviour and movement ecology studies at sea.

AB This study aims to inform the development of pedestrian-friendly self-driving vehicle (SDV) policies by investigating how perceptions of pedestrian comfort and safety are affected by SDV technology. We use structural topic modeling to investigate themes in open response survey comments from participants who viewed and rated short video clips of pedestrian interactions with motor vehicles. Although they were all human-driven vehicles (HDVs), participants were told that half of the interactions (randomly for each individual) involved SDVs. This deception-based survey design enabled isolation of the intrinsic effect of automated driving on comfort and safety perceptions across a broad sample of the population. Model results identified latent topics significantly more likely to be discussed for SDV versus HDV interactions, ceteris paribus. There is a greater focus on pedestrian responsibility to be cautious, aware, and predictable in interactions with SDVs than HDVs. Topics more associated with SDVs tend to focus on strict rule compliance (obligation fulfillment), whereas topics more associated with HDVs tend to focus on risk mitigation (with less focus on rules). Recommendations to mitigate potential negative impacts of introducing SDVs on the attractiveness of walking include requirements for conservative SDV operation in city streets, limiting potential interactions that require negotiated priority with SDVs (through physical separation and clear traffic controls), and enhancing external communication from SDVs.

AB How to plan the collision-free path effectively is crucial for autonomous ground vehicles to avoid collisions. The vehicle may lose its lateral dynamic stability due to high speed, time-varying speed and multifriction road during tracking the collision-free path. In this article, an advanced collision avoidance framework is proposed to avoid collision efficiently with road friction estimation and dynamic stability control. First, an improved A* algorithm is constructed to generate a desired trajectory for collision avoidance, which is capable of observing road regulations and overcoming the vehicle mechanical drawbacks. Next, a model predictive control-based path-tracking controller is established to solve the tracking task as a multiconstraint and multitarget optimization problem, where optimized steering angle and additional yaw moment can be calculated. Meanwhile, a novel long short-term memory based road friction coefficient estimator is built to observe road friction. Moreover, electric power steering system controls the steering motor to realize the desired steering angle. The additional yaw moment can be obtained by differential braking. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop platform tests are conducted to validate that the proposed controller can not only avoid collisions effectively, but also have a good performance on keeping the vehicle dynamic stability with accurate road friction estimation.

AB To enable autonomous vehicles to generate smooth and collision-free trajectories and improve their driving performance on structured roads, this paper proposes a hierarchical trajectory planning algorithm based on an improved artificial potential field method. To improve the applicability of the algorithm to complex scenarios, the Frenet coordinate system was established to address these limitations. First, the safety distance model is applied to the risk assessment of the improved artificial potential field method. Then, the hierarchical solution is carried out, and the road solvable convex space and the rough path solution are solved by combining the artificial potential field method. On this basis, the potential field term and the smoothing term cost function are established, and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is used to solve the exact path that meets the requirements of safety and smoothness. Hierarchical planning shortens the solution time by quickly determining the bounds of the convex space. Finally, in the speed planning, in order to take into account the comfort and safety of the occupants, the speed curve is solved by considering the dynamic constraints of the vehicle. The obstacle avoidance effects of the algorithm on static and dynamic obstacles are tested in different simulation scenarios. The results of the simulation experiment show that the proposed algorithm can successfully achieve obstacle avoidance on complex structured roads.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs), here self-driving and driverless vehicles, SAE levels 4 and 5 are becoming more clearly a reality. Potential services based on AVs and their consequences for the transport system are of increasing importance. This paper investigates policy combinations for a world with such services. The policy measures investigated are pricing of public transport (through subsidies), pricing of private motorized transport (through taxation or mobility pricing), and the organization of AV services (monopoly vs. oligopoly, with or without ride-sharing). Further, the perception of travel times for autonomous private cars is considered. All combinations of policies (respectively two to four levels each) were implemented in a simulation to determine their synergies. The applied model was the agent-based transportation simulation MATSim. The scenario employed for the tests was the agglomeration of Zug, Switzerland. The results suggest that, given the current spatial distribution of the demand and the current transport system, AV systems are only able to reduce travel times at the cost of substantial mode shifts and additional vehicle kilometers driven. Of the tested policy measures, although all showed the expected causality, only the organizational form of the AV service had a statistically significant effect. Therefore, this paper suggests that policy makers should be cautious when confronted with the promises of future transport services. To invest the benefits of automation into an improvement of the existing transport system (e.g., automation of public mass transit or complementing public mass transit with ride-sharing AVs in low-demand areas) might be a good alternative.

AB Climate change poses special and new challenges to inland waters, requiring intensive monitoring. An application based on an autonomous operation swimming vehicle (ASV) is being developed that will provide simulations, spatially and depth-resolved water parameter monitoring, bathymetry detection, and respiration measurement. A clustered load system is integrated with a high-resolution sonar system and compared with underwater photogrammetry objects. Additionally, a holistic 3D survey of the water body above and below the water surface is generated. The collected data are used for a simulation environment to train artificial intelligence (AI) in virtual reality (VR). These algorithms are used to improve the autonomous control of the ASV. In addition, possibilities of augmented reality (AR) can be used to visualize the data of the measurements and to use them for future ASV assistance systems. The results of the investigation into a flooded quarry are explained and discussed. There is a comprehensive, high-potential, simple, and rapid monitoring method for inland waters that is suitable for a wide range of scientific investigations and commercial uses due to climate change, simulation, monitoring, analyses, and work preparation.

In addition, overtaking is one of the most difficult and complex functions for the development of autonomous driving technologies because of the dynamic and complicated task involved in the control strategy and electronic control systems, such as steering, throttle, and brake control. This paper proposes a safe overtaking maneuver procedure for an autonomous vehicle based on time to lane crossing (TLC) estimation and the model predictive control scheme. As overtaking is one of the most complex maneuvers that require both lane keeping and lane changing, a vision-based lane-detection system is used to estimate TLC to make a timely and accurate decision about whether to overtake or remain within the lane. Next, to maintain the minimal safe distance and to choose the best timing to overtake, the successive linearization-based model predictive control is employed to derive an optimal vehicle controller, such as throttle, brake, and steering angle control. Simultaneously, it can make certain that the longitudinal acceleration and steering velocity are maintained under constraints to maintain driving safety. Finally, the proposed system is validated by real-world experiments performed on a prototype electric golf cart and executed in real-time on the automotive embedded hardware with limited computational power. In addition, communication between the sensors and actuators as well as the vehicle control unit (VCU) are based on the controller area network (CAN) bus to realize vehicle control and data collection. The experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed overtaking decision and control strategy to handle a variety of driving scenarios, including a lane-following function when a relative yaw angle exists and an overtaking function when the approaching vehicle has a different lateral velocity.

AB Introduction: The purpose of the research was to examine possible barriers to the use of autonomous vehicles (AVs) perceived by people with intellectual disabilities. Access to user-friendly and equitable transportation is a major factor influencing the health and well-being of people with mental disabilities, and AVs have much to offer to intellectually vulnerable travellers. It is important therefore to determine the factors that will encourage mentally disabled people to travel in driverless vehicles.
   Methods: A Structural Topic Modelling (STM) approach was employed to analyse 177 responses of mentally disabled people to an open-ended question concerning their willingness to travel in an AV. Outcomes to the STM, together with data on the sample members' levels of internal locus of control, generalised anxiety, age, gender, prior knowledge of AVs, and the intensity of an individual's disability were then incorporated into a structural equation model constructed to relate attitudinal topics identified by the STM to the participants' willingness to travel in AVs.
   Results: Three categories of attitude towards AVs arose from the STM; respectively involving freedom, fear and curiosity. Two of the three attitudinal topics, freedom and fear, significantly predicted the participants' willingness to use driverless vehicles. The "freedom" topic was significantly explained by generalised anxiety, intensity of disability, and prior knowledge of AVs. Topic two ("fear") depended significantly on generalised anxiety and prior knowledge, and also on locus of control and (female) gender. The third topic ("curiosity") was influenced by locus of control and prior knowledge.
   Conclusion: The results of the study offer a template for government agencies and vehicle manufacturers to apply when formulating public information campaigns promoting the acceptance of driverless vehicles by intellectually disabled people. Public information campaigns targeted at this important segment of the population should incorporate messages based on factors known to affect mentally disabled people's attitudes towards autonomous vehicles.

AB The research on autonomous driving based on deep reinforcement learning algorithms is a research hotspot. Traditional autonomous driving requires human involvement, and the autonomous driving algorithms based on supervised learning must be trained in advance using human experience. To deal with autonomous driving problems, this paper proposes an improved end-to-end deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on the convolutional block attention mechanism, and it is called multi-input attention prioritized deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (MAPDDPG). Both the actor network and the critic network of the model have the same structure with symmetry. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism is introduced to help the vehicles focus on useful environmental information. The experiments are conducted in the open racing car simulator (TORCS)and the results of five experiment runs on the test tracks are averaged to obtain the final result. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm, the maximum reward increases from 62,207 to 116,347, and the average speed increases from 135 km/h to 193 km/h, while the number of success episodes to complete a circle increases from 96 to 147. Also, the variance of the distance from the vehicle to the center of the road is compared, and the result indicates that the variance of the DDPG is 0.6 m while that of the MAPDDPG is only 0.2 m. The above results indicate that the proposed MAPDDPG achieves excellent performance.

AB Stop-and-go waves are easily caused by unstable traffic due to the collective behavior of human drivers, resulting in higher vehicle fuel consumption and emissions. In this article, we develop a general approach to synthesizing feedback controllers of autonomous vehicles (AVs) for smoothing unstable nonlinear mixed traffic flow, consisting of AVs and human -driven vehicles (HVs). In the context of traffic smoothing and stabilization, prior studies have mainly focused on analyzing string stability of specific car-following models linearized at flow equilibrium points. By contrast, we are interested to analytically synthesize appropriate feedback controllers of AVs for smoothing nonlinear mixed traffic in its general functional forms, covering a broad class of deterministic car-following models commonly seen in the literature. Specifically, by leveraging feedback control theory AVs are controlled to operate in such a way that they closely track a virtual speed profile, i.e., a subtler version of the disturbance resulting from the immediate preceding vehicle. Thus, traffic waves are reduced when propagating backward across controlled AVs. Based on the general functional form of car-following dynamics, we derive a class of effective additive AV controllers that are proven to be able to ensure convergence in tracking desired speed profiles, leading to smoother traffic. In addition, a set of sufficient conditions is devised for guaranteeing car-following safety. More importantly, head-to-tail string stability of the mixed traffic is likely to be achieved with a sufficient market penetration rate (MPR) of AVs. Notably, unlike many existing studies the feedback controllers synthesized for AVs require only local traffic information without having to rely on high degrees of vehicle connectivity, and the rate of smoothing mixed traffic is readily tunable, which is useful for practical implementations. The proposed approach is further illustrated with a theoretical intelligent driver model (IDM) and commercially available adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles represented by a well calibrated IDM. Extensive numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness and robustness of the feedback controllers synthesized for AVs on smoothing nonlinear mixed traffic.

AB Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods demonstrate internal representation of data hidden within neural network trained weights. That information, presented in a form readable to humans, could be remarkably useful during model development and validation. Among others, gradient-based methods such as Grad-CAM are broadly used in an image processing domain. On the other hand, the autonomous vehicle sensor suite consists of auxiliary devices such as radars and LiDARs, for which existing XAI methods do not apply directly. In this article, we present our adaptation approach to utilize Grad-CAM visualization for LiDAR pointcloud specific object detection architectures used in automotive perception systems. We try to solve data and network architecture compatibility problems and answer the question whether Grad-CAM methods could be used with LiDAR sensor data efficiently. We showcase successful results of our method and all the benefits that come with a Grad-CAM XAI application to a LiDAR sensor in an autonomous driving domain.

ID NETWORK EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM
AB This article investigates the impacts of competition in autonomous mobility-on-demand systems. By adopting a network-flow based formulation, we first determine the optimal strategies of profit-maximizing platform operators in monopoly and duopoly markets, including the optimal prices of rides. Furthermore, we characterize the platform operator's profits and the consumer surplus. We show that for the duopoly, the equilibrium prices for rides have to be symmetric between the firms. Then, in order to study the benefits of introducing competition in the market, we derive universal theoretical bounds on the ratio of prices for rides, aggregate demand served, profits of the firms, and consumer surplus between the monopolistic and the duopolistic setting. We discuss how consumers' firm loyalty affects each of the aforementioned metrics. Finally, using the Manhattan network and demand data, we quantify the efficacy of static pricing and routing policies and compare it to real-time model predictive policies.

AB Effectively detecting road objects in various environments would significantly improve driving safety for autonomous vehicles. However, small objects, low illumination, and blurred outline in images strongly limit the performance of current road object detection methods. To solve these problems, this paper proposed a novel deep learning anchor-free approach based on CenterNet. The atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) was used to extract features from multiple scales to improve the detection performance while not increasing the computational cost and the number of parameters. The space to depth algorithm was then adopted in our proposed approach to optimize the traditional downsampling process. A large-scale naturalistic driving dataset (BDD100K) was used to examined the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can effectively improve the detection performance on small objects in various traffic situations.

AB This paper presents a real-time and deterministic path planning method for autonomous ships or Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) in complex and dynamic navigation environments. A modified Artificial Potential Field (APF), which contains a new modified repulsion potential field function and the corresponding virtual forces, is developed to address the issue of Collision Avoidance (CA) with dynamic targets and static obstacles, including emergency situations. Appropriate functional and safety requirements are added in the corresponding virtual forces to ensure International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS)-constrained behaviour for the own ship's CA actions. Simulations show that the method is fast, effective and deterministic for path planning in complex situations with multiple moving target ships and stationary obstacles and can account for the unpredictable strategies of other ships. The authors believe that automatic navigation systems operated without human interaction could benefit from the development of path planning algorithms.

The signal is optimized to improve the intersection efficiency and the calculation of intergreen interval (IGI) serves as constraints to guarantee vehicle safety during signal changing. Then the vehicle trajectory in the approach lane and inside intersection is optimized to increase fuel efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated by microscopic simulation, comparing with the actuated signal control (ASC) method and an ad hoc cooperation method between traffic signals and vehicles. Results indicate the proposed control algorithm is effective to prevent conflicts during signal changing periods. Operation Efficiency and fuel efficiency are improved. The benefit is 24.9% on vehicle delay, and is 5.5% on fuel efficiency. The proposed system can potentially be used in real-time.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles are seeing their dawn at this moment. They provide numerous benefits to vehicle owners, manufacturers, vehicle service providers, insurance companies, etc. These vehicles generate a large amount of data, which makes privacy and security a major challenge to their success. The complicated machine-led mechanics of connected and autonomous vehicles increase the risks of privacy invasion and cyber security violations for their users by making them more susceptible to data exploitation and vulnerable to cyber-attacks than any of their predecessors. This could have a negative impact on how well-liked CAVs are with the general public, give them a poor name at this early stage of their development, put obstacles in the way of their adoption and expanded use, and complicate the economic models for their future operations. On the other hand, congestion is still a bottleneck for traffic management and planning. This research paper presents a blockchain-based framework that protects the privacy of vehicle owners and provides data security by storing vehicular data on the blockchain, which will be used further for congestion detection and mitigation. Numerous devices placed along the road are used to communicate with passing cars and collect their data. The collected data will be compiled periodically to find the average travel time of vehicles and traffic density on a particular road segment. Furthermore, this data will be stored in the memory pool, where other devices will also store their data. After a predetermined amount of time, the memory pool will be mined, and data will be uploaded to the blockchain in the form of blocks that will be used to store traffic statistics. The information is then used in two different ways. First, the blockchain's final block will provide real-time traffic data, triggering an intelligent traffic signal system to reduce congestion. Secondly, the data stored on the blockchain will provide historical, statistical data that can facilitate the analysis of traffic conditions according to past behavior.

AB Autonomous electronic circuits provide a convenient framework in which to study chaotic phenomena. These systems are easy to build, easy to measure, and easy to model using differential and difference equations. Furthermore, they operate in real time, and parameter values are readily adjusted.
   In this work, are discuss the nature of chaotic steady-state behaviour and describe how it manifests itself in autonomous electronic circuits. We study state space, time- and frequency-domain measurement techniques for characterizing steady-state behaviour. Because of its value as a paradigm for exploring chaos, we choose Chua's oscillator as the vehicle for our experiments.

In the spring of 1996, VICS (Vehicle Information and Communication System) started a driver information service including dynamic route guidance, and ASV (Advanced Safety Vehicle) aiming at active safety for passenger cars had demonstrations. Experiments related to Automated Highway Systems have been conducted since 1995 on a test track and an expressway. Cooperative driving, with inter-vehicle communication, was tested in the spring of 1997. Besides the Government projects, navigation systems have become widespread, and inter-vehicle distance warning systems for trucks and an intelligent cruise control system for passenger cars have become commercially available.

AB For underwater terrain-aided navigation systems to collect enough terrain features, a path-planning method for terrain-aided navigation is proposed. First, a distribution model of terrain features is built based on underwater terrain Fisher information content. Then, terrain information and path length are taken as optimization targets, and considering the constraints of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) maneuverability, a path applicable to terrain-aided navigation can be provided. Simulation tests show that the terrain feature information in AUVs' sailing area obtained with the method is adequate; therefore, this method can effectively improve the performance of terrain-aided navigation systems.

AB The geometric parameters (ratio of orifice's length to diameter, conical angle, and inner-wall roughness) of conical nozzle are investigated via computational fluid dynamic method to reveal the effect on the flow and cavitation characteristics. The variation of geometric parameters affects the distribution of the static pressure and the drag force, which in turn affects the mass flow rate at the outlet. The results indicate that the conical angle plays a dominant role in effecting the flow and cavitation characteristics. The higher the intensity of cavitation, the more notable the effect of geometric parameters on cavitation characteristics.

AB The task of synchronising autonomous agents is solved by a networked controller that steers the agents towards a common trajectory. This paper considers the transient behaviour of completely coupled synchronised agents, which brings the agents from their initial state towards the common synchronous trajectory. An explicit relation of the transient behaviour in terms of the initial agent states is derived, which shows how the time to synchronise the agents depends upon the coupling strength. As an important phenomenon of agents with complete couplings, it is proved that groups of agents, which are initially synchronised among each other, remain synchronised during the transient phase. The results are illustrated by their application to vehicle platooning.

AB Insects, being perhaps more reliant on image motion cues than mammals or higher vertebrates, are proving to be an excellent organism in which to investigate how information on optic flow is exploited to guide locomotion and navigation. This paper describes one example, illustrating how bees perform grazing landings on a flat surface. A smooth landing is achieved by a surprisingly simple and elegant strategy: image velocity is held constant as the surface is approached, thus automatically ensuring that flight speed is close to zero at touchdown. No explicit knowledge of flight speed or height above the ground is necessary. The feasibility of this landing strategy is tested by implementation in a robotic gantry, and its applicability to autonomous airborne vehicles is discussed.

AB This paper describes our work on autonomous landing control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A hierarchical control structure is developed for autonomous landing of fixed-wing UAVs. In the hierarchical control structure, active disturbance rejection controllers are designed for attitude control. A proportional guidance law is proposed for height tracking. Other controllers, such as flight path angle controller, heading angle controller and taxiing controller, are designed using proportion integration differentiation technique. A test system is developed to validate the hierarchical structure and narrow the gap between the theory and practice. The test system includes an X-Plane based hardware-in-the-loop(HIL) simulation subsystem and a flight test subsystem. The interface and protocol between the autopilot and X-plane are designed same with that of the flight test platform. Consequently, the autopilot passed the validation in the HIL simulation can be directly moved on to the flight test platform. Finally, results of the HIL simulation and field experiment are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach and the entire test system.

AB Different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) provide different connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) solutions. However, previous studies that estimated the impact of CAV on driving behaviors assumed CAVs are identical, with an integrated form of technologies. In this study, a simulation was conducted to investigate how different fundamental elements of CAV technology (i.e., communication range, number of vehicular interactions, and car-following distance) affect right-turn gap acceptance behavior at unsignalized intersections. The results of the statistical analysis, critical gaps comparison, platooning analysis, and logistic regression revealed that (1) all elements increase the lag acceptance rate compared with all human-driven vehicles; (2) a longer communication range and more vehicular interactions make CAVs turn conservatively from a minor road, causing the critical gap to increase; (3) a shorter car-following distance causes CAVs to generate longer platoons and shorter gaps on a major road, which decreases acceptance probability; and (4) CAVs with a shorter car-following distance on a minor road are more aggressive in accepting gap/lag, causing the critical gap to decrease and acceptance probability to increase. The study conducted an impact analysis of CAV technologies from a novel perspective, and the results can be used as a technical report of CAV's performance to help build transportation policies.

TI Robust Control with Uncertain Disturbances for Vehicle Drift Motions

ID PATH TRACKING; MODEL; UNITIRE
AB Professor drivers, including racing drivers, can drive cars to achieve drift motions by taking control of the steering angle in high tire slip ratios, which provides a way to improve the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. The existing studies can be divided into two kinds based on analysis methods, and the theory-based is chosen in this study. Because the recent theory based is most applied for planar models with neglect of the rollover accident risk, the nonlinear vehicle model is established by considering longitudinal, lateral, roll, and yaw motions and rolling safety with the nonlinear tire model UniTire. The drift motion mechanism is analyzed in steady and transient states to obtain drift motion conditions, including the velocity limitation and the relationship between sideslip angle and yaw rate, and vehicle main status parameters including the velocity, side-slip angle and yaw rate in drift conditions. The state-feedback controller is designed based on robust theory and LMI (linear matrix inequation) with uncertain disturbances to realize circle motions in drift conditions. The designed controller in simulations realizes drift circle motions aiming at analyzed status target values by matching the front-wheel steering angle with saturated tire forces, which satisfies the Lyapunov stability with robustness. Robust control in drift conditions solves the problem of how to control vehicles to perform drift motions with uncertain disturbances and improves the driving safety of autonomous vehicles.

TI Operations of Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet for Austin, Texas, Market
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The emergence of automated vehicles holds great promise for the future of transportation. Although commercial sales of fully self-driving vehicles will not commence for several more years, once these sales are possible a new transportation mode for personal travel promises to arrive. This new mode is the shared autonomous (or fully automated) vehicle (SAV), combining features of short-term, on-demand rentals with self-driving capabilities: in essence, a driverless taxi. This investigation examined the potential implications of the SAY at a low level of market penetration (1.3% of regional trips) by simulating a fleet of SAVs serving travelers in the 12-mi by 24-mi regional core of Austin, Texas. The simulation used a sample of trips from the region's planning model to generate demand across traffic analysis zones and a 32,272-link network. Trips called on the vehicles in 5-min departure time windows, with link-level travel times varying by hour of day based on MATSIM's dynamic traffic assignment simulation software. Results showed that each SAY could replace about nine conventional vehicles within the 24-mi by 12-mi area while still maintaining a reasonable level of service (as proxied by user wait times, which averaged just 1 min). Additionally, approximately 8% more vehicle miles traveled (VMT) may be generated because of SAV's ability to journey unoccupied to the next traveler or relocate to a more favorable position in anticipation of its next period demand.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel motion planning method for off-road unmanned ground vehicles, based on three-dimensional (3-D) terrain map information. Previous studies on the motion planning of a vehicle traveling on rough terrain dealt only with a relatively small environment. Furthermore, unique vehicle characteristics were not considered, and it was also impossible to incorporate regulations, such as maintaining driving speed and suppressing posture change. The proposed method enables vehicles to adaptively generate a path by considering vehicle characteristics and the regulations, in a large-scale environment, with rough terrain. A random sampling based scheme was applied to carrying out global path planning, based on a 3-D environmental model. Experimental results showed that the proposed off-road motion planner could generate an appropriate path, which satisfies vehicle characteristics and predefined regulations.

ID SYSTEM ENGINEERING ANALYSIS
AB Despite modern vehicles having the necessary advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) for autonomous operation, current implementations rely solely on sensor information from the surrounding environment or data from smart infrastructure. However, shortcomings in current implementations and standards around cost-effective variable latency and data rate have prevented widespread adoption of the technology to enable autonomous operations. This paper presents a proof-of-concept (PoC) reconfigurable design and performance of a hybrid ultra-high bands [i.e., millimetre-Wave (mmWave)-light fidelity (Li-Fi)] fifth generation (5G) architecture for autonomous vehicular communication applications. The hybrid multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system architecture design is mathematically modelled and presented. The reported prelim PoC validation focuses on the Li-Fi experiment and results. The proposed hybrid system's effectiveness was evaluated using the open-source "Model-based Autonomous Traffic Simulation" (MOBATSim). The simulation results of a potential Li-Fi system and a PoC prototype are presented to demonstrate the role of the Li-Fi system in the proposed hybrid mmWave-Li-Fi 5G architecture. Three models of LED/lamp and two models of photodiode were simulated at three different vehicle speeds to ascertain the potential of the system. Promising results are reported at low speeds with received power values of up to -8.39 dBm and signal-to-noise ratios of up to 29.39 dB. Practical prototype simulations showed auspicious results including received power of -24.6 dBm to -34.12 dBm at the vehicle speeds of 10 MPH to 30 MPH respectively. The implemented PoC Li-Fi technology component has demonstrated the ability to transmit information with a theoretical output of 333 bits per second at 1.92 m, without the use of any high-power processors, components, and modulation techniques. The proposed system yields high data rates due to reconfigurable high bandwidth channels; many simultaneous multimedia mmWave-Li-Fi connections enabled due to spatial reuse with narrow beams; and easier mmWave-Li-Fi ultra-low latency support occasioned by smaller packet sizes. This holds a great promise for the hybrid 5G/6G mmWave-Li-Fi autonomous vehicular communication use case and/or applications.

AB The paper presents neural dynamic optimization (NDO) as a method of optimal feedback control for nonlinear multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems. The main feature of NDO is that it enables neural networks to approximate the optimal feedback solution whose existence dynamic programming (DP) justifies, thereby reducing the complexities of computation and storage problems of the classical methods such as DP. This paper demonstrates NDO with several applications including control of autonomous vehicles and of a robot-arm, while the two other companion papers of this topic describes the background for the development of NDO and present the theory of the method, respectively.

DT Article
AB This paper presents formulation of a neural network (NN) vehicle model for estimating vehicle behaviour on sloping terrain. Lemniscate of Bernoulli courses were employed to acquire training pairs. A training method combined with genetic algorithm and back propagation algorithm was used to train the NN vehicle model. The model was validated by comparing the simulated results with the experimental ones. The open-loop characteristics of vehicle motion on sloping terrain were also investigated. A fuzzy logic controller based on the constructed NN vehicle model guided the tractor along a pre-determined path successfully with mean and standard lateral deviation of 0.005m and 0.067m, respectively. The results indicated that the NN vehicle model was qualified to represent the input-output relationship of the vehicle motion for autonomous navigation on sloping terrain.

AB Under the condition of vehicle-to-vehicle communication, different information transmission mechanisms may have different effects on the cooperative performance of road traffic. In this paper, a new car-following model with consideration of the iterative traffic information transmission mechanism of vehicle-to-vehicle communication is proposed. The influence of the iterative traffic information transmission mechanism on the cooperative car-following behavior has been revealed. It is proved that based on the iterative traffic information transmission of vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the information of the two nearest preceding vehicles ahead of the ego vehicle has the most obvious role in stabilizing traffic flow. Also, the information of the third or fourth vehicles in front of the ego vehicle has a certain stabilizing effect, but the traffic information of the fifth or further preceding vehicles in front of the ego vehicle has little effect in enhancing traffic stability. This result provides a reference vehicle number for the cooperative car-following performance under the iterative traffic information transmission mechanism of vehicle-to-vehicle communication.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Autonomous vehicles are often tasked to explore unseen environments, aiming to acquire and understand large amounts of visual image data and other sensory information. In such scenarios, remote sensing data may be available a priori, and can help to build a semantic model of the environment and plan future autonomous missions. In this paper, we introduce two multimodal learning algorithms to model the relationship between visual images taken by an autonomous underwater vehicle during a survey and remotely sensed acoustic bathymetry (ocean depth) data that is available prior to the survey. We present a multi-layer architecture to capture the joint distribution between the bathymetry and visual modalities. We then propose an extension based on gated feature learning models, which allows the model to cluster the input data in an unsupervised fashion and predict visual image features using just the ocean depth information. Our experiments demonstrate that multimodal learning improves semantic classification accuracy regardless of which modalities are available at classification time, allows for unsupervised clustering of either or both modalities, and can facilitate mission planning by enabling class-based or image-based queries.

AB In this paper, a novel translation-rotation cascade control (TRCC) scheme is developed for path following of an autonomous underactuated ship suffering from unknown sideslip and complex disturbances. Salient contributions are as follows: 1) finite-time observers are devised to exactly estimate lumped unknowns including sideslip, disturbances, and virtual yaw acceleration; 2) complex unknowns are compositely compensated with finite-time convergence such that exact path following with accurate unknown rejection is achieved; 3) in lieu of detached guidance-control design in previous works, the TRCC facilitates integrated guidance-control (IGC) system in a cascade manner; 4) combining cascade analysis with Lyapunov approach, the entire IGC system is ensured to be globally uniformly asymptotically stable. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the superiority of the proposed TRCC scheme.

AB Distributed collision-free trajectories are generally obtained through a continuous sharing of information between vehicles. With the intent of investigating possible sources of vulnerability in autonomous frameworks, we formalize a procedure malicious players can follow to influence other. In this paper we propose a strategy for steering a UAV towards predetermined targets. The strategy described here relies on the existence of a flight information sharing protocol (i.e. ADS-B) and predictable collision avoidance algorithms. A model predictive controller is applied to the switching system representing a pair of UAVs coupled by the presence of an imminent collision. As showed by means of numerical simulations and robot experiments, the result is a loss of autonomy on the UAV. Our results suggest the need to include the subject of our study in the discussion on safe automated airspace. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB With the increase in the number of offshore power generation facilities and aquaculture ponds, demand for remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to inspect underwater structures and conduct ecological surveys is increasing. Because ROVs are connected to a ground station on the water by a tether cable to enable the transmission of operating commands and images underwater, where radio communication is difficult, they can only operate within the range of the tether cable. To expand the operational range of ROVs, an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV)-ROV cooperative system, in which a tether cable is connected to an ASV and radio waves are used for remote operation from the autonomous vessel, is attracting attention. In a cooperative system, the tether cable must be managed on the ASV side, and the position and cable length of the ASV must be controlled to prevent the cable from pulling against or tangling with the ROV, which moves around underwater under the command of a human controller. We propose a method of controlling the position and cable length of the ASV using the information on the position of the ROV obtained from an underwater positioning device for an ASV-ROV cooperative system that we are also developing. In addition, we confirmed through simulations that the ASV and cable length follow target values even when the ROV moves along a complicated path.

DE AUV; Pipeline inspection; Multibeam echo sounder; Forward looking sonar;
   Obstacle avoidance
AB Faced with the difficulty in finding and locating leakage points of submarine pipelines timely as well as the high cost of pipeline routine inspection, a scheme using autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with multi beam echo sounder (MBES) and forward looking sonar (FLS) for automatic inspection of submarine pipelines was developed. In the process of inspection, the AUV maintains autonomous navigation along the pre-set pipeline route at a fixed height above the pipeline, while the MBES collects water column images. After extracting the outline characteristics of gas-filled bubbles and making a leakage risk judgment, it rises to the sea surface to issue an alarm to the shore-based command center via satellite. The results of sea trial verify the effectiveness of sub-sea pipeline leak detection and real-time obstacle avoidance of the vehicle proposed in this study. Additionally, a variable buoyancy system (VBS) is adopted, which enhances the navigation efficiency of the vehicle. On the other hand, considering the complex operation environment of the pipeline inspection, the online collision avoidance is indispensable. The traditional image segmentation algorithm is not ideal for the high noise and bottom reverberation in operation sea area. Based on the traditional algorithm, an improved Otsu algorithm is proposed to improve the operation speed and denoise effect. As a result, an improved Otsu algorithm is proposed to accurately identify obstacles. Moreover, Kalman filtering is also introduced to estimate dynamic obstacles.

AB The DARPA Learning Applied to Ground Vehicles (LAGR) program is accelerating progress in autonomous, perception-based, off-road navigation in unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) by incorporating learned behaviors. In addition, the program is using passive optical systems to accomplish long-range scene analysis. By combining long-range perception with learned behavior, LAGR expects to make a qualitative break with the myopic, brittle behavior that characterizes most UGV autonomous navigation in unstructured environments. The very nature of testing navigation in unstructured, off-road environments makes accurate, objective measurement of progress a challenging task. While no absolute measure of performance has been defined by LAGR, the Government Team managing the program has created a relative measure: the Government Team tests navigation software by comparing its effectiveness to that of fixed, but state-of-the-art, navigation software running on a standardized vehicle on a series of varied test courses. Starting in March 2005, eight performers have been submitting navigation code for Government testing on such a standardized Government vehicle. As this text is being written, several teams have already demonstrated leaps in performance. In this paper we report observations on the state of the art in autonomous, off-road UGV navigation, we explain how LAGR intends to change current methods, we discuss the challenges we face in implementing technical aspects of the program, we describe early results, and we suggest where major opportunities for breakthroughs exist as LAGR progresses.

AB Considering autonomous navigation of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) in off-road environments, it faces various problems, such as semantic perception and motion planning. This paper proposes an intelligent approach to perception and planning for UGV in field environments. Firstly, a semantic image of environment is generated in real time based on an improved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Secondly, we provide two practical extensions to an open-source 3D mapping framework. One is the semantic point cloud fusion based on 3D LIDAR and Camera, and the other is the generation of traversability cost map using both semantic and geometric information. Thirdly, we propose a new kinodynamic semantic-aware planner which adds the dynamic window approach to the receding horizon planner so that the latter can meet the kinodynamic while perceiving semantic labels. Finally, the above methods, along with a localization module, are integrated into a complete autonomous navigation system with real-time semantic perception and motion planning (RSPMP). In the experiments, the proposed method was successfully applied for safe autonomous perception navigation in off-road environments.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are the mainstream equipment for underwater scientific research and engineering. However, it remains a great challenge for AUVs to carry out near-seabed operations because of their poor maneuverability. In this paper, a new design for a high-maneuverability disc-shaped AUV is proposed, namely, the Autonomous Underwater Helicopter (AUH). We designed the AUH's propulsion system through dynamic analysis based on the unique disc shape. The experimental prototype was built by mechatronics technology, after which several motion experiments were carried out to demonstrate the high maneuverability. We find that the prototype has high maneuverability: it can cruise at 0.8 m/s (about 1.5 knots), at least; its turning radius is zero and its turning speed is at least 20 deg/s; and the motion of specific curves in a small range was completed. It is demonstrated that over-actuation is not necessary for the high-maneuverability AUH because of its unique disc shape. A propulsion system consisting of four propellers and a buoyancy adjustment system is used for the highly maneuverable AUH. In addition, the AUH may be a solution for near-seafloor operations.

AB With the arrival of autonomous and connected vehicles, it remains unclear how automation and connectivity will impact the energy consumption of electric vehicles. Here, we report the energy impacts induced by these emerging technologies on electric vehicles in a realistic urban environment based on high-resolution empirical data and high-fidelity simulations. We find that, contrary to optimistic predictions, automated vehicles (AVs) alone in fact increase energy consumption compared with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in a complicated urban environment (e.g., with distributed signalized intersections), while connected and automated vehicles outperform in energy, safety, and mobility. Also, based on our field experiments, scenario AV has a lower average speed compared with scenario HDV. These findings suggest that systematic efforts integrating AV technology innovations from the private sector and connected vehicle infrastructure investment from the public sector are essential to accomplish the ultimate vision of green urban transportation.

AB This study establishes the concept and classification system of MUM-T for the operation and development of AI-based complex combat systems. We analyze the core aspects of this system: autonomy, interoperability, and program level. AI MUM-T can improve the survivability of manned systems, expand their operational range, and increase combat effectiveness. We analyze technical challenges and program levels using data from the USA and UK, which are building the AI MUM-T integrated combat system. Currently, MUM-T is at the level of complex operation of a manned platform and an unmanned aerial vehicle platform. In the mid to long term, interoperable communication between heterogeneous platforms such as unmanned ground vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, and unmanned underwater vehicles is possible. Depending on the level of development of the common architecture and standard protocols for interoperability between AI MUM-T systems, MUM-T can evolve from the "1 to N" concept to various combinations of operating concepts from "N to N." The difference of this study from existing studies is that the core technologies of the fourth industrial revolution, such as AI, autonomy, and data interoperability, are reflected in the MUM-T system. In addition, an AI-enabled autonomous MUM-T operation and facility classification system was established by reflecting AI and autonomy in the existing unmanned system taxonomy, and the level and program were analyzed taking this into consideration.

If an accident happens, especially in bad weather, it is important to inform approaching vehicles about it. Otherwise, there might be another accident, i.e., a multiple-vehicle collision (MVC). If the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is not informed in a timely fashion about the incident, fatalities might increase because they do not receive immediate first aid. Detecting humans or animals would undoubtedly provide us with a better answer for reducing human fatalities in traffic accidents. In this research, an accident alert light and sound (AALS) system is proposed for auto accident detection and alerts with all types of vehicles. No changes are required in non-equipped vehicles (nEVs) and EVs because the system is installed on the roadside. The idea behind this research is to make smart roads (SRs) instead of equipping each vehicle with a separate system. Wireless communication is needed only when an accident is detected. This study is based on different sensors that are used to build SRs to detect accidents. Pre-saved locations are used to reduce the time needed to find the accident's location without the help of a global positioning system (GPS). Additionally, the proposed framework for the AALS also reduces the risk of MVCs.

AB Safety is a critical concern for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Current testing approaches face challenges in simultaneously meeting the requirements of being valid, safe, and fast. To address these challenges, the silent testing approach that tests functions or systems in the background without interfering with driving is motivated. Building upon our previous research, this study first extends the method to specifically address the validation of AV perception, utilizing a lane marking detection algorithm (LMDA) as a case study. Second, field experiments were conducted to investigate the method's effectiveness in validating AV systems. For both studies, an architecture for describing the working principle is presented. The efficacy of the method in evaluating the LMDA is demonstrated through the use of adversarial images generated from a dataset. Furthermore, various scenarios involving pedestrians crossing a road under different levels of criticality were constructed to gain practical insights into the method's applicability for AV system validation. The results show that corner cases of the LMDA are successfully identified by the given evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the experiments highlight the benefits of employing multiple virtual instances with different initial states, enabling the expansion of the test space and the discovery of unknown unsafe scenarios, particularly those prone to false-positive objects. The practical implementation and systematic discussion of the method offer a significant contribution to AV safety validation.

DE Autonomous vehicle (AV); control policy extraction; driving safety
   analysis; hazard driving scenario identification
AB An autonomous vehicle (AV) is a combination of subsystems, measuring its driving environments with different sensors (e.g., camera, RADAR, and LiDAR) in real time. AVs follow their control policies and make real-time control decisions based on sensor measurements to ensure driving safety. Control policies in an AV are usually implemented with codes and not open to the public and drivers, which results in people's strong concerns about driving safety. In this article, we propose a data-driven control policy-based driving safety analysis system (PoSa) to analyze the driving safety of a target AV. In PoSa, we first build a data-driven control policy extraction method to extract control policies of a target AV based on its historical driving data. Then, we develop a hazard driving scenario identification method to identify possible hazard driving scenarios of a target AV by executing the extracted control policies under different driving scenarios. Finally, we use vehicle driving data from one industry-standard AV platform (Baidu Apollo) to evaluate PoSa's hazard driving scenario identification performance. We compared its identification results with Baidu AV accident reports from California DMV and the hazard driving scenario identification results cover as many as 89% hazard driving scenarios in the Baidu AV accident report, which demonstrates that PoSa has good performance on identifying hazard driving scenarios and its identification results can be used to optimize control policies for driving safety improvement.

AB In recent years, persistent news updates on autonomous vehicles and the claims of companies entering the space, brace the notion that vehicular autonomy of level 5 is just around the corner. However, the main hindrance in asserting the full autonomy still boils down to environmental perception that affects the autonomous decisions. An efficient perceptual system requires redundancy in sensor modalities capable of performing in varying environmental conditions, and providing a reliable information using limited computational resources. This work addresses the task of 3D object detection and tracking in the vehicles' environment, using camera and 3D LiDAR as primary sensors. The proposed framework is designed to operate in an embedded system that visually classifies the objects using a lightweight neural network, while tracking is performed in 3D space using LiDAR information. The main contribution of this work is 3D LiDAR point cloud classification using visual object detector, and an IMM-UKF-JPDAF based object tracker that jointly performs 3D object detection and tracking. The performance evaluation is carried out using MOT16 metrics and ground truths provided by KITTI Datasets. Furthermore, the proposed tracker is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art approaches. The experiments suggest that the proposed framework offers a suitable solution for embedded systems to solve 3D object detection and tracking problem, with added benefits.

AB This article addresses the cooperative target enclosing problem of ring-networked underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). The target velocity is unavailable, and the ASVs are subject to sideslip effects, unknown control gains, and uncertain kinetics. The control objective is to drive a fleet of ASVs to surround a moving target at a desired range and maintain a spaced formation. An integrated distributed guidance and model-free control method is presented based on extended state observers (ESOs) and a data-driven fuzzy predictor. Specifically, by using two ESOs to estimate the unknown relative kinematics induced by the unknown target velocity and unknown sideslip and a distributed target estimator to recover the target position, intermediate range keeping and phase keeping guidance laws are designed to achieve a circular motion and an evenly spaced formation, respectively. Next, a model-free fuzzy control law is developed based on a data-driven fuzzy predictor, which learns the unknown control gains and uncertain kinetics simultaneously. Finally, the closed-loop control system is proven to be input-to-state stable through Lyapunov analysis. The salient feature of the proposed method is that cooperative circumnavigating a maneuvering target with unknown velocity can be achieved without the global target information and knowledge of vehicle kinetics. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed guidance and control method for cooperative target enclosing of ASVs.

ID NASH EQUILIBRIA
AB Dynamic games are an effective paradigm for dealing with the control of multiple interacting actors. This paper introduces augmented Lagrangian GAME-theoretic solver (ALGAMES), a solver that handles trajectory-optimization problems with multiple actors and general nonlinear state and input constraints. Its novelty resides in satisfying the first-order optimality conditions with a quasi-Newton root-finding algorithm and rigorously enforcing constraints using an augmented Lagrangian method. We evaluate our solver in the context of autonomous driving on scenarios with a strong level of interactions between the vehicles. We assess the robustness of the solver using Monte Carlo simulations. It is able to reliably solve complex problems like ramp merging with three vehicles three times faster than a state-of-the-art DDP-based approach. A model-predictive control (MPC) implementation of the algorithm, running at more than 60 Hz, demonstrates ALGAMES' ability to mitigate the "frozen robot" problem on complex autonomous driving scenarios like merging onto a crowded highway.

AB We present a photo-realistic training and evaluation simulator (Sim4CV) (http://www.sim4cv.org) with extensive applications across various fields of computer vision. Built on top of the Unreal Engine, the simulator integrates full featured physics based cars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and animated human actors in diverse urban and suburban 3D environments. We demonstrate the versatility of the simulator with two case studies: autonomous UAV-based tracking of moving objects and autonomous driving using supervised learning. The simulator fully integrates both several state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with a benchmark evaluation tool and a deep neural network architecture for training vehicles to drive autonomously. It generates synthetic photo-realistic datasets with automatic ground truth annotations to easily extend existing real-world datasets and provides extensive synthetic data variety through its ability to reconfigure synthetic worlds on the fly using an automatic world generation tool.

In this paper, a mixed traffic simulation framework that integrates vehicle models with different automated driving systems in the microscopic traffic simulation was proposed. Currently, some of the more mature Automated Driving Systems (ADS) functions (e.g., Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Keeping Assistant (LKA), etc.) are already equipped in vehicles, the very next step towards a higher automated driving is represented by Level 3 vehicles and CAV which show great promise in helping to avoid crashes, ease traffic congestion, and improve the environment. Therefore, to better predict and simulate the driving behavior of automated vehicles on the motorway scenario, a virtual test framework is proposed which includes the Highway Chauffeur (HWC) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication function. These functions are implemented as an external driver model in PTV Vissim. The framework uses a detailed digital twin based on the M86 road network located in southwestern Hungary, which was constructed for autonomous driving tests. With this framework, the effect of the proposed vehicle models is evaluated with the microscopic traffic simulator PTV Vissim. A case study of the different penetration rates of HAV and CAV was performed on the M86 motorway. Preliminary results presented in this paper demonstrated that introducing HAV and CAV to the current network individually will cause negative effects on traffic performance. However, a certain ratio of mixed traffic, 60% CAV and 40% Human Driver Vehicles (HDV), could reduce this negative impact. The simulation results also show that high penetration CAV has fine driving stability and less travel delay.

AB This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) formulation for obstacle avoidance in high-speed, large-size autono-mous ground vehicles (AGVs) with high centre of gravity (CoG) that operate in unstructured environments, such as military vehicles. The term unstructured' in this context denotes that there are no lanes or traffic rules to follow. Existing MPC formulations for passenger vehicles in structured environments do not readily apply to this context. Thus, a new nonlinear MPC formulation is developed to navigate an AGV from its initial position to a target position at high-speed safely. First, a new cost function formulation is used that aims to find the shortest path to the target position, since no reference trajectory exists in unstructured environments. Second, a region partitioning approach is used in conjunction with a multi-phase optimal control formulation to accommodate the complicated forms the obstacle-free region can assume due to the presence of multiple obstacles in the prediction horizon in an unstructured environment. Third, the no-wheel-lift-off condition, which is the major dynamical safety concern for high-speed, high-CoG AGVs, is ensured by limiting the steering angle within a range obtained offline using a 14 degrees-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model. Thus, a safe, high-speed navigation is enabled in an unstructured environment. Simulations of an AGV approaching multiple obstacles are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

ID DAMAGE DETECTION
AB Earlier identification of bolt loosening is crucial to maintain structural integrity and prevent system-level collapse. In this study, a novel drone-based 3D vision methodology has been proposed for autonomous bolt loosening assessment. First, a low-cost micro aerial vehicle with various types of sensors is designed. Second, a drone-based autonomous image collection method is proposed. Third, a 3D point cloud of the bolted connection is generated using the acquired images. Fourth, 3D point cloud processing methods are proposed to localize and quantify bolt loosening. The proposed method has been implemented on structural beam-column connections. The results show that the proposed drone-based data collection method can effectively acquire images for 3D reconstruction. The 3D point cloud processing methods can reliably localize and quantify bolt loosening at high accuracy. The proposed method provides a more robust and comprehensive evaluation of bolt loosening, compared to existing 2D vision methods, which process 2D images captured at a specific camera view.

AB The emergence of collective adaptive systems-i.e., computational systems made up of an ensemble of autonomous components that have to operate in a coordinated and adaptive way in open-ended and unpredictable environments-calls for innovative modeling and software engineering tools, to support their systematic and rigorous design and development. In this paper, we present a general model for collective adaptive systems called SOTA ("State Of The Affairs"). SOTA brings together the lessons of goal-oriented requirements modeling, context-aware system modeling, and dynamical systems modeling. It has the potential for acting as a general reference model to help tackling some key issues in the design and development of collective adaptive systems. In particular, as we will show with reference to a scenario of collectives of autonomous vehicles, SOTA enables: early verification of requirements, identification of knowledge requirements for self-adaptation, and the identification of the most suitable architectural patterns for self-adaptation.

AB Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) allow users, services, and vehicles to share information and will change our life experience with new autonomous driving applications. Multimedia will be one of the core services in VANETs and are becoming a reality in smart environments, ranging from safety and security traffic warnings to live entertainment and advertisement videos. However, VANETs have a dynamic network topology with short contact time, which leads to communication flaws and delays, increasing packet loss, and decreasing the Quality of Experience (QoE) of transmitted videos. To cope with this, neighbor vehicles moving on the same direction and wishing to cooperate should form a platoon, where platoon members act as a relay node to forward video packets in autonomous VANETs. In this article, we introduce a game theory approach for platoon-based driving (GT4P) for video dissemination services in urban and highway VANET scenarios. GT4P encourages the cooperation between neighbor vehicles by offering reward (e.g., money or coupon) for vehicles participating in the platoon. In this sense, GT4P establishes a platoon by taking into account vehicle direction, speed, distance, link quality, and travel path, which reduces the impact of vehicle mobility on the video transmission. Simulation results confirm the efficiency of GT4P for ensuring video transmissions with high QoE support compared to existing platoon-based driving protocols.

AB Motion planning for autonomous robots and vehicles in presence of uncontrolled agents remains a challenging problem as the reactive behaviors of the uncontrolled agents must be considered. Since the uncontrolled agents usually demonstrate multimodal reactive behavior, the motion planner needs to solve a continuous motion planning problem under these behaviors, which contains a discrete element. We propose a branch Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that plans over feedback policies to leverage the reactive behavior of the uncontrolled agent. In particular, a scenario tree is constructed from a finite set of policies of the uncontrolled agent, and the branch MPC solves for a feedback policy in the form of a trajectory tree, which shares the same topology as the scenario tree. Moreover, coherent risk measures such as the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) are used as a tuning knob to adjust the tradeoff between performance and robustness. The proposed branch MPC framework is tested on an autonomous vehicle planning problem in simulation, and on an autonomous quadruped robot alongside an uncontrolled quadruped in experiments. The result demonstrates interesting human-like behaviors, achieving a balance between safety and performance.

AB Autonomous vehicles can reduce labor power during cargo transportation, and then improve transportation efficiency, for example, the automated guided vehicle (AGV) in the warehouse can improve the operation efficiency. To overcome the limitations of traditional path planning algorithms in unknown environments, such as reliance on high-precision maps, lack of generalization ability, and obstacle avoidance capability, this study focuses on investigating the Deep Q-Network and its derivative algorithm to enhance network and algorithm structures. A new algorithm named APF-D3QNPER is proposed, which combines the action output method of artificial potential field (APF) with the Dueling Double Deep Q Network algorithm, and experience sample rewards are considered in the experience playback portion of the traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, which enhances the convergence ability of the traditional DRL algorithm. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is added to the state feature extraction network part to improve its adaptability in unknown environments and enhance its spatiotemporal sensitivity to the environment. The APF-D3QNPER algorithm is compared with mainstream deep reinforcement learning algorithms and traditional path planning algorithms using a robot operating system and the Gazebo simulation platform by conducting experiments. The results demonstrate that the APF-D3QNPER algorithm exhibits excellent generalization abilities in the simulation environment, and the convergence speed, the loss value, the path planning time, and the path planning length of the APF-D3QNPER algorithm are all less than for other algorithms in diverse scenarios.

AB Autonomous driving technology has not yet been widely adopted, in part due to the challenge of achieving high-accuracy trajectory tracking in complex and hazardous driving scenarios. To this end, we proposed an adaptive sliding mode controller optimized by an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Based on the improved PSO, we also proposed an enhanced grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to optimize the controller. Taking the expected trajectory and vehicle speed as inputs, the proposed control scheme calculates the tracking error based on an expanded vector field guidance law and obtains the control values, including the vehicle's orientation angle and velocity on the basis of sliding mode control (SMC). To improve PSO, we proposed a three-stage update function for the inertial weight and a dynamic update law for the learning rates to avoid the local optimum dilemma. For the improvement in GWO, we were inspired by PSO and added speed and memory mechanisms to the GWO algorithm. Using the improved optimization algorithm, the control performance was successfully optimized. Moreover, Lyapunov's approach is adopted to prove the stability of the proposed control schemes. Finally, the simulation shows that the proposed control scheme is able to provide more precise response, faster convergence, and better robustness in comparison with the other widely used controllers.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will bring considerable benefits to individuals and society, while the process of AVs' popularity may not always be smooth. Sometimes crashes are unavoidable, which could hinder the widespread acceptance of AVs. Although previous studies have investigated factors that affect AV acceptance, few of them pay attention to the impact of accidents and not to mention quantitative analysis. This study aims to explore what the public is really concerned about the AV crash and whether it significantly affects the public's behavioral intention to use AVs utilizing a multi-method analytical approach, including latent Dirichlet allocation, structural equation model, and Bayesian network. We employed a qualitative exploratory analysis to identify the topics of social media data about AV crashes and proposed an integrated framework using variables originating from topics. We introduced perceived severity in AV acceptance research to cater to the context of AV crashes. The findings reveal how trust, attitude, knowledge, perceived risk, media exposure, and perceived severity affect the public acceptance of AVs and how differences exist between full automation and driver assistance. This research helps to provide theoretical contributions and practical implications to reduce the negative effect of AV crashes and improve public acceptance of AVs.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to discuss key challenges associated with the use of either simulation or real-world application of intelligent autonomous vehicles (IAVs) in supply network operations; and second, to provide a theoretical and empirical evidence-based methodological framework that supports the integrated application of conceptualisation, simulation, emulation and physical application of IAVs for the effective design of digital supply networks. Design/methodology/approach First, this study performs a critical review of the extant literature to identify major benefits and shortcomings related to the use of either simulation modelling or real-word application of physical IAVs. Second, commercial and bespoke software applications, along with a three-dimensional validation and verification emulation tool, are developed to evaluate an IAV's operations in a conceptual warehouse. Third, a commercial depth-sensor is used as a test bed in a physical setting. Findings The results demonstrate that conceptual and simulation modelling should be initially used to explore alternative supply chain operations in terms of ideal performance while emulation tools and real-world IAV test beds are eminent in validating preferred digital supply chain design options.
   Originality/value This work contributes in the operations management field by providing both a multi-stage methodological framework and a practical "toolbox" for the proactive assessment and incorporation of IAVs in supply network operations.

AB Fully Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) can self-drive in all situations, offering the highest comfort to drivers, who can pursue several activities during their trips. Under this assumption, AVs will probably affect the perception of time and its value.
   The research presented in this paper is a first attempt to understand if the introduction of fully AVs may generate residential relocation from the city center to the suburbs due to a different time perception. Using Stated Preferences (SP) survey technique, discrete choice modelling, and traffic simulation, the effect of urban sprawl of AV-cities on the road network in terms of congestion was evaluated. The relocated demand, estimated thorough ad hoc calibrated behavioral models, was assigned to the road network of the city of Rome (Italy). Results show an increase in travel times (about 12%) for suburban residents commuting to work in city center due to the extra-demand relocated. Instead, intra-urban road congestion would benefit from lower traffic volumes (about - 10% in travel times). Moreover, this work shows the positive impact of the ride-sharing schemes with AVs by simulating different penetration rates.
   These results, however, should be taken with caution, as the sample is very small, travel time and travel monetary costs are ignored, as are housing costs, and mode choice and residential location are not modelled simultaneously.

AB Persistent surveillance is a major role envisioned for autonomous unmanned vehicles. The mission of persistent surveillance requires the vehicles to continuously survey a target region. This paper investigates the techniques of persistent surveillance control for a swarm of micro aerial vehicles. We present a flocking algorithm to drive the micro aerial vehicles flying in a coordinate formation with a capability of obstacle avoidance. We propose a new digital pheromone mechanism to control and coordinate the swarms of micro aerial vehicles to search a field of interest and to reduce the uncertainty of every region in the field over time. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in generating collision-free persistent surveillance trajectories for a swarm of micro aerial vehicles in a coordinated manner.

AB In the ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems), it is an essential condition (mixed environment) that vehicles that have communication equipment and vehicles that do not have it simultaneously run in the same road. In this paper, a vehicular driving assistant system that is applicable to the mixed environment is proposed. The proposed system uses spread spectrum techniques and consists of several new systems such as a PN code assignment system, new vehicle position systems, and a vehicle map update system. In the proposed system, the wireless broadcast CDMA is used for inter-vehicle communications. This paper also shows preexaminations of the proposed system by using an autonomous traffic flow simulator including inter-vehicle communications. It is shown that the traffic safety can be improved by using inter-vehicle communications.

AB We consider the effects of cueing in a cooperative search mission that involves several autonomous agents. Two scenarios are discussed: one in which the search is conducted by a number of identical search-and-engage vehicles and one where these vehicles are assisted by a search-only (reconnaissance) asset. The cooperation between the autonomous agents is facilitated via cueing, i.e., the information transmitted to the agents by a searcher that has just detected a target. The effect of cueing on the target detection probability is derived from first principles using a Markov chain analysis. In particular, it is demonstrated that the benefit of cueing on the system's effectiveness is bounded. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A frequency domain model of sensor contributions to navigation system performance is used to study the performance of a conventional navigation loop. On the basis of this, a new navigation system structure is introduced which is capable of detecting faults in any combination of navigation sensors. A decentralised architecture is also presented for the fusion of information from different asynchronous sources. An example implementation of these principles is described which employs a twin GPS/inertial navigation system and a millimeter wave radar/encoder navigation loop. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Many conventional systems for driver assistance on highways determine vehicle motion based on static situation configurations only. Adaptive Cruise Control systems for example react to vehicles cutting-in from neighboring lanes only after these vehicles have entered the ego-lane. Some more recent systems include prediction of future behaviors, but often neglect mutual influences between these and the best behavior for the ego vehicle.
   This paper introduces "intelligent Traffic Flow Assist", an assistance system that analyzes the current traffic situation and predicts candidate future behaviors conditioned on different options for the ego behavior. It computes vehicle trajectories optimized for safety, comfort and utility for each of the possible future situations and selects the best option for vehicle control. We describe the system architecture and implementation on a prototype vehicle with close-to-production sensors and report on tests performed in different situations on proving ground and public highways.

AB The motion of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is controllable even with reduced control authority such as in the event of an actuator failure. In this paper we describe a technique for synthesizing controls for underactuated AUV's and show how to use this technique to provide adaptation to changes in control authority. Our framework is a motion control system architecture which includes both feed-forward control as well as feedback control. We confine ourselves to kinematic models and exploit model nonlinearities to synthesize controls. Our results are illustrated for two examples, the first a yaw maneuver of an AUV using only roll and pitch actuation, and the second a ''parking maneuver'' for an AUV. Experimental results for the yaw maneuver example are described.

AB In this paper, we develop end-to-end autonomous driving based on a 2D LiDAR sensor and camera sensor that predict the control value of the vehicle from the input data, instead of modeling rule-based autonomous driving. Different from many studies utilizing simulated data, we created an end-to-end autonomous driving algorithm with data obtained from real driving and analyzing the performance of our proposed algorithm. Based on the data obtained from an actual urban driving environment, end-to-end autonomous driving was possible in an informal environment such as a traffic signal by predicting the vehicle control value based on a convolution neural network. In addition, this paper solves the data imbalance problem by eliminating redundant data for each frame during stopping and driving in the driving environment so we can improve the performance of self-driving. Finally, we verified through the activation map how the network predicts the vertical and horizontal control values by recognizing the traffic facilities in the driving environment. Experiments and analysis will be shown to show the validity of the proposed algorithm.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) is an attractive way to implement high-level decision-making policies for autonomous driving, but learning directly from a real vehicle or a high-fidelity simulator is variously infeasible. We therefore consider the problem of transfer reinforcement learning and study how a policy learned in a simple environment using WISEMOVE can be transferred to our high-fidelity simulator, WISESIM. WISEMOVE is a framework to study safety and other aspects of RL for autonomous driving. WISESIM accurately reproduces the dynamics and software stack of our real vehicle.
   We find that the accurately modeled perception errors in WISESIM contribute the most to the transfer problem. These errors, when even naively modeled in WISEMOVE, provide an RL policy that performs better in WISESIM than a hand-crafted rule-based policy. Applying domain randomization to the environment in WISEMOVE yields an even better policy. The final RL policy reduces the failures due to perception errors from 10% to 2.75%. We also observe that the RL policy has significantly less reliance on velocity compared to the rule-based policy, having learned that its measurement is unreliable.

AB This paper addresses a problem of autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the surveillance of multiple moving ground targets. The ground can be flat or uneven. A reactive real-time sliding mode control algorithm is proposed that navigates a team of communicating UAVs, equipped with ground-facing video cameras, towards moving targets to increase some measure of sensing coverage of the targets by the UAVs. Moreover, the Voronoi partitioning technique is adopted to reduce the movement range of the UAVs and decrease the revisit times of the targets. Extensive computer simulations, from the simple case with one UAV and multiple targets to the complex case with multiple UAVs and multiple targets, are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the developed autonomous navigation algorithm. The scenarios where the terrain is uneven are also considered. As shown in the simulation results, although the additional VP technique leads to some extra computation burden, the usage of the VP technique considerably reduces the target revisit time compared to the algorithm without this technique.

AB Around 1.3 million people worldwide die each year because of road traffic crashes. There are many reasons which cause accidents, and driving in the wrong direction is one of them. In our research, we developed an autonomous framework called WrongWay-LVDC that detects wrong-way driving vehicles from closed-circuit television (CCTV) videos. The proposed WrongWay-LVDC provides several helpful features such as lane detection, correct direction validation, detecting wrong-way driving vehicles, and image capturing features. In this work, we proposed three main contributions: first, the improved algorithm for road lane boundary detection on CCTV (called improved RLB-CCTV) using the image processing technique. Second is the Distance-Based Direction Detection (DBDD) algorithm that uses the deep learning method, where the system validates and detects wrong-driving vehicles. Lastly, the Inside Boundary Image (IBI) capturing feature algorithm captures the most precise shot of the wrong-way-of-driving vehicles. As a result, the framework can run continuously and output the reports for vehicles' driving behaviors in each area. The accuracy of our framework is 95.23%, as we tested with several CCTV videos. Moreover, the framework can be implemented on edge devices with real-time speed for functional implementation and detection in various areas.

AB This paper proposes a framework for path tracking under additive disturbance when a vehicle travels at high speed or on low-friction road. A decoupling control strategy is adopted, which is made up of robust model predictive control and the stability control combining preview G-vectoring control and direct yaw moment control. A vehicle-road model is adopted for robust model predictive control, and a robust positively invariant set calculated online ensures state constraints in the presence of disturbances. Preview G-vectoring control in stability control generates deceleration and acceleration based on lateral jerk, later acceleration, and curvature at preview point when a vehicle travels through a cornering. Direct yaw moment control with additional activating conditions provides an external yaw moment to stabilize lateral motion and enhances tracking performance. A comparative analysis of stability performance of stability control is presented in simulations, and furthermore, many disturbances are considered, such as varying wind, road friction, and bounded state disturbances from motion planning and decision making. Simulation results show that the stability control combining preview G-vectoring control and direct yaw moment control with additional activating conditions not only guarantees lateral stability but also improves tracking performance, and robust model predictive control endows the overall control system with robustness.

AB A growing number of research attempts have been made to enhance our knowledge about the characteristics of the potential early Autonomous Vehicle (AV) adopters. However, little is known about whether the public attitudes towards AVs change over time and how. With a multiyear cross-sectional travel survey data of the Puget Sound Region that encompasses the Seattle metropolitan area, we analyzed the fractions of population with various levels of interest and concerns regarding AVs. A two-part model combining a binary logit model and a partial proportional odds model was utilized to investigate the change of individuals' positions on AVs over time, controlling for their socio-demographic characteristics, travel behavior characteristics, and built environment attributes. We find that the percentage of population unfamiliar with AVs has declined over the years, which is probably due to a greater exposure to the information about AVs. All other variables being equal, individuals' interest in AVs has not changed over time while their concerns have increased across time. The findings suggest that information campaigns or educational programs that introduce the advantages of AV adoption with a focus on the safety aspects of AVs could potentially alter public attitudes, which could help achieve greater market penetration.

AB A midfrequency (2-6kHz) geoacoustic parameter inversion approach is proposed using a moving source and single receiver. The source motion creates a synthetic horizontal line array (SHLA), and the received signals, by source-receiver reciprocity, can be used to estimate the sedimentbottom parameters using matched field inversion (MFI). Using a wideband signal, the arrival times of multipaths are estimated using compressive sensing, from which one can estimate the source-receiver range, water depth, sediment thickness, and sound speed. This information is difficult to get at low frequencies due to the limited bandwidth. MFI is carried out using the frequency-coherent cost function and does not require the data to be precisely synchronized. Sensitivities of inversion of geoacoustic parameters are also studied. Performance using the SHLA is shown to be comparable to that using the conventional horizontal and vertical line array, and is shown to be sensitive to sediment attenuation-one of the difficult parameters to estimate. The proposed scheme uses short range (50-150 m) data, and requires a low-level source that can be carried by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). With the AUV traveling between nodes in a distributed sensors network, the inversion can be conducted over a large area.

AB Environment perception is critical for feasible path planning and safe driving for autonomous vehicles. Perception devices, such as camera, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), etc., only provide raw sensing data with no identification of vital objects, which is insufficient for autonomous vehicles to perform safe and efficient self-driving operations. This study proposes an improved edge-oriented segmentation-based method to detect the objects from the sensed three-dimensional (3D) point cloud. The improved edge-oriented segmentation-based method consists of three main steps: First, the bounding areas of objects are identified by edge detection and stixel estimation in corresponding two-dimensional (2D) images taken by a stereo camera. Second, 3D sparse point clouds of objects are reconstructed in bounding areas. Finally, the dense point clouds of objects are segmented by matching the 3D sparse point clouds of objects with the whole scene point cloud. After comparison with the existing methods of segmentation, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed edge-oriented segmentation method improves the precision of 3D point cloud segmentation, and that the objects can be segmented accurately. Meanwhile, the visualization of output data in advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) can be greatly facilitated due to the decrease in computational time and the decrease in the number of points in the object's point cloud.

AB A platoon of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is one of the promising autonomous-driving applications. Vehicles in a platoon need timely delivery of road-safety information in order to alter their speeds in time and thus maintain the stability of the platoon. The intra-platoon message delivery delay is a critical metric that has a big impact on the maintenance of a platoon's stability. It depends on several system parameters, such as the number of vehicles in a platoon, the intra-platoon spacing, and the distribution of non-platoon vehicles. This paper studies the analysis of the intra-platoon message delivery delay in a platoon of CAVs moving on a highway road. A theoretical analytical model is derived to investigate the impacts of major system parameters on the intra-platoon message delivery delay. The derived analytical model considers a V2V hop-by-hop communication mode and takes into account the effects of both platoon and non-platoon vehicle nodes on channel access contention. The effect of hidden vehicle nodes is also considered. The derived analytical model is validated through simulation results and the impacts of major system parameters on the intra-platoon message delivery delay are investigated through numerical results. The derived analytical model can be used to provide reasonable reference values for system parameter setting in order to maintain the stability of an autonomous-driving platoon.

AB The increased demand for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has also led to higher demand for realistic and efficient UAV testing environments. The current use of simulated environments has been shown to be a relatively inexpensive, safe, and repeatable way to evaluate UAVs before real-world use. However, the use of generic environments and manually-created custom scenarios leaves more to be desired. In this paper, we propose a new testbed that utilizes machine learning algorithms to procedurally generate, scale, and place 3D models to create a realistic environment. These environments are additionally based on satellite images, thus providing users with a more robust example of real-world UAV deployment. Although certain graphical improvements could be made, this paper serves as a proof of concept for an novel autonomous and relatively-large scale environment generator. Such a testbed could allow for preliminary operational planning and testing worldwide, without the need for on-site evaluation or data collection in the future.

AB This article discusses a challenge of the hydrodynamic coefficient identification in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The considered coefficients correspond to a nonlinear mathematical model of an AUV maneuvering in the horizontal plane. The dynamics of underwater vehicles is intrinsically nonlinear. Hence, to reproduce different types of maneuvers, such as straight line, zigzag, or turning in circles, a nonlinear mathematical model is important. The proposed identification approach combines an analytical and semiempirical estimation method (ASE), based on the hydrodynamics and geometric characteristics of submarine vehicles, with a parameter estimator based on the extended Kalman filter. The identification starts with ASE estimations, and then the estimator based on the extended Kalman filter adjusts the hydrodynamic coefficient estimates based on the experimental data. The experimental data were obtained with the sensors of the Pirajuba AUV during sea trials. This identification method is a cyclical estimation process, where the less reliable parameters are adjusted to the experimental data while the most reliable parameters are kept fixed. Therefore, in the next identification iteration, the originally fixed model parameters are adjusted to the experimental data, keeping the already identified values. Finally, the identified model is used to simulate the vehicle's movement, and the movement variables are compared to the experimental data, thus validating the identified model.

AB A vision-based anticipatory controller for the autonomous indoor navigation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is the topic of this paper. A dual Feedforward/Feedbac.k architecture has been used as the UAV's controller and the K-NN classifier using the gray level image histogram as discriminant variables has been applied for landmarks recognition. After a brief description of the UAV, we first identify the two main components of its autonomous navigation, namely, the landmark recognition and the dual controller based on cerebellar system of living beings, then we focus on the anticipatory module that has been implemented by an artificial neural network. Afterwards, the paper describes the experimental setup and discusses the experimental results centered mainly on the basic UAV's behavior of landmark approximation maneuver, which in topological navigation is known as the beaconing or homing problem.

AB The cavities beneath Antarctic ice shelves are among the least studied regions of the World Ocean, yet they are sites of globally important water mass transformations. Here we report results from a mission beneath Fimbul Ice Shelf of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The data reveal a spatially complex oceanographic environment, an ice base with widely varying roughness, and a cavity periodically exposed to water with a temperature significantly above the surface freezing point. The results of this, the briefest of glimpses of conditions in this extraordinary environment, are already reforming our view of the topographic and oceanographic conditions beneath ice shelves, holding out great promises for future missions from similar platforms.

AB Transportation disadvantage is about the difficulty accessing mobility services required to complete activities associated with employment, shopping, business, essential needs, and recreation. Technological innovations in the field of smart mobility have been identified as a potential solution to help individuals overcome issues associated with transportation disadvantage. This paper aims to provide a consolidated understanding on how smart mobility innovations can contribute to alleviate transportation disadvantage. A systematic literature review is completed, and a conceptual framework is developed to provide the required information to address transportation disadvantage. The results are categorized under the physical, economic, spatial, temporal, psychological, information, and institutional dimensions of transportation disadvantage. The study findings reveal that: (a) Primary smart mobility innovations identified in the literature are demand responsive transportation, shared transportation, intelligent transportation systems, electric mobility, autonomous vehicles, and Mobility-as-a-Services. (b) Smart mobility innovations could benefit urban areas by improving accessibility, efficiency, coverage, flexibility, safety, and the overall integration of the transportation system. (c) Smart mobility innovations have the potential to contribute to the alleviation of transportation disadvantage. (d) Mobility-as-a-Service has high potential to alleviate transportation disadvantage primarily due to its ability to integrate a wide-range of services.

AB This article introduces the reader to a new generation of ocean data platforms known as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (or AUVs) brought about by promising technology developments in new sensors, memories, embedded controllers and materials. There has been a growing interest by oil and gas exploration industry in using deep water AUVs to map bathymetry around an oil well head, by the navy in mine surveillance or intelligence gathering, and abundant activity by the scientific and engineering communities scattered in several dozen universities and-research establishments around the globe in building their own versions of AUVs for scientific data collection. In order to demystify the notion that AUVs are complex, high technology devices, we include a description of the main building blocks that go into the design of an AUV. This is followed by a brief look at the current scenario in AUV developments, but narrowing our attention to three noteworthy operational AUVs, and to our on-going development of a small AUV at the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa. The ultimate aim in AUV research and development is to reach the stage of unescorted missions that will see AUVs leaving and entering the world's harbours autonomously or doing the same from the shore. We shall see that this implies the implementation of safety standards of a high degree in a stable, well-tested and reliable vehicle architecture.

AB As autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely used to perform cooperative works with sensor nodes for data gathering, the need for long-range AUVs has further grown to support the long-duration cooperation with sensor nodes. However, as existing data-gathering protocols for the cooperative works have not considered AUVs' energy consumption, AUVs can deplete their energy more quickly before fulfilling their missions. The objective of this work is to develop an AUV based data-gathering protocol that maximizes the duration for the cooperative works. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol outperforms existing protocols with respect to the long-range AUVs.

AB Recently, the importance of vehicle safety supporting system has been highlighted as autonomous driving and platooning has attracted the researchers. To ensure driving safety, each vehicle must broadcast a basic safety message (BSM) every 100 ms. However, stable BSM exchange is difficult because of the changing environment and limited bandwidth of vehicular wireless communication. The increasing number of vehicles on the road increases the competition to access wireless networks for BSM exchange; this increases the packet collision rate. An increased packet collision rate impairs the transmission and reception of BSM information, which can easily cause a traffic accident. We propose a solution, the vehicular safety support system (V3S), which exchanges BSMs reliably even when many vehicles are on the road. The V3S uses a clustering scheme to decrease network traffic by reducing the amount of data exchanged between a vehicle and the roadside unit (RSU). In addition, the V3S reduces the collision rate of wireless network packets by broadcasting the vehicle's BSM in an allocated timeslot using the time division multiple access (TDMA) MAC protocol. The V3S also deals with insufficient bandwidth for dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) by changing DSRC channels according to traffic flow. In evaluating the packet error rate for stable BSM packet delivery, the V3S demonstrates an excellent packet error rate of less than 1%, compared to the 802.11p with its packet error rate of 82%.

AB Vision-based map-matching with HD map for high precision vehicle localization has gained great attention for its low-cost and ease of deployment. However, its localization performance is still unsatisfactory in accuracy and robustness in numerous real applications due to the sparsity and noise of the perceived HD map landmarks. This article proposes the tightly-coupled monocular map-matching localization algorithm (TM(3)Loc) for monocular-based vehicle localization. TM(3)Loc introduces semantic chamfer matching (SCM) to model monocular map-matching problem and combines visual features with SCM in a tightly-coupled manner. By applying the sliding window-based optimization technique, the historical visual features and HD map constraints are also introduced, such that the vehicle poses are estimated with an abundance of visual features and multi-frame HD map landmark features, rather than with single-frame HD map observations in previous works. Experiments are conducted on large scale dataset of 15 km long in total. The results show that TM(3)Loc is able to achieve high precision localization performance using a low-cost monocular camera, largely exceeding the performance of the previous state-of-the-art methods, thereby promoting the development of autonomous driving.

AB Predicting future trajectories of surrounding vehicles accurately benefits the decision-making and motion-planning of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Physical-model-based prediction methods are generally accurate in short horizon prediction, but often fail in long-horizon prediction owing to the simplicity of the models and the complexity of the environment. Data-driven prediction methods can achieve promising performance in complex traffic scenarios and long-horizon prediction tasks. However, they might not be reliable on some occasions compared with model-based approaches, mainly owing to their uncertainty, poor interpretability and unsatisfying ability to learn the physical constraints of vehicles. In this paper, a novel cooperative vehicle trajectory prediction strategy exploiting the advantages of the two categories of prediction methods is proposed. The prediction results of the data-driven and kinematic models together with their uncertainties are described by the bivariate Gaussian model, and subsequently combined with an innovatively designed Kalman filter. The fusion strategy provides both physical and environmental constraints on the two types of methods for better prediction performance in both short and long horizons. Experiments applying different data-driven methods were carried out on the public BEV High-D dataset, as well as our specially-collected first-point-of-view highway dataset. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms both the sub-models adopted in terms of prediction accuracy.

AB The driver acceleration/deceleration (A/D) profiles on surface streets have broad applications in transportation. With a large, high-resolution naturalistic driving data set, this article explores the normal driver A/D profiles in high-speed (>= 35 mi/h) environments by checking vehicle trajectories passing through isolated, rural high-speed, all-way-stop-controlled intersections. It is found that although drivers obviously decelerate in most trips when approaching stop signs, they only fully stop in 10.5% of trips, leading to safety concerns. It is noteworthy that accelerations generally take more time and distance than decelerations. On average, it takes 20.7 s and 1,059.7 ft for a deceleration maneuver and 25.2 s and 1,267.5 ft for an acceleration maneuver. The maximum deceleration rates in most trips are found to still comply with the existing design criteria. With the increase of travel speed, A/D distances keep increasing, whereas A/D durations increase first but then keep consistent around 22.5 s/26.5 s beyond 50 mi/h. Nonlinear relationships are found to exist between speed and travel distance in A/D and can be captured with the random effects loglog models. The estimated models give new insights for developing autonomous vehicles running like human drivers rather than machine robots on surface streets.

AB Due to the high mobility, dynamic nature, and legacy vehicular networks, the seamless connectivity and reliability become a new challenge in software-defined internet of vehicles based intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Thus, effieicnt optimization of the link with proper monitoring of the high speed of vehicles in ITS is very vital to promote the error-free and trustable platform. Key issues related to reliability, connectivity and stability optimization for vehicular networks are addressed. Thus, this study proposes a novel reliable connectivity framework by developing a stable, and scalable link optimization (SSLO) algorithm, state-of-the-art system model. In addition, a Use-case of smart city with stable and reliable connectivity is proposed by examining the importance of vehicular networks. The numerical experimental results are extracted from software defined-Internet of Vehicle (SD-IoV) platform which shows high stability and reliability of the proposed SSLO under different test scenarios, such as vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to anything (V2X). The proposed SSLO and Baseline algorithms are compared in terms of performance metrics e.g. packet loss ratio, transmission power (i.e., stability), average throughput, and average delay transfer. Finally, the validated results reveal that SSLO algorithm optimizes connectivity (95%), energy efficiency (67%), throughput (4Kbps) and delay (3 sec).

AB Stability as well as robustness is the major concerns in the design of a trajectory tracking controller for an autonomous vehicle. In this paper, a novel lateral stability controller design for vehicle path tracking is developed. First, using dynamic game theory as a general framework, vehicle lateral stability can be viewed as a dynamic difference game so that its two players, namely, the active front steering (AFS) system and active rear steering (ARS) system can work together to provide more stability for vehicle path tracking control. The interactive steering control strategies between AFS and ARS are obtained by noncooperative closed-loop feedback Stackelberg game theory to ensure optimal performance for vehicle path tracking. Then, based on the proposed path-following shared control paradigm, by applying the method of zero-sum game theory, a finite-time robust regulator is developed to make the interaction model more robust to uncertain lateral disturbances. Finally, double-lane change and serpentine driving condition with and without uncertain time-varying lateral disturbance are used to evaluate the proposed control algorithm. Simulation and hardware-in-loop implementation results show that the proposed shared control paradigm based robust path-tracking controller can robustly provide better lateral stability when time varying lateral disturbances are bounded.

AB This paper looks at the possibility of knowledge development of machines from an engineer's point of view. First, the increasing need for autonomous operations of vehicles, manufacturing facilities, utility networks, and robots is reviewed. From the point of view of operational design, five desirable ingredients are identified that can facilitate control autonomy. Most of these facilitators can be enabled by using the methodology of natural language programming and writing of documents that machines can read and utilize to improve their feedback control skills, their knowledge of the environment, and also their decision-making skills. A forward look outlines the benefits of 'publishing for machines', to manufacturing, vehicle operations, utility networks, and robots.

AB Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) is an important tool in assisting Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA). EEM in the offshore petroleum industry has been conducted worldwide, but traditional approaches have struggled to keep apace as exploration and production activities move to frontier regions, such as increasingly deeper waters and Arctic regions. This paper proposes the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for environmental monitoring of offshore facilities as a means of improving and expanding the overall monitoring program. The paper provides a review of technical and procedural issues involved in this application of AUV technology, including the current status of offshore oil and gas EEM, a review of available AUVs and a survey of developments in in situ sensors.

AB AUTOSUB-2, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) developed by the Southampton Oceanography Centre, was used for high resolution hydrographic surveys in the Sicily Strait. A combination of "seasoar" type profiling and terrain following missions were undertaken and velocity and hydrographic measurements taken from AUTOSUB-2 were compared with concurrent shipboard hydrographic and velocity profiles. Even though shipboard stations were separated by just 5 to 8 km along the mission path, data from the AUV showed small scale variability that was missed by the shipboard sampling. In this paper we present the examine of an intense jet, with maximum speed greater than 0.50 m s(-1), less than 4 km wide.

AB In navigation and motion control of an autonomous vehicle, estimation of at filmic and heading is an important issue, especially when the localization sensors such as global positioning system (GPS) are not available and the vehicle is navigated by the dead reckoning (DR) strategies. In this paper, based on a new modeling framework, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is utilized fir estimation of attitude. heading. and gyroscope sensor bias using a low-cost microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensor. The algorithm is developed for accurate estimation of attitude and heading in the presence of external disturbances including external body acceleration and magnetic disturbances. In this study, using the proposed attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) and an identified surge dynamic Id of an autonomous underwater vehicle, a low-cost model-aided DR navigation. system has been designed for an AUV. The proposed algorithm application is evaluated by experimental tests in different acceleration bound and existence of external magnetic disturbances for an AUV. The results indicate that the roll, pitch, and heading are estimated by mean value errors about 0.35 degrees, 0.29 degrees, and 1.27 degrees, respectively. Moreover, they indicate that a relative navigation error about 8% of the traveling distance can be achieved using the developed approach in during GPS outages.

ID STORAGE; NETWORKS
AB Technological innovations in warehouse automation systems, such as Autonomous Vehicle based Storage and Retrieval System (AVS/RS), are geared towards achieving greater operational efficiency and flexibility that would be necessary in warehouses of the future. AVS/RS relies on autonomous vehicles and lifts for horizontal and vertical transfer of unit-loads respectively. To implement a new technology such as AVS/RS, the choice of a design variable setting, interactions among the design variables, and the design trade-offs need to be well understood. In particular, design decisions such as the choice of vehicle dwell-point and location of cross-aisles could significantly affect the performance of an AVS/RS. Hence, we investigate the effect of these design decisions using customized analytical models based on multi-class semi-open queuing network theory. Numerical studies suggest that the average percentage reduction in storage and retrieval transactions with appropriate choice of dwell-point is about 8 percent and 4 percent respectively. While end of aisle location of the cross-aisle is commonly used in practice, our model suggests that there exists a better cross-aisle location within a tier (about 15 percent from end of aisle); however, the cycle time benefits by choosing the optimal cross-aisle location in comparison to the end of aisle cross-aisle location is marginal. Detailed simulations also indicate that the analytical model yields fairly accurate results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Mapping and localization; Autonomous driving
AB Accurately localizing the vehicle against a pre-built high precision map is an essential step for the Autonomous Land Vehicle (ALV). This paper proposes an efficient scan-to-map matching approach based on multi-channel lidar. We firstly advocate the usage of both the lidar reflectance map and the height map, as these two maps contain complementary information. Then, borrowing ideas from the Lucas-Kanade optical flow approach, we formulate the scan-to-map matching problem in a similar form, and propose an efficient gradient descent approach to solve it. Finally, the proposed approach is integrated into a filtering framework for real-time online localization. Experiments on real-world dataset have demonstrated the validity of our approach.

AB This paper describes the design of an embedded control system for a four-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to perform hover flights. A dynamic model of the vehicle is presented using an Euler-Lagrange approach. A control strategy based on nested saturation is proposed. An embedded control system architecture is described for autonomous hover flight. The main components of the system are a microcontroller, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a global positioning system (GPS) and infrared sensors. The Euler angles are computed using a data fusion algorithm. The experimental results show that the on-board control system performs satisfactorily for autonomous hovering indoors.

AB Occupancy grid maps are widely used as an environment model that allows the fusion of different range sensor technologies in real-time for robotics applications. In an autonomous vehicle setting, occupancy grid maps are especially useful for their ability to accurately represent the position of surrounding obstacles while being robust to discrepancies between the fused sensors through the use of occupancy probabilities representing uncertainty. In this article, we propose to evaluate the applicability of real-time vehicle detection on occupancy grid maps. State of the art detectors in sensor-specific domains such as YOLOv2/YOLOv3 for images or PIXOR for LiDAR point clouds are modified to use occupancy grid maps as input and produce oriented bounding boxes enclosing vehicles as output. The five proposed detectors are trained on the Waymo Open automotive dataset and compared regarding the quality of their detections measured in terms of Average Precision (AP) and their real-time capabilities measured in Frames Per Second (FPS). Of the five detectors presented, one inspired from the PIXOR backbone reaches the highest AP(0.7) of 0.82 and runs at 20 FPS. Comparatively, two other proposed detectors inspired from YOLOv2 achieve an almost as good, with a AP(0.7) of 0.79 while running at 91 FPS. These results validate the feasibility of real-time vehicle detection on occupancy grids.

AB Work zone areas are frequent congested sections considered as the freeway bottleneck. Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) trajectory optimization can improve the operating efficiency in bottleneck areas by harmonizing vehicles' manipulations. This study presents a joint trajectory optimization of cooperative lane changing, merging, and car-following actions for CAV control at a local merging point together with upstream points. The multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is applied in this system, with one agent providing a merging advisory service at the merging point and controlling the inner-lane vehicles' headway for smooth outer-lane vehicle merging, while other agents provide lane-changing advisory services at advance lane-changing points to control how vehicles make lane changes in advance and perform corresponding headway adjustment, similar to and jointly with the merging advisory service. Uniting all agents, the coordination graph (CG) method is applied to seek the global optimum, overcoming the exponential growth problem in MARL. Using MATLAB and the VISSIM COM interface, an online simulation platform is established. The simulation results show that MARL is effective for online computation with in-timing response. More importantly, comparisons of the results obtained in various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed system obtained smoother vehicle trajectories in all controlled sections, rather than only in the merging area, indicating that it can achieve better traffic conditions in freeway work zone areas.

AB Detecting and classifying driver distractions is crucial in the prevention of road accidents. These distractions impact both driver behavior and vehicle dynamics. Knowing the degree of driver distraction can aid in accident prevention techniques, including transitioning of control to a level 4 semi-autonomous vehicle, when a high distraction severity level is reached. Thus, enhancement of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) is a critical component in the safety of vehicle drivers and other road users. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced, using an expert knowledge rule system to predict the severity of distraction in a contiguous set of video frames using the Naturalistic Driving American University of Cairo (AUC) Distraction Dataset. A multi-class distraction system comprises the face orientation, drivers & x2019; activities, hands and previous driver distraction, a severity classification model is developed as a discrete dynamic Bayesian (DDB). Furthermore, a Mamdani-based fuzzy system was implemented to detect multi-class of distractions into a severity level of safe, careless or dangerous driving. Thus, if a high level of severity is reached the semi-autonomous vehicle will take control. The result further shows that some instances of driver & x2019;s distraction may quickly transition from a careless to dangerous driving in a multi-class distraction context.

AB As connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) enter the fleet, there will be a long period when these vehicles will have to interact with human drivers. One of the challenges for CAVs is that human drivers do not communicate their decisions well. Fortunately, the kinematic behavior of a human-driven vehicle may be a good predictor of driver intent within a short time frame. We analyzed the kinematic time series data (e.g., speed) for a set of drivers making left turns at intersections to predict whether the driver would stop before executing the turn. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to generate independent dimensions that explain the variation in vehicle speed before a turn. These dimensions remained relatively consistent throughout the maneuver, allowing us to compute independent scores on these dimensions for different time windows throughout the approach to the intersection. We then linked these PCA scores to whether a driver would stop before executing a left turn using the random intercept Bayesian additive regression trees. Five more road and observable vehicle characteristics were included to enhance prediction. Our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 at 94 m away from the center of an intersection and steadily increased to 0.90 by 46 m away from the center of an intersection.

AB The emergence of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) provides a possibility to develop an efficient and sustainable mobility option. To foster the adoption of CAVs, the dedicated CAV lanes have been widely discussed in terms of optimal planning and allocating infrastructures for CAVs. Meanwhile, a sensible operation manner of dedicated lanes is also crucial to reap the maximum benefits. In this paper, we propose a novel idea, i.e., the intermittent dedicated CAV lanes (IDCLs), which dynamically provide a separate right-of-way for human-driven vehicles (HVs) to maximize traffic efficiency and minimize environmental costs. To this end, we first tailor two multi-class queuing models as fundamental tools to evaluate the traffic state. A traffic emission model is proposed based on the proposed queuing models. Then, a queuing-based bi-objective optimization model, which aims to maximize the traffic throughput and minimize the green tax simultaneously, is developed for the optimal operation of IDCL. Subsequently, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is employed to find the Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted under different market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs and various traffic intensities. The results reported in this paper help policymakers and authorities draw insights into the IDCL policy. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to revolutionize transportation and improve road safety significantly. However, these benefits do not come without cost; AVs require large Deep-Learning (DL) models and powerful hardware platforms to operate reliably in real-time, requiring between several hundred watts to one kilowatt of power. This power consumption can dramatically reduce vehicles' driving range and affect emissions. To address this problem, we propose SAGE: a methodology for selectively offloading the key energy-consuming modules of DL architectures to the cloud to optimize edge, energy usage while meeting real-time latency constraints. Furthermore, we leverage Head Network Distillation (HND) to introduce efficient bottlenecks within the DL architecture in order to minimize the network overhead costs of offloading with almost no degradation in the model's performance. We evaluate SAGE using an Nvidia Jetson TX2 and an industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 as the AV edge, devices and demonstrate that our offloading strategy is practical for a wide range of DL models and internet connection bandwidths on 3G, 4G LTE, and WiFi technologies. Compared to edge-only computation, SAGE reduces energy consumption by an average of 36.13%, 47.07%, and 55.66% for an AV with one low-resolution camera, one high-resolution camera, and three high-resolution cameras, respectively. SAGE also reduces upload data size by up to 98.40% compared to direct camera offloading.

TI Incorporating Attitudinal Factors to Examine Adoption of and Willingness
   to Pay for Autonomous Vehicles
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Results from a recent consumer survey were thoroughly analyzed in relation to willingness to adopt and willingness to pay (WTP) for different autonomous vehicle (AV) features. Four different levels of automation were considered including basic vehicles, adding advanced features, partial automation, and full automation. A structural equations model with latent variables was employed, which simultaneously regressed adoption and WTP levels against a variety of available variables including socioeconomic and demographic attributes, private car usage habits, and attitudinal preferences/personal opinions. To address the endogeneity in personal attitudes, these variables were added to the model as latent factors. Accordingly, the analysis revealed four major latent attitudinal factors, respectively labeled as "joy of driving,""mode choice reasoning,""trust," and "technology savviness." Model results indicated that those who enjoy driving were the hardest to persuade towards AV adoption or to pay for automated features. On the other hand, technology savvy people showed higher tendency towards AV adoption. When it comes to factors affecting mode choice including travel time, travel cost, and functionality, people are willing to pay more for automated features when they believe that these features and services will provide them better utility, in relation to time and cost savings, convenience, stress reduction, and quality of life, and so forth. Interestingly, individuals with trust concerns showed higher WTP values, which may indicate that the market believes autonomous vehicles will bring more privacy and protection, at least compared with existing shared mobility or public transit options.

AB This paper proposes a simplified nonlinear fuzzy controller integrating an improved three-dimensional (3D) guidance law, in order to address the problem of path following for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) exposed to unknown environmental disturbances. First, an improved 3D line-of-sight guidance law that makes full use of the essentially equivalent coordinate transformation is derived to transform 3D path following position errors into controlled guidance speeds, which also reduces the path following system form second-order to first-order. The side-slip angle and angle of attack are integrated into 3D guidance design to account for the underactuated configuration in sway and heave. Second, a nonlinear single-input fuzzy controller is designed to reduce computation complexity resulting from square rules in a double-input fuzzy controller, and to force the steerable speeds of an AUV to attain their guidance profiles. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis is adopted to suggest that the nonlinear fuzzy design with the convergent distribution and small slope for the single input have better robustness against unknown disturbances than the linear design. Finally, numerical examples with quantitative comparison are provided to illustrate the performance of the nonlinear single-input fuzzy controller for 3D path following of an underactuated AUV exposed to unknown environmental disturbances.

Time-sensitive network (TSN) with the characteristics of determinism, low latency, high reliability, large bandwidth, and open industry standards, has been considered as the most promising technology for the next-generation IVNs. This article summarizes the current state and methodologies of in-vehicle TSN research through the following five aspects: 1) Quality of Service (QoS) strategy; 2) reliability; 3) clock synchronization; 4) network planning; and 5) network management. The corresponding research priorities and technical challenges are also addressed, respectively.

AB This paper presents simple analytical techniques that are used to understand and control high sideslip drift manoeuvres of road vehicles. These are manoeuvres in which a skilled driver stabilises a vehicle beyond its limits of handling, an operating regime responsible for major safety concerns in everyday driving. An analysis of the equilibria of a bicycle model with nonlinear tyres reveals the existence of unstable 'drift equilibria' corresponding to cornering at high sideslip angle in a countersteer configuration. Equipped with this information, linearisation about a desired drift equilibrium is used to design a controller that stabilises the vehicle at the equilibrium. The controller is subsequently implemented on a steer- and drive-by-wire testbed and successfully used to achieve autonomous drifts.

ID MORNING COMMUTE PROBLEM; NETWORK; ASSIGNMENT; FACILITIES; TIME
AB The lack of parking infrastructure continues to pose a problem for urban commuters, as the parking demand in most cities outstrips supply and significant driver time is expended searching for parking. The emergence of vehicle automation offers an opportunity to help mitigate this issue. In the autonomous vehicle (AV) era, it is expected that after dropping off its passengers at their destinations, the AV will park at a relatively inexpensive parking facility located outside the downtown area instead of the existing, higher-priced facilities in the central business district (CBD). This is expected to decrease CBD parking demand, ultimately leading to the possible decommissioning and repurposing of some existing parking infrastructure in the CBD and the construction of new infrastructure in the city's outlying areas. What is needed, therefore, is a framework for city road agencies for decommissioning/relocating/locating and user pricing of parking infrastructure to serve human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and AVs. To address this issue, this study presents a bilevel framework. The road agency (at the upper level) seeks to: (1) minimize travelers' cost systemwide; and (2) maximize monetary benefits of infrastructure decommissioning and parking fee revenue at the upper level. Travelers (at the lower level) seek to reduce their costs of travel in response to the road agency's decisions made at the upper level. A hybridized solution approach (optimization heuristics and machine learning) is implemented for this mixed-integer nonlinear problem. The numerical experiments provided a number of insights regarding parking infrastructure location design and user pricing in the prospective AV era.

AB An autonomous vehicle (AV) uses high-level decision making and lower-level actuator controls, such as throttle (acceleration), braking (deceleration), and steering (change in lateral direction) to navigate through various types of road networks. Path planning and path following for highway driving are currently available in series-produced highly automated vehicles. In addition to these, emergency collision avoidance decision making and maneuvering are another key and essential feature that is needed in a series production AV at highway driving speeds. For reliability, low cost, and fast computation, such an emergency obstacle avoidance maneuvering system should use well-established conventional methods as opposed to data-driven neural networks or reinforcement learning methods, which are currently not suitable for use in highway AV driving. This paper presents a novel Emergency Obstacle Avoidance Maneuver (EOAM) methodology for AVs traveling at higher speeds and lower road surface friction, involving time-critical maneuver determination and control. The proposed EOAM framework offers usage of the AV's sensing, perception, control, and actuation system abilities as one cohesive system to avoid an on-road obstacle, based first on performance feasibility and second on passenger comfort, and it is designed to be well integrated within an AV's high-level control and decision-making system. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, co-simulation including the AV's EOAM logic in Simulink and a vehicle model in CarSim is conducted with speeds ranging from 55 to 165 km/h and on road surfaces with friction ranging from 1.0 to 0.1. The results are analyzed and interpreted in the context of an entire AV system, with implications for future work.

AB Parking is a crucial element of the driving experience in urban transportation systems. Especially in the coming era of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs), parking operations in urban transportation networks may inevitably change. Parking stations are likely to serve as storage places for unused vehicles and depots that control the level-of-service of SAVs. This study presents an Analytical Parking Planning Model (APPM) for the SAV environment to provide broader insights into parking planning decisions. Two specific planning scenarios are considered for the APPM: (i) Single-zone APPM (S-APPM), which considers the target area as a single homogeneous zone, and (ii) Two-zone APPM (T-APPM), which considers the target area as two different zones, such as city center and suburban area. S-APPM offers a closed-form solution to find the optimal density of parking stations and parking spaces and the optimal number of SAV fleets, which is beneficial for understanding the explicit relationship between planning decisions and the given environments, including demand density and cost factors. In addition, to incorporate different macroscopic characteristics across two zones, T-APPM accounts for inter -and intra-zonal passenger trips and the relocation of vehicles. We conduct a case study to demonstrate the proposed method with the actual data collected in Seoul Metropolitan Area, South Korea. We find that the optimal densities of parking stations and spaces in the target area are much lower than the current situation. Sensitivity analyses with respect to cost factors are performed to provide decision-makers with further insights.

AB The automotive companies nowadays are working on the development and deployment of the future intelligent transportation systems and connected-autonomous driving addressing any security and privacy concerns of users. In the field of connectivity, vehicular networks are constructed to manage communications among nearby vehicles and between vehicles and road-side infrastructure units and trusted agencies or certificate authorities. The above cooperative systems applications bring the promise of improved road safety and optimised road traffic. For the successful deployment of vehicular communications (VCs), it is essential to make sure that 'life-critical safety' information cannot be modified by external or internal within the network attackers. On this basis, lack of such security and privacy in vehicular networks is one of the key hindrances to the widespread implementations of connected-autonomous-driving applications. Moreover, specific operational parameters (highly moving vehicles, frequently and fast changed connectivity) make the problem very novel and challenging. For the present study, a protocol for data privacy and authenticated VC interactions, based on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, is applied. The above analysis aims to improve the security and enhance the efficiency of VCs toward the deployment of Internet of vehicles technology in the transport area.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; DESIGN; SYSTEMS
AB This paper proposes an adaptive tube-based nonlinear model predictive control (AT-NMPC) approach to the design of autonomous cruise control systems. The proposed method utilizes two separate models to define the constrained receding horizon optimal control problem. A fixed nominal model is used to handle the problem constraints based on a robust tube-based approach. A separate adaptivemodel is used to define the objective function, which utilizes least square online parameter estimators for adaption. By having two separate models, this method takes into account uncertainties, modeling errors, and delayed data in the design of the controller and guaranties robust constraint handling, while adapting to them to improve control performance. Furthermore, to be able to implement the designed AT-NMPC in real-time, a Newton/GMRES fast solver is employed to solve the optimization problem. Simulations performed on a high-fidelity model of the baseline vehicle, the Toyota plug-in Prius, which is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, show that the proposed controller is able to handle the defined constraints in the presence of uncertainty, while improving the energy cost of the trip. Moreover, the result of the hardware-in-loop experiment demonstrates the performance of the proposed controller in a real-time application.

AB The inspection of electrical and mechanical (E&M) devices using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become an increasingly popular choice in the last decade due to their flexibility and mobility. UAVs have the potential to reduce human involvement in visual inspection tasks, which could increase efficiency and reduce risks. This paper presents a UAV system for autonomously performing E&M device inspection. The proposed system relies on learning-based detection for perception, multi-sensor fusion for localization, and path planning for fully autonomous inspection. The perception method utilizes semantic and spatial information generated by a 2-D object detector. The information is then fused with depth measurements for object state estimation. No prior knowledge about the location and category of the target device is needed. The system design is validated by flight experiments using a quadrotor platform. The result shows that the proposed UAV system enables the inspection mission autonomously and ensures a stable and collision-free flight.

AB Inspection of industrial chimneys and smoke pipes induces high costs due to production downtimes and imposes risks to the health of human workers due to high temperatures and toxic gases. We aim at speeding up and automating this process with multicopter micro aerial vehicles. To acquire high quality sensor data, flying close to the walls of the chimney is inevitable, imposing high demands on good localization and fast and reliable control. In this paper, we present an integrated chimney inspection system based on a small lightweight flying platform, well-suited for maneuvering in narrow space. For navigation and obstacle avoidance, it is equipped with a multimodal sensor setup including a lightweight rotating 3D laser scanner, stereo cameras for visual odometry and high-resolution surface inspection. We tested our system in a decommissioned industrial chimney at the Zollverein UNESCO world heritage site and present results from autonomous flights and reconstructions of the chimney surface.

AB The dynamic approach proposes a set of concepts with the help of which autonomous systems can be specified and designed. While the approach builds systems from elementary behaviors driven by behavior-specific sensory information, it also represents behaviors internally in terms of the state of dynamical systems, thus positioning itself somewhere between classical and behavior-based approaches. This paper demonstrates that the dynamic approach lends itself naturally to implementation on computationally weak platforms working with very low-level sensory information. Obstacle avoidance and target acquisition are implemented an a micro-controller based vehicle equipped with only five infra-red detectors and two photoresistors. We show how theoretical design, software simulation, and hardware implementation are enchained effortlessly. The resulting behavior is particularly smooth and requires no parameter optimization. As a technical novelty we demonstrate the integration of dynamics at two different levels of temporal derivative.

AB Where most so-called autonomous underwater vehicles are automated, they have limited autonomy in the traditional sense of being free to choose new courses of action. Onboard software systems have a narrow range of sensor processing and mission replanning capabilities due to the expense and the complexity of these operations, as well as a lack of operator trust in the validity of plans that operators cannot inspect before execution. The advent of machine learning and the maturation of new ideas in automated planning will reduce the cost and difficulty of fielding more autonomous systems, attacking the first difficulty. The second difficulty-that of trust-is severe for underwater robotics, where the more traditional approach of intelligent systems acting as operator aids is made difficult by the physics. Increasing trust will require technical advances in assured autonomy that are only just beginning. We survey the history of artificial intelligence (AI) for robotics, highlighting important developments that will influence future systems.

AB The design, construction, and testing of a large distributed system of novel, small, low-cost, autonomous surface vehicles in the form of self-propelled buoys capable of operating in open waters is reported. We detail the successful testing of collective behaviors of systems with up to 50 buoys, achieving scalable deployment and dynamic monitoring in unstructured environments. This constitutes the largest distributed multi-robot system of its kind reported to date. We confirm the robustness of the system to the loss of multiple units for different collective behaviors such as flocking, navigation, and area coverage. For dynamic area monitoring, we introduce a new metric to quantify coverage effectiveness. Our system exhibits near optimal scalability for fixed target areas and a high degree of flexibility when the shape of the target changes with time. This system demonstrates the potential of distributed multi-robot systems for the pervasive and persistent monitoring of coastal and inland water environments.

AB In a connected vehicle environment, vehicles are able to communicate and exchange detailed information such as speed, acceleration, and position in real time. Such information exchange is important for improving traffic safety and mobility. This allows vehicles to collaborate with each other, which can significantly improve traffic operations particularly at intersections and freeway ramps. To assess the potential safety and mobility benefits of collaborative driving enabled by connected vehicle technologies, this study developed an optimization-based ramp control strategy and a simulation evaluation platform using VISSIM, MATLAB, and the Car2X module in VISSIM. The ramp control strategy is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solved by the MATLAB optimization toolbox. The optimization model provides individual vehicles with step-by-step control instructions in the ramp merging area. In addition to the optimization-based ramp control strategy, an empirical gradual speed limit control strategy is also formulated. These strategies are evaluated using the developed simulation platform in terms of average speed, average delay time, and throughput and are compared with a benchmark case with no control. The study results indicate that the proposed optimal control strategy can effectively coordinate merging vehicles at freeway on-ramps and substantially improve safety and mobility, especially when the freeway traffic is not oversaturated. The ramp control strategy can be further extended to improve traffic operations at bottlenecks caused by incidents, which cause approximately 25% of traffic congestion in the United States.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; GAP ACCEPTANCE; POLICY
AB Autonomous navigation in dense traffic scenarios remains challenging for autonomous vehicles (AVs) because the intentions of other drivers are not directly observable and AVs have to deal with a wide range of driving behaviors. To maneuver through dense traffic, AVs must be able to reason how their actions affect others (interaction model) and exploit this reasoning to navigate through dense traffic safely. This paper presents a novel framework for interaction-aware motion planning in dense traffic scenarios. We explore the connection between human driving behavior and their velocity changes when interacting. Hence, we propose to learn, via deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), an interaction-aware policy providing global guidance about the cooperativeness of other vehicles to an optimization-based planner ensuring safety and kinematic feasibility through constraint satisfaction. The learned policy can reason and guide the local optimization-based planner with interactive behavior to pro-actively merge in dense traffic while remaining safe in case other vehicles do not yield. We present qualitative and quantitative results in highly interactive simulation environments (highway merging and unprotected left turns) against two baseline approaches, a learning-based and an optimization-based method. The presented results show that our method significantly reduces the number of collisions and increases the success rate with respect to both learning-based and optimization-based baselines.

ID DESIGN
AB A novel compact initiative braking system orienting intelligent vehicles and autonomous driving is revealed. The delicate arrangement of on-off switch valves guarantees precise hydraulic pressure modulation. Integrated stroke simulator provides a well-tuned pedal force feedback. The fallback level is intensively designed to be nondegraded. A hierarchical control frame with the underlying hydraulic controller is designed to govern operation procedures. The underlying hydraulic controller is set up based on adaptive gain scheduling proportion differentiation controller and logic threshold control. Hardware-in-loop tests are carried out in full perspectives. The test result of slope-sine combination tracking shows that, compared with the conventional proportion integration differentiation controller, the designed underlying controller achieves higher pressure modulation accuracy with no chattering effect. Controller robustness to accumulator pressure fluctuation is proven by the dual-cylinder tracking test. A batch of step-response tests under different accumulator pressures shows a rapid pressure building capability in emergency situations under all pressure range. The fail-safe test result indicates that the conventional hydraulic brake can be restored in 1.5 s with the operation of the driver, which significantly increases the margin of brake safety for highly autonomous vehicles. The regenerative braking test result suggests the immense potential of the developed system in an application to electrified vehicles.

AB The widespread of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) promises a transportation system revolution. Despite its potential benefits, there has been an unsolved discussion of how AV should behave during unavoidable crash situations, which is known as the Moral Dilemma of AV. The goal of this study is to investigate how AV Morality can be designed to align with human values by observing human moral reasoning process, which could be applicable for AV Moral Dilemma scenarios. To do that, we used an exploratory sequential mixed-research methodology to compare human moral reasoning types from two cultures: Korea, a highly collectivist culture, and Canada, a typical individualist culture. First, unavoidable crash scenarios that reflect the complex real-world crash contexts were developed. Second, a moral thought experiment in the form of in-depth interviews was conducted for both cultures (N = 70, Koreans = 33, Canadians = 37). Finally, K-means clustering analysis was conducted. As a result, three human moral reasoning types (Moral Altruist, Moral Non-determinist, and Moral-Deontologist) were defined. The study results reduce abstractness of AV morality by defining distinct moral decision-making patterns which are described by moral value. The findings provide guidelines for designing culture-specific moral behaviors, provide guidelines for AV practitioners, and increase AV morality transparency for the public.

ID RECONFIGURABLE INTELLIGENT SURFACES
AB The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has gained increased attention for improving the performance and efficiency of the fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless communication by obviating the propagation and blockage issues. On the other hand, the great flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has made them effective gadgets to enhance the coverage of wireless communication networks. Combining these two emerging technologies, the RIS-outfitted UAV (RISoUAV) is a promising solution for providing line-of-sight (LoS) wireless links for mobile targets (MTs) in obstructed high-dense urban areas. In this light, high-speed real-time communication is essential for some vital municipal services like ambulances, fire engines, security guards, police, etc. This important goal is achievable thanks to the RISoUAV-assisted 5G/quasi-optic wireless communication. This paper develops a framework for optimal navigation of a team of RISoUAVs for maintaining LoS links with a team of ground vehicles in a dense urban area. The trajectories of the RISoUAVs are optimized considering the energy efficiency, communication channel gains, and constraints associated with RISoUAVs motion and LoS service. A consensus-based coordinating approach is adopted to coordinate the RISoUAVs navigation to cover all MTs under a good quality of service. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the method. Note to Practitioners-In this paper, we consider a scenario where vehicles need to have high-speed, uninterrupted data links in obstructed, highly dense urban environments. Due to spectrum crunch, the data links are increasingly likely to rely on a high-frequency spectrum, including mmWave with quasi-optic nature, visible light communications, or even laser. However, the obstructed LoS and propagation are critical issues with the 5G and beyond as they rely on the availability of an unobstructed path (e.g., the LoS or a quality reflective path). On the other hand, the RIS performs as a passive reflective element that provides an indirect LoS link, a one-bounce channel, to improve the performance and efficiency of mmWave, and beyond, wireless communication networks. UAVs equipped with RISs are suggested in this paper to be adopted as aerial transponders to reflect signals and facilitate communication in high-density environments. Therefore, the problem of UAV navigation and 3D trajectory planning should be addressed regarding the application, particularly, for providing LoS service for mobile vehicles with arbitrary directions. Autonomous navigation of RISoUAVs for LoS wireless communication is a natural multi-dimensional extension of autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance where regions in which LoS communication is lost are viewed as obstacles to avoid. However, the environment and valid LoS links can change dynamically due to moving vehicles in the obstructed environment. This makes the navigation design an NP-hard problem that is tackled in this paper by developing an effective navigation program.

AB Autonomous vehicle systems rely heavily upon depth estimation, which facilitates the improvement of precision and stability in automated decision-making systems. Noteworthily, the technique of monocular depth estimation is critical for one of these feasible implementations. In the area of segmentation of medical images, UNet is a well-known encoder-decoder structure. Moreover, several studies have proven its further potential for monocular depth estimation. Similarly, based on UNet, we aim to propose a novel model of monocular depth estimation, which is constructed from the benefits of classical UNet and residual learning mechanisms and named URNet. Particularly, we employ the KITTI dataset in conjunction with the Eigen split strategy to determine the efficacy of our model. Compared with other studies, our URNet is significantly better, on the basis of higher the precision and lower error rate. Hence, it can deal properly with the depth estimation issue for autonomous driving systems.

AB The vision problem of drivers during the night is mainly owing to the high-intensity headlight-beam of the oncoming vehicle from the reverse direction. It causes temporary blindness to the driver. To overcome this situation, people generally use color windshield glass, sun visor, and night-vision glass. But, these are not considered as the best solution since it decreases the light intensity of the entire view including the road. Many researchers used various image enhancement techniques to overcome this situation. But, the existing approaches are unable to dim the high-beam headlights of oncoming vehicles without affecting the road view. In this paper, a novel night-vision system is proposed to resolve the problem in real-time for manual-driving vehicles and autonomous vehicles. The proposed method includes region segmentation of frames, local enhancement techniques in different regions followed by adaptive Gaussian filtering. Pixels masking, gamma correction, and low-light pixel enhancement are applied to three distinct regions. Both autonomous vehicles and manual drivers can get a bright and a prominent view of the road with dim headlights of oncoming vehicles in real-time. Numerous heuristic real-time test reveals the performance superiority of the projected system compared to state-of-art methods in quantitative as well as qualitative point of view.

AB A sliding mode heading control system is developed for overactuated, hover-capable autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating over a range of forward speeds. A simplified switching function is introduced, and simulation studies are proposed accordingly. The results with this novel switching function show a significant improvement in the chattering problem when compared to other conventional switching function candidates. Studies on sensitivities to a range of hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties are presented, and the parameters that have major influences on the sliding mode control performance are highlighted. The proposed control system is also proven in the field trials to enhance vehicle response, yielding consistent, and robust performance over the entire range of vehicle's speeds, even when subjected to external disturbance. It also shows superior heading tracking performance when compared to a proportional-derivative (PD) based approach implemented on the same vehicle. However, this improved performance requires intense control actions as a trade-off, causing the AUV to expend more energy than with the P-D approach. Path following trials, where the AUV is demanded to follow a set of GPS coordinates at the water surface, are presented. These demonstrate the applicability of the proposed heading control system in a practical operation. The presented SMC scheme can be applied to any vehicle straightforwardly, but the control allocation part may need to be modified regarding the actuator configuration of that vehicle.

DE autonomous driving; collision prevention; reinforcement learning
AB This paper set out to revise and improve existing autonomous driving models using reinforcement learning, thus proposing a reinforced autonomous driving prediction model. The paper conducted training for a reinforcement learning model using DQN, a reinforcement learning algorithm. The main aim of this paper was to reduce the time spent on training and improve self-driving performance. Rewards for reinforcement learning agents were developed to mimic human driving behavior as much as possible. High rewards were given for greater distance travelled within lanes and higher speed. Negative rewards were given when a vehicle crossed into other lanes or had a collision. Performance evaluation was carried out in urban environments without pedestrians. The performance test results show that the model with the collision prevention model exhibited faster performance improvement within the same time compared to when the model was not applied. However, vulnerabilities to factors such as pedestrians and vehicles approaching from the side were not addressed, and the lack of stability in the definition of compensation functions and limitations with respect to the excessive use of memory were shown.

AB The effort and expense associated with sample and data collections for long oceanographic time series are, in part, driving the development of autonomous platforms, sensors and sample collectors. Here we validate basic oceanographic samples collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle with water sampler (AUV with Gulper) by comparison with samples collected by a standard collection device, the conductivity-temperature-depth rosette with Niskin bottles. After elimination of a toxic material, on-deck and field comparisons show that Gulpers and Niskin bottles collect comparable nitrate, chlorophyll, phytoplankton species and C-14-based primary production (PP) samples and data. Gulper materials and lubricants, Gulper firing, field presence of the possibly toxic submarine, and the pressure and temperature cycling associated with the submarine's depth undulations all appear unimportant. However, 24 h sample hold periods for live samples within the Gulpers, as is necessary during many AUV deployments, appears to depress nitrate, chlorophyll and PP values somewhat (4-16%). While challenges remain, demonstration that the AUV and sampler can collect fundamental oceanographic samples is a critical step toward the broader use of such autonomous platforms.

AB An experimental kite-plane capable of autonomous aerial imaging is introduced as a viable low-cost small-scale civilian UAV imaging platform ideal for field use. The AUTOKITE fulfills a need currently unmet by other fully automated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), resulting from ease of operation, extended flight time, and overall reliability. The AUTOKITE is outfitted with an off-the-shelf autopilot system, and has demonstrated fully autonomous flight in field deployments while collecting high-resolution (similar to 12 cm/pixel) images. The AUTOKITE has been used to map regions historically prone to earthquakes along the Southern San Andreas Fault in California. Comparative image methods enabled by photogrammetric software, like Agisoft's PhotoScan, are then used to discern Structure-from-Motion (SfM) from a multitude of aerial images taken by AUTOKITE (Fonstad, Earth Surf. Process. Landf. 38: 421-430, 2013). Processing SfM data from overlapping images results in the creation of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Orthophotos for geographic areas of interest. In addition to sample data sets illustrating the SfM process, The AUTOKITE is compared with three alternative UAV systems, and payload integration/automation details are discussed.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB The realization of autonomous driving requires maximum safety and reliability of powertrain system and components (e.g., PMSM). While today's vehicles have a fallback level provided by the driver, this is completely or at least temporarily eliminated in autonomous driving systems. It is thus of high importance that the safety-critical faults of the powertrain is detected early, safely and reliably. An electrical fault in the PMSM in the stator while driving can lead to a failure of the electric vehicle. This can create a hazard for passengers and other road users. Therefore, highly reliable, safe and early detection of the PMSM faults is an important requirement to meet these safety requirements. In the literature, PMSM faults have been considered only for steady-state operating points and not for dynamic operating points. In this study, a new early diagnosis method is developed using artificial neural networks. This method is applied to three PMSM faults at both fixed and dynamic operating points (speed and torque). The fault diagnosis is successfully achieved (accuracy of about 99.7%) at both fixed operating points and dynamic operating points of an electric vehicle. In this way, the automated driving vehicle is brought to a safe state without using a redundant powertrain. In this way, weight, installation space and costs of automated driving vehicles are reduced, and safety requirements are met.

In the proposed method, the desired smoothness of trajectories, the changes in steering angle and the lateral acceleration are controlled in a robust way. This paper describes the simulations, and the confirming real-world experiments, conducted using the autonomous shuttle iseAuto. Our results suggest that the sigmoid A-star algorithm leads to a smoother and more reliable motion when compared to other two standard methods. Specifically, the abruptness of necessary steering angle changes is reduced by factor of 4, and approaching the level of an experienced driver-like maneuver.

A new platoon model is established, in which the effect of event-triggered scheme and probabilistic failures are involved. Based on the model, the criteria for the exponential stability and co-designing both the trigger parameters and the output feedback are derived by using the Lyapunov method. The theoretical results show that the proposed controller would be able to safely maintain a smaller inter-vehicle spacing and the platoon would be string stable. The effectiveness and advantage of the presented methodology are demonstrated by numerical simulations.

AB The objective of this study is to find a smooth function joining two points A and B with minimum length constrained to avoid fixed subsets. A penalized nonparametric method of finding the best path is proposed. The method is generalized to the situation where stochastic measurement errors are present. In this case, the proposed estimator is consistent, in the sense that as the number of observations increases the stochastic trajectory converges to the deterministic one. Two applications are immediate, searching the optimal path for an autonomous vehicle while avoiding all fixed obstacles between two points and flight planning to avoid threat or turbulence zones.

AB Cooperative perception, as a critical technology of intelligent connected vehicles, aims to use wireless communication technology to interact and fuse environmental information obtained by edge nodes with local perception information, which can improve vehicle perception accuracy, reduce latency, and eliminate perception blind spots. It has become a current research hotspot. Based on the analysis of the related literature on the Internet of vehicles (IoV), this paper summarizes the multi-sensor information fusion method, information sharing strategy, and communication technology of autonomous driving cooperative perception technology in the IoV environment. Firstly, cooperative perception information fusion methods, such as image fusion, point cloud fusion, and image-point cloud fusion, are summarized and compared according to the approaches of sensor information fusion. Secondly, recent research on communication technology and the sharing strategies of cooperative perception technology is summarized and analyzed in detail. Simultaneously, combined with the practical application of V2X, the influence of network communication performance on cooperative perception is analyzed, considering factors such as latency, packet loss rate, and channel congestion, and the existing research methods are discussed. Finally, based on the summary and analysis of the above studies, future research issues on cooperative perception are proposed, and the development trend of cooperative perception technology is forecast to help researchers in this field quickly understand the research status, hotspots, and prospects of cooperative perception technology.

AB This article proposes a computationally efficient path-following control strategy of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) with yaw motion stabilization. First, the nonlinear control-oriented model, including path-following model, single-track vehicle model, and magic formula tire model, is constructed. To handle the stability constraints with ease, the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) technique is applied for path-following issue. Here, NMPC control problem is reasonably established with the constraints of vehicle sideslip angle, yaw rate, steering angle, lateral position error, and Lyapunov stability. To mitigate the online calculation burden, the continuation/generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is adopted. The dead-zone penalty functions are employed for handling the inequality constraints and holding the smoothness of solution. Moreover, the varying predictive duration is utilized in this article to gain the good initial solution fast by numerical algorithm. Finally, the simulation validations are carried out, which yields that the proposed strategy can achieve desirable path following and vehicle stability efficacy, while greatly reducing the computational burden compared with the NMPC controllers by active set algorithm or interior point algorithm.

AB An effective homing guidance system with precise vehicle dynamic attitude control capability is essential for reliable docking of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). The paper describes the bio-inspired concept and electromagnetic finite element analysis-aided design and testing of an electromagnetic homing guidance system (EMHGS) comprising of an underwater dock with 400AT of electromagnetic dipole coil excited with the 20 Hz power supply; a twin-thruster AUV equipped with a differential magnetometer system, and operable in two degrees of freedom (DOF). The vehicle hydrodynamic behavior is characterized in 2 DOFs based on the thruster action and vehicle response method, and used for the control and homing guidance of the AUV. By sensing a magnetic field strength of 190nT, the EMHGS is found to have an effective range of 7 m, and capable of effecting AUV orientation correction by measuring the bearing angle. The FEA is found to comply with the experimental observations with an accuracy of 96% is extended for higher dock magnetic field strengths, and found that an EMHGS utilizing 6000AT dock coil and magnetic field sensors of same sensitivity could have a homing guidance range of 72 m. Based on a priori magnetic map, the system is capable of computing the vehicle range and velocity, serving critical inputs for realizing effective AUV short range homing and docking.

DE Acoustic long baseline (LBL) aiding; Doppler aiding; inertial
   navigation; Kalman filter; underwater vehicles
AB This paper considers the vehicle navigation problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with six degrees of freedom. We approach this problem using an error state formulation of the Kalman filter. Integration of the vehicle's high-rate inertial measurement unit's (IMU's) accelerometers and gyros allow time propagation while other sensors provide measurement corrections. The low-rate aiding sensors include a Doppler velocity log (DVL), an acoustic long baseline (LBL) system that provides round-trip travel times from known locations, a pressure sensor for aiding depth, and an attitude sensor. Measurements correct the filter independently as they arrive, and as such, the filter is not dependent on the arrival of any particular measurement. We propose novel tightly coupled techniques for the incorporation of the LBL and DVL measurements. In particular, the LBL correction properly accounts for the error state throughout the measurement cycle via the state transition matrix. Alternate tightly coupled approaches ignore the error state, utilizing only the navigation state to account for the physical latencies in the measurement cycle. These approaches account for neither the uncertainty of vehicle trajectory between interrogation and reply, nor the error state at interrogation. The navigation system also estimates critical sensor calibration parameters to improve performance. The result is a robust navigation system. Simulation and experimental results are provided.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB These days, autonomous vehicles (AVs) technology has been improved dramatically. However, even though the AVs require no human intervention in most situations, AVs may fail in certain situations. In such cases, it is desirable that humans can operate the vehicle manually to recover from a failure situation through remote driving. Furthermore, we believe that remote driving can enhance the current transportation system in various ways. In this paper, we consider a revolutionary transportation platform, where all the vehicles in an area are controlled by some remote controllers or drivers so that transportation can be performed in a more efficient way. For example, road capacity can be effectively utilized and fuel efficiency can be increased by centralized remote control. However, one of the biggest challenges in such remote driving is the communication latency between the remote driver and the vehicle. Thus, selecting appropriate locations of the remote drivers is very important to avoid any type of safety problem that might happen due to large communication latency. Furthermore, the selection should reflect the traffic situation created by multiple vehicles in an area. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose several algorithms that select remote drivers' locations for a given transportation schedules of multiple vehicles. We consider two objectives in this system and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through simulations. The results show that the proposed algorithms perform better than some baseline algorithms.

AB The advent of the digital innovation era is changing service, use, and resources management paradigms, offering a wide range of new and essential opportunities. In particular, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), i.e., the ability to connect individual objects to the Internet, also capable of communicating autonomously, has its particular declination on the connected vehicle. It is combined with the potential of advanced sensors placed pervasively on vehicles, which offer multifunctional monitoring capabilities of the entire system: from individual components up to the whole vehicle, including driver behavior and conditions and many exogenous parameters to the vehicle (road and weather conditions, congestion, risk situations, changes to mobility plans, etc.). In this perspective, machine learning (ML) models can transform raw data into new knowledge; they can contribute in an innovative way to define and suggest decisions, strategies, and criteria for resource use. Nowadays, most intelligent mobility projects also integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and ML solutions. In this article, we present and discuss the application of unsupervised learning techniques on a vehicular IoT data set. The main goal is to generate new knowledge about a geographical zone by analyzing historical drivers behavioral data. The autonomous vehicle's framework can exploit the generated valuable insights to optimize the routes and prevent critical issues.

AB The complex slip characteristics between the tracks and the terrain make it difficult to build an accurate model for intelligent tracked vehicles. Both the path planning and lateral control, however, are highly dependent on the accurate tracked vehicle model. To overcome the issue, a slip model based on the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of tracks and a dual-layer adaptive unscented Kalman filter (DAUKF) are used to estimate the ICR locations in real-time without requiring prior knowledge of terrain parameters. First, the historical trajectory information is used to estimate ICR locations by the upper-layer AUKF estimator preliminarily. The ICR locations estimated in the upper-layer and the current vehicle state are then imported into the model to predict the future trajectory which can be used to estimate the offset as compensation of preliminarily estimated ICR locations by the lower-layer AUKF estimator. The proposed DAUKF is verified by simulations on MATLAB/Simulink. In order to further verify the effectiveness and practicability of the algorithm, a large number of experiments under different terrains and road conditions are implemented on the electric-drive tracked vehicle. The simulation and experimental results illustrate that the proposed DAUKF can estimate the ICR locations efficiently and accurately, which can improve the accuracy of the tracked vehicle model compared with thaw of extended Kalman filter (EKF), UKF, and AUKF.

ID PARKING SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT
AB Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) is a technology that enables vehicles to park themselves without human intervention. It uses advanced sensing and communication systems to find a suitable parking space and to park the vehicle safely and efficiently. While various artificial intelligence (AI) based methods have demonstrated the benefits of AVP, including reducing traffic congestion, improving safety, and enhancing convenience and comfort for drivers, the issue of developing and evaluating AVP systems that can effectively handle multi-zone parking areas in real-world settings is yet to be solved. This paper presents an AVP system for three parking zones situated within a 1 km radius and utilizes a combination of existing tools and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to address the issue. DDPG algorithm controls the AVP system to allocate parking spaces efficiently in order to navigate and park vehicles autonomously. This work assumes the utilization of 5G-NR Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications for information exchange between vehicles and the system. It also studies the effect of communication latency on the system performance. Results of simulations show that the proposed system efficiently and safely parks vehicles in the three parking zones, achieving a reduction of 7% in waiting time compared to existing deep reinforcement learning methods. This work represents a notable advancement over current solutions and helps to advance the vision of smart cities for the future.

ID CHALLENGE
AB This letter proposes a robust vehicle localization method based on a prior point cloud in urban area. The high resolution point cloud collected six months ago is provided from Singapore Land Authority around One-north area in Singapore, because the data are outdated there are many changed aspects of the environment such as redrawn road markings, construction areas, and changing tree shapes. In response, this paper proposes a novel fusion algorithm based on a particle filter using vertical and road intensity information for robust localization. Whereas the state-of-the-art fusion algorithm focus on optimization of the vehicle pose based on multiple measurements, the proposed method estimates a robust vehicle pose by considering the reliability of each feature from the prior map. We also propose an efficient management strategy of a grid map that includes multilayer vertical and road intensity information for real-time operation. A sensor system equipped on a vehicle consists of 32 channels of 3D Light Detection And Ranging, IMU, wheel odometry, which are used for the proposed algorithm. RTK-GPS, wheel odometry, and iterative closest point algorithm are utilized by using a graph-structure optimization method in off-line for estimating ground truth. The total data set for the demonstration is collected in a 19.9 km way in an urban area. The proposed approach has successfully performed an autonomous vehicle driving in an urban area.

TI A Genetic Algorithm Approach for Expedited Crossing of Emergency
   Vehicles in Connected and Autonomous Intersection Traffic
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper proposes an intersection control algorithm which aims to determine an efficient vehicle-passing sequence that allows the emergency vehicle to cross an intersection as soon as possible while the travel times of other vehicles are minimally affected. When there are no emergency vehicles within the intersection area, the vehicles are controlled by the DICA that we proposed in our earlier work. When there are emergency vehicles entering the communication range, we prioritize emergency vehicles through optimal ordering of vehicles. Since the number of possible vehicle-passing sequences increases rapidly with the number of vehicles, finding an efficient sequence of vehicles in a short time is the main challenge of the study. A genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem which finds the optimal vehicle sequence that gives the emergency vehicles the highest priority. The efficiency of the proposed approach for expedited crossing of emergency vehicles is validated through comparisons with DICA and a reactive traffic light algorithm through extensive simulations. The results show that the proposed genetic algorithm is able to decrease the travel times of emergency vehicles significantly in light and medium traffic volumes without causing any noticeable performance degradation of normal vehicles.

AB Public acceptability, and ultimately acceptance, of automated vehicles (AVs) is critical in order to ensure that drivers utilise them and thus realise their predicted safety and other benefits. The aim of this study was to gauge public acceptability and opinions of AVs within an Australian context, for which there is currently a scarcity of empirical research. The study employed a national sample of 5089 respondents who responded to a large online survey (including 45 items specifically targeting aspects of AV acceptability). Survey items gauged demographic and other sample characteristics, and probed responses to questions on key issues including (a) the perceived benefits of AVs, (b) sources, and degree, of concerns regarding AV-related issues, and (c) willingness to pay for AV technology. Overall, it was found that, even though Australian respondents tended to agree with many of the potential benefits of AVs probed in the survey, they have considerable concerns regarding many AV-related issues. Furthermore, a majority of Australians are currently not willing to pay any more for a fully autonomous vehicle than for a manually operated vehicle. Results also showed that a number of sample demographic and characteristic variables (e.g., gender, self-classification as an early vs. late adopter of technology) have unique associations with aspects of AV acceptability. Important theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB As a legacy from conventional wireless services, illegal eavesdropping is regarded as one of the critical security challenges in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) network. Our work considers the use of Distributed Kalman Filtering (DKF) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to improve anti-eavesdropping communication capacity and mitigate jamming interference. Aiming to improve the security performance against smart eavesdropper and jammer, we first develop a DKF algorithm that is capable of tracking the attacker more accurately by sharing state estimates among adjacent nodes. Then, a design problem for controlling transmission power and selecting communication channel is established while ensuring communication quality requirements of the authorized vehicular user. Since the eavesdropping and jamming model is uncertain and dynamic, a hierarchical Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based architecture is developed to design the anti-eavesdropping power control and possibly channel selection policy. Specifically, the optimal power control scheme without prior information of the eavesdropping behavior can be quickly achieved first. Based on the system secrecy rate assessment, the channel selection process is then performed when necessary. Simulation results confirm that our jamming and eavesdropping defense technique enhances the secrecy rate as well as achievable communication rate compared with currently available techniques.

AB A robust self-organising fuzzy sliding mode control law steers autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to track a predefined planar path at a constant speed without temporal specifications. An intelligent methodology has been adopted for path-following control to handle varying parametric uncertainties in vehicle dynamics and also conquers stringent preliminary condition constraints in several path-following control strategies illustrated in the literature. Robust controller design builds on a fusion of sliding mode control theory and fuzzy logic technique with an adaptation mechanism to tune boundary layer width and hitting gain. This novel strategy proposes two distinct tuning procedures: the first method commonly uses absolute error and their derivative as fuzzy input variables in a two-dimensional fuzzy logic rule structure. Herein, skew symmetry property is utilised in rule base structure to derive a single input fuzzy variable based on the signed distance technique, drastically reducing two-dimensional fuzzy logic rules. Since the second method provides substantial reductions in rule inferences through the use of the fuzzy rule's mirror image and the Lyapunov approach for tuning purposes, the resulting guidance control law yields fast convergence of the path-following error trajectory towards zero along with the elimination of chattering problem. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control law to achieve favourable tracking performance with a high accuracy.

DE Artificial neural networks; collision avoidance; Path planning
AB A key component in autonomous driving is the ability of the self-driving car to understand, track and predict the dynamics of the surrounding environment. Although there is significant work in the area of object detection, tracking and observations prediction, there is no prior work demonstrating that raw observations prediction can be used for motion planning and control. In this paper, we propose ObserveNet Control, which is a vision-dynamics approach to the predictive control problem of autonomous vehicles. Our method is composed of a i) deep neural network able to confidently predict future sensory data on a time horizon of up to 10s and ii) a temporal planner designed to compute a safe vehicle state trajectory based on the predicted sensory data. Given the vehicle's historical state and sensing data in the form of Lidar point clouds, the method aims to learn the dynamics of the observed driving environment in a self-supervised manner, without the need to manually specify training labels. The experiments are performed both in simulation and real-life, using CARLA and RovisLab's AMTU mobile platform as a 1:4 scaled model of a car. We evaluate the capabilities of ObserveNet Control in aggressive driving contexts, such as overtaking maneuvers or side cut-off situations, while comparing the results with a baseline Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) and two state-of-the-art imitation learning systems, that is, Learning by Cheating (LBC) and World on Rails (WOR).

There are multiple travel model components from demand generation to network assignments that need to be modified, updated, or added to fully capture the potential impacts of AVs on regional travel patterns. This paper describes how the features of AVs were incorporated in the regional Activity-Based travel demand Model developed for Columbus, OH, metropolitan region. The model modifications included multiple adjustments to the travel demand sub-models, network assignments, as well as an addition of a new sub-model for vehicle routing and parking that addresses such new phenomenon as empty AV relocation trips. Due to many factors of uncertainty associated with AVs, a scenario-based approach was adopted for evaluation of the potential impacts of AVs on the travel patterns. The emphasis of the scenario analysis was on multiple dimensions of travel behavior in addition to such aggregate regional measures as VMT, etc. The paper presents an analysis of potential impacts of AVs on accessibility measures, activity participation, tour formation, and mode choice. The scenario analysis applied to the Columbus region showed overall logical potential impacts of AVs with many insights useful for transportation planning.

AB The design of complex systems involves a number of choices, the implications of which are interrelated. If these choices are made sequentially, each choice may limit the options available in subsequent choices. Early choices may unknowingly limit the effectiveness of a final design in this way. Only a formal process that considers all possible choices (and combinations of choices) can insure that the best option has been selected. Complex design problems may easily present a number of choices to evaluate that is prohibitive. Modern optimization algorithms attempt to navigate a multidimensional design space in search of an optimal combination of design variables. A design optimization process for an autonomous underwater vehicle is developed using a multiple objective genetic optimization algorithm that searches the design space, evaluating designs based on three measures of performance: cost, effectiveness, and risk. A synthesis model evaluates the characteristics of a design having any chosen combination of design variable values. The effectiveness determined by the synthesis model is based on nine attributes identified in the U.S. Navy's Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Master Plan and four performance-based attributes calculated by the synthesis model. The analytical hierarchy process is used to synthesize these attributes into a single measure of effectiveness. The genetic algorithm generates a set of Pareto optimal, feasible designs from which a decision maker(s) can choose designs for further analysis.

ID DEMAND
AB The explosion of low-cost, on-demand taxi services and the anticipation of an autonomous vehicle future has made transportation the center of debate and discussion for the first time since the massive expansion of the US highway system in the 1950s. Yet the realm of parking boasts innovations and developments far beyond the high-profile issues of TNCs and AVs. Rather, innovation in parking is happening in many cases quietly on a wide variety of fronts, including technology, public policy, and design. This paper serves an overview of emerging trends in parking, primarily within the US context. We identify and outline five developments and the pertinent technologies helping to catalyze change: unbundling parking costs, reducing parking minimums, pricing and allocating curb space dynamically, designing hybrid parking structures, and preparing for the autonomous era and "mobility as a service." This paper presents these trends with illustrative examples highlighting current practices, governance challenges, and possible future scenarios.

AB This paper presents the design and control of VertiKUL, a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) transitioning tailsitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), capable of hover flight and forward flight for the application of parcel delivery. In contrast to existing transitioning UAVs, VertiKUL is not controlled by control surfaces, but exclusively by four propellers using differential thrust during hover flight, transition and forward flight. A numerical design method optimising range and payload is developed for initial sizing. A simulation model is implemented in Simulink to evaluate different control strategies before conducting test flights. A unique mid-level control strategy enabling intuitive control of VertiKUL which requires no pilot skills is developed. Fluent transition from hover to forward flight is achieved through an autonomous control strategy. Attitude control based on quaternions instead of Euler-angles is implemented to avoid singularities. The resulting design, VertiKUL, is built and test flown.

AB This paper addresses the design of mobile sensor networks for optimal data collection. The development is strongly motivated by the application to adaptive ocean sampling for an autonomous ocean observing and prediction system. A performance metric, used to derive optimal paths for the network of mobile sensors, defines the optimal data set as one which minimizes error in a model estimate of the sampled field. Feedback control laws are presented that stably coordinate sensors on structured tracks that have been optimized over a minimal set of parameters. Optimal, closed-loop solutions are computed in a number of low-dimensional cases to illustrate the methodology. Robustness of the performance to the influence of a steady flow field on relatively slow-moving mobile sensors is also explored.

AB Integrated communications and sensing (ICS) has recently emerged as an enabling technology for ubiquitous sensing and IoT applications. For ICS application to autonomous vehicles (AVs), optimizing the waveform structure is one of the most challenging tasks due to strong influences between sensing and data communication functions. Specifically, the preamble of a data communication frame is typically leveraged for the sensing function. As such, the higher number of preambles in a coherent processing interval (CPI) is, the greater sensing task's performance is. In contrast, communication efficiency is inversely proportional to the number of preambles. Moreover, surrounding radio environments are usually dynamic with high uncertainties due to their high mobility, making the ICS's waveform optimization problem even more challenging. To that end, this article develops a novel ICS framework established on the Markov decision process and recent advanced techniques in deep reinforcement learning. By doing so, without requiring complete knowledge of the surrounding environment in advance, the ICS-AV can adaptively optimize its waveform structure (i.e., number of frames in the CPI) to maximize sensing and data communication performance under the surrounding environment's dynamic and uncertainty. Extensive simulations show that our proposed approach can improve the joint communication and sensing performance up to 46.26% compared with other baseline methods.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) have seen a rapid development over the past decade. However, wide diffusion of high level CAVs is still decades to come, and will depend on many technological, policy and public acceptance factors. Merging a traditional Bass Diffusion Model with a discrete choice model in a system dynamics approach, this study modelled CAV diffusion from 2020 to 2070 in the UK, considering mode choices of CAV private car, CAV car/ride sharing and CAV bus, their possible impacts on road network performance and sus-tainability, and the feedback of these impacts to CAV diffusion. Results of this study suggest that without in-terventions CAV diffusion will start to increase rapidly from 2035, and reach market saturation of 98% in around 2057. CAV diffusion will lead to reductions in average travel time, average travel cost, carbon emission and traffic accident. Training campaign, which prepares the general public to be ready for CAVs, is more effective in accelerating CAV diffusion than marketing campaign, which mainly targets the innovators and early adopters. Promoting shared CAVs and CAV public transport can contribute to more sustainable and more affordable mobility with CAVs, although this may lead to smaller CAV market size in terms of CAV sale, and the market size may reduce at a higher rate than sustainability enhancement.

AB Conditional autonomous vehicles have attracted significant attention, and their wide-spread use is expected to further increase in the near future. However, such vehicles can send take-over requests (TORs) to a driver who may struggle to accommodate the request while immersed in non-driving-related tasks. Previous studies have focused on TOR times and cues; however, the effects of environmental conditions have not been examined rigorously. This study, with the aim of addressing the aforementioned issue, is divided into two parts: in Study 1, we examine driver responses to TORs under different environmental conditions (i.e., sunny, rainy, snowy, foggy, and night-time), and in Study 2, we examine the effects of the proposed TOR cues (augmented reality + smartphone alert) under different environmental conditions. For this investigation, a driving simulator was used for the participants' safety. Each study involves 33 participants. The results of Study 1 indicate significant differences in the take-over time, lane-change time, time-to-collision, maximum acceleration, and subjective mental workload corresponding to different environmental conditions. Furthermore, the results of Study 2 suggest that the proposed TOR cues significantly reduce the effects of environmental conditions on various take-over performances. We discuss the implication of these results in terms of the improvements in responses to TORs and investigation of the effects of environmental conditions on the responses to TORs.

AB Purpose - The goal of this research has been to design and field test a multi-use planetary rover vehicle. SCOUT has been developed to test advanced rover hardware and software technologies and to enable the development and demonstration of mission operations concepts applicable to future planetary rover vehicle development activities.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents a description of the SCOUT vehicle capabilities and the results of the remote field testing conducted recently in Meteor Crater, AZ. These tests included (among others) onboard driving by suited crewmembers, remote teleoperation, autonomous point-to-point navigation, obstacle avoidance, human tracking and following, gesture recognition and onboard suit-recharge.
   Findings - SCOUT was successfully tested in all three driving modes (onboard by two suited crewmembers, teleoperation and autonomous) and additional capabilities verified over the course of the testing period.
   Research limitations/impilications - Various tests experienced periodic telemetry drop-outs to the vehicle. Future research should improve upon the communications architecture to minimize the loading on system bandwidth.
   Practical implications - A multi-use planetary rover will prove very useful on future Lunar and Martian exploration missions on an assortment of activities. In addition to equipment transport, riding on the rover will allow crewmembers to cover more surface area while conserving important extravehicular activity suit consumables.
   Originality/value - Several new concepts for rover technologies are presented here including on-board suit recharge, stereo-vision human tracking and following, gesture recognition and autonomous driving and navigation.

ID VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM
AB High-capacity Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are expected to be extensively utilized by on-demand services. This paper aims to assess the impacts of large-scale autonomous on-demand mobility services on traffic, environment, and road safety, under various service specifications using microsimulation. To that end, an urban on-demand shuttle service was designed, optimized, based on a variation of the Dial-a-Ride optimization problem (DARP), and implemented in the road network of the city of Athens to serve different portions of demand with various capacity specifications. It was then investigated through forty mobility scenarios, with differences in policy implementation and market penetration rate of CAVs. Findings show that it led to improved network level traffic conditions, as delays decreased, and that traffic impacts evolve with fleet capacity and served demand. Furthermore, the number of conflicts decreased and the environmental conditions significantly improved, with CAVs in the network, while the traveled distance increased.

AB In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a computationally efficient system for detecting moving objects on a moving platform which can be deployed on small, lightweight, low-cost and power-efficient hardware. The primary application of the payload system is that of performing real-time on-board autonomous object detection of moving objects from videos stream taken from a camera mounted to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The implemented object detection algorithms utilise recursive density estimation and evolving local means clustering to perform change and object detection of moving objects without prior knowledge. Furthermore, experiments are presented which demonstrate that the introduced system is able to detect, by on-board processing, any moving objects from a UAV in real time while at the same time sending only important data to a control station located on the ground with minimal time to set up and become operational.

ID FILTER
AB This paper presents the design, analysis, and performance evaluation of an attitude filter for an Intervention-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV) working in tandem with an Autonomous Sum face Craft (ASC). In the proposed framework, an ASC aids an I-AUV to determine its attitude by providing an inertial reference direction vector through acoustic modem communications, which is measured in body-fixed coordinates by an Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) device. The specificity of the intervention mission to be carried out, near structures that distort the Earth magnetic field, renders on-board magnetometers unusable for attitude determination. The solution presented herein includes the estimation of rate gyros biases, yielding globally asymptotically stable error dynamics under some mild restrictions on the vehicle team configurations. The feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture is assessed resorting to numerical Monte-Carlo simulations with realistic sensor noise, and transmission delays and limited bandwidth of the acoustic modems.

AB This paper describes a combined helm-sails controller for a sailboat based on fuzzy logic. Autonomous navigation of sailboats is a very nonlinear and time-variant problem, and modeling ship dynamics considering all real phenomena is a very complex task. Besides, it has to compensate for stochastic disturbances acting upon it, such as wind, waves, and currents. Heuristics in sailing plays an important role: sailing rules obtained from skippers can be included in a knowledge base to govern the boat correctly in different conditions. The controller measures variables such as heading and wind angle. If processes the data through a fuzzy inference system according to a sailing knowledge base and actuates the helm and the sails. Experiments with a scale prototype show the ability of a fuzzy controller to govern the helm and trim the sails on a sailboat Sea navigation aid systems and autonomous ocean sampling vehicles could be some areas of application of such a fuzzy system.

AB We describe a simulation environment that enables the design and testing of control policies for off-road mobility of autonomous agents. The environment is demonstrated in conjunction with the training and assessment of a reinforcement learning policy that uses sensor fusion and interagent communication to enable the movement of mixed convoys of human-driven and autonomous vehicles. Policies learned on rigid terrain are shown to transfer to hard (silt-like) and soft (snow-like) deformable terrains. The environment described performs the following: multivehicle multibody dynamics cosimulation in a time/space-coherent infrastructure that relies on the Message Passing Interface standard for low-latency parallel computing; sensor simulation (e.g., camera, GPU, IMU); simulation of a virtual world that can be altered by the agents present in the simulation; training that uses reinforcement learning to "teach" the autonomous vehicles to drive in an obstacle-riddled course. The software stack described is open source. Relevant movies: Project Chrono. Off-road AV simulations, 2020(2).

AB Localization safety, or integrity risk, is the probability of undetected localization failures and a common aviation performance metric used to verify a minimum accuracy requirement. As autonomous robots become more common, applying integrity risk metrics will be necessary to verify localization performance. This letter introduces a new method, solution separation, to quantify landmark-based mobile robot localization safety for fixed-lag smoothing estimators and compares it's computation time and fault detection capabilities to a chi-squared integrity monitoring method. Results show that solution separation is more computationally efficient and results in a tighter upper-bound on integrity risk when few measurements are included, which makes it the method of choice for lightweight, safety-critical applications such as UAVs. Conversely, chi-squared requires more computing resources but performs better when more measurements are included, making the method more appropriate for high performance computing platforms such as autonomous vehicles.

AB Real-time status monitoring is an important prerequisite for coral reef ecological protection. Existing equipment does not provide an ocean observation platform with adequate mobility and efficiency. This paper describes the design considerations of a proposed autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH) dedicated for ecological observation of coral reefs, including the system architecture, electronic devices, sensors and actuators, and explains the path control algorithm and controller to follow a specific path for ocean exploration. The structure and dynamic model of the AUH are first introduced, and then the corresponding simplification is made for motion analysis. Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is carried out to evaluate the dynamic performance of the AUH. Fuzzy-PID control algorithm is utilized to achieve a good antidisturbance effect. In order to validate the performance of the proposed underwater vehicle, a field test was performed, and results confirmed the feasibility of the proposed prototype.

AB Trajectory tracking is a key technology for precisely controlling autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a trajectory-tracking method based on model predictive control. Instead of using the forward Euler integration method, the backward Euler integration method is used to establish the predictive model. To meet the real-time requirement, a constraint is imposed on the control law and the warm-start technique is employed. The MPC-based controller is proved to be stable. The simulation results demonstrate that, at the cost of no or a little increase in computational time, the tracking performance of the controller is much better than that of controllers using the forward Euler method. The maximum lateral errors are reduced by 69.09%, 47.89% and 78.66%. The real-time performance of the MPC controller is good. The calculation time is below 0.0203 s, which is shorter than the control period.

AB The article presents a novel, efficient graph search algorithm for path planning. The algorithm was inspired by the potential field method and therefore it is called the Discrete Artificial Potential Field (DAPF) algorithm. Additional trajectory optimization algorithm is also applied as a path smoothing mechanism. The algorithm is intended for use in Intelligent Transportation Systems of autonomous ships. The algorithm was implemented in the MATLAB programming language and tested by extensive simulation experiments. Results show that the algorithm can generate a collision-free path in an environment with static and dynamic obstacles, achieving near-real run time. The algorithm was also compared with the state-of-the-art graph search algorithm - a wave-front algorithm. Obtained results demonstrate that DAPF achieves better results in terms of both solution quality and run time.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an emerging paradigm that is driven by recent advancements in vehicular communications and networking. Meanwhile, the capability and intelligence of vehicles are being rapidly enhanced, and this will have the potential of supporting a plethora of new exciting applications that will integrate fully autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the environment. These trends will bring about an era of intelligent IoV, which will heavily depend on communications, computing, and data analytics technologies. To store and process the massive amount of data generated by intelligent IoV, onboard processing and cloud computing will not be sufficient due to resource/power constraints and communication overhead/latency, respectively. By deploying storage and computing resources at the wireless network edge, e.g., radio access points, the edge information system (EIS), including edge caching, edge computing, and edge AI, will play a key role in the future intelligent IoV. EIS will provide not only low-latency content delivery and computation services but also localized data acquisition, aggregation, and processing. This article surveys the latest development in EIS for intelligent IoV. Key design issues, methodologies, and hardware platforms are introduced. In particular, typical use cases for intelligent vehicles are illustrated, including edge-assisted perception, mapping, and localization. In addition, various open-research problems are identified.

AB This paper proposes a well-grounded theoretical model to assess the factors influencing the intention to ride in autonomous vehicles (AVs). The model is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which has been decomposed to account for key components of the Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory and extended to include other influential attitudinal components (such as driving-related sensation seeking, safety perceptions, environmental concerns, and affinity to innovativeness). The extent to which these factors are expected to affect the diffusion of AVs uniformly across different urban settings is also examined. Data were collected through stated preference surveys targeting adult residents in three metropolitan statistical areas, Chicago (Illinois), Indianapolis (Indiana), and Phoenix (Arizona). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to test the validity and reliability of the components included in the theoretical model, followed by the estimation of a multi-group structural equation model. The findings of the measurement model show that the survey questions are measured equally across the three areas, and hence, the theoretical model is transferrable. The results of the structural model suggest that the synergistic effects between TPB and DoI can better explain the behavioral intention to ride in AVs. It was also found that the effect of the TBP components is similar across various areas; however, this is not the case for the DoI components. In general, the findings reinforce the need for wider testing of AV technology in urban areas coupled with public education campaigns to harvest public awareness and acceptance.

AB Velocity estimation is central for the reliable navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Doppler velocity logs (DVLs), currently the leading technology for underwater velocity estimation, can be too big, expensive, and energy consuming to be used on low-cost and small AUVs or for long missions. In our previous work, a system based on differential pressure sensors was developed for estimating surge velocity. In this paper, we combine this system with an inertial measurement unit to compensate for orientation errors and create a differential pressure sensor speedometer (DPSS). We propose and demonstrate the DPSS prototype as an important step toward a small, inexpensive, and energy-efficient alternative or complement to a DVL in certain applications. This paper presents the first underwater field tests of a sensor using differential pressure for velocity estimation. Tests were conducted with a SPARUS II AUV (IQUA Robotics, Girona, Spain). To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed solution, we compare the surge velocity estimation of the DPSS and the vehicle's DVL in bottom and water locks. Trials were conducted by varying the trajectory and velocity of the vehicle in three different environments. We show that the DPSS displayed a superior performance with respect to the DVL water lock for velocities above 0.6 m/s. The differences in the velocity estimations of the DVL in bottom lock for high velocities were as small as 0.013 m/s. These results encourage further development of the presented technology.

ID DRIVER STEERING CONTROL; ROBOT; VEHICLES; DESIGN; MODEL
AB Several approaches exist for the lateral control of autonomous vehicles. Among them are the geometric approaches. They are shown to be robust to disturbances and able to manage complex tracks. Their main advantage lies on the fact that they are explainable, in the sense that their behavior can be analyzed to provide guarantees about their limitations. However, they do not give the quality of results that can be obtained using other control principles, mostly because of design issues. This paper aims to tackle these issues by proposing a novel geometric approach based on Frenet Serret formulas to reach the level of quality proposed by the other approaches, while still benefiting from the advantages of geometric approaches. A numerical analysis of the proposed control approach show its advantage: Simulation results and tests on a real autonomous car are provided. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute.

AB This paper presented an energy-efficient adaptive cruise control, called Energy-Efficient Electric Driving Model ((EDM)-D-3), for electric, connected, and autonomous vehicles (e-CAVs) in a mixed traffic stream. (EDM)-D-3 is able to maintain high energy efficiency of regenerative braking by adjusting the spacing between the leading and the following vehicles. Moreover, a power-based energy consumption model is proposed to estimate the on-road energy consumption for battery electric vehicles, considering the impact of ambient temperature on auxiliary load. Using the proposed energy consumption model, the impact of (EDM)-D-3 on vehicle energy consumption is investigated. In particular, single-lane vehicle dynamics in a traffic stream with a mixed of e-CAVs and human-driven vehicles are simulated. The result shows that (EDM)-D-3 outperforms existing adaptive cruise control (i.e. Nissan-ACC) and cooperative adaptive cruise control (i.e. Enhanced-IDM and Van Arem Model) strategies in terms of energy consumption. Moreover, higher market penetration of e-CAVs may not result in better energy efficiency of the entire fleet. The reason is that more e-CAVs in the traffic stream results in faster string stabilization which decreases the regenerative energy. Considering mix traffic streams with battery electric (BEVs) and internal-combustion engine (ICEVs) vehicles, the energy consumption of entire fleet reduces when the market penetration of BEV (contains both e-CAV and human-driven BEV) increases. A higher ratio of e-CAV to human-driven BEV results in higher energy efficiency.

AB Cooperative braking control is a very important operation in vehicle platoon control for developing intelligent transportation systems, which can effectively increase road capacity, decrease safety hazard, and avoid serial rear-end collisions. This paper focuses on cooperative braking control of autonomous vehicles, the objectives of which are to ensure intervehicles keep within the safe spacing range and rapidly, smoothly, and accurately stop at the desired target stopping positions with zero velocity. To achieve these goals, a three-vehicle platoon framework is presented and the corresponding dynamic model is established based on only information about front-end and rear-end sensors of vehicles, so communication is not needed. The explicit solutions on the three-vehicle platoon are derived by rigorous convergent analysis and detailed proof, such that intrinsic characteristic of the interconnected vehicles is revealed. The resulting convergent conditions and convergent rate are obtained under three cases including: 1) considering internal virtual forces; 2) considering external braking forces; and 3) considering both the internal virtual forces and external braking forces simultaneously. Moreover, an example is further provided to verify that the derived convergence conditions are effective and sufficient under the different controller parameter selection. These results can provide a solution for a wide class of interconnected systems and a guide for controller design to select control parameters in real engineering applications. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed control approaches.

AB With an ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in flight, there is a pressing need for scalable and dynamic air traffic management solutions that ensure efficient use of the airspace while maintaining safety and avoiding mid-air collisions. To address this need, a novel framework is developed for computing optimized 4D trajectories for UAVs that ensure dynamic and flexible use of the airspace, while maximizing the available capacity through the minimization of the aggregate traveling times. Specifically, a network manager (NM) is utilized that considers UAV requests (including start/target locations) and addresses inherent mobility uncertainties using a linear-Gaussian system, to compute efficient and safe trajectories. Through the proposed framework, a family of mathematical programming problems is derived to compute control profiles for both distributed and centralized implementations. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework to maximize air traffic throughput under probabilistic collision avoidance guarantees.

AB This article presents an improved guidance law for underactuated marine vessels that compensates cross-track error caused by external disturbances through its sideslip. The proposed guidance law demonstrates improved path-following performance regardless of disturbances, such as waves, winds, and ocean currents. This article also presents an adaptive neural-network (NN) control law for the partially known vessel dynamics with state constraints. For satisfying the state constraints, this control scheme adopts an integral barrier Lyapunov function (iBLF)-based backstepping control technique. It is shown that the closed-loop system remains bounded, and state constraints are always satisfied. Finally, the efficacy of the improved guidance law and iBLF-based adaptive control strategy was verified in simulation and experiments using an autonomous surface vessel.

ID MOBILE PHOTO ENFORCEMENT
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are anticipated to supersede human drivers with an expectation of improved safety and operation. Since current infrastructure is designed based on the constraints caused by human drivers, it must be reassessed for autonomous driving compatibility. Recently, representatives from the infrastructure owners/operators (IOOs), automotive industry, and academia have advocated for new approaches to prepare roadways for the deployment of AVs over the next decade. Following these recommendations, this paper proposes a novel, simulation-based approach for the assessment of highways "readiness" for AVs using 3D point cloud data. The proposed method uses octrees to perform volumetric queries for potential obstructions within an AV sensory field. The proposed approach is compared to a state-of-the-art raycasting approach. Consequently, available sight distances and maximum safe speed limits based on road and AV characteristics are proposed. Finally, a discussion of the potential mitigation measures at the locations with limited sight distances is presented.

AB This paper deals with an innovative autonomous bus navigation and parking system in a bus depot, in order to optimize their movements in a confined area. The kinematic model of the vehicle is defined. Considering its dimensions and weight as well as the centimetric accuracy required, a predictive controller is designed, based on its model linearized around the changing path curvature value, to perform accurate curved paths tracking with a limited tracking error guaranteed by the consideration of a constraint. This controller and additional sliding observers are designed according to the distance traveled, allowing maneuvers to be performed at any forward or backward speed with constant accuracy. In addition, these observers are not affected by path tracking errors. The implementation on an industrial vehicle, operated under realistic conditions, demonstrates the performance and robustness of this navigation system. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present results regarding the experimental validation of connected automated vehicle design. In order for a connected automated vehicle to integrate well with human dominated traffic, we propose a class of connected cruise control algorithms with feedback structure originated from human driving behavior. We test the connected cruise controllers using real vehicles under several driving scenarios while utilizing beyond-line-of-sight motion information obtained from neighboring human-driven vehicles via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. We experimentally show that the design is robust against variations in human behavior as well as changes in the topology of the communication network. We demonstrate that both safety and energy efficiency can be significantly improved for the connected automated vehicle as well as for the neighboring human-driven vehicles and that the connected automated vehicle may bring additional societal benefits by mitigating traffic waves.

AB Understanding the preferences for new and future transportation technologies is important to ensure an efficient and equitable future transportation system. A survey was conducted of Americans' preferences for several such technologies. Americans are concerned about vehicle range and charging station availability for electric vehicles (EVs) and hesitant about autonomous vehicle (AV) safety. Opinions about many transportation technologies, such as vertical takeoff and landing (i.e., air taxis), shared parking, and air-drone delivery are mixed. These less familiar technologies require continued tracking of preferences. A 55% increase is estimated in the probability of an individual choosing a battery electric vehicle (BEV) pickup truck if its fuel economy increases by about 9%. This result supports a market for BEV pickup trucks currently under development by many automakers. The preference for vehicle autonomation appears to depend on the use case. Driving task automation is preferred by residents of low-density, car-dependent areas where long commutes are common. In contrast, automated parking technologies are favored by those living in denser communities. Intermittent bus lanes are favored by those living in high population density areas, but not among those in areas with high shares of zero-vehicle households. These results provide indications of where to direct future research in the field.

AB This work reports the design of a 60-segment photoluminescence quantum dot light emitting device (QD-LED) for automotive lighting systems. The QD-LED device was fabricated using a quantum dot film (QDF), incorporating two kinds of quantum dots (QDs) synthesized to emit at 531 nm (green) and 624 nm (red). When the QDF is excited with blue wavelength at 465 nm, a white color output is obtained. Likewise, by using different color filters, all the automotive lighting functions (interior and exterior) can be achieved. In addition, an electronic control module, based on the state-of-the-art multichannel automotive lighting emitting diode (LED) drivers, was specifically designed to control each segment individually to enable the possibility of external digital communication with the vehicle surroundings. That is key to develop the autonomous vehicle by incorporating what is known as car-to-X communication, used to transmit information to other vehicles and road users through light. Furthermore, this work is remarkable due to the low power consumption of the QD-LED device designed, which implies a high electrical efficiency, something critical for the electrical vehicle development. Besides, figures of merit and performance indicators are measured, offering promising values to use this nanotechnology in the next future of the vehicle transportation lighting systems.

AB The increasing availability and adoption of shared vehicles as an alternative to personally owned cars presents ample opportunities for achieving more efficient transportation in cities. With private cars spending on the average over 95% of the time parked, one of the passible benefits of shared mobility is the reduced need for parking space. While widely discussed, a systematic quantification of these benefits as a function of mobility demand and sharing models is still mostly lacking in the literature. As a first step in this direction, this paper focuses on a type of private mobility which, although specific, is a major contributor to traffic congestion and parking needs, namely, home-work commuting. We develop a data-driven methodology for estimating commuter parking needs in different shared mobility models, including a model where self-driving vehicles are used to partially compensate flow imbalance typical of commuting, and further reduce parking infrastructure at the expense of the increased traveled kilometers. We consider the city of Singapore as a case study and produce very encouraging results showing that the gradual transition to shared mobility models will bring tangible reductions in parking infrastructure. In the future-looking, self-driving vehicle scenario, our analysis suggests that up to 50% reduction in parking needs can be achieved at the expense of the increasing total traveled kilometers of less than 2%.

AB Most localization algorithms use a range sensor or vision in a horizontal view, which usually imparts some disruption from a dynamic or static obstacle. By using landmarks on ceiling which the vehicle position were vertically measured, the disruption from horizontal view was reduced. We propose an indoor localization and navigation system based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and real-time vision system. A single upward facing digital camera was mounted on an autonomous vehicle as a vision sensor to recognize the landmarks. The landmarks consisted of multiple circles that were arranged in a defined pattern. Information on a landmark's direction and its identity as a reference for an autonomous vehicle was produced by the circular arrangements. The pattern of the circles was detected using a robust image processing algorithm. To reduce the noise that came from uneven light, the process of noise reduction was separated into several regions of interest. The accumulative error caused by odometry sensors (i.e., encoders and a gyro) and the vehicle's position were calculated and estimated, respectively, using the EKF algorithm. Both algorithms were tested on a vehicle in a real environment. The image processing method could precisely recognize the landmarks, and the EKF algorithm could accurately estimate the vehicle's position. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed approaches are implementable.

AB Uncontrolled intersections with interaction and uncertainties are challenging for autonomous vehicles (AV) to manage. In this work, we propose a decision-making model specific to intersections with emphasis on three aspects. First, behavior estimation of the social vehicles' (SVs) is essential for risk avoidance. We try to improve prediction accuracy by predicting the intentions and driving styles of SVs in advance and doing adaptive goal sampling. Second, the uncertainty from the prediction results should be considered in the decision-making process. For this, a risk-aware framework is developed, composed of a Subordinate Driver (SD) and a Primary Driver (PD) for decision-making and planning. Particularly, in SD, the prediction-guided strategy tree is built to search for an optimal strategy with observation and action branch trimming, which employs the prediction results for risk assessment. In PD, to mimic the both-way negotiation among vehicles, the level-k game model is deployed to determine the action in the players' best interest and update the estimation of driving styles. Third, the generated maneuver is required to be evaluated in a closed-loop simulation. A 'semi-autonomous' control model is designed, which is a combination of the dataset and the stochastic sampling model. The results of ablation experiments verify the function of each module. The case studies and comparison experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in highly interactive intersections.

AB The transportation sector is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) have the potential to mitigate emissions, but the effect can be highly dependent on the growth and operation of the SAEV fleet as well as its interaction with the evolving power system. In this study, we simulate travel and charging behaviors of SAEVs based on empirical data of ride-hail service operations, and integrate SAEV charging with the Grid Optimized Operation Dispatch (GOOD) model, taking into account the expansion of renewable generation and charger capacity over time. Emissions from SAEVs are compared across different market adoption levels, occupancy rates, and charging strategies. We find that under the Californian power grid, SAEVs are generally more than 5 times less carbon intensive than modern day ICVs on a per mile basis. The extent of aligning charging schedule with renewable generation is an essential determinant of the economic and emission impact from an SAEV fleet. At higher levels of renewable penetration, synergizing SAEV charging with grid operation can be the most impactful means to reduce emissions from an SAEV fleet, gener-ating up to 95% less emissions than other charging strategies. We also examine the introduction of a carbon tax and find that it can further amplify the advantage of smart charging by approximately 1.5 times in the cost-effectiveness of emission mitigation.

AB Vision-based autonomous obstacle avoidance for unmanned air vehicle (UAV) is a vital research field to ensure the safety of UAV flight in the national airspace. In this paper, a proposed detector is introduced to extract the feature (corner) points of static obstacles from the surrounding cluttered environment for small quadrotor UAVs flying at low altitudes. The detected feature points are the bottleneck for most autonomous obstacle avoidance to facilitate tracking and identification of risk processes during UAV's take-off phase. The proposed feature point detector is based on the estimated phase image of the first image derivatives and the homogeneity test examination to give the proposed detector adaptive behavior. The performance of the proposed detector is compared with various feature point detectors in terms of several quantitative assessment indices and environmental conditions. From the experimental results, the proposed detector achieves promising results for significantly extracting the surrounding feature points.

AB The growing trend of people moving around urban areas requires more intelligent transportation-support services in smart cities. In this context, the number of traffic collisions, especially in intersections, has rapidly increased as well as the number of vehicles. The leading cause of this is represented by human errors in recognition and decision making. Thus, the development of secure Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems is an emerging challenge. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent AIM (MA-AIM) system based on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V) communications able to safely manage vehicles crossing through an intersection leveraging both Edge of Things (EoT) and Blockchain facilities. The proposed system includes an Intersection Manager Agent (IMA) that: i) interacts with vehicles through Driver Agents (DAs) installed on them in an EoT environment, and ii) uses Blockchain mechanisms in order to orchestrate the passage of vehicles crossing the intersection safely. In particular, we implemented a proof-of-concept integrating the AIM 4.0 simulator with Hyperledger Fabric (implementing Blockchain capabilities) and with Node-RED (implementing V2I/I2V communications in an EoT environment). Preliminary experiments show the feasibility and potentiality of our solution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ego-vehicle trajectory prediction is important for autonomous vehicles to detect collisions and accordingly avoid accidents. Recent approaches employ prior-known or on-line acquired road topology or geometries as motion constraints for their predictive models. However, the prior-known information (e.g., pre-built maps) might become unreliable due to, for example, temporal changes caused by road constructions. Whereas on-line perception may require high-cost sensors, such as large filed-of-view laser scanners, to get an overview structure of the local environment, making the prediction difficult to afford, especially for driving assistance systems. So in this letter, we provide a solution without using road topology or geometries for ego-vehicle trajectory prediction. We formulate this problem as a two-class semantic segmentation problem and develop a novel sequence-based deep neural network to predict the trajectory. The only sensor we need during runtime is a single front-view monocular camera. The inputs to our network are several consecutive images, and the output is the predicted trajectory mask that can be directly overlaid on the current front-view image. We create our datasets with different prediction horizons from KITTI. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and the superiority over the baselines.

DE Anomaly detection; autonomous vehicles; emerging technology risks;

ID SAFETY; INSURANCE
AB The transition to semiautonomous driving is set to considerably reduce road accident rates as human error is progressively removed from the driving task. Concurrently, autonomous capabilities will transform the transportation risk landscape and significantly disrupt the insurance industry. Semiautonomous vehicle (SAV) risks will begin to alternate between human error and technological susceptibilities. The evolving risk landscape will force a departure from traditional risk assessment approaches that rely on historical data to quantify insurable risks. This article investigates the risk structure of SAVs and employs a telematics-based anomaly detection model to assess split risk profiles. An unsupervised multivariate Gaussian (MVG) based anomaly detection method is used to identify abnormal driving patterns based on accelerometer and GPS sensors of manually driven vehicles. Parameters are inferred for vehicles equipped with semiautonomous capabilities and the resulting split risk profile is determined. The MVG approach allows for the quantification of vehicle risks by the relative frequency and severity of observed anomalies and a location-based risk analysis is performed for a more comprehensive assessment. This approach contributes to the challenge of quantifying SAV risks and the methods employed here can be applied to evolving data sources pertinent to SAVs. Utilizing the vast amounts of sensor-generated data will enable insurers to proactively reassess the collective performances of both the artificial driving agent and human driver.

TI Transportation Planning for Connected Autonomous Vehicles: How It All
   Fits Together
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB As connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology continues to evolve and rapidly develop new capabilities, it is becoming increasingly important for transportation planners to consider the effects that these vehicles will have on the transportation network. It is evident that this trend has already started; over 60% of long-range transportation plans in the largest urban areas now include some discussion of CAVs, up from just 6% in 2015. There are also numerous CAV pilot programs currently underway that entail testing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) interaction in both isolated and real-world environments. In this review of the current assessments for CAV impacts, two primary trends are identified. First, there is a great deal of uncertainty that is not being explicitly considered and properly accounted for in the transportation-network planning process. Second, the predictions that are being made are not considering potential policy or planning actions that could shape or affect the impacts of CAVs. This paper provides a picture of how ongoing CAV research interacts with current transportation planning practices by examining how the methods, the ranges of predictions, and the different sources of uncertainty in each method impact the planning process and potential system outcomes. Finally, it will identify best practices from decision analysis to help plan the best possible future transportation networks.

AB In this paper, a concept design for automated launch and recovery (L&R) of a small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is described and its feasibility is assessed through modeling and simulation. The design is being implemented on a selected catamaran USV for deployment of a REMUS 100 AUV. The concept for launch involves lowering the AUV into the water from the center of the USV while the latter is in motion. Recovery and retrieval involves aligning the two vehicles together through acoustic positioning, lowering of a thin line with an outrigger-type depressor wing from a winch on the USV, latching of the line by the AUV using a custom pincer-type onboard mechanism, and subsequent reeling of the line for vehicle retrieval. The USV being considered can operate effectively in low to moderate sea states. The length of the recovery line can be adjusted to facilitate AUV recovery from deeper locations beneath the USV in higher sea state. The L&R process is modeled in OrcaFlex to assess its feasibility and to conduct a parametric study in support of developing optimal operations of the launch and recovery system (LARS). The resulting system is being implemented on a USV.

AB The Bird-like Flapping-wing Air Vehicle (BFAV) is a robotic innovation that emulates the flight patterns of birds. In comparison to fixed-wing and rotary-wing air vehicles, the BFAV offers superior attributes such as stealth, enhanced maneuverability, strong adaptability, and low noise, which render the BFAV a promising prospect for numerous applications. Consequently, it represents a crucial direction of research in the field of air vehicles for the foreseeable future. However, the flapping-wing vehicle is a nonlinear and unsteady system, posing significant challenges for BFAV to achieve autonomous flying since it is difficult to analyze and characterize using traditional methods and aerodynamics. Hence, flight control as a major key for flapping-wing air vehicles to achieve autonomous flight garners considerable attention from scholars. This paper presents an exposition of the flight principles of BFAV, followed by a comprehensive analysis of various significant factors that impact bird flight. Subsequently, a review of the existing literature on flight control in BFAV is conducted, and the flight control of BFAV is categorized into three distinct components: position control, trajectory tracking control, and formation control. Additionally, the latest advancements in control algorithms for each component are deliberated and analyzed. Ultimately, a projection on forthcoming directions of research is presented.

TI Delving into monocular 3D vehicle tracking: a decoupled framework and a
   dedicated metric
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE 3D tracking; Monocular vision; Autonomous driving
AB Acquiring 3D trajectories of on-road vehicles is an essential visual task for autonomous driving systems. Existing 3D vehicle tracking methods either rely on point cloud data or need to be trained on visual tracking datasets. In comparison, a decoupled monocular 3D vehicle tracking framework is proposed in this paper. Because our framework is the first of its kind, a previous decoupled LiDAR-based method is taken as the baseline by substituting its detector with a monocular one. On this foundation, we further employ global coordinates to cancel out ego motion and introduce the angular rate into the 3D Kalman filter. In order to tackle the problem of long-term association, a trajectory management scheme is proposed with our novel hibernation mechanism. Furthermore, it is pointed out that current monocular 3D tracking methods have not been tailored for the depth estimation uncertainty produced by monocular 3D detectors. In this regard, we propose a depth-aware association strategy which endows remoter vehicles with larger matching regions in the data association stage. As another contribution, we discuss the defects of current metrics for evaluating 3D tracking performance and devise a nonuniform metric which is dedicated to monocular vision. Through extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI tracking benchmark, the superiority of proposed monocular 3D vehicle tracking framework and metric is demonstrated by both quantitative results and qualitative intuition.

AB Tunnel construction is one of the areas of civil engineering where automation systems can increase both safety and productivity. That is why, to promote a continuous improvement and optimization of construction processes, the implementation of intelligent transport systems and, specifically, autonomous vehicles has been proposed as a catalyst for public works construction activity, including tunnels, reducing personnel, and operation costs, as well as improving safety. Under this scope, this paper presents the development of the automation system for a 25-ton hauler truck, focusing on the task of removing debris from public works, including tunnels. This automation system has been designed, developed, and tested under real conditions in the facilities of two companies dedicated to civil engineering works, including vehicle guidance with and without gobal positioning system, obstacle detection, and tele-operation for load/unload tasks. The main novelty of the system is the capacity of easy integration into the production system of the works, with a capacity to switch between manual, tele-operation, or autonomous driving modes, and with specific sensors and control systems for combining indoor and outdoor navigation. The presented work includes the description of the automation of the vehicle, the general architecture, the environment perception, and the tele-operation capacity, including indoor navigation and obstacle detection algorithms. The proposed system has been implemented and tested in real conditions, demonstrating the performance of the system and the benefit of the automation for this application.

AB This article investigates the integrated lane-keeping and roll control for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) considering the transient performance and system disturbances. The robust integral of the sign of error (RISE) control strategy is proposed to achieve the lane-keeping control purpose with rollover prevention, by guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system, attenuating systematic disturbances, and maintaining the controlled states within the prescribed performance boundaries. Three contributions have been made in this article: 1) a new prescribed performance function (PPF) that does not require accurate initial errors is proposed to guarantee the tracking errors restricted within the predefined asymptotic boundaries; 2) a modified neural network (NN) estimator which requires fewer adaptively updated parameters is proposed to approximate the unknown vertical dynamics; and 3) the improved RISE control based on PPF is proposed to achieve the integrated control objective, which analytically guarantees both the controller continuity and closed-loop system asymptotic stability by integrating the signum error function. The overall system stability is proved with the Lyapunov function. The controller effectiveness and robustness are finally verified by comparative simulations using two representative driving maneuvers, based on the high-fidelity CarSim-Simulink simulation.

AB The tremendous applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as inspection in complex environments, search, and rescue missions, have established this area of research. The domain of UAVs autonomous navigation and landing has received considerable amount of interest of robotics researchers in the past decades. Nevertheless, the limited capability of UAVs for autonomous landing severely hampers the use of aerial vehicles specially in GPS-denied areas. Fortunately, with the rapid development of computer vision, vision-based techniques have become an important and cheap tool to be used in UAVs for moving target detection and landing. In this paper, four major vision-based techniques namely PID controller, fuzzy logic, sliding mode control and model predictive control have been investigated and their landing performance is compared to each other. These landing techniques are implemented on a quadcopter for the purpose of ground moving target detection and then landing on it. The Raspberry Pi board with two Pi cameras for 3D scene construction and depth estimation along with ultrasonic sensor have been used in the quadcopter. A wheeled mobile robot with landing platform is taken as the target. The landing performance of different techniques has been observed and compared in terms of landing displacement error, time taken and the distance travelled to finish the operation in an open and obstacle-free environment. The simulation results are further verified by the hardware experiments.

Detected vehicle can provide more information for tracking. A principal component analysis neural network is used to select appearance features online. Then the positive and negative histogram models using selected features are found for the detected vehicle and the surroundings. A likelihood function is defined based on histogram models, and it can be used as a simple classifier. For selected multiple features, the corresponding multiple classifiers are combined with a single layer perceptron. Experimental results indicate the validity and real-time performance.

AB As a product of digital development, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer a unique prospective solution to alleviate the possible performance deterioration of road networks under the mixed environment of humandriven vehicles (HVs) and CAVs. In this paper, we propose a traffic flow adjustment method (TFAM) that treats CAVs as mobile regulators with the purpose to reshape traffic flow distribution on road networks by guiding rather than controlling CAVs. More specifically, we deploy subsidy nodes to briefly outline travel routes and achieve higher acceptability than traditional route-based control schemes. The TFAM is a multi-objective bilevel programming problem where the upper-level problem optimizes the network performance through regulating location and subsidy on the subsidy nodes. The lower-level problem is a dual dynamic traffic assignment (DDTA) model. Apart from the total travel time cost (TTTC), total emission cost (TEC) and network equity (NE) are also introduced as optimization objectives to highlight environmental sustainability and acceptability. To obtain the Pareto solution frontier, a meta-heuristic algorithm with an improved encoding process is proposed. Results of two numerical case studies demonstrate the effects of TFAM on traffic flow distribution and network performance, which yields valuable insights on the optimization of urban traffic systems.

AB In this paper, a performance improvement scheme for an autonomous AC microgrid in the presence of dispatchable and renewable units, and Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicles has been proposed. In a standalone mode of operation, a droop-control strategy is implemented at the primary control level for a communication-free accurate power-sharing among multiple dispatchable generators. For a network that is neither highly reactive nor highly resistive, active and reactive powers are coupled to both voltage magnitudes and phase angles. A mixed-droop feature is incorporated at the primary control level for autonomous power-sharing among the units for such networks. The mixed-droop feature is considered in this paper. Further, stochastic models of load demands, renewable generation, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle charging loads are considered. Objectives are to reduce the cost of operation and minimize the emission of greenhouse gases from generation activities. The bi-objective problem is solved in the fuzzy domain. Performance improvement is achieved in two steps, first, by choosing optimal static droop constants using the particle swarm optimization, and then a further performance improvement is achieved by network reconfiguration. The proposed algorithm is tested on a thirty-three bus autonomous microgrid and gives satisfactory results. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Instrumented ocean moorings are the gold standard for gathering in situ measurements at a fixed location in the ocean. Because they require installation by a ship and must be secured to the seafloor, moorings are expensive, logistically difficult to deploy and maintain, and are constrained to one location once installed. To circumvent these issues, previous studies have attempted to utilize autonomous underwater gliders as platforms for virtual moorings, but these attempts have yielded comparatively large station-keeping errors due to the difficulty of glider control in dynamic ocean currents. We implemented an adaptive planner using a vehicle motion model and a predictive ocean circulation model to improve station-keeping performance by incorporating anticipated currents into glider control. We demonstrate improved station-keeping performance using our planner in both simulation and in-field deployment results, and report smaller average station-keeping error than the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's M1 mooring. Finally, we utilize our simulation framework to conduct a feasibility study on using an array of autonomous gliders as virtual moorings to conduct critical calibration and validation (CalVal) for the upcoming National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission, instead of using permanent moorings. We show that this approach carries several advantages and has potential to meet the SWOT CalVal objectives.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are supposed to identify obstacles automatically and form appropriate emergency strategies constantly to ensure driving safety and improve traffic efficiency. However, not all collisions will be avoidable, and AVs are required to make difficult decisions involving ethical and legal factors under emergency situations. In this paper, the ethical and legal factors are introduced into the driving decision-making (DDM) model under emergency situations evoked by red light-running behaviors. In this specific situation, 16 factors related to vehicle-road-environment are considered as impact indicators of DDM, especially the duration of red light (RL), the type of abnormal target (AT-T), the number of abnormal target (AT-N) and the state of abnormal target (AT-S), which indicate legal and ethical components. Secondly, through principal component analysis, seven indicators are selected as input variables of the model. Furthermore, feasible DDM, including braking + going straight, braking + turning left, braking + turning right, is taken as the output variable of the model. Finally, the model chosen to establish DDM is the T-S fuzzy neural network (TSFNN), which has better performance, compared to back propagation neural network (BPNN) to verify the accuracy of TSFNN.

AB Autonomous formation flight is a key approach for reducing energy cost and managing traffic in future high density airspace. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has allowed low-budget and low-risk validation of autonomous formation flight concepts. This paper discusses the implementation and flight testing of nonlinear dynamic inversion (NLDI) controllers for close formation flight (CFF) using two distinct UAV platforms: a set of fixed wing aircraft named "Phastball" and a set of quadrotors named "NEO." Experimental results show that autonomous CFF with approximately 5-wingspan separation is achievable with a pair of low-cost unmanned Phastball research aircraft. Simulations of the quadrotor flight also validate the design of the NLDI controller for the NEO quadrotors.

AB The future of traffic management will be based on "connected" and "autonomous" vehicles. With connected vehicles it is possible to gather real-time information. The main potential application of this information is in real-time adaptive traffic signal control. Despite the feasibility of using Floating Car Data (FCD), for signal control, there have been practically no real experiments with all "connected" vehicles to regulate traffic signals in real-time. Most of the research in this field has been carried out with simulations. The purpose of this study is to present a dedicated system that was implemented in the first experiment of an FCD-based adaptive traffic signal. For the first time in the history of traffic management, a traffic signal has been regulated in real time with real "connected" vehicles. This paper describes the entire path of software and system development that has allowed us to make the steps from just simulation test to a real on-field implementation. Results of the experiments carried out with the presented system prove the feasibility of FCD adaptive traffic signals with commonly-used technologies and also establishes a test-bed that may help others to develop better regulation algorithms for these kinds of new "connected" intersections.

   traffic assignment; Paradoxes
ID CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; IMPACT
AB Reservation-based intersection control is a revolutionary idea for using connected autonomous vehicle technologies to improve intersection controls. Vehicles individually request permission to follow precise paths through the intersection at specific times from an intersection manager agent. Previous studies have shown that reservations can reduce delays beyond optimized signals in many demand scenarios. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that signals can outperform reservations through theoretical and realistic examples. We present two examples that exploit the reservation protocol to prioritize vehicles on local roads over vehicles on arterials, increasing the total vehicle delay. A third theoretical example demonstrates that reservations can encourage selfish route choice leading to arbitrarily large queues. Next, we present two realistic networks taken from metropolitan planning organization data in which reservations perform worse than signals. We conclude with significantly positive results from comparing reservations and signals on the downtown Austin grid network using dynamic traffic assignment. Overall, these results indicate that network-based analyses are needed to detect adverse route choices before traffic signals can be replaced with reservation controls. In asymmetric intersections (e.g. local road-arterial intersections), reservation controls can cause several potential issues. However, in networks with more symmetric intersections such as a downtown grid, reservations have great potential to improve traffic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Optimization-based trajectory planners for an autonomous vehicle have received increasing attention due to their convenience for handling various complex constraints. However, their formulated trajectory planning optimization problems in unstructured environments are highly non-convex and nonlinear, requiring a proper initial guess to help with convergence. Given the low efficiency of common sampling-and-search-based initialization strategies due to the dimensionality brought by complex vehicle dynamics and the maneuverable space narrowed by cluttered obstacles, the sequential optimization of a series of softened intermediate problems is emerging as a new initialization strategy. Unlike sequential optimization-based strategies, which optimize all decision variables (w.r.t. the positions, velocities, vehicle orientations, steering angles, and so on of all waypoints) for initialization, the proposed strategy only optimizes critical variables, whose values should help satisfy the inequalities strictly with a small equation violation. Thus, the original scheme for initialization is decoupled into two sub-tasks with down-sized variables. One reduces the nonlinear equation violation, and the other ensures strict inequality satisfaction. Experimental results show that the proposed initialization strategy can facilitate the solution of an optimization-based trajectory planner, thereby making the trajectory planner outperform the state-of-the-art competitors in this community.

ID OBJECT DETECTION ALGORITHM
AB Object detection is a critical technology of environmental perception for autonomous driving vehicle. The Convolutional Neural Network has gradually become a powerful tool in the field of vehicle detection because of its powerful ability of feature extraction. In aiming to reach the balance between speed and accuracy of detection in complex traffic scenarios, this paper proposes an improved lightweight and high-performance vehicle-pedestrian detection algorithm based on the YOLOv4. Firstly, the backbone network CSPDarknet53 is replaced by MobileNetv2 to reduce the number of parameters and raise the capability of feature extraction. Secondly, the method of multi-scale feature fusion is used to realize the information interaction among different feature layers. Finally, a coordinate attention mechanism is added to focus on the region of interest in the image by way of weight adjustment. The experimental results show that this improved model has a great performance in vehicle-pedestrian detection in traffic scenarios. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC datasets show that the improved model's mAP is 85.79% and speed is 35FPS, which has an increase of 4.31% and 16.7% compared to YOLOv4. Furthermore, the improved YOLOv4 model maintains a great balance between detection accuracy and speed on different datasets, indicating that it can be applied to vehicle-pedestrian detection in traffic scenarios.

AB The rapid evolution of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has exposed the need for fast-paced development and testing processes of a variety of perception, planning, and control algorithms. To expedite development, the AV industry and researchers leverage virtual vehicle environments to simulate a range of test scenarios that may otherwise be costly or difficult to conduct on a real test track. However, the various virtual environments may have different results depending on the fidelity of various simulation features, such as vehicle dynamics, sensor simulation, and environment recreation. This tutorial article examines a proposed framework for constructing, parameterizing, and validating a virtual vehicle environment using an existing AV data set. First, an overview of several open source and commercially available simulation tools, including their associated workflows, for scene and scenario creation is presented. Next, various open AV data sets are examined to inform the data set selection for the validation framework. Then, an example workflow of recreating a real-world scene from the selected data set in a simulation tool with various emulated sensors parameterized to match the data set is demonstrated. Finally, an example AV-perception algorithm is subjected to data streams from virtual and real-world environments and suggested metrics for analyzing the results are discussed.

AB Vehicle automation and its adoption by the vehicle purchasers is an active area of research among transportation academics. So far, most of the interest in the adoption of fully automated, driverless vehicles has focussed on private vehicles alone, yet full automation could be beneficial for commercial vehicles too. This paper identifies the vehicle sectors that will likely be the earliest adopters of full automation. Total cost of ownership analysis is used to compare the costs (and benefits) of vehicle automation for private vehicles among different income groups and commercial vehicles in the taxi and freight sectors in the UK. Commercial operations clearly benefit more from automation because the driver costs can be reduced substantially through automation. Among private users, households with the highest income will benefit more from automation because of their higher driving distances and higher perceived value of time, which can be used more productively through full automation.

AB This paper focused on improving a model predictive control (MPC) using Laguerre functions. This study was conducted to achieve high performance while reducing the computational complexity of MPC for autonomous vehicle tracking control. Previous studies have used a conventional linear time-varying MPC (LTV-CMPC) for the linear time-varying (LTV) vehicle model. For LTV-CMPC, the computational complexity increases exponentially as a predictive horizon and control horizon increase. Real-time implementation of LTV-CMPC with long horizons was difficult due to limited computational resources. For reducing computational complexity, we proposed LTV-MPC using Laguerre functions (LTV-LMPC). Considering the vehicle system, LTV-LMPC used a non-augmented model and described the input rate as Laguerre functions. The proposed LTV-LMPC significantly reduced the number of optimization variables. The number of Laguerre functions and the Laguerre pole determined the performance of the LTV-LMPC. In this study, we derived and proved propositions for analyzing the performance change of LTV-LMPC according to the Laguerre pole. LTV-LMPC with pole optimization (LTV-OLMPC) was proposed based on these propositions. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified by simulation. The LTV-OLMPC guarantees low computational complexity and high performance.

ID VEHICLE NAVIGATION
AB Imitation learning for the end-to-end autonomous driving has drawn renewed attention from academic communities. Current methods either only use images as the input, which will yield ambiguities when a vehicle approaches an intersection, or use additional command information to navigate the vehicle but inefficiently. Focusing on making the vehicle automatically drive along the given path, we propose a new and effective navigation command called as subgoal anglewhich does not require human participation and is calculated by the current position and subgoal of the ego-vehicle. Thus, the subgoal angle contains more information than the navigation command represented as a one-hot vector. Additionally, we propose a model architecture called as angle branched network that makes predictions based on the subgoal angle. In this network, the subgoal angle is not only used for extracting useful features but also for guiding the appropriate prediction layer to make predictions for both the steer angle and the throttle status (which controls the acceleration). Experiments are conducted in a three-dimensional urban simulator. Both quantitive and qualitive results show the effectiveness of the navigation command and the angle branched network. Moreover, the performance can be further boosted by integrating both semantic and depth information into the driving model. Especially by using the depth information, collisions with vehicles and pedestrians can be reduced.

The functional machine is constructed by a linear combination of sigmoidal functions, with a topology similar to the perceptron, and its inference is developed by fuzzy logic. The proposed algorithm generates a desired trajectory for the vehicle that takes into account two control objectives: the energy savings and the increase of system manipulability by a smooth actuation. The computer simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of this approach.

AB Model-based methods in autonomous driving and advanced driving assistance gain importance in research and development due to their potential to contribute to higher road safety. Parameters of vehicle models, however, are hard to identify precisely or they can change quickly depending on the driving conditions. In this paper, we address the problem of safe trajectory planning under parametric model uncertainties motivated by automotive applications. We use the generalized polynomial chaos expansions for efficient nonlinear uncertainty propagation and distributionally robust inequalities for chance constraints approximation. Inspired by the tube-based model predictive control, an ancillary feedback controller is used to control the deviations of stochastic modes from the nominal solution, and therefore, decrease the variance. Our approach allows reducing conservatism related to nonlinear uncertainty propagation while guaranteeing constraints satisfaction with a high probability. The performance is demonstrated on the example of a trajectory optimization problem for a simplified vehicle model with uncertain parameters.

AB Recent advances in autonomous vehicles promise to revolutionize the transportation system. This perspective has led to new research on a number of open questions, such as how the self-driving system should behave in unavoidable crash situations. Our study aims to contribute to this investigation. In most ongoing research, this question is presented as a moral dilemma, drawing on established research on the trolley dilemma. However, more recent studies have shifted the focus from morality to risk analysis. We investigated the dual contribution of moral judgment and risk analysis in subjects facing dangerous situations. To this end, we use virtual reality to recreate a driving situation that allows subjects to immerse themselves in the road environment. Our results show a strong dissociation between quick decisions, when risk analysis seems to suggest the best choice, and conscious decisions, when proper moral judgment is at stake.

AB Future pedestrian trajectory prediction in first-person videos offers great prospects to help autonomous vehicles and social robots to enable better human-vehicle interactions. Given an egocentric video stream, we aim to predict the location and depth (distance between the observed person and the camera) of his/her neighbors in future frames. To locate their future trajectories, we mainly consider three main factors: a) It is necessary to restore the spatial distribution of pedestrians in 2D image to 3D space, i.e., to extract the distance between the pedestrian and the camera which is often neglected. b) It is critical to utilize neighbors' poses to recognize their intentions. c) It is important to learn human-vehicle interactions from the pedestrian's historical trajecto-ries. We propose to incorporate these three factors into a multi-channel tensor to represent the main features in real-life 3D space. We then put this tensor into an innovative end-to-end fully convolutional network based on transformer architecture. Experimental results reveal our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks MOT15, MOT16 and MOT17. The proposed method will be useful to understand human -vehicle interaction and helpful for pedestrian collision avoidance.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The impact of internal combustion engine-powered automobiles on climate change due to emissions and the depletion of fossil fuels has contributed to the progress of electrified powertrains. Energy management strategies (EMS) have shown huge impact on the energy efficiency of the electrified powertrains. In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) based algorithms have been intensely investigated to develop EMS for electrified powertrain with specific depth in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), battery electric vehicles (BEV) and fuel cell vehicles (FCV) and the research in this area is still acelerating. However, a comprehensive review of RL-based EMS is lacking in literature. This article reviews the recent penetration of RL based EMS like Q-learning, Deep Q Learning, deep deterministic policy gradient in the electrified powertrains domain. Extensive importance is given to the classification of the literature based on powertrain architecture, RL algorithm, and the different features and operation mechanisms of relevant algorithms are highlighted. The use of connected and autonomous vehicles and relevant communication technology to develop RL-based systems have also been discussed. More importantly, the challenges with regards to existing research in the field of RL-based EMS and the potential solutions with scope for future research are also discussed.

AB Introduction: The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has the potential to revolutionize transportation systems and address societal challenges. However, understanding the psychological factors influencing public acceptance and readiness for AV adoption is crucial for successful implementation. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of these psychological factors, specifically focusing on the context of health issues in Indonesia. Methodology: A mixed-methods approach analyzed quantitative data from 500 respondents to a questionnaire addressing key perceptions of AVs using regression analysis, coupled with 30 qualitative interviews.Results: The results revealed that trust in AV technology mediates the relationship between control perception, perceived safety, human-machine interaction, educational status, cultural factors, and public acceptance of AV adoption. Cultural factors were also identified as moderators influencing this relationship. Qualitative analysis of interview data further highlighted the significance of trust, reliability, and safety concerns in shaping public acceptance. Participants emphasized the need for effective human-machine interaction and educational awareness to enhance understanding and acceptance.Discussion: This research contributes to the existing literature by explicitly examining psycho-logical factors within the context of health issues in Indonesia, providing valuable insights for policymakers aiming to promote AV adoption. Ultimately, understanding and addressing these psychological factors will pave the way for a successful and sustainable AV future.

AB A robust steering torque control strategy for lateral tracking functionality of autonomous driving vehicles that perform active steering, active accelerating and active braking is researched in this paper. The main target of this research is to track references of lateral position and heading angle, which are provided by upstream motion planning module, via torque that robotic arm applies to steering hand wheel. Firstly, a system with tracking errors is generated and analyzed. To keep control system's robustness against time varying parameters, such as speed, center of mass, etc., gain-scheduling approach is utilized to obtain proper feedback gain. To achieve performance robustness, methods of linear matrix inequalities are used in design to maintain a performance function. Control performance is validated in Hardware in the loop environment built by ETAS labcar and Matlab/Simulink for a lane changing scenario and two typical parking scenarios. Results show that the pro-posed control strategy can regulate vehicle to follow target trajectory precisely even when speed varies. In lane changing scenario, steady state error is close to zero and maximum lateral position error is about 30 cm. In parking scenarios, tracking error of lateral position is about +/- 3 cm, and of heading angle is about +/- 0.1 rad at end points. In addition, in comparison with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and model predictive control (MPC), the pro-posed control outperformances in the three test scenarios. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

As for autonomous driving, conventional path-based approaches quickly reach their limits here. We therefore propose an input/output linearizing trajectory stabilization concept. It explicitly accounts for the time t during maneuver execution enabling precise driving amongst moving obstacles.

AB In this paper, a safety-guaranteed game-theoretical velocity planning framework in a hierarchical manner is proposed to generate safe, ride comfort, and travel efficiency-balanced velocity for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In the upper layer, a bang-bang decision-making method is utilized to determine which planning mode to be implemented based on acceleration and jerk constraints, including a comfort mode, an efficiency mode, and a game mode. In the lower layer, asymmetric jerk limits based on comfort characteristics sensibility analysis and safe velocity simultaneously considering longitudinal and lateral stability are firstly developed to maintain ride comfort and driving safety, respectively on curve roads, especially sharp curves where vehicle stability may be not fully considered in most researches. Based on these, a non-cooperative game-theoretical velocity planning method is presented to solve the conflict between comfort mode and efficiency mode by optimizing his own objective based on the other's action. Finally, for the sake of solving efficiency and accuracy, a chaos optimization-based algorithm (COA) is designed to solve for the Stackelberg equilibrium solution of the bilevel game optimization problem. Three experimental tests are carried out to comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and real time of the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed method can provide the great performance of ride comfort, travel efficiency, and longitudinal-lateral stability in real time in the velocity planning process.

AB Autonomous surfaces vehicles (ASVs) excel at monitoring and measuring aquatic nutrients due to their autonomy, mobility, and relatively low cost. When planning paths for such vehicles, the task of patrolling with multiple agents is usually addressed with heuristics approaches, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), because of the complexity and high dimensionality of the problem. Not only do efficient paths have to be designed, but addressing disturbances in movement or the battery's performance is mandatory. For this multiagent patrolling task, the proposed approach is based on a centralized Convolutional Deep Q-Network, designed with a final independent dense layer for every agent to deal with scalability, with the hypothesis/assumption that every agent has the same properties and capabilities. For this purpose, a tailored reward function is created which penalizes illegal actions (such as collisions) and rewards visiting idle cells (cells that remains unvisited for a long time). A comparison with various multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms has been done (Independent Q-Learning, Dueling Q-Network and multiagent Double Deep Q-Learning) in a case-study scenario like the Ypacarai lake in Asuncion (Paraguay). The training results in multiagent policy leads to an average improvement of 15% compared to lawn mower trajectories and a 6% improvement over the IDQL for the case-study considered. When evaluating the training speed, the proposed approach runs three times faster than the independent algorithm.

AB Achieving safe and robust autonomy is the key bottleneck on the path towards broader adoption of autonomous vehicles technology. This motivates going beyond extrinsic metrics such as miles between disengagement, and calls for approaches that embody safety by design. In this paper, we address some aspects of this challenge, with emphasis on issues of motion planning and prediction. We do this through description of novel approaches taken to solving selected sub-problems within an autonomous driving stack, in the process introducing the design philosophy being adopted within Five. This includes safe-by-design planning, interpretable as well as verifiable prediction, and modelling of perception errors to enable effective sim-to-real and real-to-sim transfer within the testing pipeline of a realistic autonomous system.

AB This paper presents a real-time dynamic path planning method for autonomous driving that avoids both static and moving obstacles. The proposed path planning method determines not only an optimal path, but also the appropriate acceleration and speed for a vehicle. In this method, we first construct a center line from a set of predefined waypoints, which are usually obtained from a lane-level map. A series of path candidates are generated by the arc length and offset to the center line in the s-p coordinate system. Then, all of these candidates are converted into Cartesian coordinates. The optimal path is selected considering the total cost of static safety, comfortability, and dynamic safety; meanwhile, the appropriate acceleration and speed for the optimal path are also identified. Various types of roads, including single-lane roads and multi-lane roads with static and moving obstacles, are designed to test the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and indicate its wide practical application to autonomous driving. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The autonomous vehicles emergence is a significant step forward in the development of safe and dependable intelligent transportation systems. In vehicular automation, digital connectivity has been one of the most critical specifications. In this paper, we focus on the autonomous train, which is one of the most rapidly growing applications of autonomous vehicles. In this context, we address the issue of safety by the proposition of Enhanced Train-centric Communication-Based Train Control (ETcCBTC), which provides efficient control of rail traffic. To ensure the operation's safety, we've implemented a new safety-checking approach based on process algebra, which aims to track and correct in real time the train behavior. The proposed ETcCBTC system's performance is tested using extensive simulations and compared to CBTC and TcCBTC. In terms of checking success, transmission load, and response time, the obtained results demonstrate that ETcCBTC outperforms the concurrent systems.

AB In this paper, we investigate the problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) autonomous tracking moving target with only an airborne camera sensor. We proposed a novel integrated controller framework for this problem based on multi-neural-network modules (MNNMs). In this framework, two neural networks are designed for target perception and guidance control, respectively. The deep learning method and reinforcement learning method are applied to train the integrated controller. The training result demonstrates that the integrated controller can be trained more quickly and efficiently than the end-to-end controller trained by the deep reinforcement learning method. The flight tests with the integrated controller are implemented in simulated and realistic environments, the results show that the integrated controller trained in simulation can easily be transferred to the realistic environment and achieve the UAV tracking randomly moving target, which has a faster motion velocity. The integrated controller based on the MNNMs structure has a better performance on an autonomous tracking target than the control mode that combines with a perception network and a proportional integral derivative controller.

AB A human-like trajectory could give a safe and comfortable feeling for the occupants in an autonomous vehicle especially in corners. The research of this paper focuses on planning a human-like trajectory along a section road on a test track using optimal control method that could reflect natural driving behaviour considering the sense of natural and comfortable for the passengers, which could improve the acceptability of driverless vehicles in the future. A mass point vehicle dynamic model is modelled in the curvilinear coordinate system, then an optimal trajectory is generated by using an optimal control method. The optimal control problem is formulated and then solved by using the Matlab tool GPOPS-II. Trials are carried out on a test track, and the tested data are collected and processed, then the trajectory data in different corners are obtained. Different TLCs calculations are derived and applied to different track sections. After that, the human driver's trajectories and the optimal line are compared to see the correlation using TLC methods. The results show that the optimal trajectory shows a similar trend with human's trajectories to some extent when driving through a corner although it is not so perfectly aligned with the tested trajectories, which could conform with people's driving intuition and improve the occupants' comfort when driving in a corner. This could improve the acceptability of AVs in the automotive market in the future. The driver tends to move to the outside of the lane gradually after passing the apex when driving in corners on the road with hard-lines on both sides.

AB Reliable motion prediction of surrounding vehicles is the key to safe and efficient driving of autonomous vehicles, especially at urban intersections with complex traffic environments. This study models driving intentions and future driving speeds at urban intersections and improves model prediction performance by considering traffic environment characteristics. Key feature parameters including environmental characteristics are first extracted through driving behavior analysis and existing research experience. Then models with different input combinations are constructed to explore the effectiveness of different factors in predicting driving intention and future speed. In particular, in vehicle speed modeling, a target detection algorithm is used to identify traffic participants. Based on the identified traffic participant and vehicle position information, a new method for speed prediction that can reflect the dynamic interaction characteristics between the driver and the traffic environment is proposed. Models are trained and tested using natural driving data from China. Finally, the models with the simplest input and the best effect are determined. The driving intention recognition model can accurately predict the driving maneuvers of straight-ahead, stopping, turning left and right 4 seconds before reaching the intersection. The speed prediction model can significantly improve the speed prediction accuracy, and shows stronger robustness and adaptability than existing models. This research provides important technical support for developing intelligent driving systems suitable for complex urban traffic environments.

   vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS; FREE NAVIGATION; STRATEGY;
   ROBOTS
AB Avoiding collisions is an essential goal of the control system of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a reactive algorithm for avoiding obstacles in a three-dimensional space, and shows how the algorithm can be applied to an underactuated underwater vehicle. The algorithm is based on maintaining a constant avoidance angle to the obstacle, which ensures that a guaranteed minimum separation distance is achieved. The algorithm can thus be implemented without knowledge of the obstacle shape. The avoidance angle is designed to compensate for obstacle movement, and the flexibility of operating in 3D can be utilized to implement traffic rules or operational constraints. We exemplify this by incorporating safety constraints on the vehicle pitch and by making the vehicle seek to move behind the obstacle, while also minimizing the required control effort. The underactuation of the vehicle induces a sway and heave movement while turning. To avoid uncontrolled gliding into the obstacle, we account for this movement using a Flow frame controller, which controls the direction of the vehicle's velocity rather than just the pitch and yaw. We derive conditions under which it is ensured that the resulting maneuver is safe, and these results are verified trough simulations and through full-scale experiments on the Hugin HUS autonomous underwater vehicle. The latter demonstrates the performance of the proposed algorithm when applied to a case with unmodeled disturbances and sensor noise, and shows how the modular nature of the collision avoidance algorithm allows it to be applied on top of a commercial control system.

AB The cellular automaton (CA) model for traffic flow describes the restrictive vehicle movements using the distance headway (gap) between two adjacent vehicles. However, the autonomous and synergistic behaviors also exist in the vehicle movements. This paper makes an attempt to propose a microscopic traffic simulation model such that the feedback control behavior during the driving process is incorporated into the CA model. The acceleration, speed holding and deceleration are manipulated by the difference between the gap and the braking reference distance the driver perceives, which is generally observed in the realistic traffic. The braking reference distance is related to the current speed and braking performance of vehicle grasped by the driver. Consequently, the proposed CA model with feedback control (CA-FC) can assign the vehicle with rationale acceleration and deceleration rates which aim at maintaining the moderate safe-driving distance to the preceding adjacent vehicle and thereby accomplishing the speed tracking with regard to that vehicle. Besides, the variety and randomness of driving behaviors are kept through the adjustable parameters for the conservative, prudent and aggressive drivers. The comparative study of CA-CF model with the typical CA and car following (CF) models is undertaken using the go-and-stop cases without and with signal control. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CA-FC model can replicate the restrictive, autonomous and synergistic behaviors of vehicle movements. The consistency is revealed with the macroscopic property of traffic flow such as the relationship between any two of density, flow and speed.

AB In heterogeneous traffic flow, the response delay of different types' vehicles varies. Accordingly, a heterogeneous lattice model is created for the mixed traffic flows including autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles accounting for the delay difference characteristics with the passing effect. The neutral stability condition is acquired from the linear stability analysis, which shows that the stability region of the system significantly decreases with the increase of the passing effect, the proportion of regular vehicles and the reaction time co-efficient. The kink-antikink solution of the modified Kortewegde Vries equation is inferred via nonlinear analysis. The jamming transitions occur between the kink jam and no jam regions with lower passing effect. When the passing effect increases to a critical value, a chaotic jam region appears between the kink jam and no jam regions. And the chaotic jam region further expands with higher passing effect. Moreover, simulation experiments indicate that traffic stability gets better with the delayed time falling down in heterogeneous traffic flow. Also, the impact factors of chaos phenomenon, including the passing effect, the delayed time and pro-portion of regular vehicles, are investigated in heterogeneous lattice model through Poincare ' phase diagram and Lyapunov exponent.

AB Precise and detailed speed information is indispensable for ensuring safe and efficient transportation. This is particularly true within unstable flow (UF) segments, which are especially prone to accidents due to the significant speed variations between vehicles and across lanes, and in the context of evolving transportation systems, where autonomous and non-autonomous vehicles are increasingly mixing. To address the limitations of existing methods in providing such data, this study aims to improve the detail, accuracy, and granularity of road information for micro-segments by leveraging individual vehicle big data. The proposed approach utilizes the geohash algorithm for spatial segmentation and introduces a novel criterion for identifying UF segments based on the relationship between space mean speed (SMS) and time mean speed (TMS). The presented strategy was validated through a comprehensive analysis of DTG (Digital Tachograph) data from freight vehicles on Expressway No. 50 in the Gyeonggi region in the Republic of Korea. As a result, a total of 301 segments were identified, including 178 eastbound and 123 westbound segments. UF segments corresponded to partitions falling beyond the reference standard deviation range. Compared with VDS (Vehicle Detection System) and conzone speeds, the proposed method provided more precise and continuous speed information, surpassing those obtained from conventional link-based approaches.

AB The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has expanded in recent years to include inspection, maintenance, and repair missions. For these tasks, the vehicle must maintain its position while inspections or manipulations are performed. Some station-keeping controllers for AUVs can be found in the literature that exhibits robust performance against external disturbances. However, they are either model-based or require an observer to deal with the disturbances. Moreover, most of them have been evaluated only by numerical simulations. In this paper, the feasibility of a model-free high-order sliding mode controller for the station-keeping problem is validated. The proposed controller was evaluated through numerical simulations and experiments in a semi-Olympic swimming pool, introducing external disturbances that remained unknown to the controller. Results have shown robust performance in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) of the vehicle position. The simulation resulted in the outstanding station-keeping of the BlueROV2 vehicle, as the tracking errors were kept to zero throughout the simulation, even in the presence of strong ocean currents. The experimental results demonstrated the robustness of the controller, which was able to maintain the RMSE in the range of 1-4 cm for the depth of the vehicle, outperforming related work, even when the disturbance was large enough to produce thruster saturation.

AB The rapid development of modern logistics and e-commerce highlights the importance of exploring various modes of transportation in the last-mile delivery (LMD) process. However, no comprehensive studies exist in the literature exploring all modes of LMD transportation, the changes in these transportation modes, and the commonalities between them. In this study, we address this gap by conducting a systematic review of 150 academic journal articles utilizing a combination of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) content analysis and text mining analysis. Nine primary transportation methods (parcel lockers, autonomous drones, trucks, bicycles, crowd logistics, electric vehicles, tricycles, autonomous robots, and autonomous vehicles) are identified in this research. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the historical changes in these transportation modes in LMD. Using a bottom-up induction method, we identify the three major clusters of scholarly focus in the LMD literature: emphasis on value co-creation between consumers and logistics providers, practical delivery performance (path optimization or algorithms), and environmental friendliness. Further, we analyze the main themes under each cluster, leading to the identification of opportunities, challenges, and future research agendas. Our findings have implications for scholars, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in LMD transportation modes.

AB To achieve rapid and flexible vertical profile exploration of deep-sea hybrid structures, a multi-joint autonomous underwater vehicle (MJ-AUV) with orthogonal joints was designed. This paper focuses on the 3-dimensional (3D) modeling and attitude control of the designed vehicle. Considering the situation of gravity and buoyancy imbalance, a 3D model of the MJ-AUV was established according to Newton's second law and torque balance principle. And then the numerical simulation was carried out to verify the credibility of the model. To solve the problems that the pitch and yaw attitude of the MJ-AUV are coupled and the disturbance is unknown, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) decoupling control method based on a linear extended state observer (LESO) was proposed. The system was decoupled into pitch and yaw subsystems, treated the internal forces and external disturbances of each subsystem as total disturbances, and estimated the total disturbances with LESO. The control law was divided into two parts. The first part was the total disturbance compensator, while the second part was the linear state feedback controller. The simulation results show that the overshoot of the controlled system in the dynamic process is nearly 0 rad, reaching the design value very smoothly. Moreover, when the controlled system is in a stable state, the control precision is within 0.005%.

AB Cellular vehicle to everything (C-V2X) communications is presented as the cornerstone for next-generation connected vehicles. C-V2X can support efficient vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure data transmission, and is said to be a key enabler of cooperative connected and automated mobility (CCAM). Performance of 5G New Radio (5G-NR) is expected to address bandwidth and delay requirements of services for autonomous vehicles. This is the theory and what particular research works have showed through simulation or limited prototypes. On the contrary, this work focuses on evaluating real 5G deployments (including 5G-NR) of network operators in CCAM scenarios, with particular emphasis on cross-border settings and service continuity under inter-operator handovers. The paper presents an evaluation platform to gather cross-layer measurements, homogenise results, perform comparative assessment of figures of merit, and calculate network and CCAM key performance indicators (KPIs). The platform is evaluated through implementing a use case for autonomous overtaking, involving two 5G-NR operator deployments at the Spanish-Portuguese border. Results reveal good network performances and correct operation of the service, thanks to 5G-NR and edge servers, although significant impact of handovers is detected on network and overtaking KPIs.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB This paper presents a comfort-oriented adaptive fuzzy-model predictive control strategy to control the lateral motion of a vehicle with the steering angle as the input while preventing sudden changes and unwanted motions. This is reached by utilizing three main contributions: an adaptive fuzzy model based on look-ahead dynamics, limiting the controller to the acceptable range of states to the driver and introducing an adjustment factor to the controller's cost function. Using adaptive-fuzzy models to describe the vehicle lateral dynamics and driver behaviour for the purpose of the control-oriented model enables this method of control to advantage from the low computational effort of the models while maintaining the accuracy and adaptive properties which are crucial to the performance and robustness of the system during the manoeuvres. Also, the characteristics of each driver's behaviour modify the controller towards a more comfort-oriented drive with means of the cost function and constraints. The comparative simulation indicates that the developed method leads to a comfort-oriented drive, in that the vehicle's states stay within the limits of the driver behaviour range, the fluctuations are insignificant and the control strategy is more accurate than previous methods.

AB In this paper, we concern ourselves with finding a control strategy that minimizes energy consumption along a trajectory connecting two given configurations. We develop an algorithm, based on our previous work with the time optimal problem, which provides implementable control strategies that are energy efficient. We find an interesting correlation between the duration of these trajectories and the optimal duration. We present the algorithm, control strategy and experimental results from our test-bed vehicle.

AB Accurate vehicle localization is important for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. Existing precise localization systems based on the global navigation satellite system cannot always provide lane-level accuracy even in open-sky environments. Map-based localization using high-definition (HD) maps is an interesting method for achieving greater accuracy. We propose a map-based localization method using a single camera. Our method relies on road link information in the HD map to achieve lane-level accuracy. Initially, we process the image-acquired using the camera of a mobile device-via inverse perspective mapping, which shows the entire road at a glance in the driving image. Subsequently, we use the Hough transform to detect the vehicle lines and acquire driving link information regarding the lane on which the vehicle is moving. The vehicle position is estimated by matching the global positioning system (GPS) and reference HD map. We employ iterative closest point-based map-matching to determine and eliminate the disparity between the GPS trajectories and reference map. Finally, we perform experiments by considering the data of a sophisticated GPS/inertial navigation system as the ground truth and demonstrate that the proposed method provides lane-level position accuracy for vehicle localization.

AB This letter presents an integrated navigation and control strategy for an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) to operate in narrow waterways without relying on GPS. The proposed method uses a camera and a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor to detect navigable regions in the waterway. A deep learning-based semantic segmentation algorithm is applied to detect the navigable region in camera images, and the segmented region is projected onto the water surface using planar homography. A line-detection algorithm is also introduced to improve the reliability of detecting navigable regions from LiDAR measurements. A safe collision-free path for the ASV is generated within the navigable regions using model predictive control-based local path planning and control algorithms. The performance and practical utility of the proposed method were demonstrated through field experiments using a small cruise boat, modified as an autonomous surface vehicle.

AB Automated and connected vehicles are emerging in the market. Currently, solutions are being proposed to use these technologies for cooperative driving, which can significantly improve road safety. Vehicular safety applications must be tested before deployment. It is challenging to verify and validate them in the real world. Therefore, simulation is used for this purpose. Modeling this technology necessitates coupled use of traffic flow, vehicle dynamics, and communication network simulators. State-of-the-art tools exist in these domains; however, they are difficult to integrate or lack full domain coverage. This article analyzes the requirements for an integrated connected and automated vehicle simulation environment for simulating vehicular cooperative driving automation with consideration of surrounding objects' influence. For this purpose, we have assessed the existing challenges and practices. Vehicular simulation tools, signal propagation, and cooperative perception models are reviewed and analyzed. In our review, we focus mainly on autonomous driving simulators with 3D graphical environments as they have not yet been assessed for cooperative driving task fitness. Further, the current state of connected and automated vehicle simulation studies using these tools is surveyed, including single-tool and co-simulation approaches. We discuss the shortcomings of existing methods and propose an architecture for an integrated simulation environment (ISE) with full domain coverage using open source tools. The obtained conclusions can be further used in the development of connected and automated vehicle ISEs.

AB Accurately detecting and predicting Lane Change (LC) processes of human-driven vehicles can help autonomous vehicles better understand their surrounding environment, recognize potential safety hazards, and improve traffic safety. This paper focuses on LC processes, first developing a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with an attention mechanism (ATM) model to recognize LC intention. Then, considering the intrinsic relationship among output variables, the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework is employed to simultaneously predict multiple LC vehicle status indicators. Furthermore, a unified modeling framework for LC intention recognition and driving status prediction (LC-IR-SP) is developed. The results indicate that the classification accuracy of LC intention was improved from 95.83% to 98.20% when incorporating the ATM into the TCN model. For LC vehicle status prediction issues, Pearson's correlation coefficient indicates that metrics extracted from LC processes show stronger correlation than those extracted from Lane-keeping processes. Consequently, three multi-tasking learning models are constructed based on the MTL framework. The results indicate that the MTL with Long Short-Term Memory (MTL-LSTM) model outperforms the MTL with TCN (MTL-TCN) and MTL with TCN-ATM (MTL-TCN-ATM) models. Compared to the corresponding single-task model, the MTL-LSTM model demonstrates an average decrease of 26.04% in MAE and 25.19% in RMSE. The LC-IR-SP model developed holds great potential in enhancing autonomous vehicles' perception and prediction capabilities, such as identifying LC behaviors, calculating real-time traffic conflict indices, and improving vehicle control strategies.

AB The autonomous traffic system has imposed higher requirements on the speed estimation of connected vehicles, where the speed of connected vehicles, as one of the control conditions for refined traffic management, plays a crucial role in the evaluation and optimization of network performance. In this paper, we propose a multi-source speed measurement sensor network consensus filtering (MSCF) algorithm based on information weight for the problem of optimal speed consistency estimation for connected vehicles. Specifically, we first utilize dynamic linearization techniques and data-driven parameter identification algorithms to handle the derived state equations of connected vehicles. We then establish observation models for four different types of sensors and construct distributed direct and indirect measurement models by dynamically adjusting the information weights of sensor nodes. Following this, we combine the Kalman consistency filtering algorithm to derive the speed state estimation update rate and design a new state estimator to achieve the optimal consistent convergence estimation for connected vehicles' speed. The MSCF algorithm can solve the problem of consistency filtering for noisy sensor data under observation- and communication-constrained conditions, enabling each sensor node to obtain a consistent convergence estimation value for the speed of the connected vehicle. The convergence of the algorithm is proved using the Lyapunov function. Through numerical simulation, the results are verified, indicating that compared to existing methods, this method can achieve a higher precision speed estimation effect.

AB The autonomous navigation of aerial robots in unknown and complex outdoor environments is a challenging problem that typically requires planners to generate collision-free trajectories based on human expert rules for fast navigation. Presently, aerial robots suffer from high latency in acquiring environmental information, which limits the control strategies that the vehicle can implement. In this study, we proposed the SAC_FAE algorithm for high-speed navigation in complex environments using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. Our approach consisted of a soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm and a focus autoencoder (FAE). Our end-to-end DRL navigation policy enabled a flying robot to efficiently accomplish navigation tasks without prior map information by relying solely on the front-end depth frames and its own pose information. The proposed algorithm outperformed existing trajectory-based optimization approaches at flight speeds exceeding 3 m/s in multiple testing environments, which demonstrates its effectiveness and efficiency.

AB Taking the velocity regulation of autonomous driving as an example, this paper developed an enhancing active disturbance rejection design employing the deep reinforcement learning-deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). In this scheme, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is adopted to online estimate and compensate disturbances and uncertainties, and feasible regions of control parameters are obtained through the Lyapunov method. Then DDPG is combined with ADRC to online adaptively tune control parameters in response to the changing environments, where safety, comfort, and energy-saving are considered in the reward design, and mapping relation between the defined action and state is constructed for the maximal reward. Besides, numerical simulations demonstrate the better performance and stronger robustness of the enhancing design when facing uncertainties, sensor noise, and mechanical faults, and comfort and energy consumption have also been improved to some extent compared with the general ADRC and model predictive control (MPC).

AB Autonomous vehicles will generate data from the variety of sensors they employ to track the surrounding environment. This data is inherently valuable, as it gives algorithm designers the potential to leverage prior experience in order to improve driving performance over time. This paper uses the lens of autonomous racing to provide an example of how data from previous iterations of driving can be used to improve quantitative metrics of performance. Two complementary algorithms are demonstrated in this paper. The first algorithm uses iterative learning control (ILC) to simultaneously improve lateral and longitudinal tracking of the desired racing trajectory over multiple laps, while the second algorithm is focused on altering the trajectory itself using a search method. When driven experimentally at the limits of handling, the result is a reduction in lap time of nearly 1.4 seconds, a major improvement.

TI Three-Dimensional Path Planning Method for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
   Based on Modified Firefly Algorithm
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Path planning is a classic optimization problem which can be solved by many optimization algorithms. The complexity of three-dimensional (3D) path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) requires the optimization algorithm to have a quick convergence speed. This work provides a new 3D path planning method for AUV using a modified firefly algorithm. In order to solve the problem of slow convergence of the basic firefly algorithm, an improved method was proposed. In the modified firefly algorithm, the parameters of the algorithm and the random movement steps can be adjusted according to the operating process. At the same time, an autonomous flight strategy is introduced to avoid instances of invalid flight. An excluding operator was used to improve the effect of obstacle avoidance, and a contracting operator was used to enhance the convergence speed and the smoothness of the path. The performance of the modified firefly algorithm and the effectiveness of the 3D path planning method were proved through a varied set of experiments.

AB This paper presents an environment-detection-and-mapping algorithm for autonomous driving that is provided in real time and for both rural and off-road environments. Environment-detection-and-mapping algorithms have been designed to consist of two parts: 1) lane, pedestrian-crossing, and speed-bump detection algorithms using cameras and 2) obstacle detection algorithm using LIDARs. The lane detection algorithm returns lane positions using one camera and the vision module "VisLab Embedded Lane Detector (VELD)," and the pedestrian-crossing and speed-bump detection algorithms return the position of pedestrian crossings and speed bumps. The obstacle detection algorithm organizes data from LIDARs and generates a local obstacle position map. The designed algorithms have been implemented on a passenger car using six LIDARs, three cameras, and real-time devices, including personal computers (PCs). Vehicle tests have been conducted, and test results have shown that the vehicle can reach the desired goal with the proposed algorithm.

ID VISUAL SERVO CONTROL
AB In this paper, a fully autonomous quadrotor in a heterogeneous air-ground multi-robot system is established only using minimal on-board sensors: a monocular camera and inertial measurement units (IMUs). Efficient pose and motion estimation is proposed and optimized. A continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter is applied, in which the high-frequency IMU data drive the prediction, while the estimates are corrected by the accurate and steady vision data. A high-frequency fusion at 100 Hz is achieved. Moreover, time delay analysis and data synchronizations are conducted to further improve the pose/motion estimation of the quadrotor. The complete on-board implementation of sensor data processing and control algorithms reduces the influence of data transfer time delay, enables autonomous task accomplishment and extends the work space. Higher pose estimation accuracy and smaller control errors compared to the standard works are achieved in real-time hovering and tracking experiments. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to significantly improve traffic efficiency and safety. However, the overall impacts of CAVs on mixed traffic have not been clearly studied because most previous research focused on one subset of the performance of mixed traffic. This study aims to provide complete information for the policymakers to make better decisions on future CAV implementation strategies with a comprehensive evaluation of the overall performance of mixed traffic. With this purpose, this study develops an integrated framework to evaluate the efficiency and safety of mixed traffic with CAVs under adverse weather conditions, which is composed of a traffic simulation, multi-vehicle crash model, single-vehicle crash model, and performance assessment. For the first time, a unified performance index is introduced to reflect the overall efficiency and safety performance of mixed traffic. The proposed framework is demonstrated with an evaluation of the performance of mixed traffic on a highway segment. Traffic efficiency and safety under different weather conditions are investigated. The impact of reaction time of human-driving vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs are also studied. Simulation results show that the overall traffic performance in terms of traffic efficiency, multi-vehicle safety, and single-vehicle safety increases with the increase in the market penetration rate (MPR). In addition, it is found that CAVs have a greater impact on improving overall traffic performance under rainy and snowy weather than in clear weather. Moreover, a shorter reaction time of HDVs and CAVs can lead to better overall traffic performance.

AB A set-point controller for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed in this paper. The controller is expressed in transformed equations of motion with a diagonal inertia matrix. It takes into account the dynamics of the system and it can be applied for fully actuated AUVs. The stability of the designed control law is demonstrated by means of a Lyapunov-based argument. Some advantages arising from the use of the controller are considered too. The performance of the proposed controller is validated via simulation on a 6-DOF underwater vehicle. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ID EVASION DIFFERENTIAL-GAMES; AIR-COMBAT
AB This paper studies a safe intercept navigation which accounts for the uncertainty of other vehicles' trajectories, avoids collisions and any other positions in which vehicle safety is compromised. Since the number of vehicles can vary with time, it is important that the navigation strategy can quickly adjust to the current number of vehicles, i.e, that it scales well with the number of vehicles. The scalable strategy is based on a stochastic optimal control problem formulation of safe navigation in the presence of a single vehicle, denoted as the one-on-one vehicle problem. It is shown that safe navigation in the presence of multiple vehicles can be solved exactly as an auxiliary Markov decision problem. This allows us to approximate the solution based on the one-on-one vehicle optimal control solution and achieve scalable navigation. Our work is illustrated by a numerical example of safely navigating a vehicle in the presence of four other vehicles and by a robot experiment.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB An effective traffic control strategy will improve travel reliability in urban transportation networks. Lack of coordination between vehicles, however, exacerbates congestion due mainly to frequent stops at unsignalized intersections. It is beneficial to develop a conflict-free cooperation method that collects basic safety message from multiple approaching Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (for short, CAVs) and guarantees efficient unsignalized intersection operations with safe and incident free vehicle maneuvers. This paper proposes an interspersed traffic organization method under controlled constraints. Firstly, relied on shared location technology and considered the operating characteristics of CAVs at unsignalized intersections to detect and analyze traffic conflicts to establish a right-of-way judgment model for CAVs. In order to further ensure the safety and operating efficiency of the vehicle, based on the judgment results of right-of-way judgment model, a vehicle speed guidance model is established for different traffic conditions. Taking the real city standard intersection as the experimental analysis object, through data collection and simulation experiment, the signal control method and the organization method proposed in this paper are compared and analyzed. The results showed that the traffic organization method proposed in this paper improves the operational efficiency of 46%, the average travel time is reduced by 6.54s, which is not only better than the signal control method, but also supports the development of car networking technology.

AB This paper presents a guidance and control law design method for coordinated path following of networked underactuated robotic autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) under directed communication links. Each ASV is subject to model uncertainties and environment disturbances induced by wind, waves, and ocean currents. Antidisturbance coordinated path-following controllers are designed, featured with an inner-outer loop architecture. In the outer loop, a line-of-sight guidance scheme and graph theory are employed to design guidance laws for synchronized path following. In the inner loop, an extended state observer is developed to estimate the lumped disturbances, including the model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Based on the estimated disturbances through the extended state observer, antidisturbance kinetic control laws are designed by resorting to a dynamic surface control method. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system is established by cascade theory and all error signals are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the results of simulation and experiment are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed antidisturbance coordinated path-following controllers for underactuated ASVs.

AB Localization and tracking are basic services for the applications of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Although they are closely related, the localization or tracking is usually studied independently. This paper addresses a joint localization and tracking issue for an AUV, subject to asynchronous clocks in physical channel and state disturbances in control channel. We first develop an asynchronous localization algorithm to estimate the position of an AUV, wherein the clocks on AUV and buoys are not required to be synchronized. With the estimated position, a model-free tracking controller is designed for an AUV to track the reference trajectory. Particularly, the time-delay estimation and dynamic gain strategies are adopted to reduce the influence of state disturbances. Moreover, the convergence conditions and Cramer-Rao lower bounds for the localization algorithm are derived. For the tracking controller, Lyapunov functions are constructed to analyze the stability, through which the sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability are presented. Finally, simulation and experiment results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is demonstrated that the asynchronous localization algorithm in this paper can effectively eliminate the impact of the clock skew and offset. Meanwhile, the tracking accuracy can be significantly improved.

TI Efficient ConvNet Feature Extraction with Multiple RoI Pooling for
   Landmark-Based Visual Localization of Autonomous Vehicles

DT Article
ID LOOP CLOSURE DETECTION; PLACE RECOGNITION
AB Efficient and robust visual localization is important for autonomous vehicles. By achieving impressive localization accuracy under conditions of significant changes, ConvNet landmark-based approach has attracted the attention of people in several research communities including autonomous vehicles. Such an approach relies heavily on the outstanding discrimination power of ConvNet features to match detected landmarks between images. However, amajor challenge of this approach is how to extract discriminative ConvNet features efficiently. To address this challenging, inspired by the high efficiency of the region of interest (RoI) pooling layer, we propose a Multiple RoI (MRoI) pooling technique, an enhancement of RoI, and a simple yet efficient ConvNet feature extraction method. Our idea is to leverage MRoI pooling to exploit multilevel and multiresolution information from multiple convolutional layers and then fuse them to improve the discrimination capacity of the final ConvNet features. Themain advantages of ourmethod are (a) high computational efficiency for real-time applications; (b) GPUmemory efficiency for mobile applications; and (c) use of pretrained model without fine-tuning or retraining for easy implementation. Experimental results on four datasets have demonstrated not only the above advantages but also the high discriminating power of the extracted ConvNet features with state-of-the-art localization accuracy.

AB In the development of autonomous driving technology, 5G-NR vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology is a key technology that enhances safety and enables effective management of traffic information. Road-side units (RSUs) in 5G-NR V2X provide nearby vehicles with information and exchange traffic, and safety information with future autonomous vehicles, enhancing traffic safety and efficiency. This paper proposes a communication system for vehicle networks based on a 5G cellular network with RSUs consisting of the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE), and validates the system performance when providing services from different RSUs. The proposed approach maximizes the utilization of the entire network and ensures the reliability of V2I/V2N links between vehicles and each RSU. It also minimizes the shadowing area in the 5G-NR V2X environment, and maximizes the average throughput of vehicles through collaborative access between BS- and UE-type RSUs. The paper applies various resource management techniques, such as dynamic inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC), coordinated scheduling coordinated multi-point (CS-CoMP), cell range extension (CRE), and 3D beamforming, to achieve high reliability requirements. Simulation results demonstrate improved performance in outage probability, reduced shadowing area, and increased reliability through decreased interference and increased average throughput when collaborating with BS- and UE-type RSUs simultaneously.

AB A modern vehicle can be viewed as a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) where the vehicle dynamics interact with the software control systems. Adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane keeping control (LKC), in particular, are foundational features for semi-autonomous and autonomous driving. Safety analysis of such systems is extremely important for realizing vehicle autonomy. Ensuring safety in such complex CPS is very challenging, especially in the presence of interactions between multiple subsystems, nonlinearities, hybrid dynamics, and disturbances. This paper presents an approach for safety analysis of automotive control systems using multi-modal port-Hamiltonian systems. The approach uses the Hamiltonian function as a barrier between the energy levels of the safe and unsafe states and employs passivity to prove that trajectories cannot cross this barrier. The approach is applied to the safety analysis of a vehicle dynamics composed with ACC and LKC. The goal is to ensure that the host vehicle will not collide with a lead vehicle and will not skid off of the road. The control design is implemented and evaluated using a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform. The experimental results demonstrate the safety analysis approach including the impact of implementation effects such as discretization and quantization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a preview steering control algorithm and its closed-loop system analysis and experimental validation for accurate, smooth, and computationally inexpensive path tracking of automated vehicles. The path tracking issue is formulated as an optimal control problem with dynamic disturbance, i.e., the future road curvature. A discrete-time preview controller is then designed on the top of a linear augmented error system, in which the disturbances within a finite preview window are augmented as part of the state vector. The obtained optimal steering control law is in an analytic form and consists of two parts: 1) a feedback control responding to tracking errors and 2) a feedforward control dealing with the future road curvatures. The designed control's nature, capacity, computation load, and underlying mechanism are revealed by the analysis of system responses in the time domain and the frequency domain, theoretical steady-state error, and comparison with the model predictive control (MPC). The algorithm was implemented on an automated vehicle platform, a hybrid Lincoln MKZ. The experimental and simulation results are then presented to demonstrate the improved performance in tracking accuracy, steering smoothness, and computational efficiency compared to the MPC and the full-state feedback control.

AB The effects of in-vehicle automation and driving assistant systems on the situation awareness of drivers have been the subject of much research with the implications of automation in such man-machine systems being identified. With the introduction of advanced automated systems in agricultural machinery, farmers are now working with semi-autonomous vehicles. A human factors perspective is needed to ensure the safe and efficient operation of such systems. This simulator study investigated the effects of automating vehicle steering and implement control and monitoring task automation on the situation awareness of drivers. Experiments were conducted using a tractor driving simulator located in the Agricultural Ergonomics Laboratory at the University of Manitoba. Thirty young, experienced tractor drivers participated in this study. It was found that implement control and monitoring task automation significantly affected the situation awareness of operators. Situation awareness increased as the level of automation support increased although the highest level of automation, where the participants were removed from the task loop, resulted in low situation awareness at a level similar to the condition with no automation support. The highest level of situation awareness was observed when the simulator suggested the required action to be taken by the operator. Vehicle steering task automation reduced the attentional demand of the task. (c) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate depth and heading control play an essential role for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in nearseabed exploration and ocean surveys. This paper proposed a novel adaptive backstepping sliding mode control (ABSMC) algorithm for a lightweight autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH) subject to highly coupled nonlinearities, unknown system parameters, disturbances uncertainties, and input saturation. This algorithm adopted a conditional adaptation algorithm to govern adaptation so that gains only adapt when necessary to improve stability. Different reaching laws were selected for heading and depth control to reduce system chattering. For thruster saturation, we proposed an anti-windup compensator for auxiliary dynamic compensation based on system states; it can make the controller output change smoothly in the event of input saturation to better meet the response characteristics of the actual physical actuator. The mathematical proofs of the proposed algorithms are presented. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. Moreover, extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better control performance than PID and sliding mode controllers and demonstrate its adaptive capability to system state changes.

ID PLACE RECOGNITION
AB Robust and precise visual localization over extended periods of time poses a formidable challenge in the current domain of spatial vision. The primary difficulty lies in effectively addressing significant variations in appearance caused by seasonal changes (summer, winter, spring, autumn) and diverse lighting conditions (dawn, day, sunset, night). With the rapid development of related technologies, more and more relevant datasets have emerged, which has also promoted the progress of 6-DOF visual localization in both directions of autonomous vehicles and handheld devices.This manuscript endeavors to rectify the existing limitations of the current public benchmark for long-term visual localization, especially in the part on the autonomous vehicle challenge. Taking into account that autonomous vehicle datasets are primarily captured by multi-camera rigs with fixed extrinsic camera calibration and consist of serialized image sequences, we present several proposed modifications designed to enhance the rationality and comprehensiveness of the evaluation algorithm. We advocate for standardized preprocessing procedures to minimize the possibility of human intervention influencing evaluation results. These procedures involve aligning the positions of multiple cameras on the vehicle with a predetermined canonical reference system, replacing the individual camera positions with uniform vehicle poses, and incorporating sequence information to compensate for any failed localized poses. These steps are crucial in ensuring a just and accurate evaluation of algorithmic performance. Lastly, we introduce a novel indicator to resolve potential ties in the Schulze ranking among submitted methods. The inadequacies highlighted in this study are substantiated through simulations and actual experiments, which unequivocally demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed amendments.

AB Self-driving cars and trucks, autonomous vehicles (avs), should not be accepted by regulatory bodies and the public until they have much higher confidence in their safety and reliability - which can most practically and convincingly be achieved by testing. But existing testing methods are inadequate for checking the end-to-end behaviors of av controllers against complex, real-world corner cases involving interactions with multiple independent agents such as pedestrians and human-driven vehicles. While test-driving avs on streets and highways fails to capture many rare events, existing simulation-based testing methods mainly focus on simple scenarios and do not scale well for complex driving situations that require sophisticated awareness of the surroundings. To address these limitations, we propose a new fuzz testing technique, called AutoFuzz, which can leverage widely-used av simulators' API grammars to generate semantically and temporally valid complex driving scenarios (sequences of scenes). To efficiently search for traffic violations-inducing scenarios in a large search space, we propose a constrained neural network (NN) evolutionary search method to optimize AutoFuzz. Evaluation of our prototype on one state-of-the-art learning-based controller, two rule-based controllers, and one industrial-grade controller in five scenarios shows that AutoFuzz efficiently finds hundreds of traffic violationsin high-fidelity simulation environments. For each scenario, AutoFuzz can find on average 10-39% more unique traffic violationsthan the best-performing baseline method. Further, fine-tuning the learning-based controller with the traffic violationsfound by AutoFuzz successfully reduced the traffic violationsfound in the new version of the av controller software.

AB This work presents the development of a classification method that can contribute to precise and increased awareness of the situational context of vehicles, for it to be used in autonomous driving applications. This work aims to obtain a method for machine-learning-based driving environment classification that does not involve computer vision but instead makes use of dynamics variables from Inertial-Measurement-Unit (IMU) sensors and instantaneous energy consumption measurements. This article includes details about the data acquisition, the electric vehicle used for the experiments, and the pre-processing methods employed. This explores the viability of a method for classifying a vehicle's driving environment. The results of such a system can potentially be used to provide precise information for path planning, energy optimization, or safety purposes. Information about the driving context could be also used to decide if the conditions are safe for autonomous driving or if human intervention is recommended or required. In this work, the feature selection process and statistical data pre-processing methods are evaluated. The pre-processed data are used to compare 13 different classification algorithms and then the best three are selected for further testing and data dimensionality reduction. Two approaches for feature selection based on feature importance and final classification scores are tested, achieving a classification mean accuracy of 93 percent with a real testing dataset that included three driving scenarios and eight different drivers. The obtained results and high classification accuracy represent a first approach for the further development of such classification systems and the potential for direct implementation into autonomous driving technology.

AB Unmanned autonomous vehicles for various civilian and military applications have become a particularly interesting research area. Despite their many potential applications, a related technological challenge is realizing realistic coordinated autonomous control and decision making in complex and multi-agent environments. Machine learning approaches have been largely employed in simplified simulations to acquire intelligent control systems in multi-agent settings. However, the complexity of the physical environment, unrealistic assumptions, and lack of abstract physical environments derail the process of transition from simulation to real systems. This work presents a modular framework for automated data acquisition, training, and the evaluation of multiple unmanned surface vehicles controllers that facilitate prior knowledge integration and human-guided learning in a closed-loop. To realize this, we first present a digital maritime environment of multiple unmanned surface vehicles that abstracts the real-world dynamics in our application domain. Then, a behavior-driven artificial immune-inspired fuzzy classifier systems approach that is capable of optimizing agents' behaviors and action selection in a multi-agent environment is presented. Evaluation scenarios of different combat missions are presented to demonstrate the performance of the system. Simulation results show that the resulting controllers can achieved an average wining rate between 52% and 98% in all test cases, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its feasibility in realizing adaptive controllers for efficient multiple unmanned systems' cooperative decision making. We believe that this system can facilitate the simulation, data acquisition, training, and evaluation of practical cooperative unmanned vehicles' controllers in a closed-loop.

ID SELECTION
AB Contemporary advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) features for semi-autonomous vehicles include braking assistance during collision avoidance. Although precollision detection typically relies on sensing systems to enable production vehicles to perceive oncoming road obstacles, the physiological state of the driver is not measured to predict emergency braking. On the other hand, previous driving simulation experiments have demonstrated the ability of regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) to predict precollision braking using brain signals from multiple electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes. In contrast, the current study used EEG data from these previous experiments to determine the quality of support vector machine (SVM) predictions as a first step toward realizing a brain-computer interface (BCI) for emergency braking. Power spectral density (PSD) features were extracted from the EEG of one electrode to train and evaluate an SVM. Through a novel data ablation analysis, the optimal number of PSD components was determined to optimize model classification quality measured by the area under the curve (AUC). A comparison of the proposed model to the previous RLDA and other machine learning (ML) methods indicated that the SVM had a superior AUC. Thus, the proposed model is a candidate for assisting ADASs with precollision detection. Moreover, since the proposed model only utilized one electrode, our study potentially contributes to the facilitation of BCIs for autonomous vehicles.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) can be programmed to act cooperatively. Previous research on cooperative and autonomous vehicles (CAV) suggests they can substantially improve traffic system operations in terms of mobility and safety. However, these studies do not explicitly take each vehicle's potential gain/loss into consideration and ignore their individual levels of willingness to cooperate. They do not account for ethics and fairness either. In this study, several cooperation/courtesy strategies are proposed to address the above issues. These strategies are grouped into two categories based on non-instrumental and instrumental principles. Non-instrumental strategies make courtesy/cooperation decisions based on some courtesy proxies and a user-specified courtesy level, while instrumental strategies are based only on courtesy proxies related to local traffic performance. Also, a new CAV behavior modeling framework is proposed based on our previous work on cooperative car-following and merging (CCM) control. With such a framework, the proposed courtesy strategies can be easily implemented. The proposed framework and courtesy strategies are coded in SUMO microscopic traffic simulator. They are evaluated considering different levels of traffic demand on a freeway corridor consisting of a work zone and three weaving areas of different types. Interesting findings are drawn from the simulation results, one of which is that the instrumental Local Utilitarianism strategy performs the best in terms of mobility, safety, and fairness. In the future, auction-based strategies can be considered to model how CAV make decisions.

AB The precise measuring of vehicle location has been a critical task in enhancing the autonomous driving in terms of intelligent decision making and safe transportation. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an important infrastructure in support of autonomous driving, allowing real-time road information exchanging and sharing for localizing vehicles. Global positioning System (GPS) is widely used in the traditional IoV system. GPS is unable to meet the key application requirements of autonomous driving due to meter level error and signal deterioration. In this article, we propose a novel solution, named Semi-Direct Monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry using Point and Line Features (SDMPL-VIO) for precise vehicle localization. Our SDMPL-VIO model takes advantage of a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and monocular camera, using them as the sensor to acquire the surrounding environmental information. Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), taking into account both point and line features, is proposed, which is able to deal with both weak texture and dynamic environment. We use a semi-direct method to deal with keyframes and non-keyframes, respectively. Dual sliding window mechanisms can effectively fuse point-line and IMU information. To evaluate our SDMPL-VIO system model, we conduct extensive experiments on both an indoor dataset (i.e., EuRoC) and an outdoor dataset (i.e., KITTI) from the real-world applications, respectively. The experimental results show that the accuracy of SDMPL-VIO proposed by us is better than the mainstream VIO system at present. Especially in the weak texture of the datasets, fast-moving datasets, and other challenging datasets, SDMPL-VIO has a relatively high robustness.

AB Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research has focused on public acceptance of and intention to use AVs, with trust emerging as important to these variables. Research on AV trust has centered on trust in vehicle performance. However, trust evaluation may include AV manufacturers and developers, and regulation pertaining to AVs; thus, we expand our measurement of trust to include beliefs based on manufacturers and regulation. In this experiment, we manipulate information regarding manufacturer focus (i.e., an emphasis on standards, regulations, and research (SRR) versus speed to market) to determine its effect on trust. When information focused on SRR, we found higher levels of trust in AV performance and in manufacturers, compared to when it focused on speed to market. In addition, information regarding passenger control (i.e., the ability to take over for the vehicle and to determine privacy settings) was manipulated to yield either high or low passenger control conditions. Behavioral Intention (BI) to use AVs was lowest when speed to market was emphasized and when passenger control was low. Furthermore, trust was tested as a mediator between perceived risk and BI. Trust in AV performance partially mediated the relationship between perceived AV performance risk and BI. In addition, trust in AV regulation partially mediated the relationship between AV privacy/security risk and BI. Researchers should continue to examine trust beyond the AV itself to encompass trust in manufacturers and regulations. Those designing and marketing AVs should carefully consider decisions that influence manufacturer/developer reputation and passenger control due to their effect on intention to use AVs.

AB A two-layer model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with curvature adaptive is introduced and adopted in path tracking, especially for high-speed autonomous driving. Whether the vehicle can stably reach a safe driving speed in advance is the main consideration of rollover and speed-overshoot avoidance, especially when the trajectory with large curvatures. Thus, the outer layer of the proposed controller, which is built based on the vehicle kinematic model, generates an optimal vehicle velocity. And, the inner layer controller that is established according to the vehicle dynamics provides an optimal front wheel angle obtained combined with the optimal tracking trajectory generated by the path planner. The cross-track error, which is considered an important judging criterion of tracking and obstacle avoidance, is chosen here to validate the control performance. With the MATLAB/Simulink-Carmaker platform for modeling, the two-layer MPC has good performance in a continuous curve, simple obstacle avoidance, and complex obstacle avoidance scenarios. Notably, when the average driving speed reaches 108km/h, the cross-track error can be controlled within 0.21m when employing the proposed MPC method. In contrast, the conventional MPC method yields a cross-track error exceeding 3.4m, while an LQR-based strategy results in a maximum error of 0.64m. The proposed two-layer MPC algorithm with curvature adaptivity significantly enhances path-tracking performance, particularly for high-speed autonomous driving. By effectively controlling the cross-track error and considering various driving scenarios, it successfully ensures safe and stable driving speeds, thereby mitigating the risks associated with rollover and speed overshoot.

AB This paper addresses the problem of robust bottom following control for a flight-style autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subject to system uncertainties, actuator dynamics, and input saturation. First, the actuator dynamics that is approximated by a first-order differential equation is inserted into the AUV dynamics model, which renders a high-order nonlinear dynamics analysis and design in the model-based backstepping controller by utilizing guidance errors. Second, to overcome the shaking control behavior resulted by the model-based high-order derivative calculation, a fuzzy approximator-based model-free controller is proposed, in order to online approximate the unknown part of the ideal backstepping architecture. In addition, the adaptive error estimation technology is resorted to compensate the system approximation error, ensuring that all the position and orientation errors of robust bottom following control tend to zero. Third, to further tackle the potential unstable control behavior from inherent saturation of control surfaces driven by rudders, an additional adaptive fuzzy compensator is introduced, in order to compensate control truncation between the unsaturated and saturation inputs. Subsequently, Lyapunov theory and Barbalat lemma are adopted to synthesize asymptotic stability of the entire bottom following control system. Finally, comparative numerical simulations with different controllers, environmental disturbances and initial states are provided to illustrate adaptability and robustness of the proposed bottom following controller for a flight-style AUV with saturated actuator dynamics.

AB This article investigates the distributed affine formation maneuver control for collaborative autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) systems with the event-triggered data transmission mechanism among inter-ASVs. To achieve preset arbitrary configuration transformations in the case where the formation knowledge is assigned to only a part of ASVs, the affine image is employed to describe desired configurations. To ensure position and attitude configuration rigidities simultaneously, a synthetical constraint composed of the Laplacian matrices and the stress matrices is constructed. Besides, an algebraic relation between the synthetical constraint and the formation tracking error is established. The above tools enable the sliding mode technology to be used to the affine formation maneuver control of collaborative ASVs systems. It follows that a novel distributed event-triggered affine formation maneuver control scheme is developed for the collaborative ASVs systems. The advantages of the proposed control scheme are threefold: 1) the distributed affine formation maneuver control of collaborative second-order vehicles systems is achieved with changeable formation velocities and orientations; 2) the existing literatures adapt to developing the second-order distributed affine formation maneuver control based on the backstepping philosophy. In contrast, the sliding manifold replaces the backstepping philosophy here. Since the complexity explosion is circumvented, the proposed control scheme is relatively simple; and 3) the event-triggered data transmission mechanism among inter-ASVs is introduced, and neighbor velocities and accelerations are omitted for the control implementation. As a consequence, the communication resource usage can be reduced. Finally, the semi-physical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

TI Point Cloud Compression: Impact on Object Detection in Outdoor Contexts

AB Increasing demand for more reliable and safe autonomous driving means that data involved in the various aspects of perception, such as object detection, will become more granular as the number and resolution of sensors progress. Using these data for on-the-fly object detection causes problems related to the computational complexity of onboard processing in autonomous vehicles, leading to a desire to offload computation to roadside infrastructure using vehicle-to-infrastructure communication links. The need to transmit sensor data also arises in the context of vehicle fleets exchanging sensor data, over vehicle-to-vehicle communication links. Some types of sensor data modalities, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, are so voluminous that their transmission is impractical without data compression. With most emerging autonomous driving implementations being anchored on point cloud data, we propose to evaluate the impact of point cloud compression on object detection. To that end, two different object detection architectures are evaluated using point clouds from the KITTI object dataset: raw point clouds and point clouds compressed with a state-of-the-art encoder and three different compression levels. The analysis is extended to the impact of compression on depth maps generated from images projected from the point clouds, with two conversion methods tested. Results show that low-to-medium levels of compression do not have a major impact on object detection performance, especially for larger objects. Results also show that the impact of point cloud compression is lower when detecting objects using depth maps, placing this particular method of point cloud data representation on a competitive footing compared to raw point cloud data.

To infer knowledge from sensors' measurements, while drawing on a priori knowledge about the vehicle's dynamics, modern approaches solve an optimization problem to compute the most likely trajectory given all past observations, an approach known as smoothing. Improving smoothing solvers is an active field of research in the SLAM community. Most work is focused on reducing computation load by inverting the involved linear system while preserving its sparsity. This article raises an issue that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been addressed yet: standard smoothing solvers require explicitly using the inverse of sensor noise covariance matrices. This means the parameters that reflect the noise magnitude must be sufficiently large for the smoother to properly function. When matrices are close to singular, which is the case when using high-precision modern inertial measurement units (IMUs), numerical issues necessarily arise, especially with 32-bit implementation demanded by most industrial aerospace applications. We discuss these issues and propose a solution that builds upon the Kalman filter to improve smoothing algorithms. We then leverage the results to devise a localization algorithm based on the fusion of IMU and vision sensors. Successful real experiments using an actual car equipped with a tactical grade high-performance IMU and a LiDAR illustrate the relevance of the approach to the field of autonomous vehicles.

AB Time delay is an inevitably negative factor to real-time vehicle control. This paper investigates cooperative spacing control of vehicle platoons with input delays under no communication between vehicles (including the lead vehicle). The spacing control strategy is based solely on self information and onboard measurement of the immediate neighbor vehicles (preceding and succeeding vehicles). Considering the delay constraints, sufficient stability conditions are derived for the vehicle system with input delays. To avoid transient spacing errors to amplify along the string of vehicles, we give conditions that guarantee string stability of the vehicular platoon, by which the upper bound of tolerable delays are derived in terms of controller parameters and the model parameters. An algorithm is then given to determine the controller parameters using the stability and string stability conditions simultaneously. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed control methodology.

AB In the autonomous driving process, the decision-making system is mainly used to provide macro-control instructions based on the information captured by the sensing system. Learning-based algorithms have apparent advantages in information processing and understanding for an increasingly complex driving environment. To incorporate the interactive information between agents in the environment into the decision-making process, this paper proposes a generalized single-vehicle-based graph neural network reinforcement learning algorithm (SGRL algorithm). The SGRL algorithm introduces graph convolution into the traditional deep neural network (DQN) algorithm, adopts the training method for a single agent, designs a more explicit incentive reward function, and significantly improves the dimension of the action space. The SGRL algorithm is compared with the traditional DQN algorithm (NGRL) and the multi-agent training algorithm (MGRL) in the highway ramp scenario. Results show that the SGRL algorithm has outstanding advantages in network convergence, decision-making effect, and training efficiency.

AB Autonomous connected vehicles (ACVs) rely on intra-vehicle sensors such as camera and radar as well as inter-vehicle communication to operate effectively which exposes them to cyber and physical attacks in which an adversary can manipulate sensor readings and physically control the ACVs. In this paper, a comprehensive control and learning framework is proposed to thwart cyber and physical attacks on ACV networks. First, an optimal safe controller for ACVs is derived to maximize the street traffic flow while minimizing the risk of accidents by optimizing the ACV speed and inter-ACV spacing. It is proven that the proposed controller is robust to physical attacks which aim at making ACV systems unstable. Next, two data injection attack (DIA) detection approaches are proposed to address cyber attacks on sensors and their physical impact on the ACV system. The proposed approaches rely on leveraging the stochastic behavior of the sensor readings and on the use of a multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm. It is shown that, collectively, the proposed DIA detection approaches minimize the vulnerability of ACV sensors against cyber attacks while maximizing the ACV system's physical robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal safe controller outperforms the current state of the art controllers by maximizing the robustness of ACVs to physical attacks. The results also show that the proposed DIA detection approaches, compared to Kalman filtering, can improve the security of ACV sensors against cyber attacks and ultimately improve the physical robustness of an ACV system.

AB The idle computing resources of parked vehicles could be utilized to improve performance by assisting task executions in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. As a result, the owner of a vehicle could be compensated, resulting in a win-win situation. A dynamic pricing strategy is proposed to minimize the average cost of the MEC system under the constraints on quality of service by adjusting the price constantly based on the current system state. To do so, a cost minimization problem is solved to obtain the optimal dynamic pricing strategy efficiently. Finally, the optimization results are validated with extensive simulations.

AB We estimated travel demand models that incorporate a private autonomous vehicle (AV) option using revealed preference data in which personal chauffeurs simulated a personally owned AV. We investigated four components of activity-based models (ABM): activity pattern and primary destination choice, mode choice, and time of day. We compared the chauffeur week models ("AV future") to the non-chauffeur week models (current conditions). We found no statistically significant differences in parameters of the individual activity pattern, time of day, or destination choice. For mode choice, however, while the auto constant did not change, the mean value of time decreased 60%. As the destination choice model included the mode choice logsum, this results in longer average tour lengths. Moreover, while the trip-making propensity of individuals did not change significantly, there was a 25% increase in systemwide trips due "AVs" (chauffeurs) being sent on errands. This points to the importance of incorporating zero-occupancy vehicle (ZOV) trips into the ABM framework. Our findings suggest that these can be incorporated via the standard ABM development process by adding as additional model components ZOV home-based tours and ZOV subtours. Relatedly, as inter-regional travel is modeled outside the ABM framework, our results indicated that modifications should be made to account for the increase in interregional tours, which were 54% more frequent during chauffeur weeks. While these results are from a relatively small sample of 71 individuals, they are the first such travel demand estimation results available from a field experiment, and further studies can build on our framework.

AB The controllability and maneuverability of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in practical applications need to be properly validated and assessed before the prototype is finalized for manufacturing. With regard to mathematical system model of the AUV, hydrodynamic coefficients have a dominant effect on the quality of vehicle pre-testing and evaluation, which is crucial to be estimated with adequate accuracy to curb the uncertainty from modeling simplifications. The standard time domain discrete Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithms are two promising numerical approximation approaches for hydrodynamic identification technique with favourable computational complexity and acceptable estimation precision. In this paper, a study with respect to time domain discrete optimized UKF (OUKF) algorithm based on recursive tuning rule and update gradient descent lemma for a typical prototype known as NPS AUV II will be proposed to enhance adaptability and prediction performance of the identification approach with appropriate verification. In addition, Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) noisy model needs to be included into three Kalman Filter (KF) algorithms to further improve the estimation precision and perturbations inhibiting performance. Pre-processing numerical model validation and non-dimensional viscous linear damping coefficient identification based on three KF algorithms will be implemented respectively to provide an assistant pre-assessment for the vehicle. In accordance with comparable outputs and estimation-experiment errors, the OUKF identification algorithm is certified to be more precise and superior compared with EKF and UKF approaches in the presence of ARMA noisy model.

AB Efficient path tracking control for autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs) is the key technology for realizing agriculture 4.0 and precision agriculture, which makes smart farms more sustainable, profitable, and eco-friendly. It is well recognized that model nonlinearity, unknown disturbances, and wheel slipping are common problems in practical AAV systems in operation. To tackle these issues and improve the path tracking performance, a novel fixed-time generalized super-twisting control scheme is proposed for AAVs in this paper. First, a fixed-time integral sliding mode surface is designed for the considered vehicle by fusing the lateral offset and heading offset together. Then, an innovative auxiliary system dynamics is constructed to collaborate with the foregoing sliding mode surface, compensating for the adverse effects of wheel slipping effectively. Subsequently, based on the kinematic offset model of AAVs, a new type of generalized super-twisting controller is designed to achieve superior path tracking with robustness. Unlike existing super-twisting controllers, the generalized super-twisting continuous controller can fully eliminate chattering by replacing the previous discontinuous terms with a nonsmooth term. Further, rigorous theoretical analysis is conducted by raising a fresh Lyapunov function to verify the closed-loop control system stability. Finally, extensive field experiments have been carried out to show that the proposed control scheme significantly outperforms typical comparative control schemes.

AB Lane change intention prediction is an essential component for motion planning of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). In this work, we aim to achieve this task by using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. One critical challenge on this task is that the dataset used for training such a network is usually highly imbalanced due to the fact that the size of left/right lane change data is much smaller than that of the lane keeping data. The imbalanced dateset would lead to trivial output of LSTM model. To deal with this problem, we propose a hierarchical over-sampling bagging method based on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). With the proposed method, more diverse and informative instances of minority classes can be generated for training LSTM model. Furthermore, we also propose a sampling technique to keep the temporal information and make the proposed method applicable to sequential data. Moreover, to further improve the prediction performance, we also take the interactions between neighboring vehicles into account by concatenating their trajectories when constructing features. We evaluate our method against several baseline algorithms over two benchmark datasets and the empirical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in terms of the indexes of prediction time, F1, and G-mean.

AB The spatio-temporal imbalance of parking demand and supply results in unwanted on-street cruising-for-parking traffic of conventional vehicles. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can selfrelocate to alleviate the shortage of parking supplies at the trip destinations. The extra floating trips of vacant AVs have adverse impacts on traffic congestion and the parking demand-supply imbalance may still exist when they are not distributed optimally. This paper presents a centralized parking dispatch approach to optimize the distribution of floating AVs and provide regional route guidance. We apply the concept of macroscopic fundamental diagram to represent the evolution of traffic conditions, cruising-for-parking, and dispatched AVs in a congested multiregion network. A model predictive control is suggested to optimize the control inputs. Numerical experiments in a four-region network demonstrate that the proposed parking dispatch and regional route guidance of AVs are effective in reducing intense cruising-for-parking traffic, and the integration of both has the best control performance by regulating the network towards under-saturated conditions. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated via simulations with noise in measurement errors and compliance rate prediction. Results show substantial improvements in terms of total time spent, even for low levels of AV market penetration or AV compliance rate to parking dispatch and route guidance.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives, but legal and social barriers may delay or even deter manufacturers from offering fully automated vehicles and thereby cost lives that otherwise could be saved. Moral philosophers use "thought experiments" to teach us about what ethics might say about the ethical behavior of AVs. If a manufacturer designing an AV decided to make what it believes is an ethical choice to save a large group of lives by steering away from the large group towards a single individual, could the manufacturer be liable to that single individual? I believe the answer is yes. This article discusses famous "trolley problem" thought experiments in moral philosophy, which news articles have recently applied to AVs. After establishing a hypothetical case, applying product liability law to AV behavior may show a way, in some jurisdictions, that will permit a manufacturer to implement an ethical choice without triggering liability, but liability risk remains. I then turn to possible traditional defenses to see if they prevent liability for a manufacturer making what it believes is an ethical design choice-necessity, defense of self, and the sudden emergency doctrine. None of them provides an effective defense. Under current law, maximizing collision avoidance appears to minimize legal risk. I conclude that the only way to provide effective protection to a manufacturer seeking to implement ethical choices about AV behavior is through special legislation or regulation.

AB Differing forms of self-operating transportation are already among us and some have been in operation now for an extended period of time. From elevators and escalators to airport transit trams, we already use many fully automatic systems. Now such technologies are very publicly and prominently penetrating into the on-road environment of everyday personal vehicle usage. The present article raises and addresses a number of the specific and more general human factors/ergonomic issues associated with such an evolutionary step. One particular concern is that of identified responsibility when such systems fail to perform flawlessly. The ways in which this (r)evolution will impact the social and cultural fabric of affected societies is also considered. Further observations as to the vector of the future characteristics of these vehicular forms and how they and other autonomous systems will affect our world are examined. The very future of the human experience depends upon the ways in which such systems are designed, enacted and integrated into everyday life and these are fundamentally ergonomic endeavours.Practitioner's Summary: The prominence of practitioners working on advanced human-machine systems will increase with public concerns surrounding self-driving vehicles. Driverless cars are not only a technological step but they will also exert widespread effects throughout society. Practitioners should prepare for these broad socio-technical challenges in an evolving, autonomous world.

ID MODEL
AB In the process of constructing the driver's lane-changing model, in addition to the dynamic states of the surrounding vehicles affecting the driver's lane-changing decision, various traffic environment factors and the driver's own personality also affect the driver's lane-changing probability. At the same time, these influencing factors also make the lane changing process ambiguous and uncertain. To address these issues, in this study the membership function of soft set is applied to quantify the impact of some typical ambiguous factors and relationships, such as weather conditions, driver personality, and vehicle type, on the driver's driving process. The mapping relationships between these influencing factors and the driver's expected speed and aggression are obtained through decision rules. Then a new lane changing model considering uncertain or ambiguous factors and relationships is proposed. On the basis of this model, simulation experiments of mixed traffic flow under the conditions of 0%, 20%, 40% and 60% penetration rate of autonomous vehicles were carried out. The experimental results reasonably present the impact of autonomous vehicle penetration and some ambiguity on the lance change behavior. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Railways are facing a serious problem of road vehicle-train collisions at unmanned railway level crossings. The purpose of the study is the development of a safe stopping sight distance and sight distance from road to rail track model with appropriate computation and analysis. The scope of the study lies in avoiding road vehicle-train collisions at unmanned railway level crossings. An intelligent and autonomous framework is being developed using supervised machine learning regression algorithms. Further, a sight distance from road to rail track model is being developed for road vehicles of 0.5 to 10 m length using the observed geometric characteristics of the route. The model prediction accuracy obtained better results in the development of a stopping sight distance model in comparison to other intelligent algorithms. The developed model suggested an increment of approximately 23% in the current safe stopping sight distance on all unmanned railway level crossings. Further, the feature analysis indicates the 'approach road gradient' to be the major contributing parameter for safe stopping sight distance determination. The accident prediction study finally indicates that, as the safe stopping sight distance is increased by following the developed model, it is predicted to decrease road vehicle-train collisions.

AB Usually, image-and radar-based data are used to perform environmental characteristics related tasks in autonomous cars, while the use of valuable sensor data from the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus has been limited. The vehicle's CAN bus data consist of multivariate time series data, such as velocity, RPM, and acceleration, which contain meaningful information about the vehicle dynamics and environmental characteristics. The ability to use these data to sense the environment, along with the sight sense (from image-based data), can prevent a single point of failure when image-or radar-based data are missing or incomplete, and contribute to increased understanding of the vehicle's environment. Moreover, a solution that does not rely on image-or radar-based data also addresses concerns about privacy and the use of location-based data. We present DeepCAN, a novel hybrid method for road type classification that utilizes solely vehicle dynamics data and combines two main approaches for time series classification. In the end-to-end approach, a long short-term memory autoencoder (LSTM AE) is trained, and the learned embedding serves as the input to a fully convolutional network autoencoder (FCN AE), while the feature-based approach utilizes an XGBoost classifier with aggregated time series feature representation. In our comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets, we assessed the performance of each model component as an independent solution, as well as a model integrating all of the components in a hybrid solution. The results demonstrate DeepCAN's efficiency and accuracy and provide a solid basis for its future use by the automobile industry.

DE Autonomous vehicle routing; System optimal assignment; Mixed

ID BEHAVIORS
AB We envisage a transportation management center (TMC) for future autonomous vehicles that distributes the traffic over a cycle comprising many days in such a manner that the average travel time (AVT) of vehicles of the same origin-destination (OD) over the cycle is identical at equilibrium while the entire network achieves system optimal (SO) flows every day. Vehicles are assigned to a set of paths, with different proportions of time within the cycle on different paths, but with the same AVT over the cycle at equilibrium. Since AVT is the same for each user, it is inherently fair to every-one. Thus, not only do users gain by subscribing to this system but the overall system also, as SO flows are followed each day. We then model the case of mixed equilibrium (ME), wherein drivers are given the option to subscribe to the TMC path combinations and hence assist in achieving SO, while non-subscribers only minimize their own private costs and follow their user equilibrium (UE) paths, which typically have shorter times than the corresponding AVT. To counter this, a tolling scheme is imposed on non-subscribers, i.e., UE users, based on their value-of-time (VOT) distribution and the travel time difference between subscribers' AVT and non-subscribers' UE time at ME. In the end, the total cost of travel of nonsubscribers, toll plus UE time, is equal to the corresponding AVT of subscribers. The efficiency of this system is shown through numerical studies. Finally, the impact of market penetration and different VOT distributions on AVT and toll are investigated through sensitivity analysis.

AB A current-aided inertial navigation framework is proposed for small autonomous underwater vehicles in long-duration operations (>1 h), where neither frequent surfacing nor consistent bottom tracking is available. We instantiate this concept through mid-depth underwater navigation. This strategy mitigates dead-reckoning uncertainty of a traditional inertial navigation system by comparing the estimate of local ambient flow velocity with preloaded ocean current maps. The proposed navigation system is implemented through a marginalized particle filter where the vehicle's states are sequentially tracked along with sensor bias and local turbulence that is not resolved by general flow prediction. The performance of the proposed approach is first analyzed through Monte Carlo simulations in two artificial background flow fields, resembling real-world ocean circulation patterns, superposed with smaller scale turbulent components with Kolmogorov energy spectrum. The current-aided navigation scheme significantly improves the dead-reckoning performance of the vehicle even when unresolved small-scale flow perturbations are present. For a 6-h navigation with an automotive-grade inertial navigation system, the current-aided navigation scheme results in positioning estimates with under 3% uncertainty per distance traveled (UDT) in a turbulent double-gyre flow field, and under 7.3% UDT in a turbulent meandering jet flow field. Further evaluation with field test data and actual ocean simulation analysis demonstrates consistent performance for a 6-h mission, positioning result with under 25% UDT for a 24-h navigation when provided direct heading measurements, and terminal positioning estimate with 16% UDT at the cost of increased uncertainty at an early stage of the navigation.

AB This study mainly investigates the maximum length of CAV (Connected and Autonomous Vehicle) platoons in a heterogeneous traffic flow environment. By employing MATLAB to simulate the heterogeneous traffic flow on expressways, this study focuses on the maximum platoon length of CAV platoons and explores their impact on the traffic flow characteristics on expressways. Firstly, based on four different car-following modes of heterogeneous traffic flow, F-STCA (Flexible-Symmetric Two-Lane Cellular Automata Model) and the symmetric lane-changing strategy, the study refines and improves the construction of the NaSch (Nagel and Schreckenberg) model introduced into the Gipps safety distance formula. The whole improvement process is based on the acceleration decay characteristics of vehicles on expressway. Secondly, the congestion situations under different maximum platoon lengths are compared using fundamental heat maps of the simulation data. The evolution of the fundamental diagram with changes in maximum platoon length is studied to investigate the impact and magnitude of maximum platoon lengths on the road capacity under different CAV permeabilities. Finally, the study explores the stability and safety of heterogeneous traffic flow involving CAV platoons using SD (Standard Deviation) and TERCRI (Time-Exposed Rear-End Collision Risk Index). The results show that when the CAV's permeability does not reach a high level on heavily trafficked sections of the expressway, considering the overall average speed, the maximum platoon length should not be set too long and should be around five vehicles. This restriction does not apply when the CAV permeability approaches 100%.

   IMPACTS
AB When traffic congestion occurs on freeway off-ramp bottlenecks, the traffic state becomes complicated and changeable, which leads to increased vehicle travel time and decreased traffic safety and traffic efficiency. Variable speed limit (VSL) control is an effective method to improve traffic conditions, increase bottleneck throughput, improve traffic efficiency, and reduce emissions. Currently, there is an emerging trend of using connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology to develop VSL control. This paper proposes an optimal differential variable speed limit (DVSL) control strategy under mixed CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) environment for freeway off-ramp bottlenecks. The proposed DVSL control considers the characteristics of on-ramp, off-ramp, and mixed traffic flow (i.e., CAVs coexist with HVs). The proposed optimal DVSL control can describe and forecast the dynamics of traffic flow, and can set different speed limits across each lane with a multiple-objective function of total travel time (TTT) and total travel distance (TTD). A model predictive control (MPC) approach was utilized to optimize the DVSL control algorithm. The designed DVSL control was tested on a real-word freeway section with a simulated off-ramp bottleneck. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy outperforms other existing methods in terms of improving the mobility of a freeway off-ramp bottleneck and maximizing the environmental benefits. Sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed control strategy can improve performance with the increase of the penetration rate (PR) of CAVs. The proposed methods form the basis of VSL control at off-ramp sections under mixed traffic environment.

AB An efficient position based visual sevroing control approach for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) by employing Non-linear Model Predictive Control (N-MPC) is designed and presented in this work. In the proposed scheme, a mechanism is incorporated within the vision-based controller that determines when the Visual Tracking Algorithm (VTA) should be activated and new control inputs should be calculated. More specifically, the control loop does not close periodically, i.e., between two consecutive activations (triggering instants), the control inputs calculated by the N-MPC at the previous triggering time instant are applied to the underwater robot in an open-loop mode. This results in a significantly smaller number of requested measurements from the vision tracking algorithm, as well as less frequent computations of the non-linear predictive control law. This results in a reduction in processing time as well as energy consumption and, therefore, increases the accuracy and autonomy of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. The latter is of paramount importance for persistent underwater inspection tasks. Moreover, the Field of View constraints (FoV), control input saturation, the kinematic limitations due to the underactuated degree of freedom in sway direction, and the effect of the model uncertainties as well as external disturbances have been considered during the control design. In addition, the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system has been guaranteed analytically. Finally, the efficiency and performance of the proposed vision-based control framework is demonstrated through a comparative real-time experimental study while using a small underwater vehicle.

AB Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are unmanned transport vehicles widely used in the industrial sector to substitute manned industrial trucks and conveyors. In order to guarantee safe operation, AGVs must be equipped with a safety system to stop their movement in presence of obstacles or humans in their path. This work presents a novel safety system for AGVs that is based on Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology. Unlike previous works based on UWB Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS), the proposed safety system does not require installing hardware on the plant's infrastructure. Instead, the AGV is equipped with sensors capable of locating the tag of a person or a mobile asset. This simplifies deployment of the solution and enables its use in dynamic environments. The proposed safety system was mounted in an AGV designed by the company ASTI Mobile Robotics. Dynamic measurements showed that the proposed safety system accurately mirrors the relative movement between the AGV and tag. Furthermore, the proposed safety system employs a novel method for post-processing ranging data. Measurements showed that this method improves the accuracy of the system, resulting in a more homogeneously distributed positioning error around a room.

AB Information-aware connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have drawn great attention in recent years due to their potentially significant positive impacts on roadway safety and operational efficiency. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth review of three basic and key interrelated aspects of a CAV: sensing and communication technologies; human factors; and information-aware controller design. First, the different vehicular sensing and communication technologies and their protocol stacks, to provide reliable information to the information-aware CAV controller, are thoroughly discussed. Diverse human factors, such as user comfort, preferences, and reliability, to design the CAV systems for mass adaptation are also discussed. Then, the different layers of a CAV controller (route planning, driving mode execution, and driving model selection) considering human factors and information through connectivity are reviewed. In addition, the critical challenges for the sensing and communication technologies, human factors, and information-aware controller are identified to support the design of a safe and efficient CAV system while considering user acceptance and comfort. Finally, the promising future research directions of these three aspects are discussed to overcome existing challenges to realize a safe and operationally efficient CAV.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer new technologies that could revolutionize travel, such as greater link capacity and innovative intersection controls. One such traveler behavior is the potential for empty repositioning trips, in which a vehicle travels without any passengers. Repositioning trips could allow travelers to avoid parking costs or make their vehicle available to other household members. However, empty repositioning trips increase the demand for personal vehicle travel. A previous study using static traffic assignment on hometo- work trips showed that repositioning trips still resulted in a net increase in congestion even when link capacity improvements for AVs were modeled. This raises the question of whether empty repositioning trips should be permitted. However, a key characteristic of repositioning trips is that they depart after the traveler has been dropped off. This could reduce the concentration of demand at any point in time. By using dynamic traffic assignment with a more realistic model of link flow on the downtown Austin network, we showed that when repositioning trips encourage travelers to switch to AVs, the resulting improvement from those AVs could decrease congestion. Furthermore, even if all vehicles are AVs, the congestion resulting from empty repositioning is still less than current conditions. Therefore, allowing empty repositioning trips could be beneficial for the traffic network. (c) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB With a single stochastic extremum seeking control signal, we steer multiple autonomous vehicles, modeled as nonholonomic unicycles, toward the maximum of an unknown, spatially distributed signal field. The vehicles, whose angular velocities are constant and distinct, travel at the same forward velocity, which is controlled by the stochastic extremum seeking controller. To determine the vehicles' velocity, the controller uses measurements of the signal field at the respective vehicle positions and excitation based on filtered white noise. The positions of the vehicles are not measured. We prove local exponential convergence, both almost surely and in probability, to a small neighborhood near the source and provide a numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

SO CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE

AB Control design for an autonomous wheel loader requires a high-fidelity and low-order dynamics model. The objective of order reduction is to decrease the number of states in the model while maintaining performance comparable to the original model. Of all the power components in a wheel loader, the model order reduction for steering and working hydraulic systems is most demanding due to its nonlinear and stiff dynamical nature. This paper describes a physics-inspired model order reduction method that can reduce the model order by close to thirty percent. It is achieved by discarding orders with fast dynamics and consolidating multiple states into less new states. This method can also be extended to other types of off-road vehicles such as excavators, bulldozers, etc. Simulation results demonstrate that the reduced-order model exhibits very similar performance to the full-order model under typical operating conditions of wheel loaders, with an output error of less than six percent.

AB The unmanned operation of agriculture machinery in the full field of farmland is an important part of unmanned farm and smart agriculture. Although the autonomous navigation for agriculture robot has been widely studied in literature, research on the full-field path tracking problem of agriculture machinery is rare. In this paper, in order to enhance the adaptivity of path tracking algorithm, an improved fuzzy Stanley model (SM) is proposed based on particle swarm optimization (PSO), where the control gain is modified adaptively according to the tracking error, velocity and steering actuator saturation. The PSO-enhanced fuzzy SM (PSO-FSM) is verified by experiments on numerical simulation and self-driving of mobile vehicle. Simulation results indicate that the PSO-FSM achieves a better result than SM and FSM, where PSO-FSM changes the control gain adaptively under different velocities and actuator saturation conditions, and the maximum lateral errors of SM and PSO-FSM for mobile vehicle autonomous turning are 0. 32 m and 0.03 m, respectively. When the location of the mobile vehicle deviates from the expected path at 4 m in a lateral direction, the distance of the guided trajectory for the mobile vehicle to reach the expected path is no more than 5 m. A preliminary experiment is also carried out for a wheeled combine harvester working on slippery soil, and the result indicates that the maximum lateral tracking error of PSO-FSM is 0.63 m, which is acceptable for the path tracking of a combine harvester with a large operation width.

AB A common approach used for planning blind intersection crossings is to assume that hypothetical vehicles are approaching the intersection at a constant speed from the occluded areas. Such an assumption can result in a deadlock problem, causing the ego vehicle to remain stopped at an intersection indefinitely due to insufficient visibility. To solve this problem and facilitate safe, deadlock-free intersection crossing, we propose a blind intersection planner that utilizes both the ego vehicle and the approaching vehicle's visibility. The planner uses a particle filter and our proposed visibility-dependent behavior model of approaching vehicles for predicting hidden vehicles. The behavior model is designed based on an analysis of actual driving data from multiple drivers crossing blind intersections. The proposed planner was tested in a simulation and found to be effective for allowing deadlock-free crossings at intersections where a baseline planner became stuck in a deadlock. The effects of perception accuracy and sensor position on output motion were also investigated. It was found that the proposed planner delayed crossing motion when the perception was imperfect. Furthermore, our results showed that the planner decelerated less while crossing the intersection with the front-mounted sensor configuration compared to the roof-mounted configuration due to the improved visibility. The minimum speed difference between the two sensor configurations was 1.82 m/s at an intersection with relatively poor visibility and 1.50 m/s at an intersection with good visibility.

This study uses tomographic techniques to extend the survey area covered by moving vehicles. An acoustic reciprocal transmission experiment was conducted using three tomographic sensors installed on an autonomous underwater vehicle, a fishing ship, and a buoy. The distributed sensing method is applied for currents estimation. The estimated currents near the ship show consistent results with the direct measurements. In particular, an anticyclonic circulation was revealed. Further, a general least-squares method is employed to improve the estimate of this vortical structure.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) could reduce emissions, increase road safety, and enhance ride comfort. Multiple CAVs can form a CAV platoon with a close inter-vehicle distance, which can further improve energy efficiency, save space, and reduce travel time. To date, there have been few detailed studies of self-driving algorithms for CAV platoons in urban areas. In this paper, we therefore propose a self-driving architecture combining the sensing, planning, and control for CAV platoons in an end-to-end fashion. Our multi-task model can switch between two tasks to drive either the leading or following vehicle in the platoon. The architecture is based on an end-to-end deep learning approach and predicts the control commands, i.e., steering and throttle/brake, with a single neural network. The inputs for this network are images from a front-facing camera, enhanced by information transmitted via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. The model is trained with data captured in a simulated urban environment with dynamic traffic. We compare our approach with different concepts used in the state-of-the-art end-to-end self-driving research, such as the implementation of recurrent neural networks or transfer learning. Experiments in the simulation were conducted to test the model in different urban environments. A CAV platoon consisting of two vehicles, each controlled by an instance of the network, completed on average 67% of the predefined point-to-point routes in the training environment and 40% in a never-seen-before environment. Using V2V communication, our approach eliminates casual confusion for the following vehicle, which is a known limitation of end-to-end self-driving.

AB Advances in guided airdrop technology including guidance, navigation, and control algorithms, novel control mechanisms and wind sensing algorithms have led to significant improvements over unguided airdrop systems. Guided systems are autonomously controlled with an embedded microprocessor using position and velocity feedback. While capable of highly accurate landing, these systems struggle to overcome deviations from expected flight dynamics due to canopy damage or cargo imbalance, complex terrain at the drop zone, and loss of sensor feedback. Human operators are intelligent, highly adaptive, and can innately judge the flight vehicle and environment to steer the vehicle to the desired impact point provided sufficient information. This work experimentally explores operators abilities to accurately land an airdrop system using different sensing modalities. Human operator landing results are compared with a state of the art fully autonomous airdrop system. Across the methods analyzed, human operators attained up to a 40% increase in landing accuracy over the fully autonomous control algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB An autonomous vehicle can sense its environment and operate without human involvement. Its adequate management in an intelligent transportation system could significantly reduce traffic congestion and overall travel time in a network. Adaptive traffic signal controller (ATSC) based on multi-agent systems using state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA (?) are well-known state-of-the-art models to manage autonomous vehicles within urban areas. However, this study found inefficient weights updating mechanisms of the conventional SARSA (?) models. Therefore, it proposes a Gaussian function to regulate the eligibility trace vector's decay mechanism effectively. On the other hand, an efficient understanding of the state of the traffic environment is crucial for an agent to take optimal actions. The conventional models feed the state values to the agents through the MinMax normalization technique, which sometimes shows less efficiency and robustness. So, this study suggests the MaxAbs scaled state values instead of MinMax to address the problem. Furthermore, the combination of the A-star routing algorithm and proposed model demonstrated a good increase in performance relatively to the conventional SARSA (?)-based routing algorithms. The proposed model and the baselines were implemented in a microscopic traffic simulation environment using the SUMO package over a complex real-world-like 21-intersections network to evaluate their performance. The results showed a reduction of the vehicle's average total waiting time and total stops by a mean value of 59.9% and 17.55% compared to the considered baselines. Also, the A-star combined with the proposed controller outperformed the conventional approaches by increasing the vehicle's average trip speed by 3.4%.

AB The entropy-oriented approach called security- or cybersecurity-informed safety (SIS or CSIS, respectively) is discussed and developed in order to analyse and evaluate the safety and dependability of autonomous transport systems (ATSs) such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned maritime vehicles (UMVs), and satellites. This approach allows for extending and integrating the known techniques FMECA (Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis) and IMECA (Intrusion MECA), as well as developing the new SISMECA (SIS-based Intrusion Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis) technique. The ontology model and templates for SISMECA implementation are suggested. The methodology of safety assessment is based on (i) the application and enhancement of SISMECA considering the particularities of various ATSs and roles of actors (regulators, developers, operators, customers); (ii) the development of a set of scenarios describing the operation of ATS in conditions of cyberattacks and physical influences; (iii) AI contribution to system protection for the analysed domains; (iv) scenario-based development and analysis of user stories related to different cyber-attacks, as well as ways to protect ATSs from them via AI means/platforms; (v) profiling of AI platform requirements by use of characteristics based on AI quality model, risk-based assessment of cyberattack criticality, and efficiency of countermeasures which actors can implement. Examples of the application of SISMECA assessment are presented and discussed.

AB The accurate position is a key requirement for autonomous vehicles. Although Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are widely used in many applications, their performance is often disturbed, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, many studies consider multi-sensor integration and cooperative positioning (CP) approaches to provide additional degrees of freedom to address the shortcomings of GNSS. However, few studies adopted real-world datasets and internode ranging outliers within CP is left untouched, leading to unexpected challenges in practical applications. To address this, we propose a Robust Cooperative Positioning (RCP) scheme that augments the GPS with the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) system. A field experiment is conducted to generate a real-world dataset to evaluate the RCP scheme. Moreover, the analysis of the collected dataset enables us to optimise a simple but effective Robust Kalman Filter (RKF) to mitigate the influence of outlier measurements and improve the robustness of the proposed solution. Finally, a simulated dataset is derived from the real-world data to comprehensively study the performance of the proposed RCP method in urban canyon scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed solution can crucially improve positioning performance when the number of visible GPS satellite is limited and is robust against various adverse effects in such environments.

AB Bayesian Optimization is a sequential method for obtaining the maximum of an unknown function that has gained much popularity in recent years. Bayesian Optimization is commonly used to monitor the surface of large-scale aquatic environments using an Autonomous Surface Vehicle. We propose to model water quality parameters using Gaussian Processes, and propose three different adaptations of classical Acquisition Functions in order to explore an unknown space, considering surface vehicle restrictions. The proposed Sequential Bayesian Optimization system uses the aforementioned information in order to monitor the Lake and also to obtain a water quality model, which has an associated uncertainty map. For evaluation, the Mean Squared Error of the resulting approximated models are compared. Afterwards, they are compared with other monitoring algorithms, like the Traveling Salesman Problem, using Genetic Algorithms and Lawnmower. Concluding remarks indicate that the proposed method not only performs better while minimizing the Mean Squared Error (via active monitoring), but also manages to quickly identify an approximate of the black-box function, which is very useful for monitoring lakes like Ypacarai Lake (60 km(2)) in Paraguay. Additionally, the proposed method reduces the MSE by 25% when compared with Traveling Salesman Problem-based monitoring algorithms and also provides a more robust solution, i.e., 30% more independent of initial conditions, when compared with known robust coverage methods like the lawnmower method.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) create new opportunities to traffic planners and policy-makers. In the case of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), dynamic pricing, vehicle routing and dispatch strategies may aim for the maximization of the overall system welfare instead of the operator's profit. In this study, an existing congestion pricing methodology is applied to the SAV transport mode. On the SAV operator's side, the routing- and dispatch-relevant cost are extended by the time and link-specific congestion charge. On the users' side, the congestion costs are added to the fare. Simulation experiments are carried out for Berlin, Germany in order to investigate the impact of SAVs and different pricing setups on the transport system. For the pricing setup, where SAV users only pay the base fare and there is no congestion charge added to the user costs, the model predicts an SAV share of 17.7% within the inner-city Berlin service area. The level of traffic congestion increases, air pollution levels decrease and noise levels slightly increase in the inner-city area. The SAV congestion charge pushes users from SAVs to the walk, bicycle and conventional (drivercontrolled) private car (CC) mode. The latter effect is avoided by applying the same congestion charge also to CC users. Overall, this study highlights the importance to control both, the SAV and CC mode in order to improve a city's transport system.

AB In this work, we consider a cooperative system in which UAVs perform long-distance missions with assistance of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for battery charging. We propose an autonomous landing scheme for the UAV to land on a mobile UGV with high precision by leveraging multiple-scale Quick Response (QR)-codes for different altitudes. These QR-codes support the acquisition of the relative distance and direction between the UGV and UAV. As a result, the UGV is not required to report its accurate state to the UAV. In contrast to the conventional landing algorithms based on the global positioning system (GPS), the proposed vision-based autonomous landing algorithm is available for both outdoor and GPS-denied scenarios. To cope with the challenge on the moving platform landing, a quadratic programming (QP) problem is formulated to design the velocity controller by combining a control barrier function (CBF) and a control Lyapunov function (CLF). Finally, both extensive computer simulation and a prototype of the proposed system are shown to confirm the feasibility of the proposed system and landing scheme.

AB Autonomous landing is a challenging problem for aerial robots. An autonomous landing manoeuver depends largely on two capabilities: the decision of where to land and the generation of control signals to guide the vehicle to a safe landing. We focus on the first capability here by presenting a strategy and an underlying fast algorithm as the computer vision basis to make a safe landing decision. The experimental results obtained from real test flights on a helicopter testbed demonstrate the robustness of the approach under widely different light, altitude and background texture conditions, as well as its feasibility for limited-performance embedded computers.

AB Digital twin cities are frequently used in vehicle and traffic simulations to render realistic on-road driving scenarios under various traffic and environmental conditions. These digital twins provide a high-fidelity replica of the physical world (e.g., buildings, roads, infrastructures, traffic) to create three-dimensional (3D) virtual-physical environments to support various emerging vehicle and transportation technologies such as connected and automated vehicles. These virtual environments provide a cost-effective digital proving ground to evaluate, validate, and test emerging technologies that include control algorithms, localization, perception, and sensors. Replicating a real-world traffic scenario in a digital twin using a traditional 3D modeling approach is a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort. This paper presents a semi-automated spatial framework to construct realistic 3D digital twin cities to support autonomous driving research using readily available geographic information system (GIS) data and 3D prefabricated (prefab) models. We start with a comprehensive review of geospatial data sources of essential digital entities required in a 3D digital twin city and present an integrated GIS-3D modeling pipeline using customized QGIS/GDAL and Blender scripting in Python. The pipeline outputs are realistic 3D digital twin cities compatible with common vehicle simulation software, such as CARLA and IPG CarMaker. The paper closes with a showcase to demonstrate the quality and usability of a digital twin city created to replicate the Shallowford Road corridor in Chattanooga in both Unity and Unreal engine-based virtual environment. The generated digital twin city can be applied to a hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment with an actual testing vehicle to facilitate autonomous driving research.

ID MODEL; DECISION
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have moved from hype to reality as the penetration and acceptance rate continues to increase. As they are slowly integrated into traffic with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), it is necessary to predict the car-following behaviors of AVs and HDVs for better control of AV-HDV mixed traffic. This study extends a data-driven car-following model to incorporate drivers' memory, and cooperation with the lead vehicle. The model predicts the following vehicle's speed in AV-HDV mixed traffic. The effect of drivers' cooperation on car-following behavior was modeled using prospect theory (PT), whereas the driver's memory was incorporated using the memory cell of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. This extended car-following model is called the "PT-LSTM model." Real-world vehicle trajectories of HDVs and AVs in the Waymo AV Open Dataset were used to calibrate and validate the PT-LSTM model. The PT-LSTM model demonstrated higher accuracy compared with the LSTM model that did not consider drivers' cooperation, the multiple layer perceptron model, Gipps' model, and the intelligent driver model that incorporated PT. The importance of variables in different time steps in the PT-LSTM model was also evaluated using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The SHAP results showed that AV followers were more likely to cooperate with the lead HDV, whereas HDV followers were more likely to cooperate with the lead AV than the lead HDV. Thus, this study underscores the importance of considering drivers' memory and cooperation with the lead vehicle for the prediction of car-following behaviors in AV-HDV mixed traffic.

ID DESIGN
AB In this work, a human-centred steering assist controller based on dynamic allocation of control authority between driver and automatic e-copilot has been proposed for lane keeping systems. Cooperative control between driver and steering assist controller is addressed taking into consideration human driving behaviour. The vehicle steering controller for lane keeping is designed using a driver model for representation of the conflict between the driver and the controller. The steering controller is designed employing the integrated driver-vehicle model using Takagi-Sugeno control technique coupled with Lyapunov stability tools. The proposed design is robust to longitudinal speed variations and involves a trade-off between the lane following performance and ratio of negative system interference. The proposed approach was implemented on dynamic vehicle simulator SHERPA and the results presented in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed structure for cooperative control action between human driver and the steering assistance system. Based on indices such as energies spent by driver, driver satisfaction level and contradiction level between driver and autonomous controller the proposed optimal approach shows 93.48% and 89.30% reductions in expended driver energy and contradiction levels. Further, the satisfaction level of driver increased by 67.80% while performing a lane change manoeuvre.

AB This study investigates the response times of autonomous vehicles (AVs) equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and traditional human-driven vehicles (TVs) in mixed traffic scenarios. The primary objective is to assess how these response times impact the stability and safety of mixed traffic flow, considering the growing prevalence of ACC technology in vehicles worldwide. Utilising a trajectory dataset from OpenACC totalling 3389.70 s, this research introduces a response time estimation framework that combines cross-correlation and partial autocorrelation techniques. The study calibrates Gazis, Herman, and Rothery's (GHR) car-following model to evaluate mixed traffic flow stability and employs a modified time-to-collision (MTTC) surrogate for safety analysis. The study also delves into the influence of vehicle manufacturer diversity on study outcomes. Key findings reveal that the AVs exhibit significantly longer response times, ranging from 1.10-3.20 s, compared to the 0.30-1.90-second range of traditional vehicles (p value < 0.005). These extended response times in AVs contribute to prolonged traffic flow instability and increased traffic conflicts. Moreover, the type of lead vehicle does not significantly affect the response times of either AVs or TVs (p value > 0.005). The study also highlights that vehicle manufacturer diversity does not substantially affect these response times. Additionally, the examination of fitted GHR parameters underscores AVs' heightened sensitivity to spacing and relative speed, providing insights into AV dynamics in the presence of mixed traffic.

AB Modeling and control of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) is a challenging task due to the requirement of real-time adaptation to internal hydrodynamic parameter variations and external ocean disturbances induced by wind, waves, and ocean currents. In this paper, an online learning-based active disturbance rejection control method is proposed by combining real-time model learning and anti-disturbance control. Specifically, a filtering learning extended state observer (FLESO) is proposed for online identifying the unknown hydrodynamic parameters, the unknown control input gain, and estimating system uncertainties composed of the unknown external disturbances and dynamic modeling errors, with guaranteed convergence. Then, a self-learning anti -disturbance control law is developed based on the FLESO, enabling self-learning anti-disturbance speed tracking without prior knowledge of model parameters. A salient feature of the proposed method is that the unknown hydrodynamic parameters, the unknown control input gain, and the unknown system uncertainties can be estimated online simultaneously. Lyapunov stability analysis is employed to verify the stability of the closed -loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed online learning-based active disturbance rejection control method is demonstrated through HIL simulations.

AB An effective autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) simulation system can greatly improve development efficiency and reduce the cost and risk of actual equipment operation. In this paper, a comprehensive simulation system is developed using Mission Oriented Operating Suite (MOOS) and Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). The former provides an open-source development framework and application components, which are widely used in the field of underwater robots. The latter is a well-known game development engine that has realistic effects and various plugins. As far as we know, there are few simulation systems based on MOOS and UE4. Moreover, a modular architecture for the simulation system is designed and implemented in the paper. The developed system consists of four subsystems, including the simulation editing and controlling subsystem, shore-based operation subsystem, simulation engine subsystem, and three-dimensional (3D) visualization subsystem. These subsystems have modular characteristics and independent functions and communicate with each other through network sockets. Through the system, users can customize simulation scenarios, send missions and control simulation progress from the graphic user interface. And the system can be used in operation training, software testing, algorithm verification of AUV, etc.

ID PERCEPTION
AB The world is facing a great technological transformation towards fully autonomous vehicles, where optimists predict that by 2030 autonomous vehicles will be sufficiently reliable, affordable, and common to displace most human driving. To cope with these trends, reliable perception systems must enable vehicles to hear and see all their surroundings, with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors being a key instrument for recreating a 3D visualization of the world in real time. However, perception systems must rely on accurate measurements of the environment. Thus, these intelligent sensors must be calibrated and benchmarked before being placed on the market or assembled in a car. This article presents an Evaluation and Testing Platform for Automotive LiDAR sensors, with the main goal of testing both commercially available sensors and new sensor prototypes currently under development in Bosch Car Multimedia Portugal. The testing system can benchmark any LiDAR sensor under different conditions, recreating the expected driving environment in which such devices normally operate. To characterize and validate the sensor under test, the platform evaluates several parameters, such as the field of view (FoV), angular resolution, sensor's range, etc., based only on the point cloud output. This project is the result of a partnership between the University of Minho and Bosch Car Multimedia Portugal.

AB Artificial intelligence raises important social and ethical concerns, especially about accountability, autonomy, dignity, and justice. We focus on the specific concerns arising from how the emerging autonomous vehicle (AV) technology will affect professional drivers. We posit that we must engage with stakeholders to understand the implications of a technology that will affect the stakeholders' lives, livelihoods, or wellbeing. We conducted nine in-depth interviews with professional drivers, with at least two years of driving experience, to understand the ethical and societal challenges from the drivers' perspective during the predicted widespread implementation of AVs. Safety was the most commonly discussed issue, which was mentioned by all drivers (17 times by truck drivers and 18 times by Uber/Lyft drivers). We find that although drivers agree that AVs will significantly impact future transportation systems, they are apprehensive about the prospects of reskilling for other jobs and want their employers to be straightforward in how the introduction of AVs will affect them. Additionally, drivers dismiss the suggestions that driving jobs are unsatisfying and potentially unhealthy and thus should be eliminated. These findings should be considered seriously in decision-making about questions of socioeconomic justice, and could be useful to policymakers as they shape relevant regulations.

AB The paper addresses path planning and path-following problems in an unknown complex environment for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The AUV is required to follow a given reference path represented as a sequence of smoothly joined lines and arcs, bypassing obstacles encountered on the path. A two-level control system is proposed with an upper level for event-driven path planning and a lower level for path-following. A discrete event system is designed to identify situations that require planning a new path. An improved waypoint guidance algorithm and a Dubins curves based algorithm are proposed to build paths that allow the AUV to avoid collision with obstacles and to return to the reference path respectively. Both algorithms generate paths that meet the minimum turning radius constraint. A robust parameter-varying controller is designed using sublinear vector Lyapunov functions to solve the path-following problem. The performance of the developed event-based control system is demonstrated in three different simulation scenarios: with a sharp-edged obstacle, with a U-shaped obstacle, and with densely scattered obstacles. The proposed scheme does not require significant computing resources and allows for easy implementation on board.

AB This paper presents a new technique for almost sure asymptotic state tracking, stability and reference tracking of nonlinear dynamic systems by remote controller over the packet erasure channel, which is an abstract model for transmission via WiFi and the Internet. By implementing a suitable linearization method, a proper encoder and decoder are presented for tracking the state trajectory of nonlinear systems at the end of communication link when the measurements are sent through the packet erasure channel. Then, a controller for reference tracking of the system is designed. In the proposed technique linearization is applied when the error between the states and an estimate of these states at the decoder increases. It is shown that the proposed technique results in almost sure asymptotic reference tracking (and hence stability) over the packet erasure channel. The satisfactory performance of the proposed state trajectory and reference tracking technique is illustrated by computer simulations by applying this technique on the unicycle model, which represents the dynamic of autonomous vehicles.

AB Intelligent control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) requires a control scheme which is robust to external perturbations. These perturbations are highly uncertain and can prevent the AUV from accomplishing its mission. A well-known robust control called sliding mode control (SMC) and its development have been introduced. However, it produces a chattering effect which requires more energy. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a novel robust dynamic region-based control scheme. An AUV needs to be able not only to track a moving target as a region but also to position itself inside the region. The proposed controller is developed based on an adaptive sliding mode scheme. An adaptive element is useful for the AUV to attenuate the effect of external disturbances and also the chattering effect. Additionally, the application of the dynamic-region concept can reduce the energy demand. Simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Furthermore, a Lyapunov-like function is presented for stability analysis. It is demonstrated that the proposed controller works better then an adaptive sliding mode without the region boundary scheme and a fuzzy sliding mode controller. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Semi-autonomous vehicles still require human drivers to take over when the automated systems can no longer perform the driving task. Objective: The goal of this study was to design and test the effects of six meaningful tactile signal types, representing six driving scenarios (i.e., navigation, speed, surrounding vehicles, over the speed limit, headway reductions, and pedestrian status) respectively, and two pattern durations (lower and higher urgencies), on drivers' perception and performance during automated driving. Methods: Sixteen volunteers participated in an experiment utilizing a medium-fidelity driving simulator presenting vibrotactile signals via 20 tactors embedded in the seat back, pan, and belt. Participants completed four separate driving sessions with 30 tactile signals presented randomly throughout each drive. Reaction times (RT), interpretation accuracy, and subjective ratings were measured. Results: Results illustrated shorter RTs and higher intuitive ratings for higher urgency patterns than lower urgency patterns. Pedestrian status and headway reduction signals were associated with shorter RTs and increased confidence ratings, compared to other tactile signal types. Lastly, among six tactile signals, surrounding vehicle and navigation signal types had the highest interpretation accuracy. Conclusion: These results will be used as preliminary data for future studies that aim to investigate the effects of meaningful tactile displays on automated vehicle takeover performance in complex situations (e.g., urban areas) where actual takeovers are required. The findings of this study will inform the design of next-generation in-vehicle human-machine interfaces.

AB This paper considers the vehicle control process in emergency lane change (ELC). The control method is divided into two parts: before crossing the obstacle and after crossing it. The first part is done by a feed-forward controller inspired by the driver's behavior pattern in the ELC maneuver. This controller is compensated by a neural network system and two proportional-integral (PI) and proportional-derivative (PD) controllers, which correct the output of the feed-forward controller to follow the path more accurately. The second part consists of two PD controllers responsible for controlling and steering the vehicle in the main path after crossing the obstacle. The main novelty of the proposed method is that the computational burden is low because of using a feed-forward controller, which is the main source of the calculation's burden. So as a result, the controller system can cover the ELC maneuver in under 2 seconds in various lateral displacements to bypass the obstacle and prevent collisions. The co-simulations are performed in CarSim software and MATLAB/Simulink, which shows that the control system can appropriately steer the vehicle and follow the desired at different speeds, in the presence of road friction and parameter uncertainty.

AB Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) consists of smart vehicles, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as well as road-side units (RSUs) that communicate wirelessly to provide enhanced transportation services such as improved traffic efficiency and reduced traffic congestion and accidents. Unfortunately, current IoV networks suffer from security, privacy, and trust issues. Blockchain technology emerged as a decentralized approach for enhanced security without depending on trusted third parties to run services. Blockchain offers the benefits of trustworthiness and immutability and mitigates the problem of a single point of failure and other attacks. In this work, we present the state-of-the-art Blockchain-enabled IoVs (BIoVs) with a particular focus on their applications, such as crowdsourcing-based applications, energy trading, traffic congestion reduction, collision, accident avoidance, infotainment, and content caching. We also present in-depth applications of federated learning (FL) for BIoVs. The key challenges of integrating Blockchain with IoV are investigated in several domains, such as edge computing, machine learning, and Federated Learning (FL). Lastly, we present several open issues, challenges, and future opportunities in AI-enabled BIoV, hardware-assisted security for BIoV, and quantum computing attacks on BIoV applications.

AB C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything) standard introduced in 3GPP Release-14 is emerging as a potential technology for Cooperative Awareness Message (CAMs) dissemination among connected vehicles. But to attain its full potential, optimal resource scheduling and interference management must be enforced. To address this issue, we propose a weighted exponential averaging based Context-Aware Resource Reselection scheme (CARRs), enabling the periodic exchange of CAMs in a vehicular network. The proposed strategy allows autonomous resource selection by performing continuous power sensing and cooperative learning with the neighbors within the safety zone. CARRs is a two-stage learning process. In the first stage, it learns the exponential weighing factor for each resource available in the Vehicle-to-Vehicle resource pool and performs resource reselection. In the second stage, it learns to select transmit power level based on the interference experienced over the reselected resource. It is established through numerical results that CARRs outperforms the existing strategies. Packet reception ratio, average error rate, average blocking rate and update delay are considered as the performance metrics. CARRs improves packet reception ratio by 3.1% while reducing the average error rate by 28.2% and lowering update delay by 4.5% in comparison to existing schemes.

   vehicle (ODAGV); stratified control
AB We present a stratified adaptive finite-time tracking control (SAFTTC) system, and apply the methodology to trajectory tracking of nonlinear uncertain generalized vehicles. The modeling approach separates vehicle pose dynamics and actuator dynamics into indirect and direct modes, respectively. To track the reference trajectory of the task, an adaptive finite-time virtual reference trajectory (AFTVRT) generator is designed to converge to a first switching surface. The output generated by the AFTVRT is a virtual reference that must then be tracked by the direct modes. Direct mode tracking of the AFTVRT output is achieved by a second, AFTTC, which is designed to converge to a second switching surface. Simple adaptive laws for AFTVRT and AFTTC learn the upper bounds of both the indirect mode and direct mode uncertainties, and convergence to both switching surfaces is with linear dynamics and fractional order of tracking errors. Stability of the closed-loop system is ensured by the Lyapunov stability theory. An application for tracking a pair of nested, interlocking circular trajectories by an omnidirectional autonomous ground vehicle also confirms effectiveness and robustness of the proposed adaptive control system. In the absence of adaptive learning, the system is unable to track the trajectory.

AB Development of intelligent behaviors for vehicles has to cope with rigorous specifications. Many tests are performed for verification, validation and a detailed study of resulting behaviors. In this workflow, testing algorithms with real vehicles is a cornerstone step in developing new intelligent features for future transportation systems. This step requires a lot of experiments before efficiently set up embedded autonomous systems. However, the development of such tests is not linear and it highly depends on external variable factors (weather, hardware or software issues, etc.). To overcome these issues, it is possible to carry out a first series of validation under a simulation framework. In this paper, we describe a simulation platform called VIPS (Vehicles In Platoon Simulator), which provides a virtual environment designed to test and validate platoon control approaches, as close as possible to reality, before bringing them in the real vehicle system. Among the features provided by the simulator, one main contribution is the direct matching between perception and control of both real and virtual vehicles. Moreover, VIPS is also able to deal with perturbations, which are dynamically added to running scenarios so as to reproduce real world conditions. Simulation results in the context of platoon control systems show the benefits of the proposed simulation framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting resistivity and self-potential (SP) anomalies is useful for the exploration of hydrothermal deposits. Using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can increase survey effectiveness because it allows stable posture control without a towing wire cable from a ship. We propose a new style for geophysical surveys using multiple AUVs without a towing electrode cable for marine direct current resistivity (MDCR) and SP survey. We used two AUVs for electrical signal transmission and their receiver. We successfully conducted MDCR and SP surveys ill hydrothermal deposit areas using two AUVs with 20 m tow-rods. One AUV was assisted by an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) for monitoring and controlling via satellite and the public broadband mobile communications radiowave. The survey covered an area of about 1 square kilometer, spending only 4 hr observation time near the seafloor with the vehicle's speed maintained at 2 - 2.5 blots at distance between the AUVs of 200 - 300 m during most of the survey. The SP and apparent resistivity were calculated along the main survey line crossing known hydrothermal mounds of sulfide ore. The distribution of the negative SP anomalies obtained in the dive is similar to that obtained from our earlier survey using a deep-tow. The apparent resistivity is generally low (0.2 ohm-m or less) above the mounds. The averaged distance between the vehicles and the averaged altitude are respectively about 250 and 70 m. Therefore, the estimated apparent resistivities are the averaged value to several tens of meters below the seafloor. These positions show good agreement with the locations of blown hydrothermal deposits.

AB This article addresses the problem of formation control of a quadrotor and one (or more) marine vehicles operating at the surface of the water with the end goal of encircling the boundary of a chemical spill, enabling such vehicles to carry and release chemical dispersants used during ocean cleanup missions to break up oil molecules. Firstly, the mathematical models of the Medusa class of marine robots and quadrotor aircrafts are introduced, followed by the design of single vehicle motion controllers that allow these vehicles to follow a parameterised path individually using Lyapunov-based techniques. At a second stage, a distributed controller using event-triggered communications is introduced, enabling the vehicles to perform cooperative path following missions according to a pre-defined geometric formation. In the next step, a real-time path planning algorithm is developed that makes use of a camera sensor, installed on-board the quadrotor. This sensor enables the detection in the image of which pixels encode parts of a chemical spill boundary and use them to generate and update, in real time, a set of smooth B-spline-based paths for all the vehicles to follow cooperatively. The performance of the complete system is evaluated by resorting to 3-D simulation software, making it possible to visually simulate a chemical spill. Results from real water trials are also provided for parts of the system, where two Medusa vehicles are required to perform a static lawn-mowing path following mission cooperatively at the surface of the water.

AB Path tracking is an important component of autonomous driving and most current path tracking research is based on different positioning sensors, such as GPS, cameras, and LIDAR. However, in certain extreme cases (e.g., in tunnels or indoor parking lots), if these sensors are unavailable, achieving accurate path tracking remains a problem that is worthy of study. This paper addresses this problem by designing a dead reckoning method that is solely reliant on wheel speed for localization. Specifically, a differential drive model is first used for estimating the current relative vehicle position in real time by rear wheel speed, and the deviation between the current path and the reference path is then calculated using the pure pursuit algorithm as a means of obtaining the target steering wheel angle and vehicle speed. The steering wheel and vehicle speed signals are then output by two PID controllers in order to control the vehicle, and the automatic driving path tracking is ultimately realized. Through exhaustive tests and experiments, the stop position error and tracking process error are compared under different conditions, and the effects of vehicle speed, look-ahead distance, starting position angle, and driving mode on tracking accuracy are analyzed. The experimental results show the average error of the end position to be 0.26 m, 0.383 m, and 0.505 m when using BMW-i3 to drive one lap automatically at speeds of 5 km/h, 10 km/h, and 15 km/h in a test area with a perimeter of approximately 200 m.

AB The emergence of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is not only improving the efficiency of transportation, but also providing new opportunities for the sustainable development of transportation. Taking advantage of the energy consumption of CAVs to promote the sustainable development of transportation has attracted extensive public attention in recent years. This paper develops a mathematical approach to investigating the problem of the optimal implementation of dedicated CAV lanes while simultaneously considering economic and environmental sustainability. Specifically, the problem is described as a multi-objective bi-level programming model, in which the upper level is to minimize the system-level costs including travel time costs, CAV lane construction cost, and emission cost, whereas the lower level characterizes the multi-class network equilibrium with a heterogeneous traffic stream consisting of both human-driven vehicle (HVs) and CAVs. To address the multi-objective dedicated CAV lane implement problem, we propose an integrated solution framework that integrates a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm, diagonalized algorithm, and Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The NSGA-II was adopted to solve the upper-level model, i.e., hunting for the optimal CAV lanes implementation schemes. The diagonalized Frank-Wolfe (DFW) algorithm is used to cope with multi-class network equilibrium. Finally, numerical experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution method. The experimental results show that the total travel time cost, total emission cost, and total energy consumption were decreased by about 12.03%, 10.42%, and 9.4%, respectively, in the Nguyen-Dupuis network as a result of implementing the dedicated CAV lanes.

AB This paper presents, a robust nonlinear proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-like fuzzy control scheme for a task-space trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (AUVMS) employed for deep-sea intervention tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is numerically demonstrated on a planar underwater vehicle manipulator system (consisting of an underwater vehicle and two link rotary (2R) serial planar manipulator). The actuator and sensor dynamics of the system are also incorporated in the dynamical model of an AUVMS. The proposed control law consists of two main parts: first part uses a feed forward term to reinforce the control activity with extravagance from known desired acceleration vector and carries an estimated perturbed term to compensate for the unknown effects namely external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics and the second part uses a PID-like fuzzy logic control as a feedback portion to enhance the overall closed-loop stability of the system. The primary objective of the proposed control scheme is to track the given end-effector task-space trajectory despite of external disturbances, system uncertainties and internal noises associated with the AUVMS system. To show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, comparison is made with linear and nonlinear PID controllers. Simulation results confirmed that with the proposed control scheme, the AUVMS can successfully track the given desired spatial trajectory and gives better and robust control performance.

AB Limits in attention restrict drivers from performing many desired non-driving activities while manoeuvring their vehicles. This constraint facilitates the use of transport services with autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this study, we interviewed 763 car drivers about their driving behaviour, their driving-based multitasking habit, and their driving-based smart device addiction. We constructed an integrated choice model with latent variable (ICLV) and identified the latent effects of two variables on both the preference for AV-based services and the value of travel time (VTT) at an individual level. Our results suggest that the multitasking habit discourages a driver from switching to AV-based services, while the driving-based device addiction encourages drivers to do so. This is expected, since drivers having a stronger driving-based multitasking habit are likely to be more capable of carrying out non-driving activities while manoeuvring their vehicle. As a result, skilful drivers may be reluctant to adopt an AV service. In contrast, those who demonstrate a higher level of driving-based addiction to their smart device are more likely to embrace AV services, since the addiction implies a desire to focus their attention on it instead of on driving. We found a stronger multitasking habit to reduce VTT in both AV and public transport services. In contrast, addiction to smart device increases generic cost, increasing VTT. We further investigated factors affecting how these two latent variables form and we identify young, male drivers (under 40 years old) that drive very frequently (> 3 times a day) should be the ideal advertising targets should AV-based services are rolled out.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology can help disabled Americans achieve their desired level of mobility. However, realizing this potential depends on vehicle manufacturers, policymakers, and state and municipal agencies collaborating to accommodate the needs of disabled individuals at different stages of trip making through information system design, vehicle design, and infrastructure design. Integrating accessibility at this stage of the AV revolution would finally allow us an opportunity to develop a transportation system that treats accessibility as a guiding principle, not as an afterthought. This paper documents accessibility considerations for disabled individuals followed by a review of relevant Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations. The review of regulations is followed by a review of nine case studies, five corresponding to the on-demand microtransit service model and four corresponding to the paratransit service model. These case studies are essentially different prototypes currently being deployed on a pilot basis. Each of these specific case studies is then evaluated for its ability to provide potential accessibility features that would fulfill the requirement set forth by relevant ADA regulations in the absence of an operator/driver. Based on this review of relevant research, ADA regulations, and case studies, recommendations are provided for researchers, private firms, policymakers, and agencies involved in AV development and deployment. The recommendations include better collaboration and adoption of best practices to address the needs of individuals with different disability types (e.g., Cognitive, Visual, Auditory). ADA regulations should be used as one of the tools in addition to universal design principles and assistive technologies in order to maximize accessibility.

AB With more and more stringent requirements on driving comfort, safety and fuel economy, polytopic LPV approaches have become popular in intelligent automotive control systems due to their merits in dealing with the complex nonlinearities. This survey starts with a review on control theory of polytopic LPV systems. Stability analysis and controller design are provided with techniques in obtaining less conservative results. Then, some key applications in vehicle dynamics control are provided. Several LPV models concerning the vertical dynamics, lateral dynamics and integrated dynamics are introduced. Different polytopic LPV control designs are summarized taking various settings on time-varying parameters into account. Moreover, polytopic LPV approaches in vehicle path following and powertrain control are concluded, including the applications in internal combustion engines, electric vehicles and aftertreatment systems. Finally, from recent advances on polytopic LPV control theory and automotive applications, future research directions and related challenges are discussed.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are becoming indispensable for the maritime industry and defense applications. The nonlinear, time-varying, and highly coupled dynamics of AUVs, along with the parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics, make the design of efficient controllers a hard task. This article explores a robust control strategy that aims at providing better tracking accuracy by reducing the switching gain in order to reduce chattering and the control error bandwidth. The performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated through rigorous simulation on an experimentally validated AUV, and superior path tracking performance is noted against sliding mode and time delay control methodologies under various uncertain conditions.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for a force-controlled over-actuated two-wheel-steer four-wheel-drive vehicle to achieve accurate path tracking through control allocation. The control algorithm is developed by combining embedded integrator model predictive control and sequential quadratic programming-based control allocation. Based on the offset model presented in this paper, the model predictive control can generate the virtual accelerations. Using these virtual accelerations in control allocation, the actual control inputs are obtained. The proposed method is then used in a simulation to demonstrate its successful implementation in path tracking.

AB Purpose This study aimed to explore the requirements for accessible Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and AV services from a consumer perspective, focusing on people with disabilities (PwDs) and older adults.
   Methods Two national surveys were conducted, capturing current transportation trends and AV priorities. Participants (n = 922) with disabilities and older adults were included in the analysis.
   Results Transportation choices exhibited significant divergence based on the underlying causes of disabilities, showcasing distinct inclinations and impediments within each category. AV services, encompassing family conveyance and package delivery, proved integral, but their specific desirability fluctuated in accordance with the nature of disabilities. Notably, medical appointments emerged as the foremost AV utilisation requirement, particularly pronounced among individuals with hearing impairments. Preferences for orchestrating AV rides and the preferred vehicle types displayed disparities linked to the various disability classifications. The employment of mobile applications, websites, and text messages were preferred mediums for arranging rides. Features such as automated route guidance and collision prevention garnered unanimous precedence among AV attributes. Key priorities, spanning wheelchair accessibility, user profiles, and seamless communication with AVs, were universally emphasised across all participant clusters. The study indicated a moderate comfort level with AV deployment, implying the potential for favourable reception within the population of PwDs and older adults.
   Conclusion The study highlights the significance of considering diverse needs in accessible AV development of vehicle and infrastructure and policies.

AB An overtaking trajectory planning algorithm is an essential part of autonomous vehicles, but maximizing trip efficiency (minimum travel time) while guaranteeing safety is non-trivial. In particular, to achieve optimal trajectory results in all situations using one algorithm is challenging because overtaking is a complex maneuver in which several behaviors are combined. In this paper, an overtaking algorithm that employs a finite state machine as a high-level decision maker and chance constrained model predictive control as a trajectory planner is proposed to optimize trip efficiency and ride comfort while guaranteeing safety. By combining two methods in a hierarchical structure, the proposed algorithm takes advantage of each method to realize optimality and real-time performance. Using the conditional state machine (CSM), algorithm classifies maneuver states that can ensure safety, and sets the optimal multi-vehicle constraints in each state. The chance constrained model predictive control (MPC) plans an optimal trajectory that considers the prediction uncertainty, safety, trip efficiency and ride comfort. To rigorously evaluate both trip efficiency and safety, the performance of the proposed overtaking algorithm is evaluated in a statistical manner for various level of service (LOS) scenarios. Simulation results show that the optimal trajectory was generated in a multi-vehicle situation while ensuring higher safety than the rule-based algorithm. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper describes an autonomous water vehicle (ASV) capable of autonomously mapping shallow water environments above and below the water surface. Over the past two years, Fraunhofer IOSB has developed a system that is fully electrified and equipped with extensive sensor technology (multibeam sonar, lidar, cameras, IMU, GNSS). For autonomous navigation, the complete processing pipeline was implemented, from obstacle detection and avoidance to trajectory planning and control to multi-sensor localization and mapping. Above water, both lidar-based mapping and photogrammetric methods are used; underwater, bathymetry data is obtained using sonar. The interface to the operator is realized by an interactive digital map table, which allows intuitive mission specification and evaluation.

The techniques employed within key modules from this architecture are explained in detail, such as a six-dimensional localization approach based on visual odometry and Monte Carlo localization, or a variant of the Lazy Theta* algorithm for motion planning. The aerial robot used to demonstrate this approach has been extensively tested over the past 2 years for localization and state estimation without any external positioning systems, autonomous local obstacle avoidance, and local path planning among other tasks. This article describes the architecture and main algorithms used to achieve these goals to build a robust autonomous system.

AB This paper presents a study of horizontal and depth controller design for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) regarding model uncertainties, input constraints, and ocean currents. Firstly, the depth-plane and horizontal-plane models of AUV are established comprehensively with ocean currents. Besides, the AUV's characteristics and physical limitations are also described. Secondly, extended perturbation observers (EPOs) are innovatively constructed to estimate ocean currents, which guarantee the accuracy in the case of time-varying ocean currents. To achieve the position errors with prescribed performance guarantees, a finite-time prescribed performance function is proposed such that the convergence time, maximum overshoot, and steady error bounds can be preset directly. Neural network-based adaptive control is adopted to deal with model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Auxiliary systems with a smooth switching function are introduced to alleviate the effect of input saturation. Furthermore, rigorous theoretical analyses are also carried out to demonstrate the robust stability of the proposed controllers. Finally, extensive numerical simulation studies confirm the strong and conclusive evidence for the proposed method's effectiveness, robustness, anti-jamming ability, and feasibility.

AB Video surveillance in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) is in the rapid growth stage, where video analytics is a potential technology to improve the safety of the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV). However, massive video data transmission and computation-intensive video analytics bring an overwhelming burden for vehicular networks. Moreover, owing to the unstable network connection, the video data are not always reliable, which makes data sharing a lack of security and scalability in IoAV. In this work, we first propose a video analytics framework, where the multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and blockchain technologies are integrated into IoAV to optimize the transaction throughput of the blockchain system as well as reducing the latency of the MEC system. Furthermore, based on deep reinforcement learning, the joint optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm is adopted to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can fast converge and significantly improve the performance of blockchain-enabled IoAV with MEC.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB Following the development of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), multiple trajectory-based submarine target information collection constitutes one of the key technologies that significantly influence underwater information collection ability and deployment efficiency. In this paper, we propose an underwater information collection AUV, O-AUV, that can perceive the omnidirectional area and could detect a larger area than the traditional AUV. A 3D sensing model for the O-AUV is proposed to describe the complex underwater information collection spaces. Thereafter, a cube-based environment model involving candidate observation point calculation methods are suggested to adapt the O-AUV model. A voyage cost map is also built according to the multi-AUV path planning for a common submarine mission that must traverse numerous mission targets in complex environments through the R-Dijkstra algorithm. Specifically, the voyage planning problem is solved through a critical algorithm called ANSGA (accelerated NSGA-II algorithm), which in turn, is developed by modifying the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to accelerate the optimization rate for the Pareto solution. Experiments are carried out in MATLAB, and the results verify the validity of the proposed O-AUV+ANSGA algorithm framework.

AB One of Saturn's largest moons, Enceladus, possesses a vast extraterrestrial ocean (i.e., exo-ocean) that is increasingly becoming the hotspot of future research initiatives dedicated to the exploration of putative life. Here, a new bio-exploration concept design for Enceladus' exo-ocean is proposed, focusing on the potential presence of organisms across a wide range of sizes (i.e., from uni- to multicellular and animal-like), according to state-of-the-art sensor and robotic platform technologies used in terrestrial deep-sea research. In particular, we focus on combined direct and indirect life-detection capabilities, based on optoacoustic imaging and passive acoustics, as well as molecular approaches. Such biologically oriented sampling can be accompanied by concomitant geochemical and oceanographic measurements to provide data relevant to exo-ocean exploration and understanding. Finally, we describe how this multidisciplinary monitoring approach is currently enabled in terrestrial oceans through cabled (fixed) observatories and their related mobile multiparametric platforms (i.e., Autonomous Underwater and Remotely Operated Vehicles, as well as crawlers, rovers, and biomimetic robots) and how their modified design can be used for exo-ocean exploration.

AB Collision prevention is critical for navigation safety at sea. At early ages, researchers aimed at developing navigational assistance systems for enhancing situational awareness of human operators as human is at the core of collision avoidance. Recently, autonomous vehicles have gained a remarkable amount of attention with a focus on solving collision problems by machines. This results in two groups of studies, both working on preventing collisions but with different focuses: one aims at conflict detection, and the other focuses on conflict resolution.
   This paper offers a comprehensive overview of collision prevention techniques based on the three basic processes of determining evasive solutions, namely, motion prediction, conflict detection, and conflict resolution. The strengths and weaknesses of different methods for these three fundamental processes are discussed. Limitations and new challenges are highlighted. Moreover, this review points out the differences between the research for manned and unmanned ships and how the research in the two domains can learn from each other. A potential roadmap for the transition from existing manned ships to fully unmanned ships is provided in the end.

AB During the last years, new technologies have been developing at a rapid pace; however, new technologies carry risks and uncertainties. Technology forecasting by analogy has been used in the case of emerging technologies; nevertheless, the use of analogies is subject to several problems such as lack of inherent necessity, historical uniqueness, historically conditioned awareness, and casual analogies. Additionally, the natural process of selecting the analogy technology is based on subjective criteria for technological similarities or inductive inference. Since many analogies are taken qualitatively and rely on subjective assessments, this paper presents a quantitative comparison process based on the Social Network Analysis (SNA) and patent analysis for selecting analogous technologies. In this context, the paper presents an analysis of complex patent network structures using centrality and density metrics in order to reduce the lack of information or the presence of uncertainties. The case of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is explored in this paper, comparing three candidate technologies which have been chosen based on the similarities with the target technologies. The best candidate technology is selected based on the analysis of two main centrality metrics (average degree and density).

ID POWER TRANSFER SYSTEM
AB Lightweight autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), powered by rechargeable batteries, are widely deployed in inshore surveying, environmental monitoring, and mine countermeasures. While providing valuable information in locations humans have difficulty accessing, limited battery capacity of such systems prevents extended mission times. In order to extend mission times, this paper proposes a three-phase wireless charging system that could be used in a field-deployable charging station capable of rapid, efficient, and convenient AUV recharging. Wireless charging should not, however, affect instrumentation located inside the AUV. Thus, a three-dimensional finite element analysis tool is employed to study the characteristics of magnetic fields inside the AUV during three-phase charging. Simulation results reveal that the magnetic field generated by the proposed three-phase coil structure is concentrated away from the center of the AUV, where instrumentation would nominally be located. Detailed circuit analysis and compensation method to achieve resonance on both transmitter's and receiver's sides are also given. To validate the proposed concept, a three-phase wireless charging system is developed. Experimental results demonstrate that the system is able to transfer 1.0 kW with a dc-dc efficiency of 92.41% at 465 kHz.

DE cooperative motion control; path-following; autonomous surface vessels;

AB This paper addresses the problem of cooperative path-following of networked autonomous surface vessels with discrete-time periodic communications. The objective is to steer a group of autonomous vehicles along given spatial paths, while holding a desired inter-vehicle formation pattern. For a given class of marine vessels, we show how Lyapunov-based techniques, graph theory, and results from networked control systems can be brought together to yield a decentralized control structure where the dynamics of the cooperating vessels and the constraints imposed by the topology of the inter-vehicle communication network are explicitly taken into account. Cooperation is achieved by adjusting the speed of each vessel along its path according to information exchanged periodically on the positions of a subset of the other vessels, as determined by the communications topology adopted. The closed-loop system that is obtained by putting together the path-following and cooperation strategies takes an interconnected feedback form where both systems are input-to-state stable with respect to the outputs of each other. Using a small-gain theorem, stability and convergence of the overall system are guaranteed for adequate choices of the controller gains. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Control design for autonomous vehicles involves a number of issues that are not satisfactorily addressed in classical control systems theory. There is typically the need for prescribing and commanding a collection of interacting dynamic control systems in order to meet the desired requirements for overall behavior, whereas conventional control design has only one system to govern. This context requires a whole new set of concepts, methods, and tools that are adapted to capture the integration of logical commands, continuous time evolution, and discrete event dynamics. A rapidly growing and extensive body of literature testifies to the valuable heritage of control systems that will address the challenges ahead. Several new issues arise in attempting a principled design of a specific system, and it is essential that they be resolved in order to ground the effort for a suitable control design framework. Furthermore, control design cannot be dissociated front the implementation phase, which introduces a wide range of challenges in communication and computation. This paper provides an overview of three control projects designed at the Underwater Systems and Technology Laboratory, and discusses the new challenges from the dynamic optimization viewpoint.

AB Autonomous ships represent an emerging paradigm within the maritime sector, poised to bring multiple advantages. Although numerous prototypes have been developed, the deployment of large autonomous ships has predominantly remained confined to domestic waters or specialized military applications. The extensive adoption of autonomous ships is hampered by several challenges, primarily centered around safety. However, the direct assessment of autonomous technologies on large-scale vessels can be very costly. Small-scale autonomy testing may provide a cheaper option. This study reviews the current small autonomous ship models used by maritime researchers and industry practitioners. It aims to evaluate how these autonomous models currently augment and can augment safety assurances on larger autonomous ships. The review identifies relevant very small Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs), the main research groups behind them and their applications. Then, the current use of USVs for safety and safety assurance is analyzed. Finally, the paper suggests innovative strategies and research directions for using USVs for the safety assurance of larger autonomous ships.

AB Autonomous vehicles are equipped with advanced vehicle technology (AVT) that will improve road traffic safety and reduce accidents. However, due to the uncertain behavior of other road users, collisions can never be completely eliminated. Collision reconfiguration systems offer a solution by, for instance, changing where ve-hicles are hit and how the impact force is directed towards them. Unfortunately, the logic behind the decision-making of collision reconfiguration systems is fundamentally different from that of other AVTs. Fundamentally different feedback might thus be required from accident analyses to ensure the successful design of collision reconfiguration systems. Through simulations, this study explores decision-making strategies of collision reconfiguration systems to ascertain the implications of which feedback is required from accident analyses. Results show that different strategies can be statistically significantly different from each other in the way they affect severity; and that a new source of unobserved heterogeneity could easily be small variations in the al-gorithms used by collision reconfiguration systems. Based on this, three new needs to consider during accident analysis are put forth: firstly, new safety surrogate measures (SSMs) that consider severity are required; one such SSM is proposed; secondly, to identify new unobserved heterogeneity as a result of collision reconfiguration systems, the trajectories of traffic near-collisions should be recorded, and statistical tools to identify comparable scenarios developed. Thirdly, new collision patterns will make it difficult to analyze the implications of recon-figured collisions, which suggests that collision configurations must be carefully recorded to provide early feedback.

AB As well as offering tremendous opportunities for existing transportation systems, autonomous driving presents challenges for traffic management, particularly in mixed traffic flow. The design of driving strategies for autonomous vehicles (AVs) considers both safety and efficiency to promote smooth traffic flow with no collisions. However, the complex traffic conditions at freeway bottlenecks mean that the traffic impacts of AVs in such scenarios remain unclear. Therefore, this study employs several driving strategies utilizing deep reinforcement learning (RL) to form a mixed-autonomy traffic flow on a one-way two-lane freeway with on- and off-ramps and weaving sections in SUMO traffic microsimulations. The study also examines the overall traffic impacts in terms of congested patterns, safety, efficiency, and passenger comfort. Multiple experiments are conducted with different AV driving strategies, penetration rates, and key traffic conditions. The results show that AVs with a deep-RL driving strategy significantly mitigate traffic-congested patterns and prevent the propagation of shockwaves, but at the expense of speed at low penetration rates. Moreover, the proposed driving strategy is conducive to a safer capability in vehicle dynamics. However, AVs under a deep-RL strategy lead to poorer passenger comfort at bottlenecks. Therefore, it is crucial to design a driving strategy with high robustness and scalability so that deep RL-based AVs can adapt to more complex scenarios and traffic events. Overall, the present research improves the understandings of AV driving mechanisms and provides insights into corresponding future traffic-management measures.

AB The control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is considered as a challenging problem, mainly due to the AUV's nonlinear and uncertain dynamics. In fact, the underwater vehicles require a robust control scheme in order to maneuver to any given point and track a moving target regardless of external disturbances. The main aim of this work consists of proposing two different designs of a robust control system for the nonlinear model of an AUV. The first controller is a PID that optimizes its gains using a novel hybrid PSO algorithm, combining Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) and Levy Flight (LF) distribution. The second one is a state feedback control that uses the Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach to guarantee the closed-loop stability in the sense of the Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed control schemes are developed based on the Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) model to take into account the time-varying nature of AUV. The performance quality of these two controllers is evaluated based on the depth control of an AUV in the presence of parametric uncertainty. In order to assess the trajectory tracking, an attitude control system for the underwater vehicle is also developed using the proposed control methodologies. Finally, the obtained simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PSOSCALF-tuned PID not only shows higher robustness in the presence of parametric uncertainties and disturbances but also gives stunning time-domain performances compared to the LMI-based state feedback control.

AB Pure pursuit algorithm is one of the most effective ways of path tracking in autonomous vehicles. Nevertheless, the tracking accuracy of the existing pure pursuit algorithm is limited by the look-ahead distance. In this paper, to improve the tracking accuracy of the pure pursuit algorithm, a novel pure pursuit algorithm based on the optimized look-ahead distance named OLDPPA is proposed. Four improvements are presented in OLDPPA. Firstly, to find a better look-ahead distance of pure pursuit algorithm, salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is used in pure pursuit algorithm. Secondly, Brownian motion, a random motion mechanism of particles, is introduced in SSA to enhance its exploitation and exploration capabilities. Thirdly, to accelerate the convergence speed of SSA, a weighted mechanism which uses two different weights in the search process to adjust the salps closer to the food source quickly is assigned. Based on innovations 2 and 3, adaptive Brownian motion salp swarm algorithm (ABMSSA) is proposed and applied to pure pursuit algorithm. Finally, a velocity controller which outputs the speed of the next moment according to the distance and time interval between the look-ahead point and the current vehicle position is designed in OLDPPA, to ensure that the vehicle reaches its destination at a specified time. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of OLDPPA, OLDPPA is applied in four different paths and the corresponding results are compared with other pure pursuit algorithms that use different look-ahead distances. Experimental results show that the tracking accuracy of OLDPPA is better than other algorithms.

AB Elevation map generation is an essential component of any autonomous underwater vehicle designed to navigate close to the seafloor because elevation maps are used for obstacle avoidance, path planning and self localization. We present an algorithm for the reconstruction of elevation maps of the seafloor from side-scan sonar backscatter images and sparse bathymetric points co-registered within the image. Given the trajectory for the underwater vehicle, the reconstruction is corrected for the attitude of the side-scan sonar during the image generation process. To perform reconstruction, an arbitrary but computable scattering model is assumed for the seafloor backscatter. The algorithm uses the sparse bathymetric data to generate an initial estimate for the elevation map which is then iteratively refined to fit the backscatter image by minimizing a global error functional. Concurrently, the parameters of the scattering model are determined on a coarse grid in the image by fitting the assumed scattering model to the backscatter data. The reconstruction is corrected for the movement of the sensor by initially doing local reconstructions in sensor coordinates and then transforming the local reconstructions to a global coordinate system using vehicle attitude and performing the reconstruction again. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real data sets. Our algorithm is shown to decrease the average elevation error when compared to real bathymetry from 4.6 meters for the initial surface estimate to 1.6 meters for the final surface estimate from a survey taken of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.

AB As the most important device of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), thrusters are one of the main sources of fault. If the thruster fault can be diagnosed in the early stage, it would give more time to guarantee the safety of an AUV. Fault feature extraction is the premise of fault diagnosis. The traditional feature calculation methods extract fault features from one domain. These methods work well in the case of high fault severity, but poorly in the case of weak fault severity. In addition, for weak faults, the fault features extracted by the traditional methods may not meet the monotonic relationship with fault severity and cannot be used in fault severity identification. Aiming at these problems, through experimental data analysis, this paper excludes the features that do not meet the law from the 52 selectable fault features in the time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. Aiming at the problem that there is no useful feature in the frequency domain, a new feature calculation method is proposed, and the order of magnitude of the available feature is given, which provides concise and accurate information for subsequent fault feature fusion and fault severity identification.

AB The prevailing discourse on autonomous vehicles (AVs) has not yet developed a sophisticated conceptualization of autonomy and has given insufficient attention to the autonomy of people. In response, this article shifts our attention away from the AV's autonomy and towards that of its user. Autonomy is conceived here as the socially and materially situated capacity of an individual to identify and act on one's own values and desires, a capacity that is desirable for collective political life. This definition is drawn selectively from a survey of thought illustrating the richness of this concept. I then examine how studies of transportation have already made use of certain themes of autonomy in understanding mobility practices beyond dominant utilitarian models. This sets up an examination of AVs, where the existing literature tends to use a narrow conceptualization of autonomy. I then briefly examine two examples of unsettled questions in AV development, discretionary user controls and shared ride systems, in light of autonomy. The goal of this article is both to show how autonomy can be productive in understanding mobility practices, and to argue for personal autonomy as a normative value worth pursuing in the technical, political, and social development of automated mobility systems.

AB This article focuses on the economic potential and the consequences on the regulatory context of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV) used in a regional public transportation system. Based on an experimental case study two on-demand scenarios were developed for the Swiss rural area of the TOss Valley. Scenario 1 replaces the current public transportation by SAVs; scenario 2 operates with a SAV fleet instead of buses and integrates the regional railway. Data sources are an overall traffic model and the current business figures of the public transportation. The results suggest that scenario 2 is, out of an economic and traffic system view, an attractive solution compared to line-bound traditional bus and train systems. In both scenarios, a cost-covering service may be possible due to an increase in productivity and demand. Regarding the present regulatory context of the Swiss public transportation system, we propose to change the system of call for tenders for single public transportation lines towards a call for tender for entire regions. This paper contributes to the scholarship discussion on the role of the final provider of new services and which adaptions of current regulations have to be targeted in the future.

AB In recent years, the self-driving car technologies have been developed with many successful stories in both academia and industry. The challenge for autonomous vehicles is the requirement of operating accurately and robustly in the urban environment. This paper focuses on how to efficiently solve the hierarchical control system of a self-driving car into practice. This technique is composed of decision making, local path planning and control. An ego vehicle is navigated by global path planning with the aid of a High Definition map. Firstly, we propose the decision making for motion planning by applying a two-stage Finite State Machine to manipulate mission planning and control states. Furthermore, we implement a real-time hybrid A* algorithm with an occupancy grid map to find an efficient route for obstacle avoidance. Secondly, the local path planning is conducted to generate a safe and comfortable trajectory in unstructured scenarios. Herein, we solve an optimization problem with nonlinear constraints to optimize the sum of jerks for a smooth drive. In addition, controllers are designed by using the pure pursuit algorithm and the scheduled feedforward PI controller for lateral and longitudinal direction, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can operate efficiently in the urban scenario.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; AUV; ATTITUDE
AB This paper presents a novel three-dimension (3-D) underwater trajectory tracking method for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using model predictive control (MPC). First, the 6-degrees of freedom (DoF) model of a fully-actuated AUV is represented by both kinematics and dynamics. After that, the trajectory tracking control is proposed as an optimization problem and then transformed into a standard convex quadratic programming (QP) problem which can be readily computed online. The practical constraints of the system inputs and states are considered effectively in the design phase of the proposed control strategy. To make the AUV move steadily, the control increments are considered as the system input and optimized. The receding horizon implementation makes the optimal control inputs be recalculated at each sampling instant, which can improve the robustness of the tracking control under the model uncertainties and time-varying disturbances. Simulations are carried out under two different 3-D trajectories to verify the performance of trajectory tracking under random disturbances, ocean current disturbances, and ocean wave disturbances. The simulation results are given to show the feasibility and robustness of the MPC-based underwater trajectory tracking algorithm.

AB Being one of the key techniques for unmanned autonomous vehicle, traffic sign recognition is applied to assist autopilot. Colors are very important clues to identify traffic signs; however, color-based methods suffer performance degradation in the case of light variation. Convolutional neural network, as one of the deep learning methods, is able to hierarchically learn high-level features from the raw input. It has been proved that convolutional neural network-based approaches outperform the color-based ones. At present, inputs of convolutional neural networks are processed either as gray images or as three independent color channels; the learned color features are still not enough to represent traffic signs. Apart from colors, temporal constraint is also crucial to recognize video-based traffic signs. The characteristics of traffic signs in the time domain require further exploration. Quaternion numbers are able to encode multi-dimensional information, and they have been employed to describe color images. In this article, we are inspired to present a quaternion convolutional neural network-based approach to recognize traffic signs by fusing spatial and temporal features in a single framework. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can yield correct recognition results and obtain better performance when compared with the state-of-the-art work.

AB Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are only applied to relatively simple scenarios, such as highways. If there is an emergency while driving, the driver should take control of the car to deal properly with the situation at any time. Obviously, this incurs the uncertainty of safety. Recently, in the literature, several studies have been proposed for the above-mentioned issue via Artificial Intelligence (AI). The achievement is exactly the aim that we look forward to, i.e., the autonomous vehicle. In this paper, we realize the autonomous driving control via Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based on the CARLA (Car Learning to Act) simulator. Specifically, we use the ordinary Red-Green-Blue (RGB) camera and semantic segmentation camera to observe the view in front of the vehicle while driving. Then, the captured information is utilized as the input for different DRL models so as to evaluate the performance, where the DRL models include DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) and RDPG (Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient). Moreover, we also design an appropriate reward mechanism for these DRL models to realize efficient autonomous driving control. According to the results, only the RDPG strategies can finish the driving mission with the scenario that does not appear/include in the training scenario, and with the help of the semantic segmentation camera, the RDPG control strategy can further improve its efficiency.

AB Smart maintenance is essential to achieving a safe and reliable railway, but traditional maintenance deployment is costly and heavily human-involved. Ineffective job execution or failure in preventive maintenance can lead to railway service disruption and unsafe operations. The deployment of robotic and autonomous systems was proposed to conduct these maintenance tasks with higher accuracy and reliability. In order for these systems to be capable of detecting rail flaws along millions of mileages they must register their location with higher accuracy. A prerequisite of an autonomous vehicle is its possessing a high degree of accuracy in terms of its positional awareness. This paper first reviews the importance and demands of preventive maintenance in railway networks and the related techniques. Furthermore, this paper investigates the strategies, techniques, architecture, and references used by different systems to resolve the location along the railway network. Additionally, this paper discusses the advantages and applicability of on-board-based and infrastructure-based sensing, respectively. Finally, this paper analyses the uncertainties which contribute to a vehicle's position error and influence on positioning accuracy and reliability with corresponding technique solutions. This study therefore provides an overall direction for the development of further autonomous track-based system designs and methods to deal with the challenges faced in the railway network.

AB This paper describes an end-to-end control system for autonomous navigation of a small vehicle at a remote place, e.g. in space for planetary exploration. Due to a realistic background of this study the proposed method has to deal with limited knowledge about the environment as well as limited system resources and operational boundary conditions, especially a very large time delay in the communication between the ground control station and the space segment. To overcome these constraints the remote system has to act in a very autonomous way. Ground support minimizes the computational load of the remote system. High-level information interchange reduces the communication bandwidth requirements.

UAV acquires multiple RGB pictures of the terrain after cruise, and then extracts speed-up robust features (SURF) and perform structure from motion (SFM) to obtain sparse feature point clouds. By utilizing the generated initial depth map, we further propose a novel 3-D reconstruction algorithm named PatchmatchNet-A, which can help to obtain precise and stable estimates of the depth information. In PatchmatchNet-A, we also use a new activation function, adjustable-arctangent linear units (ALU), to improve the accuracy and robustness. We have tested our algorithms in a DTU dataset and found that it can speed up the processing by around 25% while guaranteeing competitive performance. Flight experiments have also been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the whole landing system by using a commercial M210V2 quadcopter.

AB This paper proposes a two-stage multi-lane unsignalized intersection cooperative control strategy based on mixed platoons (MICS-PF) in the mixed traffic environment of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs). In the first stage, we propose a 0-1 integer programming model based on vehicles' intersection movements and potential car-following costs to organize vehicles into mixed platoons led by CAVs. Meanwhile, we design a rule-based algorithm to coordinate the relative distribution of platoons. Then, the lane-changing and car-following models are integrated to ensure that the platoons organization plan can be completed in the limited functional zone. In the second stage, we design an improved minimum covering clique algorithm to generate a conflict-free passing order of platoons by considering the platoon-level conflict relation and the potential yield delay. The proposed strategy couples the process of organizing vehicles into mixed platoons to pass through the intersection. The optimal platoon organization enables CHVs to receive accurate guidance when entering the intersection and avoids the disorderly lane change at the upstream road sections. The mixed platoon control also allows vehicles to avoid stop-and-go, improve the capacity of approach roads, and prevent the intersection capacity from being restricted by the inefficient traffic at the approach road. The conflict-free coordination method of mixed platoons optimizes the throughput of intersections and broadens the usage conditions of unsignalized intersections. A series of simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the strategy, and the applicable boundary conditions are obtained.

AB We propose an integrated path planning method for multiple automated guided vehicles performing logistics delivery within a real-world warehouse environment considering obstacles. By applying it on each vehicle, this proposed method enables the vehicle the vehicles have the capabilities for autonomous path planning. The path planning consists of three parts, K-means algorithm based task points clustering, genetic algorithm based task points ordering, and the probabilistic road map based best path search. Vehicle conflict resolution is depending on implementing the probabilistic road map construction considering the realistic map with obstacles. The simulations result validate that the clustering and ordering are necessary for the path planning, both the path planning time and the Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) running time can be dramatically reduced.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Recent advancements in automated driving technology and vehicle connectivity are associated with the development of advanced predictive control systems for improved performance, energy efficiency, safety, and comfort. This paper designs and compares different linear and nonlinear model predictive control strategies for a typical scenario of urban driving, in which the vehicle is approaching a traffic light crossing. In the linear model predictive control (MPC) case, the vehicle acceleration is optimized at every time instant on a prediction horizon to minimize the root-mean-square error of velocity tracking and RMS acceleration as a comfort metric, thus resulting in a quadratic program (QP). To tackle the vehicle-distance-related traffic light constraint, a linear time-varying MPC approach is used. The nonlinear MPC formulation is based on the first-order lag description of the vehicle velocity profile on the prediction horizon, where only two parameters are optimized: the time constant and the target velocity. To improve the computational efficiency of the nonlinear MPC formulation, multiple linear MPCs, i.e., a parallel MPC, are designed for different fixed-lag time constants, which can efficiently be solved by fast QP solvers. The performance of the three MPC approaches is compared in terms of vehicle velocity tracking error, root-mean-square acceleration, traveled distance, and computational time. The proposed control systems can readily be implemented in future automated driving systems, as well as within advanced driver assist systems such as adaptive cruise control or automated emergency braking systems.

AB Purpose For the crews and assets of the European Union's (EU's) Joint Operations available today, but a vast area in the Mediterranean Sea to monitor, detection of small boats and rafts in distress can take up to several days or even fail at all. This study aims to outline how an energy-autonomous swarm of Unmanned Aerial System can help to increase the monitored sea area while minimizing human resource demand. Design/methodology/approach A concept for an unattended swarm of solar powered, unmanned hydroplanes is proposed. A swarm operations concept, vehicle conceptual design and an initial vehicle sizing method is derived. A microscopic, multi-agent-based simulation model is developed. System characteristics and surveillance performance is investigated in this delimited environment number of vehicles scale. Parameter variations in insolation, overcast and system design are used to predict system characteristics. The results are finally used for a scale-up study on a macroscopic level. Findings Miniaturization of subsystems is found to be essential for energy balance, whereas power consumption of subsystems is identified to define minimum vehicle size. Seasonal variations of solar insolation are observed to dominate the available energy budget. Thus, swarm density and activity adaption to solar energy supply is found to be a key element to maintain continuous aerial surveillance. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted extra-occupationally. Resources were limited to the available range of literature, computational power number and time budget. Practical implications A proposal for a probable concept of operations, as well as vehicle preliminary design for an unmanned energy-autonomous, multi-vehicle system for maritime surveillance tasks, are presented and discussed. Indications on path planning, communication link and vehicle interaction scheme selection are given. Vehicle design drivers are identified and optimization of parameters with significant impact on the swarm system is shown. Social implications The proposed system can help to accelerate the detection of ships in distress, increasing the effectiveness of life-saving rescue missions. Originality/value For continuous surveillance of expanded mission theatres by small-sized vehicles of limited endurance, a novel, collaborative swarming approach applying in situ resource utilization is explored.

AB In this paper, a robust single-input fuzzy logic control Robust Single Input Fuzzy Logic Controller (RSIFLC) scheme is proposed and applied for task-space trajectory control of an autonomous underwater vehicle manipulator system (AUVMS) employed for underwater manipulation tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is numerically demonstrated on a planar underwater vehicle manipulator system [consisting of an underwater vehicle and a two link rotary (2R) serial planar manipulator]. The actuator and sensor dynamics of the system are also incorporated in the dynamical model of an AUVMS. The proposed control law consists of a feedforward term to exaggerate the control activity with immoderation from the known desired acceleration vector and an estimated perturbed term to compensate for the unknown effects namely external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics as a first part and a single-input fuzzy logic control as a feedback portion to enhance the overall closed-loop stability of the system as a second part. The primary objective of the proposed control scheme is to track the given end-effector task space trajectory despite of external disturbances, system uncertainties, and internal noises associated with the AUVMS. To show the efficacy of the proposed control scheme, comparison is made with conventional fuzzy logic control (CFLC), sliding mode control (SMC), and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. Simulation results confirmed that with the proposed control scheme, the AUVMS can successfully track the given desired spatial trajectory and gives better and robust control performance.

In a geometric basin, considering unobservable spaces, their orthogonal complements, and using control invariant properties, a disturbance decoupling mechanism is designed for the mentioned dynamics. Afterward, a nonlinear tracking controller is designed to steer the vehicle on a reference path. The obtained disturbance decoupling and tracking controllers are implemented on a typical passenger car in a simulation environment to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed method. It is shown that the controller decouples both the uniformly distributed and exponentially attenuated disturbances from the output.

AB Ensuring the security of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has been a challenging task, particularly due to the high mobility rate of the many elements in the network. With vehicles constantly moving and frequently exchanging data, authentication is crucial for maintaining security. We propose a new approach based on group authentication to handle authentication of several units simultaneously while protecting privacy in an IoV environment. The proposed protocol is designed to perform an authentication and handover process of multiple users within a predefined group. The group authentication based approach ensures privacy of users as the group members' identification is systematically redefined after each group exchange process. Thus, the proposed scheme is designed to offer a promising solution to security challenges within the IoV environment by simultaneously addressing scalability and protecting the privacy of user data. Additionally, our scheme is resistant to various types of attacks, including offline ID attacks, replay attacks, location spoofing attacks, and replay attacks. Comprehensive tests have been conducted and the results are presented in the analysis section, both in terms of the computational cost and the running times, which reveal that the proposed method demonstrates remarkable practicality when compared to the existing approaches.

TI Cooperative Towing by Multi-Robot System That Maintains Welding Cable in

AB As considerable amounts of welding are required during ship construction, robotic automation is being promoted. However, current welding robots do not automate work in high or narrow places. One reason is that welding cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy because a welding robot with a torch cannot tow a heavy cable and thus may go off path. This letter proposes a multi-robot system for automating the execution of long welds in high and narrow places to address this problem. In the proposed method, towing vehicles are placed along the supply cable to reduce the load on the lead welding vehicle. In confined-space welding, the cable must not be excessively loaded, and obstacles such as walls must be avoided. Under the proposed method, autonomous movement of the towing vehicles is achieved by solving an optimization problem that considers these aims and minimizes the amount of change from the estimated current cable shape. The method was evaluated through simulation and real-world tests, in which it was applied successfully to tow the cable with a welding torch in a working area of 2.6 x 10 m(2) (simulation) and of 3.4 x 5.5 m(2) (real-world environment) without disturbing the lead vehicle's movement.

AB It is believed that the lateral line found in most fish and some other aquatic organisms plays an important role in many behaviors by providing hydrodynamic information about the surrounding fluid. This paper presents a lateral line inspired feedforward control design for the autonomous underwater vehicles. The goal of this paper is to improve maneuvering accuracy for underwater exploration and environmental monitoring. The proposed controller takes pressure measurements at multiple locations over the entire vehicle hull and forms a B-spline surface approximation of the pressure distribution. Hydrodynamic forces acting on the vehicle are then estimated and passed to the controller for the improved trajectory tracking performance. The algorithm is formulated in such a way that the force estimation is a linear, fixed weight combination of the pressure signals, which enables rapid online computation. The performance of the feedforward controller is simulated in conjunction with the "robust integral of the sign of the error" control design. Trajectory tracking is investigated for control accuracy in the presence of localization errors. Reduced tracking errors are observed with the feedforward design. Experimental tests with pressure sensors on a moving cylinder further vindicate the force estimation algorithm.

DT Article
DE Flow field identification; Autonomous underwater vehicles; Underwater
   navigation; Environmental mapping
AB Motivated by the desire to improve the navigation performance of small autonomous underwater vehicles, we seek simple methods for modeling the local flow that affects the vehicle's trajectory. We propose a low-complexity, planar flow field model that consists of a uniform flow component and a singular flow component. Assuming this simplified flow field model, we develop identification algorithms that can be performed quickly using small, sparse data sets collected by a platoon of vehicles. The basic approach involves estimating the uniform flow component, localizing an assumed flow singularity, and identifying the parameters which characterize the singular flow. In order to identify the singular flow component, we propose a least squares and a constrained least squares approach. In the latter case, the minimization is constrained to preserve the average divergence and circulation of the measured flow. Preserving divergence and circulation predictably results in a larger overall error because it eliminates two free model parameters, but it produces a flow model which more realistically captures the flow in the larger region of the measurement points. Numerical simulations and an initial experiment illustrate the parameter identification process as well as the benefits of incorporating a flow field model for vehicle navigation.

AB In the cloud computing era, the analyses of various types of big data gathered from the Internet of Vehicles, the Internet of Things, and smart sensors/devices achieve convenient services. Some famous applications include vehicle traffic loading on roads (from Google MAP), video sharing for fans group (from Facebook or Youtube), and so on. However, to achieve real-time active safe driving (RT-ASD) under unstable driving in high-threat areas on roads becomes an open issue in cloud computing-based intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes a predictive backward shockwave analysis approach (PSA) to achieve the RT-ASD based on the analyses of macroscopic traffic shockwave (PSA_MA) and microscopic car-following (PSA_mi). The PSA contributes in several aspects to active safe driving: 1) predicting and analyzing high threat of backward shockwaves from the gathered big data of the driving state information vehicles; 2) informing the analyzed threat messages to the vehicles in high-threat areas via the 3-Tier hierarchical cloud computing mechanism; 3) reducing the driving threat certainly; and 4) PSA_MA and PSA_mi can be applied for achieving active safe driving in autonomous self-driving vehicles and human-driving vehicles. The numerical results show that the PSA outperforms in approaches to relative error rate prediction, the accuracy of the backward shockwave determination, average vehicle velocity, average travel time, number of goodput vehicles, time-to-collision, and distance-to-collision.

AB Velocity planning is an important module of autonomous driving, which aims to generate the velocity profile given a reference path. However, most existing algorithms fail to adequately address the uncertainty inherent in driving contexts, leading to potentially risky situations. To this end, we propose an efficient safety-enhanced velocity planning algorithm (ESEVP), which uses chance constraints to take uncertainties from trajectory prediction and velocity tracking into account, arising great improvement in driving safety. In addition, ESEVP formulates velocity planning as quadratic programming and explores candidate solutions through a fast planning space construction method, which ensures efficiency and covers all the interaction possibilities. Experimental results obtained from various scenarios demonstrate that ESEVP outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of safety, comfort, and driving efficiency. Besides, we successfully deploy ESEVP in real traffic, showcasing its competitive capabilities in practice.

AB Development of innovative solutions for the maintenance of transport infrastructure facilities is needed in order to ensure a more rational, planned and lower-cost maintenance of transport infrastructure, and to ultimately minimise the risk of catastrophic consequences. A system for an autonomous inspection of structures, based on advanced measuring methods integrated on a wall-climbing robot and an unmanned aerial vehicle, is currently developed in the scope of the ASAP project. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview and draw attention to disadvantages of conventional methods for testing materials and structures in order to assess their condition. This objective was the main motivation for forming a multidisciplinary team through the ASAP project. Possibilities and challenges in the development of an autonomous structural-assessment system are also presented in the paper, with the purpose of increasing the reliability and efficiency of systemic assessment of structures.

ID TOWED-ARRAY
AB The maneuverability of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with hull-mounted arrays provides the opportunity to actively modify received acoustic fields to optimize extraction of information. This paper uses ocean acoustic data collected by an AUV-mounted two-dimensional hydrophone array, with overall dimension one-tenth wavelength at 200-500 Hz, to demonstrate aspects of this control through vehicle motion. Source localization is performed using Doppler shifts measured at a set of receiver velocities by both single elements and a physical array. Results show that a source in the presence of a 10-dB higher-level interferer having exactly the same frequency content (as measured by a stationary receiver) is properly localized and that white-noise-constrained adaptive beamforming applied to the physical aperture data in combination with Doppler bearnforming provides greater spatial resolution than physical-aperture-alone bearnforming and significantly lower sidelobes than single element Doppler beamforming. A new broadband beamformer that adjusts for variations in vehicle velocity on a sample by sample basis is demonstrated with data collected during a high-acceleration maneuver. The importance of including the cost of energy expenditure in determining optimal vehicle motion is demonstrated through simulation, further illustrating how the vehicle characteristics are an integral part of the signal/array processing structure.

AB Lidars are commonly used on autonomous vehicles, but their performance can be significantly affected by adverse weather. A number of studies have been devoted to analyzing and improving lidars' performance in rain, fog, and snow. Yet, relatively little attention has been paid to road spray which occurs when vehicles travel on wet surfaces at high speed. Road spray produced by the vehicles causes false positive point measurements in lidar scans. To evaluate the performance of lidar perception systems or train learning-based perception models, a large amount of data collected in various weather conditions are needed. Unfortunately, collecting spray data is challenging due to the requirements for certain weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain), and vehicles with high speed. In this letter, we propose the first data-driven method combined with simulation to reconstruct and synthesize spray data. The proposed pipeline can be applied to data augmentation by adding spray effects to existing lidar data collected under good weather conditions. We compare the performance of vehicle detection models trained with and without augmented data. The model trained with augmented data achieve significant performance improvement given real-world spray-affected point cloud data.

AB The rail transit system is an essential component of a sustainable transport system, but its accessibility remains a barrier owing to inadequate transit network coverage. Ride-sharing autonomous vehicle (RAV) service is anticipated to be a potentially viable option to improve the economics of rail-based transportation systems (RTS) by substantially lowering the upfront and ongoing costs. In this study, we model and evaluate the impact of RAVs on integrated RTS + first-mile autonomous vehicle design where the commuters' waiting time at railway stations is capped to ensure the level of quality service for rail. The proposed framework optimizes the RAV fleet size while allowing their relocations to tackle the vehicle imbalance problem in the network to assist operators in optimally and effectively running their services. To this end, this study intends to help the relevant Government agency in their planning, where the RTS extension design and RAV operations are planned concurrently to maximize the coverage area with improved accessibility. The modeling framework is solved using mixed-integer linear programming. We applied our proposed framework to the Doncaster railway extension in Melbourne, Australia, to demonstrate the applicability of our modeling framework. Our findings show that increasing rideshare capacity enhanced the operational performance of the integrated services, increased the percentage of AVs performing ride-sharing, and resulted in a shorter RTS alignment and that the RAV-only service is always a costlier option. Finally, the RTS alignment is found to be robust against the variations in capped commuters' waiting time, the disutility of commuter delays by the RAV service, and changes in headway between train trips.

AB Researchers have predicted that "vulnerable road users" (VRUs) such as pedestrians will feel less vulnerable and thus take more risks around autonomous vehicles (AVs) than around humanoperated vehicles (HOVs). However, data on the behaviours pedestrians are likely to display during passing as well as crossing interactions with AVs - particularly from naturalistic studies - are currently lacking. Such data could help inform AV system designers and authorities, as well as researchers. So, a novel study was conducted in London, UK. Perceived vulnerability was gauged via a survey on hypothetical pedestrian-vehicle interactions (N = 267). Behaviours were observed during real crossing and passing interactions with AV shuttle pods in a shared space (N = 330). While pedestrians were the main focus, joggers and cyclists were also frequenting the observation site and were included in the analysis of passing interactions. The survey results showed that pedestrians were not perceived to be less vulnerable around AVs. Diminishing initial boldness in the crossing interactions, and high yielding in the passing interactions, supported this, demonstrating that VRUs were not taking undue risks; rather, they appeared to be experiencing some uncertainty and discomfort. Further results showed other VRU behaviours (gap acceptance, inattention, hesitation, changes in speed, explicit communication, a side preference) may be relevant in AV interactions, but not necessarily to the same degree as when around HOVs or not in line with UK road rules. Positive conclusions were drawn for AV programming, and for safety, at least in the short term, but concerns regarding mobility need addressing.

AB With the significant technological growth that affected autonomous vehicles in the last decade, several consequences occurred as: human factor exclusion, entry and exit manoeuvres precision from roundabouts, and headway reduction. In this paper, it was carried out a microsimulation approach study that aims to evaluate benefits in terms of safety obtained with flower roundabouts in a scenario where traffic is characterized by conventional vehicles "CVs" and Connected Autonomous Vehicles "CAVs". This study focused on the evaluation of CAVs and CVs operation with the presence of the so called "weak users" or rather, pedestrians and bikes. Then, simulated scenarios were characterized by the presence of zebra-crossings in main roads, positioned at 20 m from circulatory carriageway edges. Micro simulation choice is due to the absence of survey data collection because the presence of CAVs in ordinary traffic is still minimal. The micro simulation was carried out through VISSIM, so it was operated with a specific methodological path, consisting, in the application, of O-D matrix based on real cases, in order to achieve an assessment of potential conflicts in relation with the increase in CAVs. Simulation results showed that higher safety levels were achieved for special cases of O-D distribution and with CAVs present. Finally, considering crash absence in results related to CAVs presence, safety interventions of such roundabout types have to be thorough. There were 10 O/D matrices analysed through VISSIM considering parameters as: average tail length, maximum tail length, average speed, vehicles, and number of stops quantity. As reported in the conclusion section, O/D matrices that showed minimum conflicts and maximum dynamic performances were identified.

AB AUV play an important role in the exploration and utilization of the ocean. Underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used in these missions due to the associated low manufacturing costs, low power consumption, and high reliability. Among many control problems of underactuated AUVs, the research of trajectory tracking and formation control methods has become a hot topic in recent years. In order to obtain superior control performance, research on trajectory tracking and formation control of underactuated AUVs based on intelligent control methods should be further advanced and deepened. In this context, we present a survey of intelligent trajectory tracking and formation control of underactuated AUVs, which is beneficial to researchers in this field. To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter, we review some preliminary knowledge in trajectory tracking and formation control of underactuated AUVs. We also highlight research problems and challenges, including external disturbances, system characteristics, and system faults. We review recent advances in intelligent trajectory tracking and formation control of underactuated AUVs and analyze and discuss their characteristics. Moreover, we put forward some prospects of advanced control techniques, especially AI-based techniques for underactuated AUVs.

AB The rising sea levels caused by the climate crisis are causing significant changes in the coastal environment of the Korean Peninsula, leading to increased demand for coastal erosion protection. Accurate bathymetric information is crucial for implementing effective prevention measures. However, existing methods such as the airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) bathymetry (ALB) and multibeam echo sounder (MBES) are not cost-effective for small-scale regions, and the single-beam echo sounder (SBES) method using manned survey vessels is challenging to use in low-water-depth areas. In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) to conduct bathymetric surveying at a very small water depth of less than 2.0 m. The survey was conducted by connecting SBES and network real-time kinematic (N-RTK) positioning data to a small, self-developed ASV. The vessel was autonomously navigated using N-RTK positioning data during most measurement operations, allowing for precise sounding intervals using a simple waypoint setting for each planned sidetrack without direct steering. The bathymetric measurements of exposed or partially exposed rocks at average water depths of 2.0 m or less could be obtained from the bathymetric surveying using the unmanned vessel and devices applied in this study.

ID DESIGN; AI
AB The uncertainty due to road fluctuations and vision system dynamics represents a big challenge to adjusting the steering angle of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Furthermore, AVs require fast action to follow the target lane to overcome lateral deviation with minor errors. In this regard, this paper introduces a fast model predictive controller formulated based on the discrete-time Laguerre function (DTLF) to overcome the high computational burden of the traditional MPC. To improve the hybrid DTLF-MPC performance, a modern and effective dandelion optimizer (DO) strategy is used in this work, which resulted in obtaining the optimal DTLF-MPC parameters and achieving satisfactory results. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid DTLF-MPC is designed based on different algorithms in the literature to evaluate the performance of the DO. Several scenarios are discussed in this paper to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control strategy system against the vision system uncertainty and road fluctuations. The results emphasize that the proposed DTLF-MPC based on the DO can achieve the best damping performance for the lateral deviations with less overshoot; around 0.4533, and a settling time of around 0.01979 s compared with other algorithms.

ID DESIGN
AB In order to improve braking performance of the intelligent vehicle, a pedestrian collision avoidance control model for autonomous emergency braking pedestrian (AEB-P) system based on the fuzzy neural network (FNN) and genetic algorithm (GA) theory is proposed. In this research, we construct a backpropagation (BP) feedforward FNN-GA model for the AEB-P system. Aiming at to solve the problem that initial training parameters of the FNN model generate randomly, they are optimized by fusing the fuzzy neural network with GA. Simulation results show that training epochs reduce from 800 to 60 and training error changes from [-0.06, +0.06] to [-0.04, +0.04] after optimization. Moreover, the maximum model error lessens from 0.058 to 0.0351 and sample total error decreases from 0.0179 to 0.0068. At last, the proposed scheme is applied to the China New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP) simulation test scenarios. Output curves of vehicle distance, velocity, deceleration become smoother and the maximum error decreases from 0.51 m/s(2) to 0.26 m/s(2), which verifies the proposed FNN-GA control strategy for AEB-P system is effective and reliable.

ID ARCHITECTURE; AUV
AB In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for ocean interventions. Typical operations imply the pre-loading of a pre-generated mission plan into the AUV before being launched. Once deployed, the AUV waits for a start command to begin the execution of the plan. An onboard mission manager is responsible for handling the events that may prevent the AUV from following the plan. This approach considers the management of the mission only at the vehicle level. However, the use of a mission-level manager in coordination with the onboard mission manager could improve the handling of exogenous events that cannot be handled fully at the vehicle level. Moreover, the use of vehicle virtualization by the mission-level manager can ease the use of older AUVs. In this paper, we propose a new mission-level manager to be run at a control station. The proposed mission manager, named Missions and Task Register and Reporter (MTRR), follows a decentralized hierarchical control pattern for self-adaptive systems, and provides a basic virtualization in regard to the AUV's planning capabilities. The MTRR has been validated as part of the SWARMs European project. During the final trials we assessed its effectiveness and measured its performance. As a result, we have identified a strong correlation between the length of mission plan and the time required to start a mission (rho(s) = 0.79, n = 45, p 0.001). We have also identified a possible bottleneck when accessing the repositories for storing the information from the mission. Specifically, the average time for storing the received state vectors in the relational database represented only 18.50% of the average time required for doing so in the semantic repository.

AB In order to reduce the number of vehicle collisions and average travel time when vehicles pass through an unsignalized intersection with connected and automated vehicle, an improved Double Dueling Deep Q Network method with Convolutional Neutral Network and Long Short-Term Memory is presented in this article. This method designs a multi-step reward and penalty method to alleviate the sparse reward problem using positive and negative reward experience replay buffer. The proposed method is validated in a simulation environment with different traffic flow and market penetration under the mixed traffic conditions of automated vehicles and human-driving vehicles. The results show that compared with traditional signal control methods, the proposed method can effectively improve the convergence and stability of the algorithm, reduce the number of collisions, and reduce the average travel time under different traffic conditions.

AB How to determine the absolute position of users, such as underwater autonomous vehicles, ships or other long-range vehicles, is a fascinating and challenging issue, especially in global navigation satellite system -denied environments. In this article, a bioinspired global autonomous positioning system based on polarized skylight is proposed. By comparing with the related literatures, the system is able to global positioning based on the degree of polarization pattern (DoP) pattern. To be more specific, in an attempt to use the DoP pattern for the geolocalization purposes, a bioinspired polarization compass is designed and in addition, an overall maximum DoP (MDoP) determination algorithm is presented. Moreover, on the basis of the MDoP value, the sun elevation angle can be ultimately measured by using the DoP pattern. The sun elevation angle difference algorithm is used to deduce the absolute position of users. Finally, the bioinspired global autonomous positioning system is developed and validated through experiments. The test results show that the location errors are in range of few kilometers, of which the latitude accuracy is 0.113 degrees (1 sigma), and the longitude accuracy is 0.082 degrees (1 sigma).

AB Data Subset selection for training learning models for a variety of tasks, has been widely studied in the literature of batch mode active learning. Recent works attempt to utilize the model specific signals in the deep learning context for computer vision tasks. Companies, in their bid to create safe autonomous driving models, train and test their models on billions of miles of driving data; not all of which may be valuable for a training task. In this paper, we study the problem of frame-subset selection from autonomous vehicle driving data, for the problem of semantic segmentation - which is a crucial component of the perception module in an autonomous driving system. We find that state of the art methods for deep active learning do not utilize pairwise similarity between incoming and existing frames. We explore both active learning settings, where labels for incoming points are not available, as well as frame selection settings and find that our method selects more valuable frames than only score-based frame subset selection, or frame subset selection without label information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using DeeplabV3+ model on both benchmark as well as datasets generated by driving simulators. Our generated dataset and code will be made publicly available. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are a major development direction in international scientific and technological innovation. One of the most popular features of SAVs in the urban space is that they can significantly reduce the need for parking. The urban underground parking space (UPS) is currently the largest static traffic space, especially in high-density urban centers. Under the SAV scenario, the need for the renewal of UPS will increase in the near future. However, renewal of the UPS is difficult due to its special form features, which are greatly restricted by the external environment, thus necessitating targeted methods and strategies. This research first conducted field investigations and data collection on the spatial morphology and service conditions of typical UPSs in different areas of Hangzhou city. Based on the driver status response and the multi-objective attribute models, the time-series evaluation method and function replacement decision model for the sustainable renewal of underground parking were established. The research also discusses appropriate design strategies for the combination of spatial characteristics and functional replacement goals of typical samples. The conclusions will provide scientific guidance for the future design practice of architects and urban designers in SAV.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are considered one of the most disruptive technology innovations due to issues of customers' acceptance based on safety, ethics, etc. Along with the rapid advancement of smart cities' demand for this technology, getting customer acceptance of this futuristic technology is a serious concern in the AV industry. This paper modified the technology acceptance model to find out factors influencing customers' intention to use AV such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, and facilitating condition, and the moderating effects of demographic variables (gender, age, family size, income, education level, and marital status) on the relationship between predictors and intention to use AV. Online questionnaires were distributed to 318 participants in South Korea and the data was analyzed through multiple regression and integration moderation test. The findings show that social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived usefulness are three important variables of AV usage intention. In addition, demographic variables (age, marital status, family size, and educational level) can moderate effect of PU and SI on intention to use AV. Strategic directions are suggested to managers to increase the possibility of customers' acceptance of AV.

AB In this paper, a robust control scheme is developed for time-varying formation of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with disturbances under input saturation. Firstly, the reference trajectory of the follower is defined using a body-fixed coordinate transformation based on the leader position and predetermined time-varying formation. Next, three new additional control terms are proposed to handle the input saturation and underactuation problems of AUVs, respectively. On the basis of the above, the robust formation control law is designed incorporating a disturbance observer into the dynamic surface control (DSC) method, where the disturbance observer is constructed to online estimate unknown time-varying disturbances. The designed formation control law does not depend on the leader's acceleration due to using DSC and the mass matrix in the dynamic model of AUVs is non-diagonal, which is more realistic. Strict stability analysis indicates that the designed robust formation control law can make AUVs achieve the predefined time-varying formation, while guaranteeing uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals of the AUV formation closed-loop control systems. Simulation results on three AUVs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation control scheme.

ID SERVICE
AB A fault-tolerant routing system is highly needed in autonomous unmanned vehicle (AUxV)-based networks because of the various constraints due to adversarial situations present in the environment of AUxVs. Critical consequences might be resulting even with a minor fault in the system software/hardware in these types of systems due to the involved hazard of their applications such as search and rescue, threat surveillance, and chemical and biohazard sampling. The architecture, capability, application, and power of the internal systems are the parameters that vary among the AUxV network member nodes. Fault-tolerant system design is a key aspect for AUxVs, and heterogeneity is to be considered while designing the fault-tolerant systems' AUxVs. This paper describes an approach to fault-tolerant AUxV networks by designing a routing method. The proposed algorithm for AUxVs is based on the cross-layer design and the learning automata (LA), referred as Unmanned Vehicle Network with LA-based Routing using Cross-Layer Design (ULARC). The optimal path between the source and the destination is obtained using the theory of LA. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is proved by the proof of convergence and is shown in the Appendix.

AB The sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks are envisioned to revolutionize customer services and applications via the Internet of Things (IoT) toward a future of fully intelligent and autonomous systems. In this article, we explore the emerging opportunities brought by 6G technologies in IoT networks and applications, by conducting a holistic survey on the convergence of 6G and IoT. We first shed light on some of the most fundamental 6G technologies that are expected to empower future IoT networks, including edge intelligence, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, space-air-ground-underwater communications, Terahertz communications, massive ultrareliable and low-latency communications, and blockchain. Particularly, compared to the other related survey papers, we provide an in-depth discussion of the roles of 6G in a wide range of prospective IoT applications via five key domains, namely, healthcare IoTs, Vehicular IoTs and Autonomous Driving, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Satellite IoTs, and Industrial IoTs. Finally, we highlight interesting research challenges and point out potential directions to spur further research in this promising area.

AB Mandatory lane change (MLC) is the core of lane-specific motion planning for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To model the MLC for CAVs, this paper presented a decentralized cooperative MLC (DC-MLC) framework. The framework aimed to achieve a safe MLC maneuver with multiple-CAV cooperation, including the lane change times, positions, and trajectories for the CAVs, while minimizing the impacts of the MLC maneuver on overall traffic. This problem was rigorously formulated and solved by an analytical method that significantly decreases computational time and renders the methodology suitable for practical implementations. To evaluate the performance of the proposed DC-MLC framework, we built a CAV testing environment by referring to the next generation simulation program (NGSIM) US 101 dataset. A series of numerical experiments were conducted under the built CAV testing environment. The results showed that the proposed DC-MLC framework could achieve safe, traffic-efficient, and comfortable MLC maneuvers. Moreover, the trajectories generated by the proposed DC-MLC framework outperformed those of human drivers in terms of speed standard deviation, maximum acceleration/deceleration, and maximum acceleration jerk.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are subjected to several induced roll-destabilizing internal/external moments. Thus, roll control is a significant issue for many researchers, designers, and engineers to define, design, or perform the desired AUV missions due to the coupled dynamics of roll and other degrees of freedom (DOFs). In this paper, the roll dynamics and control enhancement of a REMUS AUV is studied using a four-decoupled-fins (FDF) roll control system by developing a 6DOF simulator. The results show that: 1) the roll angle deflections considerably affect the other degrees of freedom due to their coupled dynamics in both open-loop and closedloop systems; 2) In large roll angle deflections, the FDF system (70% stern and 30% rudder fins) is needed to produce sufficient minimum oscillatory roll control forces. 3) The fins incident flow has lower energies in producing the roll control forces in lower forward speeds, causing the fluctuations of actuators' inputs and trajectory paths. 4) A limited but considerable desired roll angle can be achieved at a given forward speed; the maximum value of desired roll angle is 62 circle for the desired forward speed of 4 m/s.

   SCHEME
AB Escorting a moving object in a subsea environment with cooperative autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is a typical subject in Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT) applications. It involves two issues that should be studied. First, a mobile task assignment method is required to lead the AUVs to the escorting positions; then, a formation control scheme should be utilized to safely escort the moving object to the destination. Accordingly, in this article, a comprehensive target escorting mechanism called the cooperative-control-based underwater target estimating mechanism (CUTE) is proposed, which includes a belief-function-method-based self-organizing map algorithm for task assignment and an artificial potential field-based formation control method. The task assignment method aims to establish smooth routes from the AUVs to the escort position while flexibly avoiding obstacles, and the formation control method aims to improve the monitoring coverage on the escort route by rotating the formation structure while following the moving object. Simulations show that the proposed CUTE method may be very practical in underwater target escorting scenarios.

AB This study suggests a simple searching technique for obstacle-avoidance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in varying ocean environments by using the self-tuning fuzzy controller. The corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients for the AUV are obtained by the test of Planar Motion Mechanism (PMM), which serves as the important data inputs for the control system. Subsequently, the self-tuning fuzzy controller would be adopted to command the propulsion of AUVs. The function of obstacle-avoidance is based on the underwater image detection method with the BK triangle subproduct of fuzzy relations which can evaluate the safety and remoteness of the candidate routes and the successive optimal heading of strategic routing can then be selected. In the present simulations, four types of motion control factors are selected as the platform to investigate the maneuvering performance of obstacle-avoidance, i.e. self-tuning control, visibility, safety and current effect. Eventually, the present study indicates that the self-tuning fuzzy controller, combined with the image detection technique based on BK triangle sub-product of fuzzy relations, is verified to be a useful searching technique for obstacle-avoidance of AUVs.

AB For autonomous driving, one of the major challenges is to predict pedestrian crossing intention in ego-view. Pedestrian intention depends not only on their intrinsic goals but also on the stimulation of surrounding traffic elements. Considering the influence of other traffic elements on pedestrian intention, recent work introduced more traffic element information into the model to successfully improve performance. However, it is still difficult to effectively capture and fully exploit the potential dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements for accurate reasoning. In this work, inspired by neuroscience that human drivers tend to make continuous sensory-motor driving decisions by progressive visual stimulation, we propose a model termed Progressive Interaction Transformer (PIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. Local pedestrian, global environment, and ego-vehicle motion are considered simultaneously in the proposed PIT. In particular, the temporal fusion block and self-attention mechanism are introduced to jointly and progressively model the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions among the three parties, allowing it to capture richer information and make prediction in a similar way to human drivers. Experimental results demonstrate that PIT achieves higher performance compared with other state-of-the-arts and preserves real-time inference.

AB This paper proposes a switched velocity-dependent path-following control method for autonomous ground vehicles under uncertain cornering stiffness and time-varying velocity. A switched polytopic linear-parameter-varying (LPV) model combining path-following and vehicle lateral dynamics is established, where the velocity-dependent parameters are divided into several switched regions. In each region, a trapezoidal polytope is adopted to describe the varying parameters. A global H-infinity performance analysis is carried out for the switched polytopic LPV vehicle system based on the average dwell time approach with multiple Lyapunov functions. Based on the analysis, a switched velocity-dependent controller is synthesized to achieve a desired path-following performance by regulating the steering angle of the front wheels. The proposed switched path-following control specializes in handling large range of varying velocity, and achieves superior path-following performance compared with the conventional gain-scheduling control. Simulations are carried out for typical road maneuvers to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. The results are also applicable to other LPV analysis and synthesis conditions involving time-varying parameters of large varying ranges.

ID KALMAN FILTER; LOCALIZATION
AB For the problem of pose estimation of an autonomous vehicle using networked external sensors, the processing capacity and battery consumption of these sensors, as well as the communication channel load should be optimized. Here, we report an event-based state estimator (EBSE) consisting of an unscented Kalman filter that uses a triggering mechanism based on the estimation error covariance matrix to request measurements from the external sensors. This EBSE generates the events of the estimator module on-board the vehicle and, thus, allows the sensors to remain in stand-by mode until an event is generated. The proposed algorithm requests a measurement every time the estimation distance root mean squared error (DRMS) value, obtained from the estimator's covariance matrix, exceeds a threshold value. This triggering threshold can be adapted to the vehicle's working conditions rendering the estimator even more efficient. An example of the use of the proposed EBSE is given, where the autonomous vehicle must approach and follow a reference trajectory. By making the threshold a function of the distance to the reference location, the estimator can halve the use of the sensors with a negligible deterioration in the performance of the approaching maneuver.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) simulation using a virtual environment has the advantage of being able to test algorithms in various scenarios with reduced resources. However, there may exist a visual gap between the virtual environment and the real-world. In this paper, in order to mitigate this gap, we trained Dual Contrastive Learning Generative Adversarial Networks (DCLGAN) to realistically convert the image of the CARLA simulator and then evaluated the effect of the Sim2Real conversion focusing on the lane keeping assist system (LKAS). Moreover, in order to avoid the case where the lane is translated distortedly by DCLGAN, we found the optimal training hyperparameters using feature similarity (FSIM). After training, we built a system that connected the CARLA simulator with DCLGAN and AV in real-time. As for the result, we collected data and analyzed them using the following four methods. First, image reality was measured with Frechet Inception Distance (FID), which we quantitatively verified to reflect the lane characteristics. The CARLA images that passed through DCLGAN had smaller FID values than the original images. Second, lane segmentation accuracy through ENet-SAD was improved by DCLGAN. Third, in the curved route, the case of using DCLGAN drove closer to the center of the lane and had a high success rate. Lastly, in the straight route, DCLGAN improved lane restoring ability after deviating from the center of the lane as much as in reality. Consequently, it convinced that the proposed method could be applicable to mitigate the gap of simulation toward real-world.

AB This study presents an intelligent distribution framework based on edge computing and proposes navigation and obstacle avoidance algorithms for connected logistics vehicles (CLVs) on the basis of Trimble BD982 positioning sensor and tentacle algorithm (TA). An edge computing framework for the distribution of CLVs is established, and the functions of three layers (cloud server, edge equipment, and terminal) are described in detail. The basic functions, hardware, and software systems of the CLV are designed and presented. Focusing on autonomous driving, a Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation algorithm and an obstacle avoidance control strategy on the layer of edge equipment are developed on the basis of the TA. Autonomous GPS navigation is realized by combining the entire road network with the local road network to avoid obstacles. The TA is improved to help the CLV for avoiding obstacles. Experiments show that the hardware system and designed algorithms of the CLV are effective. The tracking error on the straight-line track is within 3 cm, the change rate of longitudinal velocity is within 0.3 g/s, the change rate of tire side deflection angle is less than 1 degrees/s, and the calculation time is shortened by 25% when the calculation time is 30 ms. These results indicate that the vehicle has good stability and performance during obstacle avoidance in real time, and the proposed algorithms are superior to traditional algorithms. The CLV can realize autonomous GPS navigation, with high navigation accuracy, reliable obstacle avoidance performance, and stable vehicle handling.

ID WAY-POINT TRACKING; UNDERACTUATED AUVS
AB In this paper, a control scheme is designed for the trajectory tracking problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles with input saturation, parameter uncertainty, and disturbance. First, a novel continuous desired heading angle is designed, which is better than traditional tracking error-based desired angle design and excludes the discontinuity problem of the desired angle in traditional design. Second, based on the desired heading angle design, dynamic surface control is introduced, which reduces the computational complexity, and the desired speed can be obtained. A compensation filter is used to compensate for the loss caused by the input saturation of the control signal. Third, novel velocity compensation laws are designed to compensate the sway velocity, which can overcome the challenge of underactuation. Moreover, the parameter uncertainty issue, which widely exists in most engineering systems, can also be handled by the novel velocity compensation laws. In the simulation, the performance of the desired heading angle and velocity compensation law designed in this paper are compared, and simulation results verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.

AB While much attention has been paid to data centers' greenhouse gas emissions, less attention has been paid to autonomous vehicles' (AVs) potential emissions. In this work, we introduce a framework to probabilistically model the emissions from computing onboard a global fleet of AVs and show that the emissions have the potential to make a nonnegligible impact on global emissions, comparable to that of all data centers today. Based on current trends, a widespread AV adoption scenario where approximately 95% of all vehicles are autonomous requires computer power to be less than 1.2 kW for emissions from computing on AVs to be less than emissions from all data centers in 2018 in 90% of modeled scenarios. Anticipating a future scenario with high adoption of AVs, business-as-usual decarbonization, and workloads doubling every three years, hardware efficiency must double every 1.1 years for emissions in 2050 to equal 2018 data center emissions. The rate of increase in hardware efficiency needed in many scenarios to contain emissions is faster than the current rate. We discuss several avenues of future research unique to AVs to further analyze and potentially reduce the carbon footprint of AVs.

AB This paper introduces the localization method of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in environments (such as harbors or ports) where there can be passing ships near the AUV. It is assumed that the AUV can access the trajectory and approximate source level of a passing ship, while identifying the ship by processing the ship's sound. This paper considers an AUV which can localize itself by integrating propeller and Inertial Measurement Units (IMU). Suppose that the AUV has been moving in underwater environments for a long time, under the IMU-only localization. To fix long-term drift in the IMU-only localization, we propose that the AUV localization uses sound measurements of passing ships whose trajectories are known a priori. As far as we know, this AUV localization method is novel in using sound measurements of passing ships of which the trajectories are known a priori. The performance of the proposed localization method is verified utilizing MATLAB simulations. The simulation results show significant estimation improvements, compared to IMU-only localization. Moreover, using measurements from multiple ships gives better estimation results, compared to the case where the measurement of a single ship is used.

AB Technology of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is becoming mature, and many AVs will appear on roads in the near future. AVs become connected with the support of various vehicular communication technologies, and they possess a high degree of control to respond to instantaneous situations cooperatively with high efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a new public transportation system based on AVs. It manages a fleet of AVs to accommodate transportation requests, offering point-to-point services with ride sharing. We focus on the two major problems of the system: scheduling and admission control. The former is to configure the most economical schedules and routes for the AVs to satisfy the admissible requests, whereas the latter is to determine the set of admissible requests among all requests to produce maximum profit. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and the admission control problem is cast as a bilevel optimization, which embeds the scheduling problem as the major constraint. By utilizing the analytical properties of the problem, we develop an effective genetic-algorithm-based method to tackle the admission control problem. We validate the performance of the algorithm with real-world transportation service data.

ID MONTEREY BAY
AB Coastal upwelling is a wind-driven ocean process. It brings cooler, saltier, and usually nutrient-rich deep water upward to replace surface water displaced offshore due to Ekman transport. The nutrients carried up by upwelling are important for primary production and fisheries. Ocean life can aggregate at the boundary between stratified water and upwelling water-the upwelling front. In an upwelling water column, temperature, salinity, and other water properties are much more homogeneous over depth than in stratified water. Drawing on this difference, we set up a key measure for differentiating upwelling and stratified water columns-the vertical temperature difference between shallow and deep depths. The vertical temperature difference is large in stratified water but small in upwelling water. Based on this classifier, we developed a method for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to autonomously detect and track an upwelling front. During the Controlled, Agile, and Novel Observing Network (CANON) Experiment in April 2011, the Tethys long-range AUV ran the algorithm to autonomously track an upwelling front in a dynamic coastal upwelling region in Monterey Bay, CA. The AUV transected the upwelling front 14 times over two days, providing a very high-resolution depiction of the front.

AB Dynamic traffic demand has been a longstanding challenge for the conventional transit system design and operation. The recent development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) makes it increasingly realistic to develop the next generation of transportation systems with the potential to improve operational performance and flexibility. In this study, we propose an innovative transit system with autonomous modular buses (AMBs) that is adaptive to dynamic traffic demands and not restricted to fixed routes and timetables. A unique transfer operation, termed as "in-motion transfer", is introduced in this paper to transfer passengers between coupled modular buses in motion. A two-stage model is developed to facilitate in-motion transfer operations in optimally designing passenger transfer plans and AMB trajectories at intersections. In the proposed AMB system, all passengers can travel in the shortest path smoothly without having to actually alight and transfer between different bus lines. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed transit system results in shorter travel time and a significantly reduced average number of transfers. While enjoying the above-mentioned benefits, the modular, adaptive, and autonomous transit system (MAATS) does not impose substantially higher energy consumption in comparison to the conventional bus system.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB In this paper, a novel model predictive control (MPC) method based on the population normal probability division genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization (GA-ACO) method is proposed to optimally solve the problem of standard MPC with constraints that generally cannot yield global optimal solutions when using quadratic programming (QP). Combined with dynamic sliding mode control (SMC), this model is applied to the dynamic trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). First, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation platform ANSYS Fluent is used to solve for the main hydrodynamic coefficients required to establish the AUV dynamic model. Then, the novel model predictive controller is used to obtain the desired velocity command of the AUV. To reduce the influence of external interference and realize accurate velocity tracking, dynamic SMC is used to obtain the control input command. In addition, stability analysis based on the Lyapunov method proves the asymptotic stability of the controller. Finally, the trajectory tracking performance of the AUV in an underwater, three-dimensional environment is verified by using the MATLAB/Simulink simulation platform. The results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control method.

ID RADAR
AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on a set of radar sensors used to map surrounding environment. Most commonly used radar sensors for AVs use Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) ramps for object parameter (i.e., range and relative velocity) estimation. Due to large bandwidth requirement of FMCW radar, only a limited number of AVs can be operated in the available spectrum. Consequently, the co-existence of large number of AVs may lead to the problem of radar-to-radar interference, also referred to as radar blindness. Moreover, the problem becomes more severe in the higher traffic scenarios. In this work, we propose a Traffic-based Adaptive Ramp Packing (TRAP) scheme, which adapts radar range and assigns FMCW ramp parameters on the basis of inter-vehicular distance among AVs. Specifically, TRAP scheme allows to make effective use of the available time-frequency resource, and enables to pack more ramps in the dense traffic scenarios. Further, it is shown that adaptive radar range adoption may provide significantly more number of ramps in the given bandwidth. Furthermore, through simulation results, it is shown that TRAP significantly reduces the blind probability against state-of-the-art fixed range schemes.

AB Task assignment is an important research topic in multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cooperative working system. However, many studies concentrate on minimizing total distance of AUVs serving targets at different locations, and mostly do not pay attention to workload balance among inhomogeneous AUVs. What is more, most of them do not think of the effect of ocean current while distributing tasks. To solve these problems, a novel dual competition strategy based on self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is put forward. An AUV makes use of surplus sailing distance to a target when it competes with others for engaging the target. In order to fulfill a balanced task assignment among AUVs, a task balance coefficient is also proposed. Meanwhile, a hybrid path planning approach is applied to guide AUVs to reach their targets safely. The good performance of the proposed algorithm for distributing tasks among AUVs is demonstrated through simulation studies. From the comparison study of SOM algorithm, Hungarian algorithm, k-means algorithm, and the proposed dual competition strategy, it can be found that the task assignment with the proposed strategy is more rational and fair.

AB The ocean bottom flying node is a novel autonomous underwater vehicle that explores the oil and gas resources in deep water. Thousands of the ocean bottom flying nodes track different predefined trajectories arriving at target points in a small ocean area, respectively. A class of prescribed performance adaptive trajectory tracking control method is investigated for the ocean bottom flying node trajectory tracking problem with ocean current disturbances, model uncertainties as well as thruster faults. Based on a predefined performance function and an error transformation, the ocean bottom flying node trajectory tracking error is restricted to prespecified bounds to ensure a desired transient and steady response. Radial basis function neural network is used to approximate the general uncertainty caused by ocean current disturbances, model uncertainties, and thruster faults. Further, the upper bound of approximation error is estimated by an adaptive law. Using the adaptive laws, we propose a prescribed performance adaptive trajectory tracking controller. The simulation examples on an ocean bottom flying node system show that the proposed control scheme can compensate for the effect of the general uncertainty while obtaining the fast transient process and expected trajectory tracking accuracy.

ID VEHICLES; OPERATION; MANEUVERS; SYSTEMS
AB Collision avoidance is one of the most difficult and challenging automatic driving operations in the domain of intelligent vehicles. In emergency situations, human drivers are more likely to brake than to steer, although the optimal maneuver would, more frequently, be steering alone. This statement suggests the use of automatic steering as a promising solution to avoid accidents in the future. The objective of this paper is to provide a collision avoidance system (CAS) for autonomous vehicles, focusing on pedestrian collision avoidance. The detection component involves a stereo-vision-based pedestrian detection system that provides suitable measurements of the time to collision. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed using fuzzy controllers for the actuators that mimic human behavior and reactions, along with a high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides the information needed for the autonomous navigation. The proposed system is evaluated in two steps. First, drivers' behavior and sensor accuracy are studied in experiments carried out by manual driving. This study will be used to define the parameters of the second step, in which automatic pedestrian collision avoidance is carried out at speeds of up to 30 km/h. The performed field tests provided encouraging results and proved the viability of the proposed approach.

AB Remote-controlled (RC) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used to study the movement of agricultural threat agents (e.g., plant and animal pathogens, invasive weeds, and exotic insects) above crop fields, but these RC UAVs are operated entirely by a ground-based pilot and often demonstrate large fluctuations in sampling height, sampling pattern, and sampling speed. In this paper, we describe the development and application of an autonomous UAV for precise aerobiological sampling tens to hundreds of meters above agricultural fields. We equipped a Senior Telemaster UAV with four aerobiological sampling devices and a MicroPilot-based autonomous system, and we conducted 25 sampling flights for potential agricultural threat agents at Virginia Tech's Kentland Farm. To determine the most appropriate sampling path for aerobiological sampling above crop fields with an autonomous UAV, we explored five different sampling patterns, including multiple global positioning system (GPS) waypoints plotted over a variety of spatial scales. An orbital sampling pattern around a single GPS waypoint exhibited high positional accuracy and produced altitude standard deviations ranging from 1.6 to 2.8 m. Autonomous UAVs have the potential to extend the range of aerobiological sampling, improve positional accuracy of sampling paths, and enable coordinated flight with multiple UAVs sampling at different altitudes.

AB Accurately estimating the pose of a vehicle is important for autonomous parking. The study of around view monitor (AVM)-based visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has gained attention due to its affordability, commercial availability, and suitability for parking scenarios characterized by rapid rotations and back-and-forth movements of the vehicle. In real-world environments, however, the performance of AVM-based visual SLAM is degraded by AVM distortion errors resulting from an inaccurate camera calibration. Therefore, this paper presents an AVM-based visual SLAM for autonomous parking which is robust against AVM distortion errors. A deep learning network is employed to assign weights to parking line features based on the extent of the AVM distortion error. To obtain training data while minimizing human effort, three-dimensional (3D) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and official parking lot guidelines are utilized. The output of the trained network model is incorporated into weighted Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) for vehicle localization under distortion error conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces localization errors by an average of 39% compared with previous AVM-based visual SLAM approaches.

AB Technologies such as Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) increasingly disrupt traditional manufacturing and production systems. However, there is a scarcity of empirical studies synthesising and evaluating the impact of disruptive technologies on existing manufacturing systems. This study examines the impact of AGVs applying IoT on Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) through a case study demonstrating the integration of AGVs with IoT in a manufacturing company. As a concept, FMS was conceived decades ago; this study uses socio-technical systems theory to elaborate the concept of FMS into the current context. Key themes uncovered from the literature review include (i) AGVs in warehouse systems, (ii) AGV scheduling and routing, (iii) Human-machine interface, and (iv) integrating and controlling AGVs/IoT. The case study demonstrates how AGVs can create smart, flexible manufacturing systems by taking the following steps: (a) problem identification, (b) performance measurement, (c) designing the proposed solution, (d) evaluate IoT systems, (e) implementation of the new solution, and (f) future improvements. The study concludes with specific recommendations to implement Industry 4.0 in manufacturing companies.

AB 6-DoF visual localization systems utilize principled approaches rooted in 3D geometry to perform accurate camera pose estimation of images to a map. Current techniques use hierarchical pipelines and learned 2D feature extractors to improve scalability and increase performance. However, despite gains in typical recall@0.25 m type metrics, these systems still have limited utility for real-world applications like autonomous vehicles because of their worst areas of performance - the locations where they provide insufficient recall at a certain required error tolerance. Here we investigate the utility of using place specific configurations, where a map is segmented into a number of places, each with its own configuration for modulating the pose estimation step, in this case selecting a camera within a multi-camera system. On the Ford AV benchmark dataset, we demonstrate substantially improved worst-case localization performance compared to using off-the-shelf pipelines - minimizing the percentage of the dataset which has low recall at a certain error tolerance, as well as improved overall localization performance. Our proposed approach is particularly applicable to the crowdsharing model of autonomous vehicle deployment, where a fleet of AVs are regularly traversing a known route.

AB In this work, an adaptive learning model predictive control (ALMPC) scheme is proposed for the trajectory tracking of perturbed autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) subject to input constraints. In order to estimate the unknown system parameter, we propose a set-membership-based parameter estimator based on the recursive least-squares (RLS) technique with the ensured nonincreasing estimation error. Then, the estimated system parameter is employed in MPC to improve the prediction accuracy. In the proposed ALMPC scheme, a robustness constraint is introduced into the MPC optimization to handle parametric and additive uncertainties. For the designed robustness constraint, its shape is decided off-line based on the invariant set, whereas its shrinkage rate is updated online according to the estimated upper bound of the estimation error, leading to further reduced conservatism and slightly increased computational complexity compared with the robust MPC methods. Furthermore, it is theoretically shown that the proposed ALMPC algorithm is recursively feasible under some derived conditions, and the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable (ISS). Finally, a numerical example and comparison study are conducted to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB Accurate and reliable relative navigation is the prerequisite to guarantee the effectiveness and safety of various multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperation tasks, when absolute position information is unavailable or inaccurate. Among the UAV navigation techniques, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is widely used due to its worldwide coverage and simplicity in relative navigation. However, the observations of GNSS are vulnerable to different kinds of faults arising from transmission degradation, ionospheric scintillations, multipath, spoofing, and many other factors. In an effort to improve the reliability of multi-UAV relative navigation, an autonomous integrity monitoring method is proposed with a fusion of double differenced GNSS pseudoranges and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) ranging units. Specifically, the proposed method is designed to detect and exclude the fault observations effectively through a consistency check algorithm in the relative positioning system of the UAVs. Additionally, the protection level for multi-UAV relative navigation is estimated to evaluate whether the performance meets the formation flight and collision avoidance requirements. Simulated experiments derived from the real data are designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in autonomous integrity monitoring for multi-UAV relative navigation.

AB In this study, a hierarchical inversion-based output tracking controller (HIOTC) is developed for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subject to random uncertainties (e.g., current disturbances, unmodeled dynamics, and parameter variations) and noises (e.g., process and measurement noises). The proposed HIOTC respectively utilizes a combination of feedforward and feedback controls in a hierarchical structure based on the kinematic and dynamic models of the system. Moreover, to obtain uncontaminated or unavailable states for implementing the proposed control law, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to estimate the system states. Then, the position outputs, orientation, and velocity of the AUV are reached with guaranteed asymptotic stability. The robustness of the proposed HIOTC is verified through injection of random uncertainties into the system model. The closed-loop stability of the proposed individual subsystems is respectively guaranteed to have uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) performance based on the Lyapunov stability criteria. In addition, the asymptotic tracking of the overall system is demonstrated using Barbalat's lemma. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are evaluated through computer simulations and it is shown that the overall system achieves good asymptotic tracking performance.

ID CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT; CONSISTENT
AB Autonomous vehicles offer new traffic behaviors that could revolutionize transportation. Examples include reservation-based intersection control and reduced reaction times that result in greater road capacity. Most studies have used microsimulation models of those new technologies to study their impacts more realistically. However, microsimulation is not tractable for larger networks. Recent developments in simulating reservation-based controls and multiclass cell transmission models for autonomous vehicles in dynamic traffic assignment have allowed studies of larger networks. This paper presents analyses of several highly congested arterial and freeway networks to quantify how reservations and reduced reaction times affect travel times and congestion. Reservations were observed to improve over signals in most situations. However, signals outperformed reservations in a congested network with several close local road and arterial intersections because the capacity allocations of signals were more optimized for the network. Reservations also were less efficient than were traditional merges and diverges for on- and off-ramps. However, the increased capacity from reduced following headways resulted in significant improvements for both freeway and arterial networks. Finally, the authors studied a downtown network, including freeway, arterial, and local roads, and found that the combination of reservations and reduced following headways resulted in a 78% reduction in travel time.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) have recently attracted policymakers, manufacturers, and customers' attention. Despite their numerous benefits, CAVs still have to overcome many challenges related to the implementation and market penetration. When not dominated by financial constraints, the CAV adoption heavily depends on how policymakers and the government address the other challenges, including public perception, rules, and regulations. This study aims at formulating recommendations to support decision-makers in choosing the most appropriate and sustainable strategy to implement CAV technology. To do so, key barriers were first identified based on the literature review and discussions with decision-makers. Moreover, long-term adoption of CAV technologies in alternative future scenarios is developed. Multicriteria decision-making analysis was conducted to weigh these barriers and rank different strategies of CAV implementation. The transportation system of the Sultanate of Oman was used as a study case. It was found that the lack of technical skills and policies/regulations are the main barriers to the adoption of CAV technologies. To overcome these barriers, suggested strategies include establishing low-cost and short-term solutions, providing training to transportation professionals, and investing in statewide radio communications/IoT for emergency responses.

AB There are many types of controllers had been used to control Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) such as Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), state feedback linearization, integrator backstepping, and Sliding-Mode Control (SMC). However, for PID and SMC in particular, it is difficult to determine the optimal control design parameters. The objective of this study is to design and develop a responsive motion control system with optimal parameters for an AUV. The contribution of this paper is in term of introducing a filter to smooth reference signal and proposing a brute forcing technique to find optimal controller parameters. The methodology starts with modeling the AUV, estimating the unknown parameters from a real AUV model, designing a control system based on PI and SMC methods, and finally optimizing the controller parameters. The controller design was onto controlling surge speed using PI, heading using SMC, and diving using SMC. Simulation-wise, the developed control system has an average value of 93.89 % of responsiveness to track desired trajectory while 82.33 % of responsiveness without using the smoothing filter. The tested input signals were unit step, ramp, parabolic, and sinusoidal.

AB This article proposes a holistic localisation framework for underwater robotic swarms to dynamically fuse multiple position estimates of an autonomous underwater vehicle while using fuzzy decision support system. A number of underwater localisation methods have been proposed in the literature for wireless sensor networks. The proposed navigation framework harnesses the established localisation methods in order to provide navigation aids in the absence of acoustic exteroceptive sensors navigation aid (i.e., ultra-short base line) and it can be extended to accommodate newly developed localisation methods by expanding the fuzzy rule base. Simplicity, flexibility, and scalability are the main three advantages that are inherent in the proposed localisation framework when compared to other traditional and commonly adopted underwater localisation methods, such as the Extended Kalman Filter. A physics-based simulation platform that considers environment's hydrodynamics, industrial grade inertial measurement unit, and underwater acoustic communications characteristics is implemented in order to validate the proposed localisation framework on a swarm size of 150 autonomous underwater vehicles. The proposed fuzzy-based localisation algorithm improves the entire swarm mean localisation error and standard deviation by 16.53% and 35.17%, respectively, when compared to the Extended Kalman Filter based localisation with round-robin scheduling.

AB This paper proposes a robust lateral control system with fuzzy state observer based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model of autonomous four-wheel independent drive electric vehicles (A-4WDEVs) considering the roll effects and actuator faults. Firstly, a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model of A-4WDEVs with uncertainties, time-varying parameters and actuator faults is presented, which can describes the coupling lateral and roll dynamic features of A-4WDEVs. Then, a robust H-infinity state feedback lateral control system of A-4WDEVs is proposed to deal with the characteristics of uncertainties and external disturbance and produce the desired front wheel steering angle and external yaw moment of A-4WDEVs. Next, the control allocation law of additional longitudinal tire forces of A-4WDEVs is reviewed as a quadratic programming problem to achieve the desired external yaw moment. Furthermore, a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy observer is designed to estimate the roll angle and roll angle rate of A-4WDEVs in real time. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID ROBOT
AB Ground segmentation is a key component for Autonomous Land Vehicle (ALV) navigation in an outdoor environment. This paper presents a novel algorithm for real-time segmenting three-dimensional scans of various terrains. An individual terrain scan is represented as a circular polar grid map that is divided into a number of segments. A one-dimensional Gaussian Process (GP) regression with a non-stationary covariance function is used to distinguish the ground points or obstacles in each segment. The proposed approach splits a large-scale ground segmentation problem into many simple GP regression problems with lower complexity, and can then get a real-time performance while yielding acceptable ground segmentation results. In order to verify the effectiveness of our approach, experiments have been carried out both on a public dataset and the data collected by our own ALV in different outdoor scenes. Our approach has been compared with two previous ground segmentation techniques. The results show that our approach can get a better trade-off between computational time and accuracy. Thus, it can lead to successive object classification and local path planning in real time. Our approach has been successfully applied to our ALV, which won the championship in the 2011 Chinese Future Challenge in the city of Ordos.

ID WAVE
AB Long-range autonomous underwater vehicles (LRAUVs) generally carry limited energy during observation missions, making it critical to enhance sailing efficiency through optimization design. Therefore, it is essential to understand the relationship between the shape parameters, motion modes, and sailing efficiency. This study proposes a LRAUV energy consumption model considering the variation in seawater density and drive loss, to obtain higher accuracy. In the optimization design, a surrogate model based on the response surface method is applied to establish the functional relationship between shape parameters, sailing parameters, and sailing efficiency. According to the optimization results, the AUV mode shows better efficiency in shallow sea, while the glider mode is more suitable for deep-sea operation. For the AUV mode, the applicable working band increases with the working time at fixed depth and/but decreases with the increase of the angle of attack at fixed depth. For the glider mode, the applicable working band increases the buoyancy compensation coefficient. The hotel load has less impact on the applicable working band for both modes. Based on the proposed method, a Petrel LRAUV with an optimized shape and sailing efficiency is developed, which can also serve as a reference for the preliminary design of other LRAUVs.

AB Accurate navigation and localization are essential for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). However, the unknown modeling errors and nonlinear errors will affect the AUV positioning accuracy. Meanwhile, the marine environment changes may not be accurately sensed by AUV. Therefore, this paper proposes a Hybrid Model (HM) navigation methodology for AUV to reduce the impact of unknown errors and better predict the future states simultaneously. Firstly, an error correction sub-model based on Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) predicts AUV pseudo displacements. The pseudo displacements are augmented to the observation vector to correct the unknown errors in the state estimation. Secondly, a state regression sub-model based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is utilized to capture the motion trends from the historical data and regress the state variation, which is used to resist the unknown disturbances in the changeable marine environment. The sub-models work parallel with the master model, benefiting from the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM). We compare the performance of the proposed HM to Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and IMM-EKF by using the actual experimental data of Sailfish 210 AUV. The experimental results show that the proposed HM algorithm achieves superior navigation accuracy and good fault tolerance capability.

AB This paper presents a novel control scheme for the three-dimensional (3D) path following of underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUVs) subject to unknown internal and external disturbances, in term of the time scale decomposition method. As illustration, two-time scale motions are first artificially forced into the closed-loop control system, by appropriately selecting the control gain of the integrator. Using the singular perturbation theory, the integrator is considered as a fast dynamical control law that designed to shape the space configuration of fast variable. And then the stabilizing controller is designed in the reduced model independently, based on the time scale decomposition method, leading to a relatively simple control law. The stability of the resultant closed-loop system is demonstrated by constructing a composite Lyapunov function. Finally, simulation results are provided to prove the efficacy of the proposed controller for path following of underactuated AUVs under internal and external disturbances.

AB The problem of finite-time path following control for a typical 6-DOF (degree of freedom) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subjected to parametric and modeling uncertainties, disturbances and unknown saturation nonlinearities is studied and discussed in this article. For the mentioned AUV, finite-time control inputs are designed based on innovative terminal sliding surfaces and several finite-time adaptation laws. By means of the designed adaptation laws, the unknown physical parameters of AUVs, the unknown upper bound of uncertainties, and an unknown parameter of input saturation are estimated. By using the Lyapunov stability theorem, it is proven that designed control inputs are able to ensure and provide the practical finite-time stability for the closed-loop AUV system. Furthermore, it is mathematically demonstrated that the tracking errors (defined for the path following problem of the AUV) converge to the vicinity of zero within an adjustable finite time. Finally, the efficacy of the suggested control scheme is demonstrated by the hardware-in-the-loop OPAL real-time test.

AB In this communication, we report results of an experiment in which crude oil adsorbed on Teflon fabric is exposed to conditions expected in natural ocean-surface collection vehicle containers over a period of 3 months. Samples were recovered at designated time points and analyzed to determine degree of preservation of molecular signatures. Ratios of saturate hydrocarbons were preferentially preserved compared to those of aromatic compounds. Unsubstituted aromatic compounds such as naphthalene and dibenzothiophene were removed at higher rates relative to methyl-substituted homologues owing to differences in biodegradability and solubility. Ratios of important marker compounds persist over several months with sufficient fidelity for accurate determination of source-rock facies and thermal maturity. Collection and storage of oil samples on small pieces of adsorbent Teflon mesh broadens the opportunity space for collection of organic geochemistry data. Deployment of automated samplers equipped with such Teflon meshes aboard autonomous surface vehicles and human-operated vessels promises cheaper, better coverage of geochemical data in seep, slick, and spill surveys conducted for research, exploration, monitoring, and emergency response efforts.

AB Free space detection is crucial to autonomous vehicles while existing works are not entirely satisfactory. As cameras have many advantages on environment perception, a stereo vision-based robust free space detection method is proposed which mainly depends on geometry information and Gaussian process regression. In this work, in order to improve the performance by exploiting multiple source information, we apply Bayesian framework and conditional random field inference to fuse the multimodal information including 2-D image and 3-D point geometric information. Particularly, a Bayesian framework is used for multiple feature fusion to provide a normalized and flexible output. Gaussian process regression is used to automatically and incrementally regress the data, resulting enhanced performance. Finally, conditional random field with color and geometry constrains is applied to make the result more robust. In order to evaluate the proposed method, quantitative experiments on popular KITTI-road data set and qualitative experiments on our own campus data set are tested. The results show satisfactory and inspiring performance compared to the outstanding works and even are competitive to some relevant Lidar-based methods.

AB In this brief, a constrained self-tuning controller (CSTC) is developed for the heading and diving motions of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) considering the parameter variation and practical realization of the algorithm. Parameters in the AUV dynamics may vary due to change in payload or physical structure. A Nonlinear Auto-Regressive Moving Average eXogenous (NARMAX) model is designed using the significant regressors to identify the AUV heading and diving dynamics, respectively. The parameters of the NARMAX model are updated using a recursive extended least square algorithm at each time instant. Furthermore, using the identified model, a CSTC law is designed to track desired waypoints using line of sight guidance law. The controller gains are updated at each instant satisfying the actuator constraint and computational efficiency is studied in view of achieving the practical implementation of the developed algorithm. The efficacy of the developed NARMAX-based CSTC algorithm to track a given reference is verified in an experimental environment with payload variation and external disturbance. From the obtained results, it is concluded that the developed control algorithm is effective for an AUV to track desired waypoints or heading/diving reference.

AB The problem of safe and fair conflict resolution among inertial, distributed agents-particularly in highly interactive settings-is of paramount importance to the autonomous vehicles industry. The difficulty of solving this problem can be attributed to the fact that agents have to reason over other agents' complex behaviors. We propose the idea of using a behavioral contract to capture a set of explicitly defined assumptions about how all agents in the environment make decisions. In this article, we present a behavioral contract for a specific class of agents that can guarantee the safety and liveness (i.e., progress) of all agents operating in accordance with it. The behavioral contract has two main components-an ordered behavioral rulebook that the agent uses to select its intended action and some additional constraints that define when an agent has precedence (or not) to take its intended action. If all of the agents act according to this contract, we can guarantee safety under all traffic conditions and liveness for all agents under "sparse" traffic conditions. The formalism of the contract also enables assignment of blame. We provide proofs of correctness of the behavioral contract and validate our results in simulation.

AB This paper presents a framework to plan and execute autonomous parking maneuvers in complex parking scenarios. We formulate a minimum-time optimal control problem for trajectory planning, using an indirect optimal control approach. A novel smooth penalty function is devised for collision avoidance with optimal control, and an effective technique is adopted to compute an initial solution guess. The trajectory planning tasks are solved with low computational times, and a dense mesh is used to discretize the domain of the optimal control problems, resulting in accurate collision-free solutions. The planned parking maneuvers are tracked with an original pseudo-neural feedforward-feedback steering controller, which outperforms other techniques from the literature, and a feedback longitudinal controller, to drive a realistic 14-degree-of-freedom vehicle simulator. We validate the planning and tracking algorithms in challenging narrow parking scenarios, including reverse, parallel and angle parking, and unstructured environments. The framework robustness is assessed by changing the vehicle mass, the road adherence conditions, and by introducing measurement noise with realistic sensor models. A video of the trajectory planning and tracking results is available as supplementary material.

AB Industrial subsea infrastructure inspections using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) require high accuracy of AUV navigation relative to the objects being examined. In addition to traditional navigation tools with inertial navigation systems and acoustic navigation equipment, technologies with video information processing are also actively developed today. The visual odometry-based techniques can provide higher navigation accuracy for local maneuvering at short distances to objects. However, in the case of long-distance AUV movements, such techniques typically accumulate errors when calculating the AUV movement trajectory. In this regard, the present article considers a navigation technique that allows for increasing the accuracy of AUV movements in the coordinate space of the object inspected by using a virtual coordinate reference network. Another aspect of the method proposed is to minimize computational costs for AUV moving along the inspection trajectory by referencing the AUV coordinates to the object pre-calculated using the object recognition algorithm. Thus, the use of a network of virtual points for referencing the AUV to subsea objects is aimed to maintain the required accuracy of AUV coordination during a long-distance movement along the inspection trajectory, while minimizing computational costs.

AB In dynamic and complicated industrial environments, feature-based SLAM based on laser scanner is a popular choice to achieve localization of autonomous guided vehicles. However, there are many clutters and dynamic objects degrading SLAM performance. This paper proposes a clutter-resistant SLAM solution where both point features generated from reflectors and line features are employed to improve SLAM robustness. First, a point feature recognition method based on geometrical characteristics of reflectors is developed to filter out clutters and identify true reflector landmarks; Then a dual-map based map management scheme is proposed for EKF-SLAM to further eliminate both types of fallacious landmarks and enhance its clutter resistance capability. The proposed methods eliminate adverse impact of clutters and thus improve SLAM performance in terms of accuracy, consistency and efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed clutter-resistant SLAM solution is validated through real-time experiments. The absolute localization error is controlled within 19 mm and 31mm in X-axis and Y-axis respectively. The improved SLAM algorithm is proved to be accurate and efficient enough for practical application in dynamic and complicated industrial environments.

AB As important observational platforms for the Smart Ocean concept, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that perform long-term observation in fleets are beneficial because they provide large-scale sampling data with a sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Therefore, a large number of low-cost micro AUVs with docking capability for power recharge and data transmission are essential. This study designed a low-cost electromagnetic docking guidance (EMDG) system for micro AUVs. The EMDG system is composed of a transmitter coil located on the dock and a three-axial search coil magnetometer acting as a receiver. The search coil magnetometer was optimized for small sizes while maintaining sufficient sensitivity. The signal conditioning and processing subsystem was designed to calculate the deflection angle (beta) for docking guidance. Underwater docking tests showed that the system can detect the electromagnetic signal and successfully guide AUV docking. The AUV can still perform docking in extreme positions, which cannot be realized through normal optical or acoustic guidance. This study is the first to focus on the EM guidance system for low-cost micro AUVs. The search coil sensor in the AUV is inexpensive and compact so that the system can be equipped on a wide range of AUVs.

AB Having an accurate mathematical model is essential in design, control, and navigation process of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Due to the modeling simplifications, the available mathematical models suffer fromthe uncertainty of their parameters and they usually need an identification phase for improving themodeling accuracy. In case of AUVs, the hydrodynamic coefficients of the model play an important role and they should be identified using the available experimental data. In this paper, a 6-DoF dynamic model of an AUV is presented and then some of its parameters including viscous damping, the body lift, and control input coefficients that have the highest effects on the modeling error are identified by augmented state model method. The extended Kalman filter (EKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), and transformed unscented Kalman filter (TUKF) are used as the estimation filters. To verify and compare the three estimation filters with consideration of the predetermined hydrodynamic coefficients and spiral maneuver AUV results, these three methods are evaluated. The results indicate that the TUKF identifies the best hydrodynamic model due to solving both the CKF nonlocal sampling problem and the EKF linearization problem.

AB Numerous existing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) formation control works have focused on the observation of external time-varying disturbances in trajectory tracking control. However, external time-varying disturbance outliers cannot be ignored due to the complex marine environment. It is rarely considered in pre-vious research. In this paper, a double-layer distributed formation prediction control scheme is designed, including an upper-level adaptive distributed observer and a lower-level predictive controller. Firstly, the ve-locity is observed and regarded as an unknown variable by the expectation maximization algorithm. The gain in the observer will be optimized by adaptive cubature Kalman to improve the anti-disturbance performance of the adaptive distributed observer. Then, the constraints of internal safety distance and input saturation are fully considered. The distributed cooperative cost function is constructed based on the virtual trajectory, which is further introduced into local rolling domain optimization to realize formation predictive control. The bound-edness of innovation and Lyapunov stability are utilized to prove the reliability of the control system. Some comparative simulation experiments are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the pro-posed method.

ID TROLLEY
AB In situations where some risk of injury is unavoidable for self-driving vehicles, how risk is distributed becomes an ethical question. Geisslinger and colleagues have developed a planning algorithm that takes five ethical principles into account and aims to comply with the emerging EU regulatory recommendations.
   With the rise of artificial intelligence and automation, moral decisions that were formerly the preserve of humans are being put into the hands of algorithms. In autonomous driving, a variety of such decisions with ethical implications are made by algorithms for behaviour and trajectory planning. Therefore, here we present an ethical trajectory planning algorithm with a framework that aims at a fair distribution of risk among road users. Our implementation incorporates a combination of five ethical principles: minimization of the overall risk, priority for the worst-off, equal treatment of people, responsibility and maximum acceptable risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ethical algorithm for trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles in line with the 20 recommendations from the European Union Commission expert group and with general applicability to various traffic situations. We showcase the ethical behaviour of our algorithm in selected scenarios and provide an empirical analysis of the ethical principles in 2,000 scenarios. The code used in this research is available as open-source software.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING
AB This paper presents a robust-saved energy control and obstacles avoidance technique for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). A super twisting sliding mode which consists of discontinues and continuous function is engaged as a robust control. A discontinuous function is useful to switch between two different systems; thus, the disturbance's effect can be minimized. However, it is resulting a high-infinite frequency which degrades the robustness of an AUV, hence, a continuous function is useful to smoothness the switching movement. Instead of line trajectory, a region shape based on region-tracking control is included to save the energy usage, whilst, the calculation of repulsive force between an AUV and obstacles is used to avoid the collision. To observe the performance, some simulations on a 6-DOF-AUV are presented. During the obstacles avoidance, it is shown that the proposed control allows the AUV to produce 0.6 (m) less error without oscillation, obtain 80 (s) faster time of error convergence and save 9.3 % of energy consumption compared to modified Function-based Augmented Proposal Derivative (PFAPD). Overall, the proposed method contributes to a robust, energy saving and obstacles avoidances control for an AUV under disturbance's effect.

AB Multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have gradually become the trend in underwater operations. Identifying and detecting these new underwater multi-targets is difficult when studying underwater moving targets. A 28-element transducer is used to test the echo of multiple AUVs with different layouts in a lake. The characteristics of the wideband echo signals are studied. Under the condition that the direction of arrival (DOA) is not known, an autofocus coherent signal subspace (ACCSM) method is proposed. The focusing matrix is constructed based on the received data. The spatial spectrum of the array signal of multiple AUVs at different attitudes is calculated. The algorithm estimates the DOA of the echo signals to overcome the shortcomings of traditional wideband DOA estimation and improve its accuracy. The results show that the highlights are not only related to the number of AUVs, but are also modified by scale and attitude. The contribution of the microstructure of the target in the overall echo cannot be ignored. Different parts of the target affect the number of highlights, thus resulting in varying numbers of highlights at different attitude angle intervals. The results have significant implications for underwater multi-target recognition.

AB This paper presents a method for inverse learning of a control objective defined in terms of requirements and their joint probability distribution from data. The probability distribution characterizes tolerated deviations from the deterministic requirements and is learned using maximum likelihood estimation from data. Further, this paper introduces both parametrized requirements for motion planning in autonomous driving applications and methods for the estimation of their parameters from driving data. Both the parametrized requirements and their joint probability distributions are estimated using a posterior distribution such that the control objective is personalized from a prior as driver data are accumulated. Finally, three variants of the learning method are presented that vary in computational complexity and data storage requirements. Key advantages of the proposed inverse learning method are a relatively low computational complexity, a need for a limited amount of data, and that the data do not have to be segmented into specific maneuvers, which makes the method easily implementable. Learning results using data of five human drivers in a simulation environment suggest that the proposed model for human-conscious driving along with the proposed learning method enable a more natural and personalized driving style of autonomous vehicles for their human passengers.

AB With the ongoing development and improvement of deep learning technology, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have made tremendous progress in recent years. Despite its great potential, AV supported by deep learning technology still faces numerous security threats, which prevent AV from being putting into large-scale practice. Aiming at this challenging situation, in this paper, we would like to exploit two attacks against deep learning algorithms in traffic sign recognition system by leveraging particle swarm optimization. Specifically, we first exploit the PAPSO (poisoning attack with particle swarm optimization) which focuses on the training process of the deep learning algorithms in the traffic sign recognition system, i.e., the attacker injects crafted samples into the training dataset, causing a reduction in classification accuracy of the traffic sign recognition system. Then, we also explore the EAPSO (evasion attack with particle swarm optimization) which on the other hand focuses on the interference process of the deep learning algorithms, i.e., the attacker adds some hardly perceptible perturbations to the targeted test sample, leading to a misclassification on it. Extensive experiments are conducted to shed light on the effectiveness of our attacks, and some corresponding defense strategies are also presented.

AB Use of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to obtain environmental observations beneath coastal sea ice offshore of Barrow, AK, is described. This study is motivated by the desire to obtain cross-shore hydrographic transects (temperature, salinity, and velocity versus depth) that would provide estimates of the transport of relatively dense, salty water from the Chukchi Sea to the Arctic Ocean in winter. Although person-portable AUVs are well suited to the task, it was recognized that achieving the science goals would require increasing the range of acoustic navigation and communication as well as developing a robust approach to through-ice deployment and recovery. These needs drove three modifications to the AUV: 1) incorporation of a lower frequency (10 kHz) transponder and associated hardware for navigation and communication; 2) addition of special-purpose sensors and hardware in a hull extension module; and 3) development of a homing algorithm utilizing Ultrashort Base Line acoustics. In March 2010, eight days of field work offshore of Barrow provided successful demonstration of the system. A total of 14 km of track lines beneath a coastal ice floe were obtained from four missions, each successfully terminated by net-capture recovery.

AB This paper studies the transient response of the output voltages of a Ballard-Mark-V 35-cell 5 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack with power conversion for applications in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under load changes. Four types of pulse-width modulated (PWM) dc-dc power converters are employed to connect to the studied fuel cell in series for converting the unregulated fuel cell stack voltage into the desired voltage levels. The fuel cell model in this paper consists of the double-layer charging effect, gases diffusion in the electrodes, and the thermodynamic characteristic; PWM dc-dc converters are assumed to operate in continuous-conduction mode with a voltage-mode control compensator. The models of the study's fuel cell and PWM dc-dc converters have been implemented in a Matlab/SIMULINKTM environment. The results show that the output voltages of the studied PEMFC connected with PWM dc-dc converters during a load change are stable. Moreover, the model can predict the transient response of hydrogen/oxygen out flow rates and cathode and anode channel temperatures/pressures under sudden change in load current.

AB Autonomous driving is a promising technology to reduce traffic accidents and improve driving efficiency. Although significant progress has been achieved, existing decision-making systems of autonomous vehicle still cannot meet the safety and driving efficiency requirements in highly dynamic environments. In this work, we design a discrete decision-making strategy based on the discrete soft actor-critic with sample filter algorithm (DSAC-SF) to improve driving efficiency and safety on freeways with dynamics traffic. Specifically, we first propose a sample filter method for discrete soft actor-critic, which improves the sample efficiency and stability of the algorithm via enhancing the utilization of effective samples. Subsequently, we construct the discrete decision-making strategy for autonomous driving based on the DSAC-SF algorithm, and further design the area observation method and the multi-objective reward function to improve the driving safety and efficiency. Finally, we carry out comparison and ablation experiments on the the scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning training school (SMARTS) simulation environment. Experimental results indicate that our strategy obtains a high success rate and a fast vehicle speed in the decision-making tasks on freeways. Moreover, our DSAC-SF algorithm also achieves improved performance in training efficiency and stability compared to the commonly used discrete reinforcement learning algorithm.

AB The study aims at uncovering the effects of attitudinal features on Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) adoption from a systematic and comprehensive perspective. Specifically, the technology acceptance model (TAM) was employed to systematically propose three key factors, i.e., green perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention. The life-oriented approach (LOA) was employed to extend TAM comprehensively by identifying three determinants, i.e., relative advantage, environmental awareness, and perceived risk. The study established correlations between behavioral intention and five attitudinal variables. The structural equation model (SEM) was applied to interpret the effects of these determinants on SAVs adoption. The study conducted a survey in Nanjing, China, from May to June 2020, with 627 valid respondents, to validate the results. Results indicate the significant effects of attitudinal features on SAVs adoption. SAVs adoption is related positively to relative advantage (0.47), environmental awareness (0.22), green perceived usefulness (0.29), and perceived ease of use (0.16). Perceived risk (-0.33) negatively affects SAVs adoption. These findings provide implications for improving SAVs adoption and suggestions for future research by emphasizing the importance of attitudinal features.

AB A growing interest in autonomous driving (AD) and intelligent vehicles (IVs) is fueled by their promise for enhanced safety, efficiency, and economic benefits. While previous surveys have captured progress in this field, a comprehensive and forward-looking summary is needed. Our work fills this gap through three distinct articles. The first part, a "survey of surveys" (SoS), outlines the history, surveys, ethics, and future directions of AD and IV technologies. The second part", Milestones in AD and IVs Part I: Control, Computing System Design, Communication, high-definition map (HD map), Testing, and Human Behaviors" delves into the development of control, computing system, communication, HD map, testing, and human behaviors in IVs. This part, the third part, reviews perception and planning in the context of IVs. Aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in AD and IVs, this work caters to both newcomers and seasoned researchers. By integrating the SoS and Part I, we offer unique insights and strive to serve as a bridge between past achievements and future possibilities in this dynamic field.

AB In this article, we study the problem of stabilizing the traffic flow on a ring road to a uniform steady-state using autonomous vehicles (AV). Traffic is represented at a microscopic level via a Bando-Follow-the-Leader model capable of reproducing phantom jams. For the single-lane case, a single AV can stabilize an arbitrary large ring road with an arbitrary large number of cars. Moreover, this stabilization is exponentially quick with a decay rate independent of the number of cars and a control gain also independent of the number of cars. On the other side, the stabilization domain and stabilization time depend on the number of cars. Two types of controller algorithms are proposed: a proportional control and a proportional-integral control. In both cases, the measurements used by the controller only depend on the local data around the AV, enabling an easy implementation. After numerical tests of the single-lane case, a multilane model is described using a safety-incentive mechanism for lane change. Numerical simulations for the multilane ring road suggest that the control strategy is also very efficient in such a setting, even with a single AV.

DE localization; inertial navigation system; extended Kalman filter; mobile

AB Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is one of the most widely used Bayesian estimation methods in the optimal control area. Recent works on mobile robot control and transportation systems have applied various EKF methods, especially for localization. However, it is difficult to obtain adequate and reliable process-noise and measurement-noise models due to the complex and dynamic surrounding environments and sensor uncertainty. Generally, the default noise values of the sensors are provided by the manufacturer, but the values may frequently change depending on the environment. Thus, this paper mainly focuses on designing a highly accurate trainable EKF-based localization framework using inertial measurement units (IMUs) for the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) with dead reckoning, with the goal of fusing it with a laser imaging, detection, and ranging (LiDAR) sensor-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) estimation for enhancing the performance. Convolution neural networks (CNNs), backward propagation algorithms, and gradient descent methods are implemented in the system to optimize the parameters in our framework. Furthermore, we develop a unique cost function for training the models to improve EKF accuracy. The proposed work is general and applicable to diverse IMU-aided robot localization models.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); gravimeter levelling system;

AB Recently, hydrothermal deposits below the seafloor are believed to be useful for human activity. Because the size of each deposit is much smaller than that of an offshore oil field, detailed exploration for the position and the estimated mass is needed. An underwater gravity survey just above seafloor can directly give localized mass distribution below the seafloor. Therefore, we have developed an underwater gravity measurement system onboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which is suitable for wide area surveys close to the seafloor with high resolution. An improved gravimeter was mounted on a levelling platform and the system was contained in a spherical pressure vessel with a diameter of 50 cm. The gravimeter system was installed on a large AUV. All the power is supplied from the AUV and an acoustic communication system enables control and monitoring during observation. The first observation was carried out in September 2012 in Sagami Bay, Japan. The AUV was navigated at a constant speed and constant depth on the same profile. As a result, our system has a repeatability of 0.1 mGal. The developed underwater gravimeter has been used for mapping of gravity anomalies in seafloor deposits areas around Japan since 2013.

AB This paper proposes a motion planner for autonomous parking. Compared to the prevailing and emerging studies that handle specific or regular parking scenarios only, our method describes various kinds of parking cases in a unified way regardless they are regular parking scenarios (e.g., parallel, perpendicular or echelon parking cases) or not. First, we formulate a time-optimal dynamic optimization problem with vehicle kinematics, collision-avoidance conditions and mechanical constraints strictly described. Thereafter, an interior-point simultaneous approach is introduced to solve that formulated dynamic optimization problem. Simulation results validate that our proposed motion planning method can tackle general parking scenarios. The tested parking scenarios in this paper can be regarded as benchmark cases to evaluate the efficiency of methods that may emerge in the future. Our established dynamic optimization problem is an open and unified framework, where other complicated user-specific constraints/optimization criteria can be handled without additional difficulty, provided that they are expressed through inequalities/polynomial explicitly. This proposed motion planner may be suitable for the next-generation intelligent parking-garage system. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study aims to improve the performance and generalization capability of end-to-end autonomous driving with scene understanding leveraging deep learning and multimodal sensor fusion techniques. The designed end-to-end deep neural network takes as input the visual image and associated depth information in an early fusion level and outputs the pixel-wise semantic segmentation as scene understanding and vehicle control commands concurrently. The end-to-end deep learning-based autonomous driving model is tested in high-fidelity simulated urban driving conditions and compared with the benchmark of CoRL2017 and NoCrash. The testing results show that the proposed approach is of better performance and generalization ability, achieving a 100% success rate in static navigation tasks in both training and unobserved situations, as well as better success rates in other tasks than the prior models. A further ablation study shows that the model with the removal of multimodal sensor fusion or scene understanding pales in the new environment because of the false perception. The results verify that the performance of our model is improved by the synergy of multimodal sensor fusion with scene understanding subtask, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed deep neural network with multimodal sensor fusion.

AB This paper describes a comparative study of steering and yaw moment control manoeuvres in the model predictive control and linear quadratic control approaches for path-following control of an autonomous vehicle. We present the effectiveness of the model predictive control and linear quadratic control approaches for stability control of the vehicle's lateral position and yaw angle for different control manoeuvres: two-wheel steering, four-wheel steering and direct yaw moment control. We then propose model predictive control with a feedforward controller to minimize the tracking errors of the lateral position and the yaw angle in an active front steering manoeuvre, and these are compared with the results from linear quadratic control that has a feedforward controller. Model predictive control is designed on the basis of the simple yaw-lateral motions of a single-track vehicle with a linear tyre model (i.e. a bicycle model), which is an approximation of the more realistic model of a vehicle with double-track yaw-roll motion with a non-linear tyre model (i.e. the Pacejka model). The linear quadratic controller is designed on the basis of the same approach as adopted for the model predictive controller to achieve a fair comparison. On the basis of a given trajectory, we simulate the manoeuvre of the vehicle at a low speed, a middle speed and a high speed because load transfer effects will influence the roll dynamics especially at a high speed. We also perform simulations on low-road-friction surfaces in a double-lane-change scenario with the aim of following the desired trajectory as closely as possible while maintaining the vehicle stability. The simulation results show that model predictive control through two-wheel steering and four-wheel steering with direct yaw moment control performed better in terms of trajectory tracking at a high forward speed and low road surface variation. The proposed model predictive control with a feedforward controller is shown to be effective in minimizing the trajectory tracking errors. For all control manoeuvres, model predictive control gives a better tracking performance than linear quadratic control does. In addition, when the roll dynamics are considered, model predictive control significantly improves the vehicle stability and the trajectory along the desired path.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is widely studied in both industrial and academic communities since it is regarded as a promising means for improving transportation safety and efficiency. Lane changing is a critical link for higher-level AV operations. However, few studies on AV lane changing consider the dynamics of surrounding vehicles, particularly in a mixed traffic environment including human-driven vehicles (HVs). Therefore, this article presents a dynamic lane-changing model for AV incorporating human driver behavior in mixed traffic. The proposed model includes four key components: car following (and lane keeping), lane-changing decision, dynamic trajectory generation, and model predictive control (MPC)-based trajectory tracking. AV longitudinal control algorithm is also depicted in detail in this article. Field experiments are conducted on a large-scale test track to test and validate the proposed model. An AV and three HVs are used in the lane-changing experiments. Different human driver behaviors are considered in the experiment settings. Experimental results show that the proposed lane-changing model can complete lane-changing maneuvers efficiently when HVs are cooperative and can also robustly abort them when HVs are uncooperative. Compared with the measured human lane-changing maneuvers, AV lane-changing maneuvers from the proposed model are more comfortable and safer.

AB The public had expressed their resistance and negative attitudes to self-driving vehicles (SDVs). Positive change in attitudes is critical for their diffusion. However, it gets limited scholarly attention. In a field experiment (N = 300), we recorded changes in attitude structure (positive, negative, ambivalent, and indifferent) toward the issue of whether SDVs should be allowed riding on public roads and three attitude components related to SDVs including cognitive component (perceived benefit and risk), affective component (positive affect, trust), and behavioral component (behavioral intention). Participants' ambivalence about and interest in the issue were also assessed. Direct experience lead participants to be more positive: five in ten were ambivalent before, whereas six in ten were positive later. Four major groups emerged: two groups without attitude change, keeping positive (n = 120) and keeping ambivalent (n = 88), and two groups with attitude change, ambivalent -> positive (n = 55) and positive -> ambivalent (n = 16). Two dimensions of attitude strength (ambivalence and inconsistency) might account for attitude change in the latter two groups, respectively. Attitude and its three components changed consistently. Policymakers and automakers need to provide opportunities for the public to experience autonomous vehicles to form more positive attitudes.

DE Autonomous vehicles; predictive control
AB In this paper, we present an algorithm for lateral control of a vehicle-a smooth and accurate model predictive controller (MPC). The fundamental difference compared to a standard MPC is that the driving smoothness is directly addressed in the cost function. The controller objective is based on the minimization of the first- and second-order spatial derivatives of the curvature. By doing so, jerky commands to the steering wheel, which could lead to permanent damage on the steering components and vehicle structure, are avoided. A good path tracking accuracy is ensured by adding constraints to avoid deviations from the reference path. Finally, the controller is experimentally tested and evaluated on a Scania construction truck. The evaluation is performed at Scania's facilities near Sodertalje, Sweden via two different paths: a precision track that resembles a mining scenario and a high-speed test track that resembles a highway situation. Even using a linearized kinematic vehicle to predict the vehicle motion, the performance of the proposed controller is encouraging, since the deviation from the path never exceeds 30 cm. It clearly outperforms an industrial pure-pursuit controller in terms of path accuracy and a standard MPC in terms of driving smoothness.

AB Traffic accidents are often caused by improper lane changes. Although the safety of lane-changing has attracted extensive attention in the vehicle and traffic fields, there are few studies considering the lateral comfort of vehicle users in lane-changing decision-making. Lane-changing decision-making by single-step dynamic game with incomplete information and path planning based on Bezier curve are proposed in this paper to coordinate vehicle lane-changing performance from safety payoff, velocity payoff, and comfort payoff. First, the lane-changing safety distance which is improved by collecting lane-changing data through simulated driving, and lane-changing time obtained by Bezier curve path planning are introduced into the game payoff, so that the selection of the lane-changing start time considers the vehicle safety, power performance and passenger comfort of the lane-changing process. Second, the lane-changing path without collision to the forward vehicle is obtained through the constrained Bezier curve, and the Bezier curve is further constrained to obtain a smoother lane-changing path. The path tracking sliding mode controller of front wheel angle compensation by radical basis function neural network is designed. Finally, the model in the loop simulation and the hardware in the loop experiment are carried out to verify the advantages of the proposed method. The results of three lane-changing conditions designed in the hardware in the loop experiment show that the vehicle safety, power performance, and passenger comfort of the vehicle controlled by the proposed method are better than that of human drivers in discretionary lane change and mandatory lane change scenarios.

AB Radar is a key component of the suite of perception sensors used for safe and reliable navigation of autonomous vehicles. Its unique capabilities include high-resolution velocity imaging, detection of agents in occlusion and over long ranges, and robust performance in adverse weather conditions. However, the usage of radar data presents some challenges: it is characterized by low resolution, sparsity, clutter, high uncertainty, and lack of good datasets. These challenges have limited radar deep learning research. As a result, current radar models are often influenced by lidar and vision models, which are focused on optical features that are relatively weak in radar data, thus resulting in under-utilization of radar's capabilities and diminishing its contribution to autonomous perception. This review seeks to encourage further deep learning research on autonomous radar data by 1) identifying key research themes, and 2) offering a comprehensive overview of current opportunities and challenges in the field. Topics covered include early and late fusion, occupancy flow estimation, uncertainty modeling, and multipath detection. The paper also discusses radar fundamentals and data representation, presents a curated list of recent radar datasets, and reviews state-of-the-art lidar and vision models relevant for radar research.

AB This paper presents a novel method for the dynamic positioning of an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) with unknown trajectories based on an autonomous tracking buoy (PUVV-ATB) that indirectly positions the UUV using ultra-short baseline measurements. The method employs a spatial location geometric model and divides the positioning process into four steps, including data preprocessing to detect geometric errors and apply mean filtering, direction capture, position tracking, and position synchronization. To achieve these steps, a new adaptive tracking control algorithm is proposed that does not require trajectory prediction and is applied to the last three steps. The algorithm is deployed to the buoy for tracking simulation and sea trial experiments, and the results are compared with those of a model predictive control algorithm. The autonomous tracking buoy based on the adaptive tracking control algorithm runs more stably and can better complete the precise tracking task for the UUV with a positioning error of less than 10 cm. This method breaks the premise of trajectory prediction based on traditional tracking control algorithms, providing a new direction for further research on UUV localization. Furthermore, the conclusion of this paper has important reference value for other research and application fields related to UUV.

AB This study proposes a thermal monitoring method in outdoor environments to inspect the health state of overhung transmission lines (TLs) with an infrared camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The suggested method features three characteristics. First, the thermal energy of TLs measured by an infrared camera is converted into accurate temperature accounting for the conversion principle of the infrared camera. Characteristic parameters in the conversion principle, including emissivity, transmissibility, and reflectability, are systematically quantified through experiments. Second, a simple yet effective postprocessing method is proposed to eliminate thermal energy emitted from other heat sources in outdoor environments. Third, an automatic line-tracking method is proposed to focus on TLs for reliable thermal imaging during patrol inspection. The proposed method with an infrared camera deployed on a UAV is field-tested through an autonomous flight and gimbal control. A systemic analysis on field tests demonstrates that the proposed method overcomes several bottlenecks in current technologies and reveals several important considerations regarding thermally monitoring overhung TLs in outdoor environments. This insightful discovery supports developing a fully autonomous solution for accurate outdoor thermal imaging despite the many challenges that remain.

AB The cybersecurity of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is an important emerging area of research in traffic safety. Because human failure is the most common reason for a successful cyberattack, human-factor researchers and psychologists might improve AV cybersecurity by researching how to decrease the probability of a successful attack. We review some areas of research connected to the human factor in cybersecurity and find many potential issues. Psychologists might research the characteristics of people prone to cybersecurity failure, the types of scenarios they fail in and the factors that influence this failure or over-trust of AV. Human behavior during a cyberattack might be researched, as well as how to educate people about cybersecurity. Multitasking has an effect on the ability to defend against a cyberattack and research is needed to set the appropriate policy. Human-resource researchers might investigate the skills required for personnel working in AV cybersecurity and how to detect potential defectors early. The psychological profile of cyber attackers should be investigated to be able to set policies to decrease their motivation. Finally, the decrease of driver's driving skills as a result of using AV and its connection to cybersecurity skills is also worth of research.

AB Motion performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is critical to the security and survey accuracy of AUVs. However, relationships among indices used to evaluate the motion performance are generally complicated and cannot be formulated mathematically, and it is hard to clarify how each index affects the motion performance of AUVs. In this paper, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method was proposed to assess motion performance of AUVs. Focused on the landing AUV, process of the FCE method was described in detail, and the FCE system was constructed. In the FCE system, a three-level evaluating index system was built according to the motion characteristics of the landing AUV. Based on analysis of the survey process and measurement requirements of the landing AUV, the weight sets of each factor set were determined by applying the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. The single-factor evaluation matrix was obtained by solving the membership function with ridged-shape distribution. Decision-making was completed through comparing evaluation results of the motion performance of two layout schemes. Field trials showed that the evaluation results could reflect the motion performance of landing AUVs objectively and comprehensively. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Freeway on-ramp merging areas are high-risk areas for motor vehicle crashes and conflicts due to the variety of driving styles, the difference in mainline and ramp traffic states, and factors related to roadway design and traffic control. The emerging Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technologies are expected to bring substantial improvements in ramp merging operations in general, including the possibility to reduce traffic conflicts and crashes by partially or fully eliminating the critical factors related to the human drivers. In order to investigate the potential safety impacts of AVs at on-ramp merging, this study first proposes a novel conflict index in theory as a specific indicator for ramp merging safety. Then, a merging conflict model is introduced to estimate the index value in various cases by considering the interactions between the mainline and ramp vehicles. In order to account for real-world uncertainties and variations in various crash-contributing factors, the proposed approach incorporates Monte-Carlo method and probabilistic distributions calibrated on the empirical freeway data. The developed approach is later applied in a case study with incremental AV market penetration rates to investigate AV safety impacts at on-ramp merging. The results show clear benefits of AVs in reducing the frequency and severity of the critical merging events. In addition, a sensitivity analysis on essential model parameters shows that the merging safety of AVs is closely related to their gap acceptance policy and the proper functioning of the driving systems, providing further insights into the future development of AVs.

AB This paper proposes a model to find the optimal location of autonomous vehicle lanes in a transportation network consisting of both Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) while accounting for the roadway capacity variation. The main contribution of the model is considering a generalized definition of capacity as a function of AV proportion on a link and incorporating it into the network design problem. A bilevel optimization model is proposed with total travel time as the objective function to be minimized. At the upper-level problem, the optimal locations of AV lanes are determined, and at the lower level which is a multiclass equilibrium assignment, road users including both AVs and HDVs seek to minimize their individual travel times. It is shown that if capacity variation is ignored, the effect of AV lane deployment can be misleading. Since there will be a long transition period during which both AVs and HDVs will coexist in the network, this model can help the network managers to optimally reallocate the valuable road space and better understand the effects of AV lane deployment at the planning horizon as well as during the transition period. Employing this model as a planning tool presents how the proposed AV lane deployment plan could consider the AV market penetration growth during the transition period. Numerical analysis based on the Sioux Falls network is presented in two cases with and without variable capacity to illustrate the application of this model. At the 60% penetration rate of AVs, the improvement in total travel time was 3.85% with a fix capacity while this improvement was 9.88% with a variable capacity.

Owing to intrinsic limitations, the V2X framework and related communicating autonomous vehicles are inadequate. We explore the CMX framework (Coordinated Mobility for X = SPEC), Next Generation Vehicles (NGVs), and protocols for safety-critical inter-vehicle communications and agreements that solve problems left open in the V2X framework. Then, we focus on cyberattacks and physical attacks against isolated NGVs and cohorts of NGVs. The cyberphysical security analysis investigates more than 20 attacks and demonstrates that the goal set for CMX is verified. In the presence of attacks, safety is never compromised, possibly at the expense of diminished efficiency.

This paper presents multiclass image based classification of vehicles like bikes and cars using soft computing algorithms like artificial neural network decision tree and support vector machine as well. The objective of this paper is to automate the classification of vehicles from images. A good set of descriptor features that capture the most important properties of an object are used to identify the object uniquely. Different views of vehicle images are considered as important factor during classification process as six multiple class labels are created accordingly.

AB An ever-increasing number of autonomous vehicles use bandwidth-greedy sensors such as cameras and LiDARs to sense and act to the world around us. Unfortunately, signal transmission in vehicles is vulnerable to passive and active cyber-physical attacks that may result in loss of intellectual property, or worse yet, the loss of control of a vehicle, potentially causing great harm. Therefore, it is important to investigate efficient cryptographic methods to secure signal transmission in such vehicles against outside threats. This study is motivated by the observation that previous publications have suggested legacy algorithms, which are either inefficient or insecure for vision-based signals. We show how stream ciphers and authenticated encryption can be applied to transfer sensor data securely and efficiently between computing devices suitable for distributed guidance, navigation, and control systems. We provide an efficient and flexible pipeline of cryptographic operations on image and point cloud data in the Robot Operating System (ROS). We also demonstrate how image data can be compressed to reduce the amount of data to be encrypted, transmitted, and decrypted. Experiments on embedded computers verify that modern software cryptographic algorithms perform very well on large sensor data. Hence, the introduction of such algorithms should enhance security without significantly compromising the overall performance.

ID MODEL
AB Free lane change (FLC) is an important research direction of intelligent driving vehicles. In this paper, a lane change decision model based on deep learning is established with ego and adjacent lane risk and properties of environmental vehicles. A long short-term memory neural network that can be associated with time series characteristics is used to model the lane change process based on analysis of factors affecting the lane change decision. The result of decision-making model training shows that the recognition accuracy of lane change and lane keeping decision reaches more than 92%. Then, a human-like FLC trajectory is planned based on polynomial curve, a quintic polynomial trajectory cluster based on preview distance is generated according to driving conditions, and the optimal FLC trajectory is selected by optimizing an objective function. The model predictive control method is used to dynamically control the vehicle to follow the trajectory. Finally, the lane change decision, trajectory planning, and tracking control model are built in simulation environment, and the control of vehicle dynamics model verifies the integrity and feasibility of free lane change function.

AB Underwater terrain-aided navigation (TAN) holds high potential for long-term underwater accurate navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles. TAN can lo-cate a vehicle by calculating the similarity between an a priori map and a vehicle's real-time observation consisting of a set of bathymetric measurement points. However, the amount of measurement points in the real-time observation affects both positioning accuracy and computational consumption of the TAN system, making it challenging to calculate a suitable size of real-time observation in TAN. With a smooth seabed terrain, a small observation area leads to insufficient topographic features and finally an inaccurate matching result, while a large area with a mount of features results in high computational cost. This paper proposes a method to restrain the size of observation in TAN systems based on terrain en-tropy and difference of normals. Meanwhile, this paper implements the TAN algo-rithm into an embedded system architecture used by actual underwater vehicles that are already in service to reduce the power consumption of the TAN system. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been demonstrated through playback experi-ments based on a semi-physical simulation platform using a PC/104-embedded computer.

AB The traffic in the weaving region is subject to lane-changing turbulence, which results in a significant impact on traffic safety, reduces traffic efficiency, and creates traffic bottlenecks. To mitigate the negative effect of the weaving, vehicles are distributed in each segment located inside and upstream of the weaving region by a lane-changing advisory using Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) technology, called segment-base lane-changing control (SLDC), and a heuristic optimization algorithm is applied to obtain the proportion of CAVs to be assigned to each segment. Further, to decrease volume variation on the mainline, the ramp metering (RM) control strategy is coordinated and applied to ensure the lane-changing process in the weaving region. Conditions of different traffic demands are analyzed using the cellular automata traffic simulation based on a typical one-sided ramp motorway weaving region. Results indicated that the proposed CAV distribution algorithm and SLDC-RM coordination control strategy could improve traffic efficiency and reduce traffic conflicts. The coordination control is better than SLDC when the occupancy of the weaving region reaches 25 veh/km/ln, also the effects with different proportions of connected vehicles are discussed.

AB Platooning has been identified as a promising framework to improve road capacity, on-road safety, and energy efficiency. Enabling communications among vehicles in platoons is expected to enhance platoon control by keeping constant intervehicle and interplatoon distances. Characterizing the performance of intra-and interplatoon communications in terms of throughput and packet transmission delays is crucial for validating the effectiveness of information sharing on platoon control. In this paper, we introduce an IEEE 802.11p-based communication model for multiplatooning (a chain of platoons) scenarios. We present a probabilistic performance analysis of distributed-coordination-function-based intra-and interplatoon communications. Expressions for the transmission attempt probability, collision probability, packet delay, packet-dropping probability, and network throughput are derived. Numerical results show that the performance of interplatoon communications is affected by the transmissions of the first and last vehicles in a multiplatoon. This effect is reduced with an increase of the platoon number in the multiplatoon. In addition, the communication performance for three typical multiplatooning application scenarios is investigated, indicating that the IEEE 802.11p-based communication can support the timely delivery of vehicle information among platoons for diverse on-road applications.

AB Currently, the complex traffic environment challenges the fast and accurate response of a connected autonomous vehicle (CAV). More importantly, it is difficult for different CAVs to collaborate and share knowledge. To remedy that, this paper proposes a selective federated reinforcement learning (SFRL) strategy to achieve online knowledge aggregation strategy to improve the accuracy and environmental adaptability of the autonomous driving model. First, we propose a federated reinforcement learning framework that allows participants to use the knowledge of other CAVs to make corresponding actions, thereby realizing online knowledge transfer and aggregation. Second, we use reinforcement learning to train local driving models of CAVs to cope with collision avoidance tasks. Third, considering the efficiency of federated learning (FL) and the additional communication overhead it brings, we propose a CAVs selection strategy before uploading local models. When selecting CAVs, we consider the reputation of CAVs, the quality of local models, and time overhead, so as to select as many high-quality users as possible while considering resources and time constraints. With above strategic processes, our framework can aggregate and reuse the knowledge learned by CAVs traveling in different environments to assist in driving decisions. Extensive simulation results validate that our proposal can improve model accuracy and learning efficiency while reducing communication overhead.

AB Arguably the most powerful artifact of the 20th century, the private car brought profound spatial, social, and cultural changes, as well as wide-ranging mobility justice implications. Autonomous mobility technologies, with the power to supplant part or all of the action of the driver by collecting and processing large quantities of fine grained data, promise to shift power away from users to engineers and create new important spatial and social implications for mobility justice, of which little are known. This research draws from Foucauldian conceptualizations adapted for the study of geographies of power to investigate how autonomous mobility technology may diagram spatial rationalities and moralities into the built environment. To that effect, it draws from 30 interviews of intermediaries in Finland-a country actively pursuing a transition to automated and shared mobility as part of an ICT-driven innovation policy. Examining autonomous mobility through a Foucauldian lens helps highlight the complex power relations it affords-in terms of changes in social structure and infrastructure, and social justice. By shedding light on how technology may structure the built environment, the Foucauldian perspective shows itself to be a valuable tool for planning and policymaking, providing insight into how autonomous mobility (in)justice may be assembled.

AB This study explores the overall picture of how people perceive the importance level and urgency level regarding issues associated with automated vehicles, by sorting out ten issues, developing a questionnaire with 66 measurement items, and investigating how Artificial Intelligence (AI) experts and Computer Science (CS)/Electrical Engineering (EE) majors assessed these issues. The findings suggest that AI experts in Taiwan believed that the top five issues for preparing a society for autonomous vehicles (AVs) should include (1) data privacy and cybersecurity, (2) regulation considerations, (3) infrastructure, (4) governance, and (5) public acceptance. On the other hand, for their student counterparts, the results (1) demonstrate a somewhat different order from the third to the fifth place, (2) show an attention-focused profile on the issue of cybersecurity and data privacy, and (3) indicate that gender and a few wider-impact variables (technology innovation, infrastructure) are significant predictors for the assessment on the importance level of AVs, while some wider-impact variables (technology innovation, governance, economic benefits, infrastructure), which are positively associated, as well as concerns variables (cybersecurity and data privacy, regulations), which are negatively associated, could be predictors for the urgency level of AVs. Suggestions for future research and policymakers are provided.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) leverage emerging vehicle connectivity and automation technologies to enhance traffic safety. Extensive research has been done to examine the safety impacts of CAVs on road users (including vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users). Still, the impacts on first responders, who respond to traffic incidents and assist road users, are under-discussed. Road users show growing interest in CAVs, but it is uncertain whether first responders would feel the same way. First responders face the risk of being struck by passing vehicles when they perform their duties on road or roadside. In addition, it is unknown whether CAVs can or will do a better job than human drivers in conventional vehicles when passing an incident scene. This study conducted a national survey among first responders in the US to understand their knowledge and incident management experiences related to CAVs, as well as their attributes and concerns towards CAV technologies, including advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), connected vehicle (CV) and self-driving or autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies. Over 1000 first responders participated in the survey, and the survey had represen-tation from all 50 states, Washington DC, and US Territories. The survey results showed that 82% of first re-sponders have not received any CAV-related safety training, and 41% of first responders self-reported having little knowledge about CAVs. Regarding the roles of AVs in emergency responses, only a tiny portion (3%) of first responders would trust AVs more than human drivers passing an incident scene, and the majority (86%) of first responders do not think AVs will outperform human drivers. Only 1% of first responders said they trust AVs, and 44% stated that they do not trust AVs at all. A statistical model was developed to identify the correlates of first responders' trust in AVs. Modeling results showed that education positively correlates to the likelihood of trusting AVs. This study found significant differences in perceptions towards CAVs across emergency response agencies and geographic regions. Law enforcement officers exhibit higher trust in AVs compared to firefighters; responders from DOT or public works are associated with the lowest levels of trust among all emergency response agencies. FEMA Region 3, which includes Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, shows the lowest levels of trust in AVs compared to human drivers among all regions in the country. This study provides valuable information for stakeholders to prepare responders for next-generation transportation emergency responses.

AB This paper addresses the region tracking control problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and proposes a prediction-based region tracking control (PRTC) scheme for AUV. In the PRTC scheme, the idea of prediction is adopted to solve the problems of overshoot and high energy consumption due to the lack of consideration of the large inertia of the AUV in the traditional scheme. The PRTC scheme predicts the future position of AUV through the past time-series position of AUV and the outer boundary of the desired region, and then designs the controller depending on the predicted results. Furthermore, the relationship between the desired region and the control output of the proposed PRTC scheme is studied. It is found that its control output amplitude is susceptible to the desired region range, resulting in output saturation. Therefore, this paper proposes a control law optimization scheme considering the desired region. This optimization scheme modifies the error signal in the control law of the PRTC scheme so that it is only related to the relative position of the desired region where the AUV is located. Finally, the proposed schemes are applied on the ODIN AUV, and the simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed schemes.

   understanding; safety and collision avoidance
AB Designing autonomous vehicles for urban environments remains an unresolved problem. One major dilemma faced by autonomous cars is understanding the intention of other road users and communicating with them. To investigate one aspect of this, specifically pedestrian crossing behavior, we have collected a large dataset of pedestrian samples at crosswalks under various conditions (e.g., weather) and in different types of roads. Using the data, we analyzed pedestrian behavior from two different perspectives: the way they communicate with drivers prior to crossing and the factors that influence their behavior. Our study shows that changes in head orientation in the form of looking or glancing at the traffic is a strong indicator of crossing intention. We also found that context in the form of the properties of a crosswalk (e.g., its width), traffic dynamics (e.g., speed of the vehicles) as well as pedestrian demographics can alter pedestrian behavior after the initial intention of crossing has been displayed. Our findings suggest that the contextual elements can be interrelated, meaning that the presence of one factor may increase/decrease the influence of other factors. Overall, our work formulates the problem of pedestrian-driver interaction and sheds light on its complexity in typical traffic scenarios.

AB This paper proposed a continuum dynamic model for autonomous vehicles in a polycentric urban city by considering the environment impact of traffic emission. The model assumes that homogeneous autonomous vehicles are continuously distributed over the urban areas which tend to choose a path to minimize their total travel cost from origin to destination. To describe the path choice behavior of travelers, we presented the continuum dynamic traffic assignment model which consists of a two-dimensional hyperbolic system of nonlinear conservation laws with source terms and an Eikonal-type equation. The elastic demand is considered using a function which associating each copy of flow with its total instantaneous travel cost. For the environmental impacts, here we consider the influence of CO emission and include the cost of emission into the actual transportation cost. A solution algorithm for the model is designed as a cell-centered finite volume method for conservation law equations and a fast sweeping method for Eikonal-type equations on unstructured grids. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the model and the proposed solution algorithm. Further, the results of the travel cost considering CO emissions and not considering CO emissions are compared.

AB The paper investigates thruster fault diagnosis for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Since it is difficult to eliminate the spurious behaviors based on the conventional qualitative simulation in AUV qualitative modeling, this paper suggests a grey qualitative constraint filtering method based on higher-order derivative, probability grey number and persistence time. In the process of qualitative modeling, it selects variables whose persistence time is least to derive their possible successors; and then, it filters the set of possible successor states by the developed higher order derivative constraint table. After obtaining the predicted state sequence, taking external disturbance effect into consideration, grey relational analysis based on weighted average is developed to detect and isolate thruster fault by introducing a weighted coefficient about the number of the transition sequence. Furthermore, with respect to fault identification, considering the identification result is an interval based on decision tree technique, the paper proposes a three-dimension identification model based on fractal box dimension and three-dimension surface fitting. Finally, experiments are conducted on Beaver AUV to acquire experiment data, and the comparative results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Application of crop production and protection materials is a crucial component in the high productivity of American agriculture. Agricultural chemical application is frequently needed at specific times and locations for accurate site-specific management of crop pests. Piloted agricultural aircraft are typically used to treat large, unobstructed, continuous acreage crops and are not as efficient when, working over small or obstructed plots. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously based on pre-programmed flight plans, may be used to make timely and efficient applications over these small area plots. This research developed a low volume spray system for use on a fully autonomous UAV to apply crop protection products on specified crop areas. This article discusses the development of the spray system and its integration with the flight control system of a fully autonomous, unmanned vertical take-off and landing helicopter Sprayer actuation can be triggered by preset positional coordinates as monitored by the equipped Global Positioning System (GPS). The developed spray system has the potential to provide accurate, site-specific crop management when coupled with UAV systems. It also has great potential for vector control in the areas that are not easily accessible by personnel or equipment.

AB Hydrodynamic coefficients strongly affect the dynamic performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Thus it is important to have the true values of the coefficients in order to simulate the AUV's dynamic performance accurately. Although these coefficients can be predicted by many methods, most are only applicable for AUVs with streamlined shapes. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be applied to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of AUVs with complex shapes. In this study, CFD was applied to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of the AUV TUNA-SAND (which stands for terrain-based underwater navigable AUV for seafloor and natural resources development), which has a complex block-like structure. First, the validity of the CFD simulation was verified by comparison with experimental results. Second, the relationships between hydrodynamic loads and motions for all six degrees of freedom were analyzed using the simulated results. Third, the importance of each hydrodynamic coefficient was investigated based on these relationships. There are 16 key damping coefficients that relate to viscosity and 12 key inertial coefficients that relate to the potential flow around TUNA-SAND. Finally, the values of all the key coefficients were obtained and verified by comparing the solutions of the simulated dynamics with the experimental results.

AB This paper presents the utilization of a self-adaptive recurrent neuro-fuzzy control as a feedforward controller and a proportional-plus-derivative (PD) control as a feedback controller for controlling an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in an unstructured environment. Without a priori knowledge, the recurrent neuro-fuzzy system is first trained to model the inverse dynamics of the AUV and then utilized as a feedforward controller to compute the nominal torque of the AUV along a desired trajectory. The PD feedback controller computes the error torque to minimize the system error along the desired trajectory. This error torque also provides an error signal for online updating the parameters in the recurrent neuro-fuzzy control to adapt in a changing environment. A systematic self-adaptive learning algorithm, consisting of a mapping-constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm for the structure learning and a recursive recurrent learning algorithm for the parameter learning, has been developed to construct the recurrent neuro-fuzzy system to model the inverse dynamics of an AUV with fast learning convergence, Computer simulations of the proposed recurrent neuro-fuzzy control scheme and its performance comparison with some existing controllers have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The malicious physical attacks from both sensor and actuator sides make real threats to the security and safety of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). This paper focuses on the problem of neural-network-based event-triggered adaptive security control (ET-ASC) scheme for path following of AGVs subject to arbitrary abnormal actuator signal. First, we assume that an arbitrary abnormal signal is caused by arbitrary malicious attacks or disturbances from actuators. Then, radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is used to reconstruct such abnormal actuator signal. Second, modelling issues on security path following control of AGVs with Sigmoid-like ETC scheme are shown when the AGV is suffering from abnormal actuator signal. In what follows, an ET-ASC scheme is developed to mitigate the adverse effects of abnormal actuator signal with the reconstructed abnormal signal based on a novel Sigmoid-like event-triggered communication scheme. By using the proposed RBF-NN-based ET-ASC scheme, H infinity$$ {H}_{\infty } $$ control performance can be guaranteed under arbitrary malicious actuator signal rather than such attacks following a specific probability distribution. Final, some simulation experiments are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed ET-ASC scheme.

ID PERCEPTION
AB The automotive industry is facing an unprecedented technological transformation towards fully autonomous vehicles. Optimists predict that, by 2030, cars will be sufficiently reliable, affordable, and common to displace most current human driving tasks. To cope with these trends, autonomous vehicles require reliable perception systems to hear and see all the surroundings, being light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors a key instrument for recreating a 3D visualization of the world. However, for a reliable operation, such systems require LiDAR sensors to provide high-resolution 3D representations of the car's vicinity, which results in millions of data points to be processed in real-time. With this article we propose the ALFA-Pi, a data packet decoder and reconstruction system fully deployed on an embedded reconfigurable hardware platform. By resorting to field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, ALFA-Pi is able to interface different LiDAR sensors at the same time, while providing custom representation outputs to high-level perception systems. By accelerating the LiDAR interface, the proposed system outperforms current software-only approaches, achieving lower latency in the data acquisition and data decoding tasks while reaching high performance ratios.

AB This study focuses on addressing the waypoints-based path-following problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) within multiple static and moving obstacles environment. In order to guarantee the safety of AUV obstacle avoidance in complex marine environment, it requires an effective guidance law to plan a safe path and a robust control method to force the AUV to follow safe path to avoid obstacles. Based on the dynamical virtual ship principle, an improved guidance law is developed with the dynamic virtual AUV (DVA) principle. This guidance law generates real-time commands for AUV to follow reference path and avoid obstacle. Furthermore, by combining adaptive laws and barrier Lyapunov function, an effective robust control algorithm is proposed to drive the AUV to follow the DVA. The adaptive law is used to approximate the dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. The barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is employed to guarantee the tracking errors within the preset bounds and thus ensure the safety of the AUV during the obstacle avoidance process. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy.

AB In this paper, the follower-leader formation tracking control problem of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with uncertainties is addressed. A predefined-time sliding-mode reaching law and a predefined-time sliding-mode surface are developed. Then, a novel predefined-time sliding-mode controller (SMC) is proposed. The newly proposed predefined-time SMC extends the recent finite-time and fixed-time schemes and exhibits the following attractive features: (i) The convergence time of finite-time SMC scheme is affected by the initial system conditions. Like the fixed-time SMC, the proposed control scheme can guarantee that the tracking error converges to zero in a finite time which is independent on the initial system conditions; (ii) Unlike the fixed-time SMC, the proposed scheme provides a new appealing advantage is that, the convergence time of proposed scheme is predefined, which means the proposed control scheme can directly achieve the desired convergence time without using the trial and error to choose control parameters. Finally, the numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper addresses a three-dimensional (3D) path following control problem for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subject to both internal and external uncertainties. A two-layered framework synthesizing the 3D guidance law and heuristic fuzzy control is proposed to achieve robust adaptive following along a predefined path. In the first layer, a 3D guidance controller for underactuated AUV is presented to guarantee the stability of path following in the kinematics stage. In the second layer, a heuristic adaptive fuzzy algorithm based on the guidance command and feedback linearization Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is developed in the dynamics stage to account for the nonlinear dynamics and system uncertainties, including inaccuracy modelling parameters and time varying environmental disturbances. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of the heuristic fuzzy controller is presented. Against most existing methods for 3D path following, the proposed robust fuzzy control scheme reduces the design and implementation costs of complicated dynamics controller, and relaxes the knowledge of the accuracy dynamics modelling and environmental disturbances. Finally, numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control framework and illustrate the outper-formance of the proposed controller as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper investigates the potential impacts of dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) systems on the urban road network with a particular focus on charging and energy consumption implications. The paper is motivated by the recent advancement of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology and innovations on smart transportation infrastructure. An eco-driving model aiming at energy consumption reduction is developed and a DWPT system layout suitable for charging eco-driving CAVs at a signalised intersection is proposed. The idea is demonstrated in a simulated environment with different market penetration rate (MPR) of CAVs travelling through a signalized intersection equipped with the proposed DWPT system. The results suggest that as MPR of CAV increases, the energy savings for both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) will increase significantly. At full MPR of CAVs, the reduction of average energy consumption of all types of vehicles can reach up to 62%. The average energy transferred and stored per battery electric vehicle can increase by up to 5% and 10%, respectively. These promising results indicate that a well-designed DWPT system layout together with the eco-driving behaviour of CAVs can have a positive impact on the urban transportation system in terms of resulting energy consumption and emissions.

AB This paper describes the architecture and implementation of an autonomous passenger vehicle designed to navigate using locally perceived information in preference to potentially inaccurate or incomplete map data. The vehicle architecture was designed to handle the original DARPA Urban Challenge requirements of perceiving and navigating a road network with segments defined by sparse waypoints. The vehicle implementation includes many heterogeneous sensors with significant communications and computation bandwidth to capture and process high-resolution, high-rate sensor data. The output of the comprehensive environmental sensing subsystem is fed into a kinodynamic motion planning algorithm to generate all vehicle motion. The requirements of driving in lanes, three-point turns, parking, and maneuvering through obstacle fields are all generated with a unified planner. A key aspect of the planner is its use of closed-loop simulation in a rapidly exploring randomized trees algorithm, which can randomly explore the space while efficiently generating smooth trajectories in a dynamic and uncertain environment. The overall system was realized through the creation of a powerful new suite of software tools for message passing, logging, and visualization. These innovations provide a strong platform for future research in aotonomous driving in global positioning system-denied and highly dynamic environments with poor a priori information.

ID MODEL; FRAMEWORK; BEHAVIOR
AB Vehicle trajectory prediction can provide important support for intelligent transportation systems in areas such as autonomous driving, traffic control, and traffic flow optimization. Predicting vehicle trajectories is an extremely challenging task that not only depends on the vehicle's historical trajectory but also on the dynamic and complex social-temporal relationships of the surrounding traffic network. The trajectory of the target vehicle is influenced by surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods have shortcomings in considering both time dependency and interactive dependency between vehicles or insufficient consideration of the impact of surrounding vehicles. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on a temporal convolutional network (TCN) that considers local and global interactions between vehicles. Specifically, we use a social convolutional pooling layer to capture local interaction features between vehicles and a multihead self-attention layer to capture global interaction features between vehicles. Finally, we combine these two features using an encoder-decoder structure to predict vehicle trajectories. Through experiments on the Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) public dataset and ablation experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our model.

AB Virtual simulated scenes are becoming a critical part of autonomous driving. In the context of knowledge automation and machine learning, simulated images are widely used for visual environmental perception. However, even the most inspirational applications have not fully exploited the potential of simulated images in solving real-world problems. In this article, we propose a novel framework "ParallelEye Pipeline", which uses image-to-image translation and simulated images to automatically generate realistic synthetic images with multiple ground-truth annotations. Specifically, this method has three steps: first, we use Unity3D software to simulate driving scenarios and generate simulated image pairs (including raw images and six ground-truth labels) from the simulated scenes; second, advanced image-to-image translation algorithms can generate realistic and high-resolution synthetic images from simulated image pairs; third, we exploit publicly datasets, simulated images, and synthetic images to conduct experiments for visual perception. The experimental results suggest: 1) synthetic images and simulated images can improve the performance of detectors in real autonomous driving scenarios and 2) image-to-image translation algorithms can be affected by occlusion condition.

AB Intelligent Vector Field Histogram (IVFH) is proposed to accomplish the collision avoidance of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in underwater three-dimensional dynamic space. The directed cuboid static obstacle environment model is introduced to improve the efficiency of collision avoidance decision-making. The candidate direction set is composed of relative heading and relative pitch. According to the obstacle distribution of local environment, the traveling fitness of each candidate direction is calculated from the perspectives of safety and rapidity, so as to realize the collision avoidance of AUV in three-dimensional dynamic environment. IVFH method can adaptively adjust the parameters that affect the collision avoidance action amplitude according to the obstacle distance and size. The collision avoidance velocity is adjusted by fuzzy logic according to the environment conditions, so as to ensure that AUV can fully perceive the environment and then complete the collision avoidance decision-making. The simulation results show that IVFH method can overcome the threshold sensitivity of traditional VFH method, escape from the trap area, and realize collision avoidance in three-dimensional dynamic complex obstacle environment. The proposed IVFH collision avoidance method has been verified by simulations, as well as lake and sea experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness and practicability.

AB This paper proposes a novel vision-based autonomous landing scheme for micro aerial vehicles with perturbations by using a gimbaled camera. There are no sensors available on the moving target in the task. The relative position between the drone and moving target is obtained by the camera mounted on a two-degree-of-freedom pan-tile platform. Firstly, the detection algorithm runs in real time and outputs the pixel tracking errors. Then, an adaptive vision-based controller for the pan-tilt platform guarantees that the line of sight of the camera always tracks the target. Next, the relative position tracking error is approximated according to the gimbal's rotation angles. Disturbance observer-based control is applied for flight control to attenuate the effect of disturbance and recover the hign tracking performance, where relative velocity and lumped disturbances are estimated by extend disturbance observers. The proposed flight controller guarantees that the tracking errors are ultimately bounded with tunable ultimate bounds. The convergence property is demonstrated through Lyapunov theory. The simulations and experiments illustrate the effectiveness and the superiority performance of the proposed control system.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) have a significant role in ocean research and the marine environment with the aim of performing different scientific and commercial tasks. During an underwater operation, fault detection for AUV is essential for critical operational decisions such as precautions, maintenance, and repair. This study presents an approach, GASEL, which combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ensemble Learning (EL), for fault detection of AUVs. The proposed GASEL approach is effective since the ratio of 97.70% of the feature vector was eliminated by using GA in the feature selection stage. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient way to solve this problem by removing redundant and irrelevant data, which usually reduces computational complexity and provides a better understanding of the data and learning model. The experiments were conducted on a real-world AUV dataset. The results show that the GASEL approach successfully predicted the faulty state of AUV by 99.70% accuracy and fault type detection (severe propeller fault, slight propeller fault, load increase fault, and sensor fault) with 98.96% accuracy. Furthermore, the results also showed that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset.

AB In autonomous vehicles (AVs), early warning systems rely on collision prediction to ensure occupant safety. However, state-of-the-art methods using deep convolutional networks either fail at modeling collisions or are too expensive/slow, making them less suitable for deployment on AV edge hardware. To address these limitations, we propose SG2VEC, a spatiotemporal scene-graph embedding methodology that uses the graph neural network (GNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to predict future collisions via visual scene perception. We demonstrate that SG2VEC predicts collisions 8.11% more accurately and 39.07% earlier than the state-of-the-art method on synthesized data sets, and 29.47% more accurately on a challenging real-world collision data set. We also show that SG2VEC is better than the state of the art at transferring knowledge from synthetic data sets to real-world driving data sets. Finally, we demonstrate that SG2VEC performs inference 9.3x faster with an 88.0% smaller model, 32.4% less power, and 92.8% less energy than the state-of-the-art method on the industrystandard Nvidia DRIVE PX 2 platform, making it more suitable for implementation on the edge.

AB Due to the complexity of the ocean environment, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is disturbed by obstacles when performing tasks. Therefore, the research on underwater obstacle detection and avoidance is particularly important. Based on the images collected by a forward-looking sonar on an AUV, this article proposes an obstacle detection and avoidance algorithm. First, a deep learning-based obstacle candidate area detection algorithm is developed. This algorithm uses the You Only Look Once (YOLO) v3 network to determine obstacle candidate areas in a sonar image. Then, in the determined obstacle candidate areas, the obstacle detection algorithm based on the improved threshold segmentation algorithm is used to detect obstacles accurately. Finally, using the obstacle detection results obtained from the sonar images, an obstacle avoidance algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is developed to plan a reasonable obstacle avoidance path of an AUV. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms improve obstacle detection accuracy and processing speed of sonar images. At the same time, the proposed algorithms ensure AUV navigation safety in a complex obstacle environment.

AB This study investigates a path following problem of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle under multiple uncertainties in three-dimensional space. The uncertainties are partly induced by hydrodynamic coefficient uncertainty, ocean currents and unmodeled hydrodynamics, namely dynamic uncertainties. In addition, velocities are assumed to be measured with bounded noise, which is called velocity measurement uncertainties. To address this issue, a compound robust path following control strategy is developed. At the kinematic level, an improved kinematic controller is developed by utilizing disturbance observer to recover the unknown time-varying attack and side-slip angular velocity. At the dynamic level, a novel dynamic tracking model is firstly established via linear parameter varying (LPV) technique, by which multiple uncertainties are expressed in a comprehensive way. Subsequently, a robust LPV controller is employed to track desired velocities generated by kinematic controller, which has less dependence on accurate model and exact velocity measurement. Finally, rigorous stability analysis proves the uniform and ultimate boundedness of path following errors. The comparative numerical results also substantiate the efficacy and superiority of designed method. (c) 2020 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Navigation system design using time-varying complementary filters
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS

ID H-INFINITY
AB A new methodology for the design of navigation systems for autonomous vehicles is introduced. Using simple kinematic relationships, the problem of estimating the velocity and position of an autonomous vehicle is solved by resorting to special bilinear time-varying tilters, These are the natural generalization of linear time-invariant complementary filters that are commonly used to properly merge sensor information available at low frequency with that available in the complementary region. Complementary filters lend themselves to frequency domain interpretations that provide valuable insight into the filtering design process, This work extends these properties to the time-varying setting by resorting to the theory of linear differential inclusions and by converting the problem of weighted filter performance analysis into that of determining the feasibility of a related set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Using this set-up, the stability of the resulting filters as well as their "frequency-like" performance can be assessed using efficient numerical analysis tools that borrow from convex optimization techniques. The mathematical background that is required for complementary time-varying filter analysis and design is introduced. Its application to the design of a navigation system that estimates position and velocity of an autonomous vehicle by complementing position information available from SPS with the velocity information provided by a Doppler sonar system is described.

AB This paper is concerned with the stability of the vehicular platoon consisting of a leader and multiple cooperative autonomous driving followers. The objective of the platoon control is to ensure all vehicles traveling at the same speed while maintaining a safety spacing. To achieve the objective, a novel control framework consisting of the distributed adaptive event-triggered observer and the car-following control protocol is proposed for the vehicular platoon control. The condition that only few following vehicles can access the information of the leader is considered. In order to design controllers while avoid using any global information, such as the system matrix and the state of the leader, a distributed event-triggered observer is proposed, such that each vehicle can observe the dynamics of the leader. Based on this observer, both collision avoidance and limited communication source of each vehicle are simultaneously considered in the design of the observer. It is shown that under the proposed control framework, the platoon can achieve asymptotical stable, meanwhile, the amount of transmission data and communication cost among vehicles can be reduced. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to show the applicability of the obtained results.

ID MODEL
AB In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a method for risk-based path planning, generating risk-acceptable trajectories for an autonomous surface ship. This objective is achieved in two steps. The first step uses a dynamic probabilistic risk assessment method called K-shortest-paths Probabilistic Risk Assessment (KPRA), alongside risk models and dynamic system simulation, whose output is a list of paths ranked with respect to risk. Multiple risk influencing factors and accident types may be considered in this step. In this work, collision and powered grounding accidents, and their risk-influencing factors and indicators, are considered. The second step is to perform risk evaluation on the ranked scenarios, comparing them to predefined risk acceptance criteria and defining which scenarios have acceptable risk. Evaluating multiple paths allows operators to choose how strict the autonomous ship's decision-making should be regarding risk, avoiding the problem of minimization algorithms being too conservative in terms of risk. One of the risk-acceptable paths is then chosen as a local plan to be acted by the autonomous ship. This paper has two main scientific contributions. First, an online Bayesian belief network risk model for navigation accident probability is designed and integrated to improve KPRA. Second, we propose a modified guidance, navigation, and control framework for autonomous ships, to include risk-based planning. We implement the modified framework into a real autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) named Grethe and demonstrate the method's capabilities in field trials, where the ASV uses the method to generate local plans that avoid possible collision and grounding accidents.

AB As we know, for autonomous robots working in a complex underwater region, obstacle avoidance design will play an important role in underwater tasks. In this paper, a binocular-vision-based underwater obstacle avoidance mechanism is discussed and verified with our self-made Underwater Quadrocopter Vehicle. The proposed Underwater Quadrocopter Vehicle (UQV for short), like a quadrocopter drone working underwater, is a new kind of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), which is equipped with four propellers along the vertical direction of the robotic body to adjust its body posture and two propellers arranged at the sides of the robotic body to provide propulsive and turning force. Moreover, an underwater binocular-vision-based obstacle positioning method is studied to measure an underwater spherical obstacle's radius and its distance from the UQV. Due to its perfect ability of full-freedom underwater actions, the proposed UQV has obvious advantages such as a zero turning radius compared with existing torpedo-shaped AUVs. Therefore, one semicircle-curve-based obstacle avoidance path is planned on the basis of an obstacle's coordinates. Practical pool experiments show that the proposed binocular vision can locate an underwater obstacle accurately, and the designed UQV has the ability to effectively avoid multiple obstacles along the predefined trajectory.

AB For the emerging topic of automated and autonomous vehicles in all major sectors, reliable and accurate state estimation for navigation of these vehicles becomes increasingly important. Inertial navigation, aided with measurements from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), allows high-rate and low-cost estimation of position, velocity and orientation in real-time applications. As the available satellite constellations for navigation are modernized and their number is rising, usage of multi-constellation, dual frequency and integration of correction data lead to increased accuracy, especially in areas with partial shadowing. Different coupling methods, e.g. tightly- and loosely-coupled integrations, were developed to combine inertial and GNSS measurements. Also different error estimation filters were applied to the navigation problem, and evaluated against each other. For the typical navigation task, the objective is to choose a suitable algorithm for the specific requirements of the target application, and deploy it using an appropriate implementation strategy. This contribution gives a short introduction into the field of aided inertial navigation techniques, provides useful hints for implementation, and evaluates their performance in experiments using two different railway vehicles, an autonomous maritime vessel, and an unmanned aerial quadrotor.

TI GuideWeb: a conceptually infrastructure-free vehicle navigation system
SO IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS

DT Article
AB A new paradigm named GuideWeb for networks based on vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) communication is presented. GuideWeb is a support network for vehicle navigation and guidance. It is constituted by the cooperation of a multitude of autonomous MapSynthesiser nodes located in vehicles. A MapSynthesiser, being the autonomous core of GuideWeb, receives over radio communication traffic flow information using information-enhanced maps (called map syntheses) from other GuideWeb participants' MapSynthesiser. From received map syntheses and the information of its own travel route it creates a new map synthesis, which is then broadcasted. MapSynthesiser provides timely and accurate information on traffic flow and density as well as traversability everywhere within a radius of similar to 100 km to a navigation system for driver assistance. MapSynthesiser cooperation is based on short-range radio communication (e.g. Wireless Local Area Network - WLAN) and/or mobile communication networks. GuideWeb deploys the simple method of broadcast for network formation and thus, avoids the time lags arising from setting up and maintaining a connection-oriented ad hoc network. By the map-based data design, data security and privacy are ensured. Therefore, GuideWeb can serve as a commercially viable introductory phase for full-fledged v2v communication networks. The lessons learned from GuideWeb deployment provide insights for a v2v network design.

AB Self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles (AVs), and connected cars combine the Internet of Things (IoT) and automobile technologies, thus contributing to the development of society. However, processing the big data generated by AVs is a challenge due to overloading issues. Additionally, near real-time/real-time IoT services play a significant role in vehicle safety. Therefore, the architecture of an IoT system that collects and processes data, and provides services for vehicle driving, is an important consideration. In this study, we propose a fog computing server model that generates a high-definition (HD) map using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data generated from an AV. The driving vehicle edge node transmits the LiDAR point cloud information to the fog server through a wireless network. The fog server generates an HD map by applying the Normal Distribution Transform-Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(NDT-SLAM) algorithm to the point clouds transmitted from the multiple edge nodes. Subsequently, the coordinate information of the HD map generated in the sensor frame is converted to the coordinate information of the global frame and transmitted to the cloud server. Then, the cloud server creates an HD map by integrating the collected point clouds using coordinate information.

AB Loss of accuracy in automated vehicle position control systems due to Global Positioning System (GPS) signal quality is currently one of the most studied research topics in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This paper presents all integrated positioning system that combines a GPS with onboard sensors and ail Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to perform autonomous vehicle guidance. Depending on GIPS precision. the system discriminates which positioning is most appropriate from three different possibilities: 1) real-time kinematic differential global positioning system (RTK-DGPS) is working at the highest positioning accuracy (1cm). In this instance. GPS data are Used as the main sensory supply; 2) total DGPS signal loss. Now, the IMU control system takes control; 3) centimeter accuracy is lost. In this instance. GPS and IMU measurements are integrated to determine the true positioning. This system has been installed in a Citroen C3 Pluriel car, where all the actuators were automated to achieve human-like driving. Experimental results show the car's behavior in diverse situations and prove that the test-bed vehicle can maintain automatic navigation even when GPS Positioning is Unavailable. The results also show the need to combine sensory information to obtain optimum navigation control in any circumstance. Copyright (c) 2008 CEA.

AB We consider a cooperative surveillance problem for a group of autonomous air vehicles (AAVs) that periodically receives information on suspected locations of targets from a satellite and then must cooperate to decide which AAV should search for each target. This cooperation must be performed in spite of imperfect intervehicle communications (e.g., messages with random but bounded delays), less than full communication connectivity between vehicles, uncertainty in target locations, and imperfect vehicle search sensors. We represent the state of the search progress with a "search map," and use an invariant set to model the set of states where there is no useful information on target locations. Arrivals of new suspected target location information from the satellite corresponds to perturbations of the search map from this invariant set. A cooperation strategy that pursues a type of "persistent area denial" will try to force trajectories of the system into the invariant set by exploiting initial target information and search progress by the AAVs. We show that the invariant set is exponentially stable for a class of cooperative surveillance strategies. We provide a comparative analysis of cooperative and noncooperative strategies. Next, we show via simulations the impact of imperfect communications, imperfect vehicle search sensors, uncertainty in search locations, and pop-up suspected locations on performance.

SO VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS

DE autonomous driving; vehicle dynamics and control; autonomous path
   following
AB This paper presents a feedback-feedforward steering controller that simultaneously maintains vehicle stability at the limits of handling while minimising lateral path tracking deviation. The design begins by considering the performance of a baseline controller with a lookahead feedback scheme and a feedforward algorithm based on a nonlinear vehicle handling diagram. While this initial design exhibits desirable stability properties at the limits of handling, the steady-state path deviation increases significantly at highway speeds. Results from both linear and nonlinear analyses indicate that lateral path tracking deviations are minimised when vehicle sideslip is held tangent to the desired path at all times. Analytical results show that directly incorporating this sideslip tangency condition into the steering feedback dramatically improves lateral path tracking, but at the expense of poor closed-loop stability margins. However, incorporating the desired sideslip behaviour into the feedforward loop creates a robust steering controller capable of accurate path tracking and oversteer correction at the physical limits of tyre friction. Experimental data collected from an Audi TTS test vehicle driving at the handling limits on a full length race circuit demonstrates the improved performance of the final controller design.

AB This paper studies the application of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the motion control of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with unknown disturbances. Firstly, a general state space, action space and reward function are designed for motion control problems rather than each specific motion control task, which ensures the generality of our method. Furthermore, a virtual AUV model with partial random disturbances is established, and on this basis, a simulation training method is developed to solve the problems of extremely high risk and extremely low efficiency caused by training in actual experiments. Then, in order to directly deploy the optimal control policy obtained through simulation training to an actual AUV, we employ Extended State Observers (ESOs) to estimate the unknown disturbances in five degrees of freedom, and give a deployment method using the estimated values as the disturbance state vector and compensation vector. Combining the above training method and deployment method, a novel general motion controller is proposed. Finally, four different AUV motion control simulations are carried out, and the results confirm the generality and effectiveness of our proposed controller.

AB Recently, with the advancement in autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, cooperative perception between roadway infrastructure and connected and automated vehicles via V2X communications has attracted increasing attention. However, most of the systems and prototypes reported are still at an initial stage. This paper introduces a newly developed and deployed roadside cooperative perception system with an edge-cloud structure and multiple kinds of sensors, including fisheye cameras, thermal cameras, and long-distance radars. The system is deployed at a roundabout at the intersection of State St. and W. Ellsworth Rd. in Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S. With an edge-cloud structure, it can execute high-performance detection algorithms on edge devices at the field and collect data and analyze it on the cloud. The performance, in relation to detection rate, localization accuracy, and latency, is analyzed using the data collected from the field. These results show that the system has high potential for a wide range of applications, including infrastructure-vehicle cooperative perception, traffic data collection, and road safety studies. Two example applications-traffic volume monitoring and road safety warning-are introduced in the latter part of the paper to demonstrate the system's capability.

AB With the rapid development and implementation of autonomous vehicles (AVs), the simultaneous and accurate trajectory tracking problem for such AVs has become a popular research topic. This paper proposes a comprehensive linear time-varying model predictive controller (LTV-MPC) design for a type of AV, aiming to achieve good trajectory tracking in a practical driving scenario. First, a two-degree-of-freedom kinematic model of an AV is established. Next, an error model of the AV's trajectory tracking system is constructed using linear time-varying theory. A successive linearization is introduced to linearize the nonlinear tracking error model, and a quadratic programming optimization problem is then formulated. Thus, the control sequence for this AV is incorporated into the predictive control framework, and the desired controller can be solved with a relatively higher computational efficiency and lower computational cost. Finally, the effectiveness and performance of the proposed controller are validated via a comparison of simulations conducted using MATLAB software and experiments conducted using a self-established test platform. The results demonstrate that the proposed LTV-MPC method can track the prescribed reference road trajectories with high precision and stability for an AV under various driving conditions.

AB Fully controllable autonomous vehicles offer unprecedented opportunities to address the inefficiency associated with selfish routing, a fundamental issue in transportation network modeling. This study proposes a route control scheme that aims to strike a balance between gains in the system efficiency and the control intensity, defined as the demand flow under control for each origin-destination (OD) pair. The proposed model has a bi-level structure and is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). A specialized algorithm based on sensitivity analysis and the alternative direction method of multiplier (ADMM) is developed to find a local optimum for the MPEC. Results of numerical experiments show that (1) in all tested cases, controlling a minority of vehicles (less than 10% in some case) could bring the system very close to the system optimum; (2) some O-D pairs enjoy a higher control priority than the others, mostly due to the underlying network topology rather than the demand magnitude; (3) the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient; (4) starting from different initial solutions, the algorithm produces very similar local optimal solutions.

AB This study proposes a state estimation and compression method for navigating multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) toward wide area surveys near seafloors. In the proposed method, a moving AUV navigates by referencing a stationary landmark AUV on the seafloor. By alternating the landmark role, all AUVs can cover a wide area while maintaining low positioning errors. The moving AUV estimates the states (positions and headings) of both moving and landmark AUVs by a stochastic approach called a particle filter. When AUVs exchange their landmark roles, they must share their estimated states. However, state sharing is precluded by the low data rate of acoustical communications in underwater environments. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes a state compression method in which AUVs approximate their states by "particle clustering" based on a clustering method (k-means) and a model evaluation method (Akaike information criterion). The compression method enables AUVs to share their states by communicating small amounts of data. The proposed method was evaluated in simulations of two AUVs navigating over a 300 x 300-m(2) seafloor area. Throughout the simulation, the proposed method maintained stable positioning and successful state sharing with small communication data size.

AB Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) with advanced guidance, navigation, and control capabilities have attracted great attention in recent years. Sailing safely and efficiently are critical requirements for autonomous control of MASS. The MASS utilizes the information collected by the radar, camera, and Autonomous Identification System (AIS) with which it is equipped. This paper investigates the problem of optimal motion planning for MASS, so it can accomplish its sailing task early and safely when it sails together with other conventional ships. We develop velocity obstacle models for both dynamic and static obstacles to represent the potential conflict-free region with other objects. A greedy interval-based motion-planning algorithm is proposed based on the Velocity Obstacle (VO) model, and we show that the greedy approach may fail to avoid collisions in the successive intervals. A way-blocking metric is proposed to evaluate the risk of collision to improve the greedy algorithm. Then, by assuming constant velocities of the surrounding ships, a novel Dynamic Programming (DP) method is proposed to generate the optimal multiple interval motion plan for MASS. These proposed algorithms are verified by extensive simulations, which show that the DP algorithm provides the lowest collision rate overall and better sailing efficiency than the greedy approaches.

AB In this study, the motion stability of a new type of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) named an "autonomous underwater helicopter (AUH)" with a disk-shaped hull was analyzed to better accomplish the complex tasks under the sea, namely, pipeline maintenance, mobile observation network, resources exploration, and isodepth navigation. A Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) grid for the AUH was created with an ICEM mesh generation tool. The RANS-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique, ANSYS-CFX, was adopted to analyze the AUH's behavior, including its motion stability and maneuverability in the horizontal and vertical planes. Pivotal hydrodynamic technical issues including configurations selection and a trade-off study of the AUH were analyzed with the RANS solver, including computed pressure distribution and comparison of different lengths of aquatic transducers mounted on the AUH for enhanced hydrodynamic performance. The Routh motion stability criterion based on the 6-DOF equations of motion consisting of linear hydrodynamic derivatives was implemented by the RANS solver for the optimized AUH with a service speed in the range of 13 knots. The simulation results and experimental tests show that the AUH has ample motion stability for enhanced maneuverability in translational and rotatory motion during under-sea navigation. The results suggest that design configurations of the appended hull can be used on AUVs.

AB The evolutionary applications of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to serve as part of public transport systems deserve more attention from the urban transport perspective. This study thus views AV as a novel smart mobility technology and proposes an extended model of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with additional variables to investigate the effects of factors influencing people to use autonomous shuttle services. We utilize a sample of 700 passengers who took a test-ride of autonomous shuttle services in a scooter-dominant urban mobility context for model estimations. Results show that both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness positively correlate to attitude, in turn leading to use intention. Trust is positively related to attitude, but not to use intention, while perceived enjoyment is positively related to both attitude and use intention. Results of multi-group analyses indicate the moderating roles of age and gender in the estimated models. Overall, respondents are satisfied with the shuttle service in terms of the five attributes of speed, stability and comfort, safety, convenience, and information clarity. However, the speed of shuttle service is the one attribute to which respondents are most concerned. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS)/inertial measurement unit (IMU) have been widely used in autonomous driving systems. LiDAR-GNSS/IMU calibration directly affects the performance of vehicle localization and perception. Current calibration methods require specific vehicle movements or scenarios with artificial calibration markers to keep the problem well-constrained, which are empirical, time-consuming, and poorly automated. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel self-calibration method based on both relative and absolute motion constraints. Initial calibration parameters are calculated with relative motion constraints derived from LiDAR odometry. To eliminate the impact of odometry drift and enhance the observability of translation parameters, calibration parameters are iteratively refined by tightly coupling both relative and absolute motion constraints derived from scan-global map matching. Tests on simulation and ground datasets show that the proposed method is robust and accurate with RMSEs of 10(-3?) and 10(-3) m for rotation and translation, respectively. Further mapping and localization experiments with calculated calibration parameters present a state-of-the-art absolute localization accuracy of about 3 cm.

ID SYSTEM
AB In order to improve the efficiency and safety of autonomous vehicles' decision-making process in complex urban scenarios, a decision-making method for hierarchical processing of static traffic law information and dynamic traffic participant information is proposed in this paper. In the decision-making method, the candidate behavior set is constructed by extracting the element of traffic laws and fully considering the traffic laws constraints to ensure the legality and effectiveness of the decision-making algorithm. Besides, four evaluation indicators and two-level entry threshold are designed to select the optimal driving behavior with the consideration of driving efficiency, ride safety and macro path requirement. The advantage of proposed method is that it avoids the problem of poor adaptability to traffic laws and regulations as the existing methods usually make decisions under the condition of mixed traffic laws and traffic participant information. A complete driving task simulation and analysis, including six typical urban traffic scenarios, is given under Matlab environment. The results show that the proposed decision-making method is able to make reasonable and feasible decisions and highly consistent with the actual driver's decision-making behavior in complex urban scenarios, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

DE Autonomous vehicle navigation; computer vision for transportation; deep
   learning methods
AB Predicting a vehicle's trajectory is an essential ability for autonomous vehicles navigating through complex urban traffic scenes. Bird's-eye-view roadmap information provides valuable information for making trajectory predictions, and while state-of-the-art models extract this information via image convolution, auxiliary loss functions can augment patterns inferred from deep learning by further encoding common knowledge of social and legal driving behaviors. Since human driving behavior is inherently multimodal, models which allow for multimodal output tend to outperform single-prediction models on standard metrics. We propose a loss function which enhances such models by enforcing expected driving rules on all predicted modes. Our contribution to trajectory prediction is twofold; we propose a new metric which addresses failure cases of the off-road rate metric by penalizing trajectories that oppose the ascribed heading (flow direction) of a driving lane, and we show this metric to be differentiable and therefore suitable as an auxiliary loss function. We then use this auxiliary loss to extend the the standard multiple trajectory prediction (MTP) and MultiPath models, achieving improved results on the nuScenes prediction benchmark by predicting trajectories which better conform to the lane-following rules of the road.

   Task analysis; Vehicle dynamics; Autonomous vehicles
AB Computer vision tasks such as object detection are crucial for the operations of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Results of many tasks, even those requiring high computational power, can be obtained within a short delay by offloading them to edge clouds. However, although edge clouds are exploited, real-time object detection cannot always be guaranteed due to dynamic channel quality. To mitigate this problem, we propose an edge-network-assisted real-time object detection framework (EODF). In an EODF, AVs extract the region of interest (Rols) of the captured image when the channel quality is not sufficiently good for supporting real-time object detection. Then AVs compress the image data on the basis of the Rols and transmit the compressed one to the edge cloud. In so doing, real-time object detection can be achieved due to the reduced transmission latency. To verify the feasibility of our framework, we evaluate the probability that the results of object detection are not received within the inter-frame duration (i.e., outage probability) and their accuracy. From the evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed EODF provides the results to AVs in real time and achieves satisfactory accuracy.

AB Recently, there has been growing interest in developing Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to operate for longer mission durations as well as with higher levels of autonomy. This paper describes the current state of the art in methodologies to enable long range AUVs and provides a detailed literature review of some existing AUVs characterizing their operation endurance. Path planning is identified as the core and crucial components to improve AUV persistence. The aims of path optimization, path replanning adapting to the dynamic environments, and cooperative path planning of multiple AUVs have received much attention from the research community. This paper presents a review of the main research works focusing on these three technology areas. The main objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of shape and properties of the path and optimization techniques for path planning. These techniques and algorithms have been classified into different classes and their assumptions and drawbacks have been discussed. Finally, the paper discusses the AUV literature in general and highlights challenges that need to be addressed in developing AUVs with advanced autonomy and capable of operating for longer mission durations.

AB This paper models autonomous ridesharing - multiple travelers simultaneously riding one shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) - in a network equilibrium setting with mixed SAV and human-driven vehicle (HV) traffic. We make two major methodological contributions. First, a novel one (SAV)-to-many (riders) matching is proposed to characterize the waiting times of an SAV and multiple travelers who share rides in the SAV during online matching, which is a nontrivial generalization of the one-to-one matching without ridesharing. Our matching characterization considers the possibilities of a traveler matched with an SAV starting from the same origin, whereto the SAV moved unoccupied as a result of either pickup or relocation, or with an in- service SAV that goes through the traveler's origin. Second, a section-based formulation for SAV ridesharing user equilibrium is introduced to characterize the SAV traveler flow, which accom-modates the possibility that an SAV traveler's itinerary (OD pair) is different from that of the serving SAV and other travelers in the SAV. Unlike the existing link and route based ridesharing formulations, the notion of section both prevents undesired traveler en-route transfer(s) and al-lows travelers of multiple ODs to share rides, meanwhile respecting the SAV seat capacity constraint. In addition to the above two methodological contributions, the optimal SAV fleet size, fare, routing, and allocation (to in-service, pickup, and relocation states) decisions of a trans-portation network company (TNC) are formulated. The TNC decisions anticipate traveler re-actions as characterized by a new multimodal autonomous ridesharing user equilibrium (MARUE), which is put forward with a proof of its existence and finds the endogenous market shares and road congestion effects of SAV/HV. Original insights are obtained from model implementation, including substantial systemwide benefit of ridesharing, marginal benefit of relocation in the presence of ridesharing, and diminishing economies of SAV size.

ID NEUROMORPHIC VISION
AB Detecting and locating surrounding vehicles robustly and efficiently are essential capabilities for autonomous vehicles. Existing solutions often rely on vision-based methods or 3D LiDAR-based methods. These methods are either too expensive in both sensor pricing (3D LiDAR) and computation (camera and 3D LiDAR) or less robust in resisting harsh environment changes (camera). In this work, we revisit the LiDAR based approaches for vehicle detection with a less expensive 2D LiDAR by utilizing modern deep learning approaches. We aim at filling in the gap as few previous works conclude an efficient and robust vehicle detection solution in a deep learning way in 2D. To this end, we propose a learning based method with the input of pseudo-images, named Cascade Pyramid Region Proposal Convolution Neural Network (Cascade Pyramid RCNN), and a hybrid learning method with the input of sparse points, named Hybrid Resnet Lite. Experiments are conducted with our newly 2D LiDAR vehicle dataset recorded in complex traffic environments. Results demonstrate that the Cascade Pyramid RCNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while the proposed Hybrid Resnet Lite provides superior performance of the speed and lightweight model by hybridizing learning based and non-learning based modules. As few previous works conclude an efficient and robust vehicle detection solution with 2D LiDAR, our research fills in this gap and illustrates that even with limited sensing source from a 2D LiDAR, detecting obstacles like vehicles efficiently and robustly is still achievable.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING CONTROL; AUVS
AB This paper proposes a cooperative learning formation control method with finite-time prescribed performance based on position estimation for parametric path tracking of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with uncertainties and external disturbances. The parametric path used in the control law permits the velocity to be specified independently while tracking the path accurately. The localized radial basis function neural net-works learn the uncertainties cooperatively while tracking the period path, and the knowledge gained from learning is utilized to construct an empirically based formation control law using experience to cope with similar uncertainties rather than repeatedly using adaptive methods, which reduces the computing burden. The position of the leader is assumed to be available only for the leader's neighboring AUV, and a novel finite-time distributed observer is presented for the followers to estimate the leader's position. Based on this, the control law is derived from the prescribed performance control method using a finite-time performance function rather than expo-nential decaying function to enable the tracking error converges in finite time, which accelerates the learning process. The simulation results confirm the validity of the presented control protocol.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS
AB Weak thruster fault detection problem is investigated for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) with being less than 10% loss of effectiveness fault in a thruster. For the weak thruster fault, the fault features are small in general, meanwhile the fault features are also difficult to be distinguished from the external disturbances including measurement noise. In this paper, a weak thruster fault detection method is developed based on Bayesian network and hidden Markov model. In the proposed method, the fault features are enhanced at first and then the fault detection is achieved based on the occurrence probability. Specifically, Bayesian network is applicable to enhance weak signals, but the prior knowledge is difficult to obtain for an AUV. To solve this problem, this paper introduces sparse decomposition into Bayesian network to enhance the weak thruster fault features. And then, a hidden Markov model is established to provide the likelihood probability between the observation sequence and the predict one. The fault detection is achieved according to comparing the probability and the threshold. Finally, pool-experimental results on an AUV are presented to verify the effectiveness of the developed fault detection method.

AB This paper is concerned with the coordinated formation control problem of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under alterable communication topology and time-varying delay in discrete time domain. Firstly, the multi-AUV system is divided into one leader and multiple followers, and the communication topology is divided into two parts. The coupled nonlinear AUV model is linearized into a second-order integral model using state feedback. Secondly, two types of coordinated controllers in discrete time are proposed: the controller for multi-AUV system without delay, the controller for multi-AUV system with time-varying delay. Then, the formation control issue for multiple AUVs with alterable topology is treated as the asymptotic stability of an error system. The stability analysis of the error system consisting of the state errors between each follower and the leader is performed, to obtain some novel sufficient conditions for achieving the formation control objective. Finally, some simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results, and the comparisons describe the effects of communication topology and delay on the performance of the control system.

AB This article tackles the finite-time global trajectory tracking control problem of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in presence of input saturation constraints, actuator faults, unknown dynamics, and external disturbances. First, we describe the orientation of the AUV by rotation matrix instead of classical Euler angle or unit quaternion such that the AUV's dynamics could be globally formulated without singularity and unwinding phenomenon. After that, a smooth dead zone-based model is introduced here to linearize the actuator model, leaving that the adaptive laws could be suitable for the solution of input saturation and actuator faults. Considering that the difficulty of model dynamic acquirement, together with the complicity of rotation-matrix-based representation, would trouble deployment of the controller. The minimum learning parameter technology is thereby utilized to approximated the dynamic nonlinearity of the AUV. On the basis of these, a rotation-matrix-based sliding mode control scheme is technically proposed. It is proved that the tracking errors can be stabilized to a small neighborhood of origin within a settling time. Finally, several set numerical experiments are conducted to assess the effectiveness and show the advantages of the proposed control scheme.

ID IDEOLOGY
AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) promise a reduction in the number of deadly traffic accidents. However, should accidents occur, attributions of responsibility are complicated by the fact that there is a human agent (driver) and a non-human agent (AV), and thus responsibility is likely shared between parties. In two studies, participants (n = 310 and n = 260) read a vignette modeled after an actual lethal AV accident. Across four experimental conditions, participants were told that the human driver either needed to maintain oversight of the AV; did not need to maintain oversight of the AV; did not specify whether the human needed to maintain oversight of the AV; or the artificial intelligence was turned off and the human driver was fully in control. Participants assigned responsibility to the human driver, the AV company, the pedestrian, and an act of God, and determined whether the human driver and company CEO should be held criminally responsible in court. Consistent with previous research, the human driver was held most responsible regardless of oversight condition. However, companies were not absolved of responsibility, even when they required the human driver to maintain oversight of the AV. Implications of these findings for the introduction and legal regulation of AVs are discussed.

AB This paper treats the subject of variable-depth path following control of an under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with multiple uncertainties. The modeling uncertainties of the investigated AUV are composed of inaccurate hydrodynamic coefficients and unknown environmental disturbances. For this uncertain system, a nonlinear control law integrating line-of-sight (LOS) guidance with fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) algorithm is designed to guarantee global K-exponentially convergence of path following errors. The LOS guidance in the Serret-Frenet frame is adopted to guide the under-actuated AUV to move towards the curved variable-depth path. The sliding mode control algorithm ensures the stability and the robustness of the designed control law in the presence of multiple uncertainties. The fuzzy logic algorithm is integrated to adjust sliding mode gain in order to weaken chattering. In addition, the angle of attack is considered in the design of dynamics control law to ensure that the under-actuated AUV follows the predefined path with a given resultant speed. Finally, a comparative simulation study illustrates the effectiveness of the designed FSMC algorithm for variable-depth path following of an under-actuated AUV with multiple uncertainties.

AB For the high-speed and light autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), it is moving freely, and the speed and attitude are in dynamic movement. Then, the traditional static and quasi-static ground alignment cannot be used any more. Using the optimisation-based alignment (OBA) scheme, this study presents a novel estimation method for fast initial coarse alignment of a AUV's strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS). The novel OBA method use the inertial measurement unit, the pressure sensor measurements and the navigational velocity (v) in v-frame produced by the motor thrust to solve the attitude estimation problem which is known as Wahba's problem. Unlike several current techniques, the presented estimation method is effective to any movement form. The simulation results show that the attitude determined by this novel method can meet the accuracy requirement of coarse alignment and it can be used as input for the fine alignment.

AB With the increasing number of applications for both surface and underwater autonomous vehicles, a great amount of control methods and guidance principles has been developed over the years. This work proposes a review of the most common of these methods. It is mainly focused on model-based nonlinear control methods and guidance principles. Notably, this work details examples and variations of model-based linearizing controllers, applications of line of sight guidance, sliding mode controllers and several other less common control methods for both fully-actuated and underactuated vehicles. Additionally, this work proposes an alternative definition of underactuation with respect to the task allowing for a better understanding of the consequences of underactuation on control. Comparison of fully-actuated and underactuated cases shows how control laws can be used to solve the problems of underactuation and what mechanisms can be used to compensate for the lack of actuation on a degree of freedom. The reviewed methods are compared and discussed with respect to their capabilities, limitations and suitability for typical tasks.

TI Autonomous Path Planning for Road Vehicles in Narrow Environments: An
   Efficient Continuous Curvature Approach

AB In this paper we introduce a novel method for obtaining good quality paths for autonomous road vehicles (e.g., cars or buses) in narrow environments. There are many traffic situations in urban scenarios where nontrivial maneuvering in narrow places is necessary. Navigating in cluttered parking lots or having to avoid obstacles blocking the way and finding a detour even in narrow streets are challenging, especially if the vehicle has large dimensions like a bus. We present a combined approximation-based approach to solve the path planning problem in such situations. Our approach consists of a global planner which generates a preliminary path consisting of straight and turning-in-place primitives and a local planner which is used to make the preliminary path feasible to car-like vehicles. The approximation methodology is well known in the literature; however, both components proposed in this paper differ from existing similar planning methods. The approximation process with the proposed local planner is proven to be convergent for any preliminary global paths. The resulting path has continuous curvature which renders our method well suited for application on real vehicles. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method outperforms similar approaches in terms of path quality in complicated planning tasks.

AB The accurate location of a vehicle in the road is one of the most important challenges in the automotive field. The need for accurate positioning affects several in-vehicle systems like navigators, lane departure warning systems, collision warning and other related sectors such as digital cartography Suppliers. The aim of this paper is to evaluate high precision positioning systems that are able to supply an on-the-centimetre accuracy Source to develop on-the-lane positioning systems and to be used in future applications as an information Source for autonomous vehicles that circulate at high speeds on public roads. In this paper we have performed some on-road experiments, testing several GPS-based systems: Autonomous GPS; RTK Differential GPS with a proprietary GPS base station; RTK Differential GPS connected to the public GPS base station network of the National Geographic Institute of Spain via vehicle-to-infrastructure GPRS communications; and GPS combination with inertial measurement systems (INS) for position accuracy maintenance in degraded satellite signal reception areas. In these tests we show the validity and the comparison of these positioning systems, allowing us to navigate, in some cases, on public roads at speeds near 120 km/h and up to 100 km from the start position without any significant accuracy reduction.

AB Inductive power transfer is a practical approach to recharging the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The performance of the magnetic coupler determines the system transfer capacity. The annular magnetic coupler is widely utilized in the underwater wireless charging system. However, this magnetic coupler has limitations on magnetic field distribution. The flux linkage occupies the center of the AUV, and hence, the electronics inside the AUV are susceptible to electromagnetic interference. Additionally, the weight of the annular magnetic coupler greatly increases the burden on AUV power supply. In this paper, the magnetic coupler structure evolution is analyzed and a dipole-coil-based magnetic coupler with a novel circumferential coupling manner is presented. The magnetic flux is perfectly confined by the coupling manner, and the magnetic coupler weight is reduced by dimension optimization. To implement the magnetic coupler, the Fe-based nanocrystalline soft magnetic material is taken into consideration. To validate the proposal, a wireless charging system is built. Experimental results show that the system transfers 630W under water with a DC-DC efficiency of 89.7 & x0025;.

AB This paper focuses on planning the obstacle-avoiding paths of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in complex ocean environment, with the time coordination of simultaneous arrival. By imitating the nature phenomenon that river water avoids rocks and reaches the destination, the interfered fluid dynamical system (IFDS) is first presented to obtain the single-AUV path for obstacle avoidance, where the modulation matrix is calculated to quantify the influence of obstacles especially. Then the two-layer comprehensive adjustment to path length and voyage speed is utilized, aiming to achieve the simultaneous arrival at destination between multi-AUVs. By adjusting reactive parameters of IFDS, the former is to roughly ensure the intersection of AUVs' potential arrival time range to be non-null. On this basis, the latter adjusts each AUV's voyage speed finely using the consensus method with state predictor, which has faster convergence speed. If the multi-AUVs communication network is connected, the whole system will quickly converge to the consensus state, i.e., the estimated time of arrival (ETA) of each AUV tends to be equal. Finally, the simulation results verify the advantages of our proposed method.

The robot model we use is an extension of a 2D non-holonomic robot. The measurements and sensors we considered in the presented method are simple and valid in practical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) engineering. The proposed safe exploration algorithm belongs to a class of probabilistic area search, and with a mathematical proof, the performance of the algorithm is analysed. Based on the algorithm, we also propose a sliding control law to apply the algorithm to a real quadcopter in experiments. In the presented experiment, we use a DJI Guidance sensing system and an Intel depth camera to complete the localization, obstacle detection and 3D environment information capture. Furthermore, the simulations show that the algorithm can be implemented in sloping tunnels and with multiple UAVs.

ID OF-THE-ART; PATH TRACKING
AB This paper proposes a clothoid-curve-based trajectory tracking control method for autonomous vehicles to solve the problem of tracking errors caused by the discontinuous curvature of the control curve calculated by the pure pursuit tracking algorithm. Firstly, based on the Ackerman steering model, the motion model is constructed for vehicle trajectory tracking, Then, the position of the vehicle after the communication delay of the control system is predicted as the starting point of the clothoid control curve, and the optimization interval of the curve end point is determined. The clothoid control curves are calculated, and their parameters are verified by the vehicle motion and safety constraints, so as to obtain the optimal clothoid control curve satisfying the constraints. Finally, considering the servo system response delay time of the steering system, the steering angle target control value is obtained by previewing the curvature of the clothoid control curve. The field experiment is conducted on the test road, which consists of straight, right-angle turns and lane-change elements under three sets of speed limitations, and the test results show that the proposed clothoid-curve-based trajectory tracking control method greatly improved the tracking accuracy compared with the pure pursuit method; in particular, the yaw deviation is improved by more than 50%.

AB Autonomous driving applications use two types of sensor systems to detect vehicles - depth sensing LiDAR and radiance sensing cameras. We compare the performance (average precision) of a ResNet for vehicle detection in complex, daytime, driving scenes when the input is a depth map [D = d(x,y)], a radiance image [L = r(x,y)], or both [D,L]. (1) When the spatial sampling resolution of the depth map and radiance image are both equal to typical camera resolutions, a ResNet detects vehicles at higher average precision from depth than radiance. (2) When the spatial sampling of the depth map matches the range of current LiDAR devices, the average precision is higher for radiance than depth. (3) A hybrid system that combines depth and radiance has higher average precision than systems using depth or radiance alone. We confirm these observations in both simulation and real-world data. We explain the advantage of combining depth and radiance by noting that the two types of information have complementary weaknesses. The radiance data are limited by dynamic range, motion blur and illumination variation; the LiDAR data have low spatial resolution. The ResNet effectively combines the two data sources to improve vehicle detection.

Parking AVs in designated zones would allow for the installation of fire-suppression systems other than those that are water-based, permit alternative ventilation requirements and allow for the reconfiguration of the building structure. Connected AVs could communicate with other vehicles, the parking building and the emergency services, resulting in a more effective response to a developing fire incident. However, AVs may increase fire safety hazards when considering alternative parking arrangements that promote more extensive fire spread, increase the median fire load energy density by at least 13% and inhibit firefighting. This may impact on the operational capability of the emergency services and the expectations of the structural fire safety design of the building. In this paper, options are presented that would influence the design and use of parking buildings where AVs and EVs are present. Presently, it is unclear whether the introduction of AVs will increase or decrease the fire safety risk to life and property, and further research is suggested to better understand such matters.

AB In transportation at open-pit mines, rocks dropped as a mining truck is driven will wear out the tires of the vehicle, thus increasing the mining cost. In the case of autonomous vehicles, the vehicle must automatically detect rocks on the transportation roads during the driving process. This will be a new challenge: rough road, rocks of small size and irregular shape, long detection distance, etc. This paper presents a detection method based on light detection and ranging (lidar). It includes two stages: (1) using the modified cloth simulation method to filter out the ground points; (2) using the regional growth method based on grid division to cluster non-ground points. Experimental results show that the method can detect rocks with a size of 20-30 cm at a distance of 40 m in front of the vehicle, and it takes only 0.3 s on an ordinary personal computer (PC). This method is easy to understand, and it has fewer parameters to be adjusted. Therefore, it is a better method for detecting small, irregular obstacles on a low-speed, unstructured and rough road.

AB Fifth Generation (5G) mobile technology is the latest generation of mobile networks that is being deployed to facilitate emerging applications and services. 5G offers enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine type communication, and ultra reliable low latency communication. Hence, the capabilities of 5G can be harnessed to satisfy the requirements of autonomous vehicles (AV). AVs are developed to offer comfort, safety and efficient driving. However, the capabilities of 5G are yet to be harness by AVs and related technologies. In response, this survey provides a comprehensive review on AVs in the 5G and beyond era. The paper provides a discussion on the current advancements in AVs, automation levels, enabling technologies and the requirement of 5G networks. Furthermore, the paper focuses on emerging technologies enabling the integration of 5G with AVs, the impact of 5G and B5G for AVs and the envisaged security concerns in AVs. The paper also provides a comprehensive understanding of recent developments in terms of standardisation activities and projects on 5G AV technologies. The article also provides lessons learnt, existing challenges, and future research directions to facilitate the development of AV technologies in the 5G and beyond era. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB Time-delay owing to the communication delay in acoustic modem greatly influences the path following performances when a group of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are deployed in formation. When the AUVs are employed in oceanic environment, the distance between the AUVs keeps on changing due to wave disturbances. Hence, time-delay which depends on the distance between AUVs also varies. In this brief, a time-delay estimator based on gradient-descent method has been designed to estimate the communication delays. Taking the estimated delay into account, the delayed error vectors are computed to design a suitable control input. As the reduction of Lyapunov function incorporating communication delay occurs on-line at each sampling interval, the path following control performance of follower AUV improves significantly. The simulation and experimental results show that the delay estimator accurately estimates the delay. Moreover, during experiment, the actual delay is significantly reduced as the time-stamping of packets of leader AUV states is avoided during formulation of the estimator. The follower AUV even under the effects of variable communication delay, maintains a desired distance from the leader AUV. The results also show that by imposing constraints on the control input, actuator saturation is avoided.

AB The focus of this paper is the development of tools to facilitate the effective use of AUVs to survey small-scale oceanographic processes. A fundamental difficulty in making oceanographic surveys with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is the coupling of space and time through the AUV survey trajectory. Combined with the finite velocity and battery life of an AUV, this imposes serious constraints on the extent of the survey domain and on the spatial and temporal survey resolutions. In this paper, we develop a quantitative survey error metric which accounts for errors due to both spatial undersampling and temporal evolution of the sample field. The accuracy of the survey error metric is established through surveys of a simulated oceanographic process. Using the physical constraints of the platform, we also develop the "survey envelope" which delineates a region of survey parameter space within which an AUV can sucessfully complete a mission. By combining the survey error metric wit the survey envelope, we create a graphical survey analysis tool which can be used to gain insight into the AUV survey design problem. We demonstrate the application of the survey analysis tool with an examination of the impact of certain survey design and parameters on surveys of a simple oceanographic process.

AB Eighteen percent of the world's population do not have access to electricity, impeding economic, social, and human development. The electricity access challenge can be attributed to the significant investment gap needed to finance new power projects, requiring new and innovative financing options. Independent Power Projects, funded, built, owned, and operated by the private sector and constituted via a special purpose vehicle-a legal entity whose sole purpose is implementing a power project-have become one of the fastest-growing sources of investment in the electricity sector. The limitations of traditional finance sources, including high credit, liquidity, margining, third-party, legal, and process risks, means that funds for these projects are expensive and raised only after a long and arduous process. The present article addresses these challenges by describing a novel decentralized autonomous organization, a blockchain-agnostic special purpose vehicle underpinned by a trio of autonomous mechanisms-mobilization, collateralization, and settlement. These mechanisms enable seamless finance mobilization for the special purpose vehicle from a location-independent crowd, revenue collection from the electricity buyer in a risk-mitigated manner, and disbursal of eventual project revenues to investors.

AB In this paper, we propose an embedded vision system based on laser profilometry able to get the pose of a vehicle and its relative displacements with reference to the constitutive media of a structured environment. Fundamental equations for laser triangulation are developed and encoded for their actual implementation on an embedded system. It is made of a laser source that projects a line-shaped beam onto the environment and an on-chip camera able to frame the laser light. Images are then sent to the inexpensive Raspberry Pi onboard computer, which is responsible for processing tasks. For the first time, laser profilometry is coupled with the correlation of laser signatures on a low-cost and low-resource processing board for vehicle localization purposes. Several validation tests of the proposed sensor have proven the effectiveness of the system with respect to commercially available sensors such as inductive sensors and standard odometers, which fail when the vehicle crosses path interceptions or its wheels undergo unavoidable slippages. Moreover, further comparisons with other vision-based techniques have also proven the good performances of this embedded system for real-time localization of vehicles.

AB This article focuses on the trends, opportunities, and challenges of novel arithmetic for deep neural network (DNN) signal processing, with particular reference to assisted- and autonomous driving applications. Due to strict constraints in terms of the latency, dependability, and security of autonomous driving, machine perception (i.e., detection and decision tasks) based on DNNs cannot be implemented by relying on remote cloud access. These tasks must be performed in real time in embedded systems on board the vehicle, particularly for the inference phase (considering the use of DNNs pretrained during an offline step). When developing a DNN computing platform, the choice of the computing arithmetic matters. Moreover, functional safe applications, such as autonomous driving, impose severe constraints on the effect that signal processing accuracy has on the final rate of wrong detection/decisions. Hence, after reviewing the different choices and tradeoffs concerning arithmetic, both in academia and industry, we highlight the issues in implementing DNN accelerators to achieve accurate and lowcomplexity processing of automotive sensor signals (the latter coming from diverse sources, such as cameras, radar, lidar, and ultrasonics). The focus is on both general-purpose operations massively used in DNNs, such as multiplying, accumulating, and comparing, and on specific functions, including, for example, sigmoid or hyperbolic tangents used for neuron activation.

It is based on the use of a robust equilibrium assignment model allowing us to obtain multiclass traffic flows, including automated vehicles (AVs) and conventional ones (CVs) on large real-sized road networks. This modelling framework has been successfully applied to the road network of the metropolitan area of Rome, allowing us to assess the effects of AVs in future traffic at increasing penetration rates and the effects of possible transport policies involving AVs.

AB Automated vehicles can facilitate vehicle sharing within and between households, thus decreasing ownership rates, albeit increasing miles travelled. While electrification can achieve deep reductions in transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions, shared automated electric vehicles will have different charging needs considering their higher mileage. In this study, travel survey data collected in Toronto is used to optimize the charging needs of shared automated electric vehicles, with the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation by choosing charging times that are associated with lower marginal emission factors. Optimized charging schedules reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% relative to vehicles charging once they return home. Life cycle assessment of multiple sharing scenarios indicates that higher levels of sharing increase emissions. Indeed, empty mileage associated with vehicle relocation and higher deterioration lead to a higher fleet turnover. With vehicle sharing, there is a risk of increasing mileage and vehicle production emissions.

AB Vision, Radar, and LiDAR sensors are widely used for autonomous vehicle perception technology. Especially object detection and classification are primarily dependent on vision sensors. However, under poor lighting conditions, dazzling sunlight, or bad weather an object might be difficult to be identified with general vision sensors. In this paper, we propose a sensor fusion system that combines a thermal infrared camera and a LiDAR sensor that can reliably detect and identify objects even in environments with poor visibility, such as day or night. The proposed method obtains the external parameters of the two sensors by designing and manufacturing a 3D calibration target to externally calibrate the thermal infrared camera and the LiDAR sensor. To verify the performance, experiments were conducted in day and night environments. The proposed sensor system and fusion algorithm show that it can reliably detect and identify objects even in environments with poor visibility, such as day or night. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB IntroductionThis research investigated the effects of three psychological needs (competence, autonomy, and relatedness) of self-determination theory (SDT) and automation trust on the intention of users to employ new interaction technology brought by autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially interaction mode and virtual image. MethodThis study focuses on the discussion from the perspective of psychological motivation theory applied to AV interaction technology. With the use of a structured questionnaire, participants completed self-report measures related to these two interaction technologies; a total of 155 drivers' responses were analyzed. ResultThe results indicated that users' intentions were directly predicted by their perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness of SDT and automation trust, which jointly explained at least 66% of the variance in behavioral intention. In addition to these results, the contribution of predictive components to behavioral intention is influenced by the type of interaction technology. Relatedness and competence significantly impacted the behavioral intention to use the interaction mode but not the virtual image. DiscussionThese findings are essential in that they support the necessity of distinguishing between types of AV interaction technology when predicting users' intentions to use.

   simulation; PX4-autopilot; robot operating system (ROS)
AB Aircraft designed for transporting one or two persons, much like a small personal car but flying in the air based on Bernoulli Principle and Newton's laws, are called Personal Aerial Vehicles (PAVs). Due to high PAV traffic densities and the high velocities at which PAVs fly, manual piloting of PAVs is seldom recommended. Hence, PAVs are equipped with an inbuilt Autonomous Navigation and Control System (ANCS), which frees the rider from piloting skills. Machine learning (ML)-based approaches that require datasets used during training phases can be used for implementing the software of such ANCS. The development of simulation-driven systems for ANCS offers many advantages, particularly reducing the systems' developmental costs and infrastructure needs. In this article, we report on the development of a synthetic visual dataset that enables ML-based implementation of ANCS. The state-of-the-art simulator AirSim is used to generate this dataset. Additionally, to make the synthetic data more realistic, several augmenting technologies such as Unreal Engine (3D graphics gaming), Blender animator, PX4-Autopilot SITL (Software in the loop) software, QGroundControl Autopilot App, and ROS (robot operating system) middleware suite are utilized. We also discuss the applicability of this dataset in realizing the ANCS module for PAVs.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must share space with pedestrians, both in carriageway cases such as cars at pedestrian crossings and off-carriageway cases such as delivery vehicles navigating through crowds on pedestrianized high-streets. Unlike static obstacles, pedestrians are active agents with complex, interactive motions. Planning AV actions in the presence of pedestrians thus requires modelling of their probable future behavior as well as detecting and tracking them. This narrative review article is Part I of a pair, together surveying the current technology stack involved in this process, organising recent research into a hierarchical taxonomy ranging from low-level image detection to high-level psychology models, from the perspective of an AV designer. This self-contained Part I covers the lower levels of this stack, from sensing, through detection and recognition, up to tracking of pedestrians. Technologies at these levels are found to be mature and available as foundations for use in high-level systems, such as behavior modelling, prediction and interaction control.

ID LEVEL CONTROL; RETRIEVAL; SYSTEM
AB To achieve persistent systems in the future, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will need to autonomously dock onto a charging station. Here, reinforcement learning strategies were applied for the first time to control the docking of an AUV onto a fixed platform in a simulation environment. Two reinforcement learning schemes were investigated: one with continuous state and action spaces, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and one with continuous state but discrete action spaces, deep Q network (DQN). For DQN, the discrete actions were selected as step changes in the control input signals. The performance of the reinforcement learning strategies was compared with classical and optimal control techniques. The control actions selected by DDPG suffer from chattering effects due to a hyperbolic tangent layer in the actor. Conversely, DQN presents the best compromise between short docking time and low control effort, whilst meeting the docking requirements. Whereas the reinforcement learning algorithms present a very high computational cost at training time, they are five orders of magnitude faster than optimal control at deployment time, thus enabling an on-line implementation. Therefore, reinforcement learning achieves a performance similar to optimal control at a much lower computational cost at deployment, whilst also presenting a more general framework.

AB A great number of pipelines in China are in unsatisfactory condition and faced with problems of corrosion and cracking, but there are very few approaches for underwater pipeline detection. Pipeline detection autonomous underwater vehicle (PDAUV) is hereby designed to solve these problems when working with advanced optical, acoustical and electrical sensors for underwater pipeline detection. PDAUV is a test bed that not only examines the logical rationality of the program, effectiveness of the hardware architecture, accuracy of the software interface protocol as well as the reliability and stability of the control system but also verifies the effectiveness of the control system in tank experiments and sea trials. The motion control system of PDAUV, including both the hardware and software architectures, is introduced in this work. The software module and information flow of the motion control system of PDAUV and a novel neural network-based control (NNC) are also covered. Besides, a real-time identification method based on neural network is used to realize system identification. The tank experiments and sea trials are carried out to verify the feasibility and capability of PDAUV control system to complete underwater pipeline detection task.

ID RECOGNITION
AB An ultra-low-power object matching processor is proposed for the autonomous micro air vehicle (MAV) navigation systems. For the ultra-low power consumption, it adopts four low-power features: 1) a 4-point scale-invariant generalized Hough transform (4P-SIGHT) to reduce the computational cost by 51%, 2) a feature streaming pipeline (FSP) to lower the operating frequency by 40%, 3) a Huffman and delta decoder (HDD) to reduce the memory readouts by 35.3%, and 4) a small-area and wide-operating-range 10-transistor level shifter (10T-LS) for the near-threshold voltage (NTV) operation. The proposed 2.0 mm(2) object matching processor is fabricated using 65 nm CMOS technology and it consumes only 54 mu W at 5 MHz operating frequency and 0.5 V supply voltage while processing QVGA resolution video in 30 fps. It is successfully applied to the MAV and shows 93.5% recognition accuracy for the autonomous navigation. It provides 9.35 x better energy efficiency than previous state-of-the-art object matching processors.

AB The dynamic characteristic of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is affected when it is reconfigured with different payloads. It is desirable to have an updated model, such that the control and guidance law can be redesigned to obtain better performance. Hence, we develop a method to enable online identification of AUV dynamics via in-field experiments, where the AUV is commanded to execute a compact set of maneuvers under doublet excitation. The identification process has two stages. In the training stage, state variable filter and recursive least square (SVF-RLS) estimator is used to estimate the unknown parameters. In the validation stage, the prediction capability of the model is checked using a fresh data set. The parameters converged within 12 s in the experiments using five different thrusts. Validation results show that the identified models are able to explain 78% to 92% of the output variation. Next, we compare the SVF-RLS estimator with the conventional offline identification method. The comparison shows that the SVF-RLS estimator is better in terms of prediction accuracy, computational cost and training time. The usefulness of the identified models is highlighted in two applications. We use it to estimate the turning radius of the AUV at different speeds, and to design a gain-scheduled controller.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV traffic management (UTM) have drawn attention for applications such as parcel delivery, aerial mapping, agriculture, and surveillance based on line-of-sight (LoS) links. UTM is essential to operate multiple fully autonomous UAVs safely beyond the visual line of sight (BVLoS) in the future dense UAV traffic environment. Various research and development teams globally take UTM initiatives and work on platform testing with different industrial partners. In the future, urban airspace will be congested with various types of autonomous aerial vehicles, thereby resulting in complex air-traffic management caused by communication issues. The UTM requires an efficient communication backbone to handle all airborne communication services. Existing cellular networks are suitable only for terrestrial communication and have limitations in supporting aerial communications. These issues motivate the investigation of an appropriate communication technology for advanced UTM systems. Thus, in this study, we present a future perspective of 6G-enabled UTM ecosystems in a very dense and urban air-traffic scenario focusing on non-terrestrial features, including aerial and satellite communication. We also introduce several urban airspace segmentation and discuss a strategic management framework for dynamic airspace traffic management and conflict-free UAV operations. The UTM enhances the adaptive use of the airspace by shaping the airspace with the overall aim of maximizing the capability and efficiency of the network. We also discuss the 6G multi-layer parameters i.e., space, air, and terrestrial, for safe and efficient urban air transportation in three-dimensional space. Moreover, we discuss the issues and challenges faced by future UTM systems and provide tentative solutions. We subsequently extend the vision of the UTM system and design an advanced and fully autonomous 6G-based UTM system.

AB Autonomous driving has been among the most popular and challenging topics in the past few years. Among all modules in autonomous driving, High-definition (HD) map has drawn lots of attention in recent years due to its high precision and informative level in localization. Since localization is a significant module for automated vehicles to navigate an unknown environment, it has immediately become one of the most critical components of autonomous driving. Big organizations like HERE, NVIDIA, and TomTom have created HD maps for different scenes and purposes for autonomous driving. However, such HD maps are not open-source and are only available for internal research or automotive companies. Even though researchers have proposed various methods to create HD maps using different types of sensor data, there are few papers that review and summarize those methods. New researchers do not have a clear insight into the current state of HD map creation methods to work on their HD map research. Due to the reason above, reviewing, classifying, comparing, and summarizing the state-of-the-art techniques for HD map creation is necessary. This paper reviews recent HD map creation methods that leverage both 2D and 3D map generation. This review introduces the concept of HD maps and their usefulness in autonomous driving and gives a detailed overview of HD map creation methods. We will also discuss the limitations of the current HD map creation methods to motivate future research. Additionally, a chronological overview is created with the most recent HD map creation methods in this paper.

AB Congestion pricing is one effective demand management strategy to alleviate traffic congestion. This work investigates pricing schemes for mixed traffic flow systems where the human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) coexist. The emerging and integration of autonomous vehicles can help improve the overall transportation efficiency and safety. Given the coexistence of HVs and AVs in the near future, there is need to adjust the existing traffic management strategies to adapt to the mixed traffic conditions. In this study, congestion pricing is imposed on the HVs and the AVs differently, that is, a distance-based toll to the HVs while a delay-based toll to the AVs. We consider six user groups based on the value of time (VOT) and the vehicle types. Compared with the unified distance-based toll, the advantage of delay-based toll is demonstrated first. Then, a surrogate-based optimization framework, namely the regressing Kriging (RK) model, is formulated. Three pricing schemes are investigated and compared: equity-oriented (EQ), environment friendliness-oriented (EN), and revenue-oriented (RE) schemes. Results show that the RE scheme collects the highest revenues; however, its cost-efficiency is weakened. The EQ scheme reduces the variance in the average travel costs among user groups, thus solving the equity issue.

AB Some commercial vehicle models have been equipped with semiautonomous parking systems to a certain extent. However, gaps to fully automated solutions still exist, and cost considerations further constrain their acceptance among consumers. This paper proposes a low-cost vision-based approach to a fully self-reverse parking system. It consists of four key modules: a novel path-planning module ensures that a feasible path is available under any initial poses, which frees human intervention completely; a modified sliding mode controller on the steering wheel is designed for path following; image processing with Kalman state prediction provides consistent and real-time estimation on the vehicle pose; and a robust overall control scheme ensures that the vehicle can accurately park along the slot center line without intrusion into adjacent slots. Experimental results based on 216 on-field tests under different illumination conditions showed that the proposed system was able to accurately and consistently park the vehicle in all cases with a 4.71-cm RMS offset distance from the center line and a 1.24 degrees RMS orientation deviation. With its easy setup and excellent performance, this system can be practically and robustly implemented to existing vehicles with minimal additional cost.

AB Radar overcomes the shortcomings of laser, stereovision, and sonar because it can operate successfully in dusty, foggy, blizzard-blinding, and poorly lit scenarios. This paper presents a novel method for ground and obstacle segmentation based on radar sensing. The algorithm operates directly in the sensor frame, without the need for a separate synchronised navigation source, calibration parameters describing the location of the radar in the vehicle frame, or the geometric restrictions made in the previous main method in the field. Experimental results are presented in various urban scenarios to validate this approach, showing its potential applicability for advanced driving assistance systems and autonomous vehicle operations.

By effectively exploiting redundancy of communication among vehicles and infrastructures on the road, this article aims to provide reliable communications among vehicles with high performance. Furthermore, the proposed approach is built at the application layer, and hence, it is compatible with existing routing protocols. Also, it minimizes communication and computation overheads. To verify the proposed scheme, we evaluate performance of the proposed approach compared with existing routing protocols.

AB When the autonomous vehicle (AV) is under various road friction and speed, emergency collision avoidance is extremely difficult. In this situation, the AV may encounter severe understeering problem, so it is hard to achieve collision avoidance, even under the control of active safety system. To tackle this problem, an adaptive collision avoidance strategy (ACAS) is proposed for AV under various road friction and speed. The adaptive performance of the ACAS is realized via three aspects. (1) An adaptive reference path planning method is proposed to provide desired evasive speed and reference path for the AV according to various road friction and reduces the turning burden of AV. (2) A predictive-based fuzzy controller is designed to realize the speed control, and it improves the tracking accuracy of various desired evasive speed. (3) A novel turning enhanced method built with a direct yaw turning controller and a torque distribution method can enhance the turning capability of AV. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified on AV via simulation experiments. The code can be found online here: https://github.com/wangjinlei-hnu/ACAS.

AB This paper proposes a fixed-time adaptive path-following control scheme for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to address accuracy and safety considerations in actual navigation practice. The proposed scheme is designed to effectively follow a reference path while satisfying output performance and feasibility constraints during navigation. For the output constraint problem, a modified version of the universal barrier Lyapunov function is used for the analysis of path-dependent constraint requirements. Additionally, a new type of path-dependent constraint function is proposed that depends on the path parameters rather than directly on the time variables. A new adaptive backstepping method is also devised to address the problem of fixed-time convergence, as well as the 'complexity explosion' in the controller design process, and the unknown dynamics of the model. The study shows that, under this control scheme, the ASV's position and heading errors can converge to a set near the equilibrium point at a fixed time convergence rate, while always satisfying the path-dependent constraints. Simulation and experimental studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is a key research focus in the marine domain, requiring consideration of the underwater environment's complexity and the efficiency of the planning algorithms. Firstly, a variety of strategies such as the memory function are integrated into the artificial jellyfish search algorithm (JS) to improve its convergence accuracy, and the improved artificial jellyfish search algorithm (IJS) is obtained. Secondly, this paper establishes a good objective function including the ocean current disturbance model, which helps the IJS algorithm better plan the paths to avoid obstacles and strong side currents. Furthermore, the optimal smoothed paths are obtained by using a cubic spline midpoint interpolation method. Finally, multiple simulation experiments are performed on the multi-obstacle ocean current model with realistic terrain data. The comparison results show that the IJS algorithm with a short running time has the optimal time cost and ocean current penalty cost for the planned path. In addition, the IJS algorithm is also shown to be adaptable in the field of multi-AUV movements.

AB The autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) is supposed to be able to adapt unknown environments without human interference. This paper investigates the problem of trajectory tracking control for ASVs in the present of parameter uncertainties, disturbances, input quantization and actuator saturation. The neural network (NN) approximation and an adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) strategy are combined for the ASVs with a priori unknown upper bound of parameter uncertainties, external disturbances and saturation errors. The NN is adopted to approximate the unknown continuous uncertainties and disturbances in the system. The adaptive law for the SMC parameter can guarantee no overestimation of the robust control parameter with respect to unknown upper bounds of the NN approximation errors and the saturation error. By adding the NN approximation into the adaptive SMC laws, the robust control parameter and the chattering can be reduced. Uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) for sliding variables and tracking errors can be guaranteed by Lyapunov proof. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the improved performance with the proposed approach. The comparisons on the proposed control method with other algorithms are given by using the integrated absolute error (IAE) and integrated time absolute error (ITAE).

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Autonomous vehicles perceive objects through various sensors. Cameras, radar, and LiDAR are generally used as vehicle sensors, each of which has its own characteristics. As examples, cameras are used for a high-level understanding of a scene, radar is applied to weather-resistant distance perception, and LiDAR is used for accurate distance recognition. The ability of a camera to understand a scene has overwhelmingly increased with the recent development of deep learning. In addition, technologies that emulate other sensors using a single sensor are being developed. Therefore, in this study, a LiDAR data-based scene understanding method was developed through deep learning. The approaches to accessing LiDAR data through deep learning are mainly divided into point, projection, and voxel methods. The purpose of this study is to apply a projection method to secure a real-time performance. The convolutional neural network method used by a conventional camera can be easily applied to the projection method. In addition, an adaptive break point detector method used for conventional 2D LiDAR information is utilized to solve the misclassification caused by the conversion from 2D into 3D. The results of this study are evaluated through a comparison with other technologies.

ID DYNAMICS
AB This paper describes a vehicle stability control (VSC) system using a vehicle yaw-inertia- and mass-independent adaptive control law. As a primary vehicle active control system, VSC can significantly improve vehicle driving safety for passenger cars and enhance trajectory tracking accuracy for other applications such as autonomous, surveillance, and mobile robot vehicles. For the designs of vehicle dynamic control systems, vehicle yaw inertia and mass are two of the most important parameters. However, in practical applications, vehicle yaw inertia and mass often change with vehicle payload and load distribution. In this paper, an adaptive control law is proposed to treat the vehicle yaw inertia and mass as unknown parameters and automatically address their variations. For the proposed adaptive control law, asymptotic stability of the yaw rate tracking error was proved by a Lyapunov-like analysis for certain vehicle architectures under some reasonable assumptions. The performance of the yaw-inertia- and mass-independent adaptive VSC system was evaluated under several driving conditions (i.e. double lane changing on a slippery surface and braking on a split-p Surface tests) through simulation studies using a high-fidelity full-vehicle model provided by CarSim (R).

TI Monocular-SLAM-Based Navigation for Autonomous Micro Helicopters in
   GPS-Denied Environments
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) will soon play a major role in tasks such as search and rescue, environment monitoring, surveillance, and inspection. They allow us to easily access environments to which no humans or other vehicles can get access. This reduces the risk for both the people and the environment. For the above applications, it is, however, a requirement that the vehicle is able to navigate without using GPS, or without relying on a preexisting map, or without specific assumptions about the environment. This will allow operations in unstructured, unknown, and GPS-denied environments. We present a novel solution for the task of autonomous navigation of a micro helicopter through a completely unknown environment by using solely a single camera and inertial sensors onboard. Many existing solutions suffer from the problem of drift in the xy plane or from the dependency on a clean GPS signal. The novelty in the here-presented approach is to use a monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework to stabilize the vehicle in six degrees of freedom. This way, we overcome the problem of both the drift and the GPS dependency. The pose estimated by the visual SLAM algorithm is used in a linear optimal controller that allows us to perform all basic maneuvers such as hovering, set point and trajectory following, vertical takeoff, and landing. All calculations including SLAM and controller are running in real time and online while the helicopter is flying. No offline processing or preprocessing is done. We show real experiments that demonstrate that the vehicle can fly autonomously in an unknown and unstructured environment. To the best of our knowledge, the here-presented work describes the first aerial vehicle that uses onboard monocular vision as a main sensor to navigate through an unknown GPS- denied environment and independently of any external artificial aids.

AB Recently, the Internet of vehicles (IoV) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have become research hotspots. The accuracy and efficiency of artificial intelligence (AI) models are crucial for CAVs to make decisions automatically. Intelligence networking enables each CAV to train appropriate models locally with the help of other CAVs' intelligence and make up for the lack of experience and computing power of a single-vehicle. However, intelligence is distributed across diverse geo-locations in the intelligence networking paradigm, which calls for accurate, efficient, and lightweight intelligence discovery mechanisms. In this article, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT)-based distributed intelligence networking scheme (NDIN) for CAVs. We use NFT to tokenize intelligence and efficiently describe intelligence from multiple aspects through meta-data, facilitating applications to better understand and search for intelligence in complex and trust-lacking IoV. We present the architecture, modules, and core mechanism of NDIN. Then, we formulate the essential problem as a discrete Markov decision process (MDP) and adopt the quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithm to find the optimal policy. Also, the convergence rate and performance compared with existing schemes are evaluated. Finally, we discuss several related challenges and opportunities.

AB For the sake of safety, the vehicle path tracking control should not only ensure the stability of the path tracking error containing the lateral offset and the orientation error but also guarantee that both the transient and steady states of the lateral offset are within a specified safe boundary. However, the time-varying uncertainties of a vehicle system make the control design a tough task. This paper develops an adaptive robust control (ARC) which guarantees both the tracking stability and the bounded error property for autonomous vehicles. First, to handle the bounded error requirement, a barrier function based state transformation which converts the constrained lateral offset into an unconstrained state is proposed. Then, the path tracking control task is cast into an equality constraint of the system state. On this basis, a novel adaptive robust constraint-following controller is developed to make the transformed system follow the proposed equality constraint. Through Lyapunov minimax analysis, it is proved that the resulting control guarantees the approximate constraint-following performance and the bounded error property despite the presence of system uncertainties. Finally, the main theoretical results are verified through CarSim-Simulink co-simulation results.

AB In this paper, to reduce the congestion rate at the city center and increase the traveling quality of experience (QoE) of each user, the framework of long-range autonomous valet parking is presented. Here, an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is deployed to pick up, and drop off users at their required spots, and then drive to the car park around well-organized places of city autonomously. In this framework, we aim to minimize the overall distance of AV, while guarantee all users are served with great QoE, i.e., picking up, and dropping off users at their required spots through optimizing the path planning of the AV and number of serving time slots. To this end, we first present a learning-based algorithm, which is named as Double-Layer Ant Colony Optimization (DLACO) algorithm to solve the above problem in an iterative way. Then, to make the fast decision, while considers the dynamic environment (i.e., the AV may pick up and drop off users from different locations), we further present a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm, i.e., Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) to solve this problem. Experimental results show that the DL-ACO and DQN-based algorithms both achieve the considerable performance.

AB This paper presents an overview of the most recent vision-based multi-rotor micro unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) intended for autonomous navigation using a stereoscopic camera. Drone operation is difficult because pilots need the expertise to fly the drones. Pilots have a limited field of view, and unfortunate situations, such as loss of line of sight or collision with objects such as wires and branches, can happen. Autonomous navigation is an even more difficult challenge than remote control navigation because the drones must make decisions on their own in real time and simultaneously build maps of their surroundings if none is available. Moreover, MUAVs are limited in terms of useful payload capability and energy consumption. Therefore, a drone must be equipped with small sensors, and it must carry low weight. In addition, a drone requires a sufficiently powerful onboard computer so that it can understand its surroundings and navigate accordingly to achieve its goal safely. A stereoscopic camera is considered a suitable sensor because of its three-dimensional (3D) capabilities. Hence, a drone can perform vision-based navigation through object recognition and self-localise inside a map if one is available; otherwise, its autonomous navigation creates a simultaneous localisation and mapping problem.

AB In this paper, we study the impact of using a new intelligent vehicle technology on the performance and total cost of a European port, in comparison with existing vehicle systems like trucks. Intelligent autonomous vehicles (IAVs) are a new type of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) with better maneuverability and a special ability to pick up/drop off containers by themselves. To identify the most economical fleet size for each type of vehicle to satisfy the port's performance target, and also to compare their impact on the performance/cost of container terminals, we developed a discrete-event simulation model to simulate all port activities in micro-level (low-level) details. We also developed a cost model to investigate the present values of using two types of vehicle, given the identified fleet size. Results of using the different types of vehicles are then compared based on the given performance measures such as the quay crane net moves per hour and average total discharging/loading time at berth. Besides successfully identifying the optimal fleet size for each type of vehicle, simulation results reveal two findings: first, even when not utilising their ability to pick up/drop off containers, the IAVs still have similar efficacy to regular trucks thanks to their better maneuverability. Second, enabling IAVs' ability to pick up/drop off containers significantly improves the port performance. Given the best configuration and fleet size as identified by the simulation, we use the developed cost model to estimate the total cost needed for each type of vehicle to meet the performance target. Finally, we study the performance of the case study port with advanced real-time vehicle dispatching/scheduling and container placement strategies. This study reveals that the case study port can greatly benefit from upgrading its current vehicle dispatching/scheduling strategy to a more advanced one. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we designed a fuzzy inference system to guide an unmanned vehicle for maintaining traffic rules to reach its goal with avoiding obstacles. The fuzzy inference system which we designed, generates fuzzy if then rules and defines a nonlinear mapping of input data. The input data are initial position, velocity of vehicle and whether there is any obstacle. Input data are simulated and trained by hybrid algorithm. The result controls the navigation of UV and also minimizes error performance to reach the goal.

AB Obtaining detailed information about the ocean through seafloor optical imaging is crucial, yet poses significant challenges due to the high attenuation of light, which necessitates the camera to be positioned within several meters of the seafloor. This paper proposes a method for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to track the seafloor at a close range suitable for optical survey. Through the probabilistic processing of measurements from a mechanical scanning imaging sonar, the AUV can safely follow the seafloor, even in the presence of large obstacles or overhanging geometries. The method was implemented on the low-cost AUV, HATTORI, and its effectiveness was confirmed by sea experiments around Nishinoshima island, an uninhabited volcanic island located about 1000 km south of Tokyo, Japan. Detailed images of the rugged seafloor were successfully captured under the challenging condition of strong currents.

AB Traditional propulsion systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have several deficiencies, such as the invasion of the aquatic environment through the generation of noise and damage to the ecosystem, higher energy consumption, and a unidirectional thruster vector. The last characteristic constrains the maneuverability of the vehicle. This paper proposes a 3-DOF spherical 3 universal-cylindrical-universal and 1 spherical joint (3UCU-1S) parallel mechanism coupled to an artificial caudal fin to produce a vectored thruster for a biomimetic AUV (BAUV). First, the design and construction of the prototype are described. Then, the kinematics and dynamics analysis of the parallel mechanism is presented. Finally, a motion study shows the types of movements that can be achieved with the mechanism to perform flapping of the caudal fin in different directions.

AB The paper deals with the distributed acoustic localization of teams of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and proposes a novel algorithm, real-time ray-tracing (RT2), for evaluating the distance between any pair of AUVs in the team. The technique, based on a modified formulation of the non-linear sound-ray propagation laws, allows efficient handling of the distorted and reflected acoustic ray paths. The proposed algorithm can be easily implemented on-board of low-cost AUVs, requiring the presence, on each vehicle, of an acoustic modem and a pair of look-up tables, a-priori built on the basis of the assumed knowledge of the depth-dependent sound velocity profile. On such a basis, every AUV can compute its distance w.r.t. to any other neighbor team member, through time-of-flight measurements and the exchanges of depth information only.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to focus on cybernetic transportation systems (CTS) due to their effectiveness for solving mobility problems in cities. A new mobility concept is proposed which allows to attain the same flexibility of the private passenger car but with much less nuisances. It is based on small semi-autonomous electric vehicles, which may be used to complement mass public transportation, by providing passenger service for any location at any time. Design/methodology/approach - A set of automatic guided vehicles for public transportation are described. Two different control paradigms of the fleet are compared: centralized vs distributed control. Findings - The pros and cons of both control approaches are highlighted so as to support decisions about the configuration of a CTS for people transportation on public places. Originality/value - The paper provides a new offer of transportation for people in short path cities downtown or public gardens, in order to move people based on sustainable and efficient public transportation systems.

AB This article presents a path-tracking algorithm based on an improved fuzzy logic control method (IFM) that generates optimal steering angles for an autonomous wheeled vehicle to track a sequence of waypoints. The path-tracking algorithm was designed to focus on the vehicle performance, including tracking accuracy, stability, and convergence speed. A prototype vehicle with two-wheel steering and two-wheel drive (2WS-2WD) was developed as a test platform and equipped with a series of sensors for evaluating the IFM. In this study, we considered two variables, i.e., lateral deviation (d) and heading deviation (theta), as inputs for the control system. The output (delta) was the steering angle of the front wheels as controlled by an electric linear actuator. A maximum steering angle strategy was adopted for rapid convergence when the vehicle was far from the desired path or when the heading deviation was large. An update-line distance algorithm was used for finding the best turning time as the vehicle moved closer to the next waypoint. To validate the proposed algorithm, testing was performed to compare traditional pure pursuit (TPP), traditional fuzzy logic control method (TFM), and the IFM in tracking two types of paths (straight and rectangular). Traveling at 0.5 m s(-1) and with a signal sampling period of 0.5 s, the prototype converged to the desired straight path from different initial states. When the vehicle reached a stable state, the steady-state error was between 5.0 and 6.5 cm with a mean of <= 6.0 cm. The settling distance in the straight path test was between 125.0 and 422.3 cm, and the convergence time was in the range of 11.5 to 16.0 s; the greater the initial deviation of the vehicle was, the greater the settling distance and settling time were. In the 15 m x 14 m rectangular path test, the overall mean error of the IFM was 14.4 cm when the initial lateral and heading deviations were 0, and the maximum deviation was 67.4 cm, which occurred at the corners. The test results show that the proposed IFM had better accuracy, stability, and convergence speed for path tracking when compared to the TPP and TFM algorithms.

AB The field of self-driving cars is one that is rapidly growing in popularity. The goal of autonomous vehicles has always been to avoid accidents. It has long been argued that human errors while driving are the primary cause of traffic accidents, and autonomous cars have the potential to remove this. An intelligent transportation system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) is required at some point for the vehicle to make an instant choice to evade accidents, regardless of the competence of a decent driver Mishaps on the road and in the weather are those that occur due to unfavourable weather circumstances such as fog, gusts, snow, rain, slick pavement, sleet, etc. There are many factors that might cause a vehicle to lose control, including speed, weight, momentum, poor fleet maintenance. It has the potential to lessen the number of collisions caused by poor weather and deteriorating road circumstances. An IoT-based intelligent accident escaping system for poor weather and traffic circumstances is presented here. A variety of sensors are used to check the health of the vehicle. Data from sensors is processed by a microcontroller and displayed on the dashboard of a car after it has been received. The proposed model combines both an IoT system that monitors weather and road conditions and an intelligent system based on deep learning that learns the adverse variables that impact an accident in order to anticipate and prescribe a harmless speed to the driver. The experimental results show that the proposed deep learning technique achieved 94% of accuracy, where the existing LeNet model achieved 80% of accuracy for the prediction process. The proposed ResNet is more effective than LeNet, because identity mapping is used to solve the vanishing gradient problems.

TI Evaluating the Safety Impact of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles with

AB One goal for large-scale deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles is to achieve the traffic safety benefit since connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) could reduce the collision risk by enhancing the driver's situation perception ability. Previous studies have analyzed the safety impact of CAVs involved in traffic, but only few studies examined the safety benefits brought by CAVs when approaching high-collision-risk road segments such as the freeway crash hotspots. This study chooses one freeway crash hotspot in Wuhan, China, as an instance and attempts to estimate the safety benefits for differential penetration rates (PRs) of CAVs using the surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM). First, the freeway crash hotspot is identified with kernel density estimation and simulated by VISSIM. Then, the intelligent driver model (IDM) and Wiedemann 99 (a car-following model) are adopted and calibrated to control the driving behaviors of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HVs) in this study, respectively. The impact that rather CAVs are constrained with or without managed lanes on traffic safety is also discussed, and the PR of CAVs is set from 10% to 90%. The results of this study show that when the PR of CAVs is lower than 50%, there is no significant improvement on the safety measures such as conflicts, acceleration, and velocity difference, which are extracted from the vehicle trajectory data using SSAM. When the penetration rate is over 70%, the experiment results demonstrate that the traffic flow passing the freeway hotspot is with fewer conflicts, smaller acceleration, and smaller velocity difference in the scenario where CAVs are constrained with managed lane compared with the scenario without managed lane control. The safety benefit that CAVs bring needs to be discussed. The lane management of CAVs will also lead to distinct safety impact.

AB Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are becoming data centers on wheels, amassing petabytes of data. They require a combination of software and hardware systems to operate reliably and simply in realtime. However, due to the transient nature of Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) networks and CAVs' dependency on a connected software system, we need a new paradigm for secure and immutable data exchange, which emulates smart contracts. For this reason, CAV manufacturers need to maintain the latest version of software to protect CAVs from system failure and cyber threats in real-time, which is difficult with traditional centralized management. The key challenges that we must overcome are the authentication and secure sharing of the Over-The-Air (OTA) software updates and the scalability of distribution at the level of CAVs.This paper proposes a secure and scalable software updates framework in a distributed manner for the CAVs, leveraging Blockchain (BC) with smart contract technology. The framework is able to overcome slow processing speed, which is one of the significant limitations of BC in terms of lower latency and less packet overhead with a high level of security against possible cyber-attacks. We use a salting based hashing scheme over the traditional Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Key. This process ensures multi-factor authenticated protection from malicious transactions while downloading and installing any new feature update in CAVs. Moreover, by using Hyperledger BC, our framework provides cost-free transactions while successfully upgrading and deploying OTA software patches in any system of CAVs. This paper extends our previous work [51] by analysing our proposed BC framework's immutability and load management capability. Our simulation results show that our proposed framework is robust, secure, and failsafe for CAV manufacturers and end-users.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the autonomous driving era, high-definition (HD) maps are an essential building block to enable fine-grained environmental perception, precise localization, and path planning. However, with rich multidimensional information, the size of HD map data is huge and cannot be stored onboard, where the dynamic map data need to be distributed in real time via vehicular networks and how to design the distribution mechanism (i.e., determining the data source for requests) becomes crucial. For the end-to-end communication protocols (i.e., TCP/IP), the main limitation is the vehicle mobility and high dynamic of the network topology, which can degrade the transmission performance dramatically. Therefore, in this article, we propose a reinforcement learning-based data source selection scheme, named RLSS, for efficient HD map distribution in vehicular named data networking (NDN) scenarios, which aims at seeking the best data source (roadside infrastructures or nearby vehicles) in accordance with the map data requests. Specifically, in RLSS, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning-based architecture to learn a neural network as an agent to make the decision of data source selection, which can work online after offline training based on historical selection action performance. In addition, to solve the "cold start" problem for a new vehicle, we propose a model aggregation algorithm and weight update approach to learn the model parameters from its nearby vehicles, which can guarantee the performance while saving the communication cost. Finally, we implement RLSS in NS-3 by adopting the tools of the ndnSIM, SUMO, and Gym. Extensive simulations demonstrate that RLSS can significantly improve the transmission performance in terms of delay, throughput, and packet loss when compared with state-of-the-art data source selection schemes.

AB IntroductionRes-FLNet presents a cutting-edge solution for addressing autonomous driving tasks in the context of multimodal sensing robots while ensuring privacy protection through Federated Learning (FL). The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicles and robotics has escalated the need for efficient and safe navigation algorithms that also support Human-Robot Interaction and Collaboration. However, the integration of data from diverse sensors like cameras, LiDARs, and radars raises concerns about privacy and data security.MethodsIn this paper, we introduce Res-FLNet, which harnesses the power of ResNet-50 and LSTM models to achieve robust and privacy-preserving autonomous driving. The ResNet-50 model effectively extracts features from visual input, while LSTM captures sequential dependencies in the multimodal data, enabling more sophisticated learning control algorithms. To tackle privacy issues, we employ Federated Learning, enabling model training to be conducted locally on individual robots without sharing raw data. By aggregating model updates from different robots, the central server learns from collective knowledge while preserving data privacy. Res-FLNet can also facilitate Human-Robot Interaction and Collaboration as it allows robots to share knowledge while preserving privacy.Results and discussionOur experiments demonstrate the efficacy and privacy preservation of Res-FLNet across four widely-used autonomous driving datasets: KITTI, Waymo Open Dataset, ApolloScape, and BDD100K. Res-FLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and privacy preservation. Moreover, it exhibits promising adaptability and generalization across various autonomous driving scenarios, showcasing its potential for multi-modal sensing robots in complex and dynamic environments.

AB In the autonomous piloting of vehicles, the characterization of nearby dynamic object motion by perception and tracking techniques aids in the optimization of avoidance strategies. Knowledge of the features of object motion in goal-driven navigation allows for accurate deviation strategies to be implemented with appropriate anticipation. This perceptual competence is a fundamental issue in the design of unmanned commercial outdoor vehicles with an often reduced capability for maneuvering. To this aim, a grid map representation of the local panorama is proposed such that laser rangefinder images are converted into grid cells that are segmented and assigned to objects, allowing classification and monitoring. The motion properties of objects are thus used to establish avoidance behavior to smartly control the vehicle steering, such that a safe and optimal detour maneuver is carried out while driving to a target, The developed perceptual ability is demonstrated here in several tests performed in a relatively clutter-free area to detect and track walking pedestrians. Some results are also shown to highlight the modulation of moving object properties on trajectories described by a robot when a fuzzy avoidance strategy is used to control the steering angle.

AB Connected and autonomous (CA) vehicles have been verified to significantly improve traffic efficiency. However, there is still a long lifespan for heterogeneous traffic flow consisting of both human-driven and CA vehicles. Thus a deep understanding of the heterogeneous platoon dynamics is critical to the traffic stability issues for the deployment of CA vehicles in the near future. This paper aims to develop a multiclass microscopic model for a heterogeneous platoon which can explicitly demonstrate the interaction between human-driven and CA vehicles. Specifically, the consensus-based control algorithm is adopted to model the dynamics of CA vehicles and a typical car-following model is used to describe the dynamics of human-driven vehicles. We then theoretically and numerically study the linear stability condition of the heterogeneous platoon which takes into account the probabilistic delay in the communication, the penetration of the CA vehicles, and the relative order of the vehicle types in the platoon.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK CONTROL; GUIDANCE LAW
AB This paper utilizes an adaptive event-triggered mechanism to investigate the path following control of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in shallow waters. Given the challenges posed by the shallow water environment to ASV maneuverability and heading stability, the controller design must enhance the robustness and reduce model complexity. Firstly, a time-varying drift angle-based course guidance law was proposed using a position error dynamics model and a reduced-order extended state observer. Secondly, to simplify the controller's design steps, the ASV's surge and sway motion models are decoupled and transformed. Then, an event-triggered mechanism controller was designed to activate the ASV's rudder angle and shaft speed. In addition, a new robust term was introduced to further estimate the residuals of the RBF neural network, the external disturbances and the event triggered residual term, thus eliminating the requirement for an upper bound on the unknown disturbances and residuals. The proposed control method based on the robust adaptive event-triggered mechanism can guarantee that all estimation and tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results demonstrate that the controller can ensure effective path following of vessels in shallow waters.

ID AUV
AB Due to the unknown motion model and the complexity of the environment, the problem of target tracking for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) became one of the major difficulties in model-based controllers. Therefore, the target tracking task of AUV is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) with unknown state transition probabilities. Based on actor-critic framework and experience replay technique, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to realize the dynamic target tracking of AUVs. In order to improve the performance of the algorithm, an adaptive experience replay scheme is further proposed. Specifically, the proposed algorithm utilizes the experience replay buffer to store and disrupt the samples, so that the time series samples can be used for training the neural network. Then, the sample priority is arranged according to the temporal difference error, while the adaptive parameters are introduced in the sample priority calculation, thus improving the experience replay rules. The results confirm the quick and stable learning of the proposed algorithm, when tracking the dynamic targets in various motion states. Additionally, the results also demonstrate good control performance regarding both stability and computational complexity, thus indicating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in target tracking tasks.

AB This paper studies a novel autonomous vehicle-based storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) design with movable lifts (AVS/RS/ML). In the proposed system, there are aisle-captive lifts that are able to travel along the warehouse aisle to position themselves at the target column location. Those lifts can lift up/down the autonomous vehicles to/from the target storage compartment when they are in standstill. This novel design is proposed as an alternative to existing AVS/RSs to balance the resource utilizations as well as to provide an inexpensive solution with highly utilized autonomous vehicles (i.e., AGVs). As an initial work, for this novel system, two alternative operating designs under different racking configurations are experimented. We compare those two designs by their throughput rate performance metrics under the arrival rate scenarios with highly utilized AGVs (i.e., 95%). Besides, we experiment with two warehouse capacity scenarios: 900 and 1800 storage compartments. The results show that designs with two separate I/O point locations provide a better throughput rate than designs with single I/O point location. Besides, a decreased number of columns in the system improves the system's performance.

AB Due to the development needs of the intelligent manufacturing industry, the use of drones is expanding indefinitely, and at the same time, extremely high requirements are imposed on the autonomous navigation of drones to reduce human intervention. This paper presents an UAV/ UGV scheduling problem in which the UAV needs to be recharged by the UGV in order to working in persistent tasks, and meanwhile, the UGV need to visits UGV working depots. Two different problem are presented: fixed charging sets problem (FCSP) and discrete charging sets problem (DCSP). In FCSP, charging sets are fixed, and a two-stage travelling salesman problem method is proposed to solve the problem. DCSP is a modification of FCSP while charging segments are discrete into serval segments, an graph transformation approach was proposed to transform DCSP into GTSP, so DCSP can be resolved by using GTSP solvers. Simulation results shows that both DCSP and FCSP can ensure UAV/UGV work in persistent tasks, and the graph transformation algorithm can efficiently transform DCSP into GTSP.

AB By 2020, the EU road transport sector is poised to deploy a host of advanced Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), including connected and autonomous vehicles (AVs), that are expected to significantly 'disrupt' the automotive sector. This vision of the future is fuelling a virtual 'arms race' among automakers (OEMs), who are forging unconventional alliances and investing heavily in R&D, in anticipation of a radically changed industry. Car travel seems set to undergo a paradigm shift, evolving from a privately-owned asset into mobility as a service; a metamorphosis that will have significant implications for policymakers and industry stakeholders alike. This paper therefore seeks to address existing gaps in knowledge, by using primary qualitative interview data from industry experts and policymakers to examine the early-stages of the AV transition within the EU automotive industry. This paper also assesses the major policy challenges that face industry regulators tasked with underwriting this radical and dynamic transition to autonomous driving. This paper's focus is on the sociotechnical transition to AVs, which contributes to better understandings about the future role and regulation of Intelligent Transport Systems in society.

AB To ensure more autonomy and intelligence with real-time processing capabilities for the obstacle avoidance behavior of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAV), the use of soft computing is necessary to bring this behavior near to that of humans in the recognition, learning, adaptation, generalization, reasoning and decision-making, and action. In this paper, pattern classifiers of spatial obstacle avoidance situations using Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) individually or in combination are suggested. These classifiers are based on supervised learning and adaptation paradigms as Gradient Back-Propagation (GBP), FL, GA and Simplified Fuzzy ArtMap (SFAM) resulting in NN/GBP and FL as Intelligent Systems (IS) and in NN/GA, NN/GA-GBP, NN-FL/GBP and NN-FL-ART/SFAM as Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS). Afterwards, a synthesis of the suggested pattern classifiers is presented where their results and performances are discussed as well as the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architectures, characterized by their high flexibility and compactness, for their implementation.

AB The quality of lane markings is pivotal for safe operations and efficient trajectory generations of connected and autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, most studies are devoted to enhancing in-vehicle detection systems and ignore the impact of faulty lane markings. An instrumented vehicle was employed to mimic the data input of an AV and real-world trials were conducted on (1) live motorways; and (2) a controlled motorway facility. From the live motorway data, causal factors affecting computer vision lane detection and classification algorithms were examined, and an enhanced lane classification algorithm was developed to overcome the limitations posed by poor lane markings. In the controlled motorway facility, experiments to modify the physical appearance of the lane markings were conducted to further test the performance of the developed algorithm. The detection rates of the developed lane classification algorithm were compared with the lane departure warning (LDW) system already implemented in the vehicle. Findings revealed that the LDW system is accurate over 95% and 54% of the time when lanes are faded by 50% and 75% respectively. Further testing on the quality of the lane markings was carried out virtually in such a way that the experiments were replicated in a simulation environment to (1) identify lane marking conditions that can be reliably adopted for safe operations of AVs, (2) estimate the effect of adverse weather and lighting conditions on road markings detection, and (3) address localization issues for AVs. Simulation results show that poor lane markings have a significant negative impact on AV safety, especially in inclement weather and poor light conditions inducing an increase in conflicts and delays. This can be compensated for if more sophisticated sensors are employed in AVs, and the operators of road networks develop lane-based digital road maps.

AB Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is utilized to provide route guidance information to land and autonomous vehicles. The GNSS-based positioning and navigation (POS/NAV) usually suffer from satellite signal blockage, interference, and multipath in urban areas. Autonomous land vehicles are equipped with cameras, radars, and laser ranging devices. The availability of these systems provides an attractive opportunity to increase the POS/NAV system accuracy. This research focuses on the development of an integrated multi-sensor POS/NAV system capable of offering seamless positioning for autonomous land vehicles. A new multi-sensor POS/NAV module integrating both adaptive cruise control frequency modulated continuous wave (ACC-FMCW) radar (RAD), and magnetometer measurements with the reduced inertial sensor system (RISS) was designed to update the navigation system during GNSS outages. Augmenting RAD/RISS system with the magnetometer measurements produces a robust solution. The designed system is further improved by utilizing fast orthogonal search (FOS) to provide nonlinear error modeling of the residual errors associated with the RAD/RISS positioning solution in order to reduce the error growth overextended and frequent GNSS outages.The proposed systems were evaluated on several real road test trajectories involving different types of land vehicles experiencing different motion dynamics. GNSS outages of up to 10 minutes were intentionally introduced to examine the performance. The results show that the proposed methods have resulted in a significant performance improvement in the positioning accuracy that can reach more than 80% if compared to the present techniques that rely only on integrating the inertial sensor technology with GNSS.

AB Identifying a vehicle's moment of inertia for vehicle control in any driving condition is very important, e.g., for a good continuous performance of autonomous driving. In this study, an identification method is proposed for the pitch and roll moments of inertia. The performance of the proposed estimation method was evaluated through experiments using a 4-post test rig and inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurement system under different road conditions. Several scenarios have been investigated to verify the accuracy and robustness of the estimator in real-time. The results show very promising results with acceptable convergence time for a variety of manoeuvres.

AB Unauthorized underwater vehicles (UUVs) pose a serious threat to maritime security. To preserve maritime security, it is essential to pursue these UUVs. The majority of traditional pursuit methods are based on known environmental dynamics. However, the underwater environment is too complicated and unpredictable to describe these dynamics accurately. This study developed a novel online decision-making technique called multi-agent distributional soft actor-critic (MADA) to handle the issue of underwater cooperative pursuit. The method constructs a control-oriented framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning that can map autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) observations to pursuit actions. Multiple AUVs can combine to make prompt pursuit decisions. Then, the proposed method combines distributional soft actor-critic and curriculum learning to improve the success rates of multiple AUVs in pursuing UUVs. Experimental results show that the MADA can obtain a better cooperative pursuit strategy.

AB This paper develops and experimentally demonstrates a robust automatic parallel parking algorithm for parking in tight spaces. Novel fuzzy logic controllers are designed for each step of the maneuvering process. The controllers are first demonstrated by simulation using the kinematic model of a skid steering autonomous ground vehicle (AGV). They are then demonstrated experimentally on a skid steering AGV and it is shown that the developed algorithm has the ability to parallel park AGVs in tight spaces under both vehicle localization errors and parking space detection errors. This paper also presents a genetic fuzzy system which uses a genetic algorithm's learning ability to determine effective parameters for the developed fuzzy logic controllers. The genetic fuzzy system is used to tune the fuzzy logic algorithm for both a skid steering AGV and a front-wheel steering AGV. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, the autonomous driving transportation systems are at the heart of both academic and industry research for the distinguished advantages including increased network capacity, enhanced punctuality, greater flexibility and improved overall safety level. With the responsibility of transporting passengers in a safe, comfortable and efficient way, the decision making method plays a critical position in the autonomous driving of high-speed trains. Focusing on solving the autonomous decision making problem, this paper proposes a novel learning based framework by combining the deep learning technology with the distributed tracking control approach. To cope with the data insufficiency problem in training the deep learning network, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based data argumentation scheme is proposed to generate data samples that have the same distribution with actual data samples, and a hybrid learning network is constructed to predict the speed trajectory from the multi-attribute data with both temporal sequences and static features. Then, based on the model predictive control (MPC) scheme, a distributed tracking control model is formulated to minimize the tracking deviations and balance the performance of punctuality, energy-efficiency and riding comfort. Further, the dual decomposition technique is adopted to deal with the coupling constraints for the safe distance headway such that the separation for the autonomous driving of high-speed trains is achieved. Finally, simulation experiments based on actual scenarios of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.

AB This paper studies the three-dimensional platoon control of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subjected to environmental disturbances and model uncertainties. The main control objective is to design a tracking controller to force a platoon of AUVs to construct a convoy-like formation along feasible trajectories while each consecutive pair preserves a desired line-of-sight distance with limited communication range and every possible collision is avoided between consecutive vehicles. To achieve this objective, the prescribed performance function (PPF) methodology is employed to constrain the relative distance and angles between successive pairs during their motion. A robust neural network (NN), hyperbolic tangent function, and dynamic surface control technique are simultaneously utilized to propose the prescribed performance-based controller which is robust against completely unknown parameters, nonlinear hydrodynamic damping, actuators saturation nonlinearity, NN approximation errors and time-varying environmental disturbances. Lyapunov?s direct method is used to prove that all signals of the closed-loop control system are bounded and the relative distance and angles converge to a neighbourhood of the origin. Finally, numerical computer simulations verify the proposed controller performance for offshore applications.

AB A novel fixed-time scheme is developed for the formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using only the position measurements. First, the unmeasurable velocity states and disturbances are estimated by designing a fixed-time observer (FTO). Then, a fixed-time observer-based sliding-mode control (FTOSMC) scheme is developed based on the estimations of FTO and an integral sliding-mode surface. The proposed FTOSMC exhibits threes advantages: (i) Unlike the conventional finite-time control schemes, convergence time of FTOSMC is not affected by the initial system condition; (ii) The proposed FTOSMC does not need the velocity measurements, thus the measurement system can be simplified; (iii) the control input of proposed FTOSMC is continuous, thus the undesirable chatter of conventional sliding-mode control (SMC) can be avoided. Finally, these advantages of proposed FTOSMC are illustrated by using the numerical simulation.

AB The use of autonomous vehicles in agriculture has increased in recent years. To fully automate agricultural missions, particularly the tillage process using the walk-behind hand tractor, the path planning problem for the robot must be solved so that all points in the intended region of interest may be traced. The current planning algorithm has been successful in determining the best tillage path. On the other hand, the algorithm ignores the path built using the dynamic starting point, finish point and path distance. We propose a path planning concept for back-and-forth path patterns. Our algorithm employs a novel approach based on Laravel and Google Maps, which considers the user's desired distance interval, start point, and finish point. We demonstrated auto-generating vertex-edge pathways in this research. Field trials using a walk-behind hand tractor in a plowing mission have been successfully conducted to validate the accuracy of the resulting waypoint coordinates.

AB This study extends the two-sided day-to-day learning framework to simulate the performance of a mobility service using modular autonomous vehicles (MAVs) capable of en-route passenger transfers. An insertion heuristic is used to assign trips to a fleet of vehicles and to determine whether engaging in an en-route transfer is advantageous. The operator acts as an endogenous decision maker, updating the relative weight of the operator cost and user cost within the routing algorithm after each simulation day to optimize profit. Real transit ridership data from the United Arab Emirates are used for an empirical study of three operating strategies: door-to-door service within an urban core, commuter first/last mile service and a hub-and-spoke service. Results are compared with and without en-route transfers to quantify the advantage of the en-route transfer capability for each strategy.

SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English

ID ORBIT
AB A novel methodology has been developed for the guidance and control of a maneuvering chase vehicle undergoing terminal rendezvous in the presence of path constraints and multiple obstructions. The method hinges on defining a suitable scalar function which represents an artificial potential field describing the locality of the target vehicle. Using a set of bounded impulses the chase vehicle is guided by the local topology of this potential function. Obstructions and path constraints are introduced by superimposing regions of high potential around these regions. Exact, analytical expressions are then obtained for the required control impulse magnitude, direction and switching times using the second method of Lyapunov. These control impulses ensure that the potential function monotonically decreases so that convergence of the chaser to the target is ensured analytically, without violating the path constraints. Since the components of the potential and control impulses may be represented analytically, the method appears suitable for autonomous, real-time control of complex maneuvers with a minimum of onboard computational power.

AB This work deals with the design of a control system enabling the autonomous driving of Grade of Automation 4 (GoA4) for high-speed trains over ETCS. GoA4 requires trains to autonomously adapt their behaviour to the different driving conditions occurring in real-world trips and involving a wide range of possible maneuvers, even in the presence of unexpected events forcing ETCS interventions. To ensure this high automation level, we propose a hierarchical, modular and scalable control architecture, named Autonomous Driving Function (ADF). It embeds the main ATO functionalities, i.e., optimization of the recommended speed profile and train speed tracking, both nontrivial tasks due to train nonlinear dynamics and complex external environment, while being still compliant with railway standards. Hence, ADF is devoted to the real-time trajectory planning, considering the actual data acquired and the current driving situation along with the related on-line constraints, and to the trajectory tracking which, realized via different classes of controllers, ensures a safe and efficient train motion, also compliant with the railway standard. ADF is designed according to the Model Based Control Design (MBCD) approach which fully covers the V-Cycle development process and supports automatic C code generation compliant to standard EN50128, early design validation, testing, simulation and run-time verification. Finally, thanks to the experimental validation, carried out on an inspection high speed prototype vehicle, ADF has the prospect of becoming an inherent architecture for guaranteeing the GoA4 autonomous diving for HST over ETCS.

AB The autonomous driving has shown its enormous potential to become the new generation of transportation in the last decade. Based on the automated technology, vehicles can drive in a new form, vehicle platoon, which can significantly increase the efficiency of the road system and save road resources. The space-vehicle traffic state estimation model has shown its benefits in modeling autonomous vehicle platoon in nonpipeline corridors with on- and off-ramps in ideal observation environment. However, in the current initial stage of automated connected vehicles' application, the observation environment is quite imperfect. Limited by financial and investment, traffic flow observation equipment is sparsely distributed on the road. How to adapt to the sparse observer layout is a critical issue in the current application of the space-time traffic state estimation, which is originally designed for the autonomous transportation. Therefore, this manuscript overviews the observation environment in practice and summarizes three key observation problems. This article designs 22 numerical experiments focusing on the three key issues and implements the space-time estimation model in different observation scenarios. Finally, the observation environment adaptability is analyzed in detail based on the experiment results. It is found that the accuracy of the estimation results can be improved with the highest efficiency under the premise of limited equipment input by reducing the observation interval to 1000 m and increasing the density of the observer to 1/km. For the road sections with relatively homogeneous traffic conditions, the layout of observation equipment can be relatively reduced to save the investment input. Also, the maintenance of observation equipment for the ramp with larger flow can be slowed down appropriately in limited equipment investment. This manuscript is of great practical significance to the popularization and application of connected automatic transportation.

AB Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is an effective approach for motion planning in autonomous vehicles that need to satisfy multiple driving demands. Within the realm of planner design, current strategies inadequately address the issues related to redundancy and conflicts among these diverse demands. This shortcoming leads to low efficiency and suboptimal performance, particularly when faced with a high volume of demands. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces the Hierarchical and Multi-Domain (HMD) strategy as a solution for designing a multi-objective NMPC planner. This strategy enables the dynamic adjustment of the integration method for demand indicators based on their priority. To evaluate the risk of breaching driving demands, several risk functions are established. The constraints and objective function of the planner are meticulously designed in accordance with the HMD strategy and evaluation functions. Simulation results attest to the advantages of the HMD-based planner, which, compared to planners based on traditional multi-objective (TMO) strategies, exhibits a 68.5% improvement in solution efficiency and the simultaneous enhancement of driving safety. Additionally, the HMD approach reduces the maximum jerk by 58.8%.

AB A test scenario generation method based on combinatorial testing (CT) and Bayesian Network for autonomous vehicles is proposed in this paper. Firstly, some parameters are selected to describe the test scenarios which are classified according to road types and driving tasks. Then, the constraint sets for the scenarios with forbidden tuples are established to avoid the generated cases do not conform to the reality, in which the construct constraint set (CCS) algorithm is utilized to compute implied constraints. Furthermore, the Bayesian networks is used as the probabilistic models of the scenarios, where the traffic participants are represented as object nodes and the relative relationships between the participants are converted into the network structures. Finally, an improved automatic efficient test case generator (AETG) is developed to generate test cases. By considering both probability and frequency, the select function is designed for determining the values of scenario parameters. And the generation mode can be changed by modifying the weight and target parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by generating six typical test scenarios. Compared with other algorithms, the numbers of test cases in the sets generated by this method are less and the probability deviations are smaller.

The goal of the AUV team is to capture the target based on the arrival time measurements. This article presents both the tracking controller for the AUV team and the algorithm to estimate the target location in real time. In this article, the AUVs chase the target while preserving a circle formation. The proposed approach is to control the center of the formation, such that the line-of-sight (LOS) between the target and the center is parallel at every sampling step. Moreover, we control the formation size adaptively to avoid the divergence of the target estimation. As far as we know, this article is unique in utilizing the multiple AUVs to track one target, considering the case in which every AUV measures the arrival time of sound wave emitted from the target. MATLAB simulations are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In urban environments, the location accuracy of autonomous vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using navigation systems may be degraded because the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning accuracy is degraded owing to satellite visibility or multipath signals. Therefore, to ensure the safety of autonomous navigation systems, we need technologies that can recognize or predict changes in the GNSS observation environment when vehicles enter areas with severe reception conditions. In this study, we developed an algorithm determining the GPS signal shadowing range that can be blocked by nearby obstacles at a specific grid point. To evaluate the algorithm, we collected GPS signals in the test area and analyzed the signal characteristics by overlapping the satellite trajectory and satellite signal shadowing area modeling results. As a result of the experiment, GPS signals were received in the satellite invisible area owing to the multipath effect, but the data continuity was reduced in the corresponding satellites, and L2 signals were disconnected or the amplitude of the vibration of MP1 was significantly larger than that of the visible satellites. Therefore, the SEM generation algorithm is expected to improve the positioning accuracy of autonomous navigation systems by removing multipath signals and simulating the observation environment of the GNSS receiver.

AB The paper considers the cooperative adaptive cruise control of vehicle platoons and proposes a systematic way to find the local vehicle controllers and the communication structure. It investigates under what conditions the controlled vehicles follow asymptotically the time-headway spacing policy. The result is a requirement on the vehicle delay, which is a quantity that is directly related to the dynamics of the controlled vehicles and describes how much time the vehicles need to follow a change of the velocity set-point. If the vehicle delay is too large, communication from vehicles ahead improve the performance of the vehicle within the platoon. It is proved that in order to guarantee collision avoidance in the platoon, the truncated platoons have to be externally positive. Hence, the vehicle controllers have to be designed with the two, partly contradictory objectives to make the vehicle delay as small as possible and to end up with externally positive vehicles. It is investigated how vehicles with velocity controller or combined distance and velocity controller can satisfy these objectives.

AB In this paper, we investigate the performance of communication-based controller design in connected vehicle networks. A testbed consisting of a group of ground robots that can mimic the dynamics of personal vehicles is built. We show that when incorporating time delays in the modeling equations, which arise due to digital implementation and intermittent vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, the experimental results have a very good correspondence with the theoretical ones. Moreover, we demonstrate that by designing a controller for each individual vehicle in the chain plant stability and string stability can be guaranteed despite the time delays in the control loop. Then, a series of experiments is conducted for a mixture of string stable and string unstable vehicles and the effects of penetration rate of string stable vehicles in maintaining smooth traffic are evaluated. The results lay a foundation for connected vehicle system design with flexible connectivity topologies.

AB Autonomous marine vehicles play an essential role in many ocean science and engineering applications. Planning time and energy optimal paths for these vehicles to navigate in stochastic dynamic ocean environments are essential to reduce operational costs. In some missions, they must also harvest solar, wind or wave energy (modeled as a stochastic scalar field) and move in optimal paths that minimize net energy consumption. Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a natural framework for sequential decision making for robotic agents in such environments. However, building a realistic model and solving the modeled MDP becomes computationally expensive in large-scale real-time applications, warranting the need of parallel algorithms and efficient implementation. In this article, we introduce an efficient end-to-end graphical processing unit (GPU)-accelerated algorithm that 1) builds the MDP model (computing transition probabilities and expected one-step rewards) and 2) solves the MDP to compute an optimal policy. We develop methodical and algorithmic solutions to overcome the limited global memory of GPUs by 1) using a dynamic reduced-order representation of the ocean flows; 2) leveraging the sparse nature of the state transition probability matrix; 3) introducing a neighboring subgrid concept; and 4) proving that it is sufficient to use only the stochastic scalar field's mean to compute the expected one-step rewards for missions involving energy harvesting from the environment, thereby saving memory and reducing the computational effort. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simulated stochastic dynamic environment and highlight that it builds the MDP model and computes the optimal policy 600-1000 times faster than conventional CPU implementations, making it suitable for real-time use.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; VEHICLE
AB This work considers the cooperative trajectory-planning problem along a double lane change scenario for autonomous driving. In this paper, we develop two frameworks to solve this problem based on distributed model predictive control (MPC). The first approach solves a single nonlinear MPC problem. The general idea is to introduce a collision cost function in the optimization problem at the planning task to achieve a smooth and bounded collision function, and thus to prevent the need to implement tight hard constraints. The second method uses a hierarchical scheme with two main units: a trajectory-planning layer based on mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) computes an on-line collision-free trajectory using simplified motion dynamics, and a tracking controller unit to follow the trajectory from the higher level using the nonlinear vehicle model. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) sharing their planned trajectories lay the foundation of the cooperative behavior. In the tests and evaluation of the proposed methodologies, matlab-carsim cosimulation is utilized. carsim provides the high-fidelity model for the multibody vehicle dynamics. matlab-carsim conjoint simulation experiments compare both approaches for a cooperative double lane change maneuver of two vehicles moving along a one-way three-lane road with obstacles.

AB Obstacle avoidance path planning in a dynamic circumstance is one of the fundamental problems of autonomous vehicles, counting optional maneuvers: emergency braking and active steering. This paper proposes emergency obstacle avoidance planning based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), considering safety and comfort. Firstly, the vehicle emergency braking and lane change processes are analyzed in detail. A graded hazard index is defined to indicate the degree of the potential risk of the current vehicle movement. The longitudinal distance and lateral waypoint models are established, including the comfort deceleration and stability coefficient considerations. Simultaneously, a fuzzy PID controller is installed to track to satisfy the stability and feasibility of the path. Then, this paper proposes a DRL process to determine the obstacle avoidance plan. Mainly, multi-reward functions are designed for different collisions, corresponding penalties for longitudinal rear-end collisions, and lane-changing side collisions based on the safety distance, comfort reward, and safety reward. Apply a special DRL method-DQN to release the planning program. The difference is that the long and short-term memory (LSTM) layer is utilized to solve incomplete observations and improve the efficiency and stability of the algorithm in a dynamic environment. Once the policy is practiced, the vehicle can automatically perform the best obstacle avoidance maneuver in an emergency, improving driving safety. Finally, this paper builds a simulated environment in CARLA and is trained to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The collision rate, safety distance difference, and total reward index indicate that the collision avoidance path is generated safely, and the lateral acceleration and longitudinal velocity satisfy the comfort requirements. Besides, the method proposed in this paper is compared with traditional DRL, which proves the beneficial performance in safety and efficiency.

AB Agriculture 4.0 comprises a set of technologies that combines sensors, information sys-tems, enhanced machinery, and informed management with the objective of optimising production by accounting for variabilities and uncertainties within agricultural systems. Autonomous ground and aerial vehicles can lead to favourable improvements in man-agement by performing in-field tasks in a time-effective way. In particular, greater benefits can be achieved by allowing cooperation and collaborative action among unmanned ve-hicles, both aerial and ground, to perform in-field operations in precise and time-effective ways. In this work, the preliminary and crucial step of analysing and understanding the technical and methodological challenges concerning the main problems involved is per-formed. An overview of the agricultural scenarios that can benefit from using collaborative machines and the corresponding cooperative schemes typically adopted in this framework are presented. A collection of kinematic and dynamic models for different categories of autonomous aerial and ground vehicles is provided, which represents a crucial step in understanding the vehicles behaviour when full autonomy is desired. Last, a collection of the state-of-the-art technologies for the autonomous guidance of drones is provided, summarising their peculiar characteristics, and highlighting their advantages and short-comings with a specific focus on the Agriculture 4.0 framework. A companion paper re-ports the application of some of these techniques in a complete case study in sloped vineyards, applying the proposed multi-phase collaborative scheme introduced here.(c) 2021 The Authors.

AB In this paper, we investigate the trajectory tracking control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with time-varying external disturbances of currents and waves in the sea. To solve the problem, a fixed-time extended state observer (FTESO)-based tracking controller is proposed. Firstly, by using the extended state observer, the FTESO is proposed for estimating the external disturbances and the velocities of the AUV within the fixed convergence time. Based on the FTESO, the fixed-time controller is proposed for reducing the tracking errors and improving robustness performance. Theoretical analysis is given, which shows that the unknown external disturbances can be compensated and tracking error can converge to zero within the fixed time. Simulation results show that the proposed FTESO controller not only guarantees the fixed-time convergence but also reduces the trajectory tracking errors of the AUV.

ID CALIBRATION
AB Camera systems in autonomous vehicles are subject to various sources of anticipated and unanticipated mechanical stress (vibration, rough handling, collisions) in real-world conditions. Even moderate changes in camera geometry due to mechanical stress decalibrate multi-camera systems and corrupt downstream applications like depth perception. We propose an on-the-fly stereo recalibration method applicable in real-world autonomous vehicles. The method is comprised of two parts. First, in optimization step, external camera parameters are optimized with the goal to maximise the amount of recovered depth pixels. In the second step, external sensor is used to adjust the scaling of the optimized camera model. The method is lightweight and fast enough to run in parallel with stereo estimation, thus allowing an on-the-fly recalibration. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our method achieves stereo reconstruction better or on par with manual calibration. If our method is used on a sequence of images, the quality of calibration can be improved even further.

AB Trusting autonomous vehicles is seen as crucial for their dissemination. However, research on autonomous driving so far is restricted by using closed training courses or simulators and by comparing behaviour and evaluation while driving oneself (a manual car) with being driven (by an autonomous car). In the current study, we investigated passengers' eye movements, categorized as safety-relevant or not safety-relevant, and trust ratings while being driven, once manually and once by an autonomous car, in real traffic as well as in a simulator. As some of the effects observed in the field experiment might have been caused by driving style, driving style was additionally varied in the simulator. Fixations in safety-relevant regions (e.g., on the road and steering wheel) were observed more frequently during safety critical driving situations than during regular driving. More safety-relevant fixations for the autonomous compared to the manual driving mode were observed particularly in the field. Trust ratings were affected by driving mode mainly in the simulator: Here, being driven autonomously led to a lower reported trust than believing to be driven by a human driver. Driving style showed to affect trust ratings, but not gaze behaviour in the simulator experiment. Correlations between gazing into safety relevant regions and trust ratings were of smaller descriptive size than in recent investigations on drivers, suggesting that gazing into safety-relevant regions as objective alternative to trust ratings may not be as exhaustive for passengers as for drivers.

AB An approach for formally verifying the safety of automated vehicles is proposed. Due to the uniqueness of each traffic situation, we verify safety online, i.e., during the operation of the vehicle. The verification is performed by predicting the set of all possible occupancies of the automated vehicle and other traffic participants on the road. In order to capture all possible future scenarios, we apply reachability analysis to consider all possible behaviors of mathematical models considering uncertain inputs (e.g., sensor noise, disturbances) and partially unknown initial states. Safety is guaranteed with respect to the modeled uncertainties and behaviors if the occupancy of the automated vehicle does not intersect that of other traffic participants for all times. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by test drives with an automated vehicle at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

AB The motion planning and control method of automated vehicles, as the key technology of automated vehicles, directly affects the safety, comfort, and other technical indicators of vehicles. The planning module is responsible for generating a vehicle driving path. The control module is responsible for driving the vehicle. In this study, we review the main methods and achievements in motion planning and motion control for automated vehicles. The advantages and disadvantages of various planning and control methods are comparatively analyzed. Finally, some predictions and summaries based on the existing research results and trends are proposed. Through this analysis, it is believed that various types of algorithms will be further integrated in the future to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. The next area of research will be to establish more accurate vehicle models to describe vehicle motion, improve the generalization-solving ability of algorithms, and enhance the planning and control of integrated 'human-vehicle-road' traffic systems.

AB Autonomous surface vehicles face the challenge of accurately detecting nearby ships in the complex and ever-changing maritime environment, which is vastly different from land areas. To address this issue, we propose an image-based multisensor fusion object detection method that combines Light Detection and Rangings and cameras. Since point clouds have poor semantics, our method primarily relies on images, with point clouds used to support image detection. Our image detection scheme employs a tracking-assisted detection method that leverages historical information to compensate for possible detection failures. Additionally, we designed a confidence-association-based fusion strategy to determine the final targets among the candidates. We conducted field experiments in an open-sea area to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method. The results of these experiments showed that our method is highly accurate and robust in challenging maritime scenarios. Our code and data set will be released on .

AB The proper control of the maximum convergence time toward a desired motion or trajectory is highly recommended for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) in the case of autonomous trajectory tracking navigation and obstacle avoidance scenarios. This manuscript proposes to control the convergence time of an adaptive sliding mode controller applied to an autonomous vessel prototype subject to bounded perturbations. In the proposed approach, the maximum settling time is defined as a user input conditioning the controller design and tuning. To guarantee such convergence time to a small neighborhood of the sliding surface, the adaptive law is obtained through a Lyapunov function. The proposed motion and trajectory controller is then implemented on a USV prototype subject to parametric uncertainties and external perturbations. The experiments demonstrate the ability of the controller to constrain the sliding variable to the desired closed-loop dynamics and converge within the desired settling time.

TI Parking Spaces in the Age of Shared Autonomous Vehicles How Much Parking

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

AB The world is on the cusp of a new era in mobility given that the enabling technologies for autonomous vehicles (AVs) are almost ready for deployment and testing. Although the technological frontiers for deploying AVs are being crossed, transportation planners and engineers know far less about the potential impact of such technologies on urban form and land use patterns. This paper attempts to address those issues by simulating the operation of shared AVs (SAVs) in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. by using the real transportation network with calibrated link-level travel speeds and a travel demand origin-destination matrix. The model results suggest that the SAV system can reduce parking land by 4.5% in Atlanta at a 5% market penetration level. In charged-parking scenarios. parking demand will move from downtown to adjacent low-income neighborhoods. The results also reveal that policy makers may consider combining charged-parking policies with additional regulations to curb excessive vehicle miles traveled and alleviate potential social equity problems.

AB This paper studies traffic flow of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) vehicles at lane drop on two-lane highways. A constant time gap algorithm has been used for the upper level longitudinal control of the CACC vehicles. In the control zone upstream of the lane drop, a heuristic control scheme of the CACC vehicles has been used, in which virtual leading vehicle has been introduced by mapping a vehicle on the neighboring lane to the present lane. To improve the passenger comfort, a restriction of the command acceleration caused by virtual leading vehicle, denoted as a(cmd, lim, )has been introduced. It is shown that with the decrease of vertical bar a(cmd, lim)vertical bar, while the capacity does not change, the comfort of passengers significantly improves. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB The concept of an algorithm developed for the segmentation of a road border from the content of an image produced by a forward looking TV camera mounted on a moving vehicle is presented in this paper. The extraction of a road boundary is an important step in the context of autonomous vehicle guidance, enabling further calculations of distance from the border, direction of a road, etc. The main idea behind this approach is that the texture of a road is different enough in comparison to the textures characterizing the surrounding environment, allowing the separation of the overall image into a few distinguishable regions. The segmentation algorithm combines the texture descriptors of a statistical nature and the ones based on a grey level co-occurrence matrix. The significance of this work is mainly in the practical verification of the proposed algorithm and in the testing of the real limits of its application.

AB This paper describes decoupled stochastic mapping (DSM), a new computationally efficient approach to large-scale concurrent mapping and localization (CML). DSM reduces the computational burden of conventional stochastic mapping by dividing the environment into multiple overlapping submap regions, each with its own stochastic map. Two new approximation techniques are utilized for transferring vehicle state information from one submap to another, yielding a constant-time algorithm whose memory requirements scale linearly with the number of submaps. The approach is demonstrated via simulations an experiments. Simulation results are presented for the case of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigating in an unknown environments with 110 and 1200 features using simulated observations of point features by a forward look sonar. Empirical tests are used to examine the consistency of the error bounds calculated by the different methods. Experimental results are also presented for an environment with 93 features using sonar data obtained in a 3 by 9 by 1 m testing tank.

ID KALMAN FILTER
AB In a vehicle, wheel speed sensors and inertial measurement units (IMUs) are present onboard, and their raw data can be used for localization estimation. Both wheel sensors and IMUs encounter challenges such as bias and measurement noise, which accumulate as errors over time. Even a slight inaccuracy or minor error can render the localization system unreliable and unusable in a matter of seconds. Traditional algorithms, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), have been applied for a long time in non-linear systems. These systems have white noise in both the system and in the estimation model. These approaches require deep knowledge of the non-linear noise characteristics of the sensors. On the other hand, as a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), neural network-based (NN) algorithms do not necessarily have these strict requirements. The current paper proposes an AI-based long short-term memory (LSTM) localization approach and evaluates its performance against the ground truth.

AB Traditional methods on crack inspection for large infrastructures require a number of structural health inspection devices and instruments. They usually use the signal changes caused by physical deformations from cracks to detect the cracks, which is time-consuming and cost-ineffective. In this work, we propose a novel real-time crack inspection system based on unmanned aerial vehicles for real-world applications. The proposed system successfully detects and classifies various types of cracks. It can accurately find the crack positions in the world coordinate system. Our detector is based on an improved YOLOv4 with an attention module, which produces 90.02% mean average precision (mAP) and outperforms the YOLOv4-original by 5.23% in terms of mAP. The proposed system is low-cost and lightweight. Moreover, it is not restricted by navigation trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our system in real-world crack inspection tasks.

AB Deploying fully autonomous vehicles has been a subject of intense research in both industry and academia. However, the majority of these efforts have relied heavily on High Definition (HD) prior maps. These are necessary to provide the planning and control modules a rich model of the operating environment. While this approach has shown success, it drastically limits both the scale and scope of these deployments as creating and maintaining HD maps for very large areas can be prohibitive. In this work, we present a new method for building the HD map online by starting with a Standard Definition (SD) prior map such as a navigational road map, and incorporating onboard sensors to infer the local HD map. We evaluate our method extensively on 100 sequences of real-world vehicle data and demonstrate that it can infer a highly structured HD map-like model of the world accurately using only SD prior maps and onboard sensors.

SO ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE AUV; vessel avoidance; noise
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can be very quiet platforms from which to make observations of marine living resources. With few moving parts and very low propulsion power they should have a very low underwater radiated noise signature. The purpose of this paper is to describe measurements on Autosub to test this assumption. The measured noise level and spectrum are compared to the ICES proposal for the radiated noise of fisheries research vessels. Integrated over the band 100 Hz to 5000 Hz the AUV source level, at 124 dB relative to 1 mu Pa at 1 m, was about 39 dB below of the ICES specification kind about 30 dB quieter than the noise-reduced vessel "Scotia". Autosub is in fact exceedingly quiet. The difficulties of making measurements of the underwater radiated noise of a quiet submerged vehicle are discussed and suggestions are made for improvements in techniques.

   conditions for lane changes at a diverge
AB Vehicle bypassing is known to increase delays at traffic diverges. However, due to the complexities of this phenomenon, accurate and yet simple models of such lane change maneuvers are hard to develop. In this work, we present a macroscopic model for predicting the number of vehicles that perform a bypass at a traffic diverge when taking an exit link. We interpret the bypassing maneuver of vehicles at a traffic diverge as drivers acting selfishly; every vehicle selects lanes such that its own cost of travel is minimized. We discuss how we model the costs that are incurred by the vehicles. Then, taking into account the selfish behavior of vehicles, we model the lane choice of vehicles at a traffic diverge as a Wardrop equilibrium. We state and prove the properties of the equilibrium in our model. We show that there always exists an equilibrium for our model. Moreover, although our model is an instance of nonlinear asymmetrical routing games which in general have multiple equilibria, we prove that the equilibrium of our model is unique under certain assumptions that we observed to hold in all our case studies. We discuss how our model can be calibrated by running a simple optimization problem. Then, using our calibrated model, we validate it through simulation studies and demonstrate that our model successfully predicts the aggregate lane change maneuvers that are performed by vehicles at a traffic diverge. Having shown the predictive power of our model, we discuss how our model can be employed to obtain the optimal lane choice behavior of vehicles, where the social or the overall cost of all vehicles is minimized. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can be utilized in scenarios where a central authority can dictate the lane choice and trajectory of certain vehicles, for example autonomous vehicles directed by a central authority, so as to increase the overall vehicle mobility at a traffic diverge. Examples of such scenarios include the case when both human driven and autonomous vehicles coexist in the network. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper provides a review of the literature on vision-based on-board obstacle detection and distance estimation in railways. Environment perception is crucial for autonomous detection of obstacles in a vehicle's surroundings. The use of on-board sensors for road vehicles for this purpose is well established, and advances in Artificial Intelligence and sensing technologies have motivated significant research and development in obstacle detection in the automotive field. However, research and development on obstacle detection in railways has been less extensive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of on-board obstacle detection methods for railway applications. This paper reviews currently used sensors, with particular focus on vision sensors due to their dominant use in the field. It then discusses and categorizes the methods based on vision sensors into methods based on traditional Computer Vision and methods based on Artificial Intelligence.

AB In this paper we present a motion planning method for the parabolic airdrop using multirotor UAVs. The first step is to determine a set of parabolic trajectories that can reach a desired target. Next, we plan a path to the payload launch point, and based on that path we plan a collision -free trajectory that safely executes both launch and stopping motions. The described motion planning method is extensively tested in the simulation environment: by executing many trajectories through repeatability analysis; planning in a large city-like environment; and planning in a dense office environment. Furthermore, the method is tested through real-world experiments in indoor and outdoor environments. In both environments, we performed the repeatability analysis and the obstacle avoidance experiments while delivering the payload to the target.

AB This paper employs a unique decentralised cooperative control method to realise a formation-based collision avoidance strategy for a group of autonomous vehicles. In this approach, the vehicles' role in the formation and their alert and danger areas are first defined, and the formation-based intra-group and external collision avoidance methods are then proposed to translate the collision avoidance problem into the formation stability problem. The extension-decomposition-aggregation formation control method is next employed to stabilise the original and modified formations, whilst manoeuvring, and subsequently solve their collision avoidance problem indirectly. Simulation study verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the intra-group and external collision avoidance strategy. It is demonstrated that both formation control and collision avoidance problems can be simultaneously solved if the stability of the expanded formation including external obstacles can be satisfied.

AB We describe a novel quadrotor Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) system that is designed to use computer vision algorithms within the flight control loop. The main contribution is a MAV system that is able to run both the vision-based flight control and stereo-vision-based obstacle detection parallelly on an embedded computer onboard the MAV. The system design features the integration of a powerful onboard computer and the synchronization of IMU-Vision measurements by hardware timestamping which allows tight integration of IMU measurements into the computer vision pipeline. We evaluate the accuracy of marker-based visual pose estimation for flight control and demonstrate marker-based autonomous flight including obstacle detection using stereo vision. We also show the benefits of our IMU-Vision synchronization for egomotion estimation in additional experiments where we use the synchronized measurements for pose estimation using the 2pt+gravity formulation of the PnP problem.

AB Four longitudinal control techniques are compared: a classical Proportional-Integral (PI) control; an advanced technique-called the i-PI-that adds an intelligent component to the PI; a fuzzy controller based on human experience; and an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system. The controllers were designed to tackle one of the challenging topics as yet unsolved by the automotive sector: managing autonomously a gasoline-propelled vehicle at very low speeds. The dynamics involved are highly nonlinear and constitute an excellent test-bed for newly designed controllers. A Citroen C3 Pluriel car was modified to permit autonomous action on the accelerator and the brake pedals-i.e., longitudinal control. The controllers were tested in two stages. First, the vehicle was modeled to check the controllers' feasibility. Second, the controllers were then implemented in the Citroen, and their behavior under the same conditions on an identical real circuit was compared.

AB Implementing autonomous vehicles (AVs) can provide plenty of advantages, such as improving network capacity and reducing crashes. If morning commuters take AVs to the workplace, they can assign AVs an induced trip to a low-cost parking lot or even park AVs at their origins with no cost. This travel behavior might result in a more congested city network. This study firstly considers the equilibriums in route choice, mode choice, and parking lot choice in one optimization model. The solution algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization program iteratively. The Sioux Falls network is used to test the potential impacts of induced AV trips and the preference to choose an AV. The results using the test network find that scenarios with AVs increase the average travel time by approximately 50%, while 14.60% to 32.27% (scenario-based) of the area that is currently used as parking spaces can be re-purposed.

AB An obstacle restraint-model predictive control (OR-MPC) path planning algorithm with obstacle restraints for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is presented in this paper. To avoid large-volume obstacles safely, model predictive control and obstacle restraints are combined in this paper. As obstacles are set as restricted areas, the underwater environment is divided into feasible areas and prohibited areas. With OR-MPC, speed increments are generated, which are used to generate path points. Determine whether it meets the restraint. In the case where the restraint is satisfied, an angle is generated that enables the AUV to escape the restricted area. Compared with the obstacle restraint-artificial potential field-model predictive control path planning algorithm, the proposed OR-MPC can not only avoid large obstacles but has the best path. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.

AB To bridge the gap between autonomous and normal steering during low lateral acceleration maneuvers, a steeringwheel torque controller is developed. It consists of three controllers in series, a high-gain feedback steering-wheel torque controller, a nonlinear steering-angle controller, and a linear yaw-rate controller. A validated two degrees of freedom steering-system model, in combination with a single-track vehicle model, is used to determine the controller parameters. Driving tests with different drivers have been executed to find a comfortable steering-wheel torque/angle relation. This relation is maintained throughout the lane change by specifying the steering-wheel torque as a function of the steering-wheel angle tracking error. Experiments show promising results regarding the driver/vehicle interaction, but also show that a system to detect the lanes and the vehicle position on the road is required for further improvement.

AB The application of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is expanding rapidly, which drives the urgent need of its autonomy improvement. Motion control system is one of the keys to improve the control and decision-making ability of AUVs. In this paper, a saturation based nonlinear fractional-order PD (FOPD) controller is proposed for AUV motion control. The proposed controller is can achieve better dynamic performance as well as robustness compared with traditional PID type controller. It also has the advantages of simple structure, easy adjustment and easy implementation. The stability of the AUV motion control system with the proposed controller is analyzed through Lyapunov method. Moreover, the controlled performance can also be adjusted to satisfy different control requirements. The outperformed dynamic control performance of AUV yaw and depth systems with the proposed controller is shown by the set-point regulation and trajectory tracking simulation examples.

AB This paper presents a Java framework, ThinkingCap-II, for developing mobile multirobot applications, which has been successfully used in indoor, automotive and industrial robotics applications. It consists of a reference architecture that serves as a guide to make the functional decomposition of a robotics system, a software architecture that allows a uniform and reusable way of organising software components for robotics applications, and a communication infrastructure that allows software modules to communicate in a common way. A key aspect of this software architecture is that it allows code reusability by high level abstraction and a uniform way of accessing the characteristics of the sensors. In order to show the suitability of the framework, for both diverse complex platforms and multirobot applications, two case studies are discussed. One is an autonomous car-like vehicle which is guided by a manned vehicle, and the other an autonomous industrial vehicle which is member of a multirobot transportation system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper is concerned with the development of an integrated control design approach for regulation, trajectory tracking, diagnosis and control reconfiguration of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). A three-layer controller architecture is proposed to enhance the autonomy of the vehicle. At the bottom layer, the local feedback controllers are designed using H-infinity/H-2 control design technique to drive the actuators directly. A four-degree-of-freedom controller is used to incorporate the sensor avid actuator faults and to account for the interaction between the regulation and the diagnostic module. A predictive control design technique is employed at the middle layer (guidance) to manoeuvre optimally the AUV along a desired trajectory. A robust filtering scheme is proposed at the top level to provide the necessary information to the guidance system and to reconfigure the system under fault conditions. The condition for global stability is derived and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique.

AB Trajectory planning with the involvement of motion time has become a key and challenge for autonomous systems. This paper investigates trajectory planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under maneuverability and collision avoidance constraints. First, a polynomial-based trajectory planning framework is established, and a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) is formulated. Then, a novel asymptotic optimization approach is proposed to improve NLP solution success rate. Three operations of dividing the original NLP into sub-problems, adding constraints gradually, and using previous NLP solution as current initial guess value are designed in the approach. Third, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) path planning is also proposed to generate initial guess value for the first sub-problem. Benefited from these operations, the NLP solution success rate is significantly improved. Finally, simulations on simultaneous attack of a same target are carried out. Comparisons with other algorithms illustrate the advantage of the proposed approach.

AB In this paper, the methods are proposed for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to address three-dimensional (3D) path tracking and real-time obstacle avoidance. The errors of path tracking are generated based on the Serret-Frenet frame and line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law, while the errors in obstacle avoidance are obtained based on the carrier coordinate system to filter irrelevant environment information. On this basis, to deal with the complicated target path and unknown obstacles, the controller is designed by deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm and adaptive multi-constraints. The safety constraints are adopted in reward functions to avoid useless explorations and facilitate convergence. The training proceeds for path tracking and obstacle avoidance respectively. Compared to the original DDPG algorithm in the training, the proposed algorithm shows faster convergence. Various simulations are conducted under different initial conditions, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB A cooperative navigation procedure for a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is described and validated on experimental data. The procedure relies on acoustic communication networking among the AUVs and/or fixed acoustic nodes, and it is suitable as a low-cost solution for team navigation. Embedding the acoustic localization measurements in the communication scheme causes delays and sometimes loss of acoustic data, depending on acoustic propagation conditions. Despite this drawback, the results obtained show that on-board localization estimates have an error of the order of few meters, improving the overall navigation performance and leading the system towards long-term autonomy in terms of operating mission time, without the need of periodic resurfacings dedicated to reset the estimation error. The data were collected during the CommsNet '13 experiment, led by the NATO Science and Technology Organization Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE), and the Breaking The Surface '14 workshop, organized by the University of Zagreb.

ID CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION
AB Mobility of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) has caused the wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) onboard to be mobile as well. However, the time synchronization of a WSAN on ASV is more challenging due to the environmental harshness and node mobility. In this paper, an enhanced control-theoretic distributed time synchronization protocol called Time Synchronization using Distributed Observer algorithm with Sliding mode control element (TSDOS) is presented to solve the time synchronization issue in ASV. This TSDOS protocol feeds a sliding mode control element on the relative comparative error to estimate the skew rate and relative skew rate. Through the theoretical analysis and simulations, TSDOS has showed the advantages of totally distributed, robust to node failure and time-varying clock frequencies, which are the situations usually faced by an ASV. In addition, TSDOS also has better or comparable performance over existing protocols in terms of rate of convergence, consensus error spike, and steady-state error.

DE Autonomous vehicle; 3D-LiDAR; curb detection; point cloud
ID EXTRACTION; VEHICLES
AB Road curb detection is essential for autonomous vehicles to locate themselves and make a rational decision, especially under road discontinuities, obstacle occlusions, and curved road scenarios. However, an effective and systematic solution to this problem has remained elusive. In this paper, a robust 3D-LiDAR-based method for road curb detection and tracking in a structured environment is proposed. The proposed method consists of four main stages: 1) a multi-feature based method is applied to extract candidate points; 2) a density-based clustering method is proposed for classifying left and right candidate points; 3) a candidate points filter (including distance filter and RANSAC filter) is proposed to remove false points; and 4) a least-square algorithm is used to obtain road curb curve and the amplitude-limiting Kalman filter is deployed to prevent false detection and miss detection. The comprehensive experiment evaluations show that the proposed method can deal with straight and curved road without being influenced by surrounding obstacles.

AB For target search and tracking in unknown underwater environment, an integrated algorithm for a cooperative team of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (Multi-AUV) is proposed by combining the Glasius bio-inspired neural network (GBNN) and bio-inspired cascaded tracking control approach to improve search efficiency and reduce tracking errors. Among them, the GBNN is mainly used to control a multi-AUV team in search of each targets. Once any target is found, the bio-inspired cascaded tracking control approach is applied to track it in case that it may escape. This integrated algorithm deals with various situations such as search for static or dynamic targets, and tracking of different trajectory in underwater environments with obstacles. The simulation results show that this integrated algorithm is of high efficiency and adaptability.

AB Recent advances in smart connected vehicles and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are based upon the capture and processing of large amounts of sensor data. Modern vehicles contain many internal sensors to monitor a wide range of mechanical and electrical systems and the move to semi-autonomous vehicles adds outward looking sensors such as cameras, lidar, and radar. ITS is starting to connect existing sensors such as road cameras, traffic density sensors, traffic speed sensors, emergency vehicle, and public transport transponders. This disparate range of data is then processed to produce a fused situation awareness of the road network and used to provide real-time management, with much of the decision making automated. Road networks have quiet periods followed by peak traffic periods and cloud computing can provide a good solution for dealing with peaks by providing offloading of processing and scaling-up as required, but in some situations latency to traditional cloud data centres is too high or bandwidth is too constrained. Cloud computing at the edge of the network, close to the vehicle and ITS sensor, can provide a solution for latency and bandwidth constraints hut the high mobility of vehicles and heterogeneity of infrastructure still needs to be addressed. This paper surveys the literature for cloud computing use with ITS and connected vehicles and provides taxonomies for that plus their use cases. We finish by identifying where further research is needed in order to enable vehicles and ITS to use edge cloud computing in a fully managed and automated way. We surveyed 496 papers covering a seven-year timespan with the first paper appearing in 2013 and ending at the conclusion of 2019.

AB Recent research on autonomous highway vehicles has begun to focus on lateral control strategies. The initial work has focused on vehicle control during low-g maneuvers at constant vehicle speed, typical of lane merging and normal highway driving. In this paper, and its companion paper, to follow, the lateral control of vehicles during high-g emergency maneuvers is addressed. Models of the vehicle dynamics are developed, showing the accuracy of the different models under low and high-g conditions. Specifically, body roll, tire and drive-train dynamics, tire force saturation, and tire side force lag are shown to be important effects to include in models for emergency maneuvers. Current controllers, designed for low-g maneuvers only, neglect these effects. The follow on paper demonstrates the performance of lateral controllers during high-g lateral emergency maneuvers using these vehicle models.

AB We study the problem of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles designed to minimize the travel distance while avoiding moving obstacles whose position and speed are not known. Because, in practice, observations from sensors have measurement errors, the stochasticity of the data is modeled using maximum likelihood estimators, which are shown to be consistent as the sample size increases. To comply with the kinematic constraints of the vehicle, we consider smooth trajectories that can be represented by a linear combination of B-spline basis functions, transforming the infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. Moreover, a smooth penalty function is added to the travel distance, transforming the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one. The planned stochastic trajectory, obtained from the minimization problem with stochastic confidence regions, is shown to converge almost surely to the deterministic one as the number of sensor observations increases. Finally, we present two simulation studies to demonstrate the proposed method.

AB This paper deals with model-based supervision of a class of system of systems (SoS). The SoS is modeled using hypergraphs, where their architectural representation allows the application of a supervision strategy, from ascending or descending directions directly on the graph. From ascending direction, it is possible to detect local or global faults on a system, when some constraints are no longer satisfied. This is done using the concept of "degree of satisfaction," where the new operating mode of SoS is deduced using the principle of automata. In the descending direction and based on the constraint satisfaction problem, we can check from the hypergraphs a possible structural reconfiguration of SoS in the presence of faults. This reconfiguration is possible when the available systems satisfy a maximum number of constraints. Finally, an application of a SoS is presented. This is done using intelligent autonomous vehicles in a platoon configuration within a seaport terminal.

AB This paper develops a hierarchical nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for the cooperative control of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks. In the hierarchical algorithm, an estimator is proposed as a single layer, namely, the estimated layer for generating sub-targets with local physical constraints. Then, based on an augmented simplified vehicle model, a nonlinear MPC technique is newly presented in the local layer for planning the desired trajectory with its optimization solved by a continuation/generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) method. Note that, by considering the error components between the planned trajectory and the measured positions, a controller with a two-loop structure is adopted to improve tracking performances. Therefore, the control objective is obtained, namely, the vehicle platoon in the desired path is generated and the collisions among vehicles are avoided. The simulation results with comparisons are finally given to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

AB Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies have been developed to improve traffic safety, mobility, and environmental impacts throughout the years. One of the enabling CAV technologies is the lane-changing function, which has attracted much attention from both industry and academia in recent years. This paper provides an overview of representative studies on CAV lane-changing models, algorithms, traffic impact analyses as well as testing experiments. Several crucial concepts, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, lane-changing decision and planning, and vehicle control algorithms are focus of this review. Overall, despite existing successful studies on CAV lane changing, research gaps between state-of-the-art technologies and real-world CAV applications are identified in the hope of facilitating future research in this direction.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicles is forecast to bring enormous changes to the workplace as positions primarily involving driving become progressively redundant. Little is known about public awareness of these impending changes and the potential impacts on society and individuals. This study involved a national survey of Australians and interviews with key stakeholders across multiple countries to identify major potential issues associated with vehicle automation, including in and around the workplace. Most survey respondents had concerns relating to job losses in driving occupations, while almost half anticipated increased employment in technology-related areas. Three primary themes were evident in the data from the stakeholder interviews: (1) the inevitability of the universal use of AVs and hence the immediate need for labour market planning, (2) associated potential effects on occupations that are not primarily structured around driving, and (3) the possibility of increased worker safety and enhanced commuting opportunities.

TI Addressing Autonomy in Conceptual Design
SO AI MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Aircraft design is an iterative process of creating a design concept from a set of requirements. Conceptual design is an early phase in the process, during which preliminary decisions and trade studies are made from a set of requirements related to mission objective and costs. Although much attention has been paid to applying autonomy technologies to robotic systems, including air vehicles, there has been little attention paid to incorporating autonomy as part of the conceptual design process. Consequently, designing for autonomy tends to be retrofitted to a vehicle that has already gone through a complete design process rather than as part of the initial process. This derivative approach to designing autonomous systems is sub-optimal, and there is evidence that this has hindered the acceptance of autonomy technologies. This article proposes an approach to conceptual design for aircraft that incorporates autonomy into the conceptual design process. To illustrate the principles introduced, we consider the example of configuring an autonomous small unmanned aerial vehicle for searching and tracking a target of interest.

AB The adoption of a robust collision avoidance module is required to realise fully autonomous Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). In this work, collision detection and path planning methods for USVs are presented. Attention is focused on the difference between local and global path planners, describing the most common techniques derived from classical graph search theory. In addition, a dedicated section is reserved for intelligent methods, such as artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. Born as optimisation methods, they can learn a close-to-optimal solution without requiring large computation effort under certain constraints. Finally, the deficiencies of the existing methods are highlighted and discussed. It has been concluded that almost all the existing method do not address sea or weather conditions, or do not involve the dynamics of the vessel while defining the path. Therefore, this research area is still far from being considered fully explored.

DE Autonomous vehicles; mapping; tracking; evidential occupancy grids
ID PERCEPTION; COMBINATION; FUSION
AB Tracking and mapping the local environment form the basis of an autonomous vehicle system. They are often realized separately using occupancy grids, which do not require object or shape assumptions, and model-based object tracking algorithms. Many approaches require a binary classification of the sensor measurements into coming from a static or from a dynamic object, as otherwise inconsistencies between the different representations are likely to occur. This paper presents grid-based tracking and mapping (GTAM), a low-level grid-based approach that simultaneously estimates the static and the dynamic environment, their uncertainties, velocities, as well as information about free space. GTAM works on the level of grid cells, rather than creating object hypotheses. A particle filter is used to obtain continuous cell velocity distributions for all obstacles. Continuous evidences in a Dempster-Shafer model are derived without requiring a binary pre-classification of the sensor measurements. Results and evaluations using a vehicle moving in real dynamic street environments demonstrate the performance of the presented approach.

DE Stereo vision; Vehicle detection; Epipolar constraints; Normalized cross
   correlation
AB Vehicle detection is a crucial issue for driver assistance system as well as for autonomous vehicle guidance function and it has to be performed with high reliability to avoid any potential collision. The vision-based vehicle detection systems are regarded promising for this purpose because they require little infrastructure on a highway. However, the feasibility of these systems in passenger car requires accurate and robust sensing performance. In this paper, a vehicle detection system using stereo vision sensors is developed. This system utilizes feature extraction, epipoplar constraint and feature matching in order to robustly detect the initial corresponding pairs. The proposed system can detect a leading vehicle in front and can estimate its position parameters such as the distance and heading angle. After the initial detection, the system executes the tracking algorithm for the vehicles in the lane. The proposed vehicle detection system is implemented on a passenger car and its performances are verified experimentally.

AB Automated Driving Systems (ADS) open up a new domain for the automotive industry and offer new possibilities for future transportation with higher efficiency and comfortable experiences. However, perception and sensing for autonomous driving under adverse weather conditions have been the problem that keeps autonomous vehicles (AVs) from going to higher autonomy for a long time. This paper assesses the influences and challenges that weather brings to ADS sensors in a systematic way, and surveys the solutions against inclement weather conditions. State-of-the-art algorithms and deep learning methods on perception enhancement with regard to each kind of weather, weather status classification, and remote sensing are thoroughly reported. Sensor fusion solutions, weather conditions coverage in currently available datasets, simulators, and experimental facilities are categorized. Additionally, potential ADS sensor candidates and developing research directions such as V2X (Vehicle to Everything) technologies are discussed. By looking into all kinds of major weather problems, and reviewing both sensor and computer science solutions in recent years, this survey points out the main moving trends of adverse weather problems in perception and sensing, i.e., advanced sensor fusion and more sophisticated machine learning techniques; and also the limitations brought by emerging 1550 nm LiDARs. In general, this work contributes a holistic overview of the obstacles and directions of perception and sensing research development in terms of adverse weather conditions.

AB In an Advanced Traveler Information System where route guidance is provided, a driver chooses a route before he/she actually traverses the links in the route. For such systems, Ink travel times need to be forecasted. However, information on several thousand links would take a fair amount of time to be conveyed to the driver, and very few drivers would be willing to wait very long to get route information. In the ADVANCE demonstration, to be implemented in suburban Chicago, the in-vehicle unit in each participating vehicle will be provided with the capability of accessing default travel time information, which will offer the vehicle with an autonomous navigation capability. The default estimates will be overwritten by dynamic up-to-the-minute forecasts if such forecasts are different from the default estimates. This paper describes the approach used to compute default travel times estimates.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB This study proposes a path planning algorithm for marine vehicles based on machine learning. The algorithm considers the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle and disturbance effects in ocean environments. The movements of marine vehicles are influenced by various physical disturbances in ocean environments, such as wind, waves, and currents. In the present study, the effects of ocean currents are the primary consideration. A kinematic model is used to incorporate the nonholonomic motion characteristics of a marine vehicle, and the reinforcement learning algorithm is used for path optimization to generate a feasible path that can be tracked by the vehicle. The proposed approach determines a near-optimal path that connects the start and goal points with a reasonable computational cost when the map and current field data are provided. To verify the optimality and validity of the proposed algorithm, a set of simulations were performed in simulated and actual ocean current conditions, and their results are presented.

AB This review addresses efforts made within the field of vehicle dynamics to contribute to the energy efficient operation of road and rail vehicles. Selected investigations of the research community to develop technology solutions to reduce energy consumption are presented. The study explores the impact and potential of relatively mature technologies such as regenerative braking, but also recent research directions that are seeking to develop solutions such as regenerative suspensions, a concept common to both transport modes. Specifically for road vehicles, the study includes rear wheel steering, camber control and torque vectoring, and for rail vehicles active steering and light-weighting. Operationally, there would appear to be great potential for rail vehicles in the wider adoption of connected driver advisory systems, and automatic train control systems, including the application of machine learning techniques to optimise train speed trajectories across a route. Similarly, for road vehicles, predictive and cooperative eco-driving strategies show potential for significant energy savings for connected autonomous vehicles.

AB Responsibility gaps concern the attribution of blame for harms caused by autonomous machines. The worry has been that, because they are artificial agents, it is impossible to attribute blame, even though doing so would be appropriate given the harms they cause. We argue that there are no responsibility gaps. The harms can be blameless. And if they are not, the blame that is appropriate is indirect and can be attributed to designers, engineers, software developers, manufacturers or regulators. The real problem lies elsewhere: autonomous machines should be built so as to exhibit a level of risk that is morally acceptable. If they fall short of this standard, they exhibit what we call 'a control gap.' The causal control that autonomous machines have will then fall short of the guidance control they should emulate.

AB It is particularly challenging to devise techniques for underpinning the behaviour of autonomous vehicles in surveillance missions as these vehicles operate in uncertain and unpredictable environments where they must cope with little stability and tight deadlines in spite of their restricted resources. State-of-the-art techniques typically use probabilistic algorithms that suffer a high computational cost in complex real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the probabilistic reasoning based on the target motion model offered by Monte Carlo simulation with long-term strategic capabilities provided by automated task planning. We demonstrate our approach by focusing on one particular surveillance mission, search-and-tracking, and by using two different vehicles, a fixed-wing UAV deployed in simulation and the "Parrot AR.Drone2.0" quadcopter deployed in a physical environment. Our experimental results show that our unique way of integrating probabilistic and deterministic reasoning pays off when we tackle realistic missions.

AB In this paper, we employ a dynamics modeling method for investigating a multi-body dynamics system of semi-submersible autonomous underwater vehicles consisting of a towing vehicle operated near the water surface, a tow cable, and a towfish. The towfish, which is towed by a marine cable for the purposes of exploration or mine hunting, is modeled with a Six-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DOF) equation of motion that reflects its hydrodynamics characteristics. The towing cable, which can experience large displacements and deformations, is modeled using an absolute nodal coordinate formulation. To reflect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cable during motion, the hydrodynamic force due to added mass and the drag force are imposed. To verify) the completeness of the modeling, a few simple numerical simulations were conducted, and the results confirm the physical plausibility of the model.

AB Fast simultaneous localization and mapping (FastSLAM) is an efficient algorithm for autonomous navigation of mobile vehicle. However, FastSLAM must reconfigure the entire vehicle state equation when the feature points change, which causes an exponential growth in quantities of computation and difficulties in isolating potential faults. In order to overcome these limitations, an improved FastSLAM, based on the distributed structure, is developed in this paper. There are two state estimation parts designed in this improved FastSLAM. Firstly, a distributed unscented particle filter is used to avoid reconfiguring the entire system equation in the vehicle state estimation part. Secondly, in the landmarks estimation part, the observation model is designed as a linear one to update the landmarks states by using the linear observation errors. Then, the convergence of the proposed and improved FastSLAM algorithm is given in the sense of mean square. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed distributed algorithm could reduce the computational complexity with high accuracy and high fault-tolerance performance.

AB This letter describes a method for autonomous aerial cinematography with distributed lighting by a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Although camera-carrying multi-rotor helicopters have become commonplace in cinematography, their usage is limited to scenarios with sufficient natural light or of lighting provided by static artificial lights. We propose to use a formation of unmanned aerial vehicles as a tool for filming a target under illumination from various directions, which is one of the fundamental techniques of traditional cinematography. We decompose the multi-UAV trajectory optimization problem to tackle non-linear cinematographic aspects and obstacle avoidance at separate stages, which allows us to re-plan in real time and react to changes in dynamic environments. The performance of our method has been evaluated in realistic simulation scenarios and field experiments, where we show how it increases the quality of the shots and that it is capable of planning safe trajectories even in cluttered environments.

AB In this paper the concept of Hybrid Parameter-Varying Model Predictive Control (HPV-MPC) is applied for autonomous vehicle steering. Parameter-varying in the MPC context means that a prediction model with non-constant, parameter-varying system matrices is employed. In the investigated scenarios, the displacement of a car on an icy road due to a side wind gust shall be mitigated, and a double lane-change maneuver shall be performed autonomously. In order to explore a possible reduction of online computations and the inherent degradation of control performance, the nonlinear model of the lateral dynamics is approximated in various ways. A comparison between controllers using prediction models varying from the full nonlinear model, as an indication for the maximal achievable performance, to a linear model was performed. Particular emphasis was put on the hybrid parameter-varying prediction model, to investigate their potential in terms of computational effort and control performance.

AB The navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles is a major scientific and technological challenge. The principal difficulty is the opacity of the water media for usual types of radiation except for the acoustic waves. Thus, an acoustic transducer (array) composed of an acoustic sonar is the only tool for external measurements of the AUV attitude and position. Another difficulty is the inconstancy of the speed of propagation of acoustic waves, which depends on the temperature, salinity, and pressure. For this reason, only the data fusion of the acoustic measurements with data from other onboard inertial navigation system sensors can provide the necessary estimation quality and robustness. This review presents common approaches to underwater navigation and also one novel method of velocity measurement. The latter is an analog of the well-known Optical Flow method but based on a sequence of sonar array measurements.

AB This paper addresses a methodology for autonomous motion planning of multirotor aircraft in obstructed environments. The control strategy allows the vehicle to online generate quasi-optimal trajectories with limited computational load while performing collision avoidance tasks. The problem is formulated in a model-predictive control architecture in which motion planning and trajectory tracking processes are solved separately. The first process is based on a spline path planning approach to generate smooth and safe trajectories. The second process elaborates trajectory inputs in terms of commanded thrust magnitude and desired attitude rates in order to steer the vehicle during the mission task. Results of both numerical simulations and, for the first time, an experimental validation are provided in order to assess the performance of the approach in the presence of external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, provided adequate time horizon and update frequency are selected for the numerical optimization algorithm.

AB Multitarget tracking based on multisensor fusion perception is one of the key technologies to realize the intelligent driving of automobiles and has become a research hotspot in the field of intelligent driving. However, most current autonomous-vehicle target-tracking methods based on the fusion of millimeter-wave radar and lidar information struggle to guarantee accuracy and reliability in the measured data, and cannot effectively solve the multitarget-tracking problem in complex scenes. In view of this, based on the distributed multisensor multitarget tracking (DMMT) system, this paper proposes a multitarget-tracking method for autonomous vehicles that comprehensively considers key technologies such as target tracking, sensor registration, track association, and data fusion based on millimeter-wave radar and lidar. First, a single-sensor multitarget-tracking method suitable for millimeter-wave radar and lidar is proposed to form the respective target tracks; second, the Kalman filter temporal registration method and the residual bias estimation spatial registration method are used to realize the temporal and spatial registration of millimeter-wave radar and lidar data; third, use the sequential m-best method based on the new target density to find the track the correlation of different sensors; and finally, the IF heterogeneous sensor fusion algorithm is used to optimally combine the track information provided by millimeter-wave radar and lidar, and finally form a stable and high-precision global track. In order to verify the proposed method, a multitarget-tracking simulation verification in a high-speed scene is carried out. The results show that the multitarget-tracking method proposed in this paper can realize the track tracking of multiple target vehicles in high-speed driving scenarios. Compared with a single-radar tracker, the position, velocity, size, and direction estimation errors of the track fusion tracker are reduced by 85.5%, 64.6%, 75.3%, and 9.5% respectively, and the average value of GOSPA indicators is reduced by 19.8%; more accurate target state information can be obtained than a single-radar tracker.

AB It is concerned that system-level benefits of connected automated vehicle control might only prevail in a far-future centralized control environment, whereas the benefits could be much offset in a near-future decentralized control system. To address this concern, this paper proposes a decentralized control model for connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at an isolated signalized intersection with a single-lane road where each connected automated vehicle aims to minimize its own travel time, fuel consumption and safety risks. To improve the computational tractability, the original complex decentralized control model is reformulated into a discrete model. A benchmark centralized control model is also formulated to compare with the decentralized control model. The DIRECT algorithm is adopted to solve the above models. Numerical results show that the decentralized control model has better computational efficiency (with an average solution time of 10 s) than the centralized control model (with an average solution time of 60 s) without significant loss of the system optimality (with an average of 3.91%). Finally, analysis on connected automated vehicle market penetration shows that the extra benefit of the centralized control model is not obvious either in under-saturated traffic (less than 1%) or at a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate in critically-saturated and oversaturated traffic (less than 3% when the market penetration rate is lower than 20%). The results suggest that, as apposed to the earlier concern, the near-future decentralized control scheme that requires less technology maturity and infrastructure investment can achieve benefits similar to the far-future centralized control scheme with much simpler operations in under-saturated traffic, or in critically-saturated traffic and over-saturated traffic with a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate.

AB PurposeThe purpose of this research paper is to recover the autonomous flight performance of a mini unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) via stochastically optimizing the wing over certain parameters (i.e. wing taper ratio and wing aspect ratio) while there are lower and upper constraints on these redesign parameters.Design/methodology/approachA mini UAV is produced in the Iskenderun Technical University (ISTE) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Laboratory. Its complete wing can vary passively before the flight with respect to the result of the stochastic redesign of the wing while maximizing autonomous flight performance. Flight control system (FCS) parameters (i.e. gains of longitudinal and lateral proportional-integral-derivative controllers) and wing redesign parameters mentioned before are simultaneously designed to maximize autonomous flight performance index using a certain stochastic optimization strategy named as simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). Found results are used while composing UAV flight simulations.FindingsUsing stochastic redesign of mini UAV and simultaneously designing mini ISTE UAV over previously mentioned wing parameters and FCS, it obtained a maximum UAV autonomous flight performance.Research limitations/implicationsPermission of the directorate general of civil aviation in the Republic of Turkiye is essential for real-time UAV autonomous flights.Practical implicationsStochastic redesign of mini UAV and simultaneously designing mini ISTE UAV wing parameters and FCS approach is very useful for improving any mini UAV autonomous flight performance cost index.Social implicationsStochastic redesign of mini UAV and simultaneously designing mini ISTE UAV wing parameters and FCS approach succeeds confidence, highly improved autonomous flight performance cost index and easy service demands of mini UAV operators.Originality/valueCreating a new approach to recover autonomous flight performance cost index (e.g. satisfying less settling time and less rise time, less overshoot during flight trajectory tracking) of a mini UAV and composing a novel procedure performing simultaneous mini UAV having passively morphing wing over certain parameters while there are upper and lower constraints and FCS design idea.

AB Surround View fisheye cameras are commonly deployed in automated driving for 360 degrees near-field sensing around the vehicle. This work presents a multi-task visual perception network on unrectified fisheye images to enable the vehicle to sense its surrounding environment. It consists of six primary tasks necessary for an autonomous driving system: depth estimation, visual odometry, semantic segmentation, motion segmentation, object detection, and lens soiling detection. We demonstrate that the jointly trained model performs better than the respective single task versions. Our multi-task model has a shared encoder providing a significant computational advantage and has synergized decoders where tasks support each other. We propose a novel camera geometry based adaptation mechanism to encode the fisheye distortion model both at training and inference. This was crucial to enable training on the WoodScape dataset, comprised of data from different parts of the world collected by 12 different cameras mounted on three different cars with different intrinsics and viewpoints. Given that bounding boxes is not a good representation for distorted fisheye images, we also extend object detection to use a polygon with non-uniformly sampled vertices. We additionally evaluate our model on standard automotive datasets, namely KITTI and Cityscapes. We obtain the state-of-the-art results on KITTI for depth estimation and pose estimation tasks and competitive performance on the other tasks. We perform extensive ablation studies on various architecture choices and task weighting methodologies. A short video at https://youtu.be/xbSjZ5OfPes provides qualitative results.

AB This study describes the implementation of an online path planner in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system by using an open-source system architecture, MOOS-IvP. The path planner employed a path replanning scheme and the selective differential evolution quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (SDEQPSO) algorithm. The implementation was based on a modular framework to ensure the robustness of the path replanner during a mission. The performance of the path replanner was evaluated and verified under stochastic processes hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests, in which the replanner interacted with the onboard controllers and actuators of an Explorer AUV. The experimental results showed the path replanner can be run seamlessly with the hardware onboard an Explorer AUV in real time to generate and continuously refine a safe and feasible path for a dynamic and unexplored environment.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB In recent years, computer vision algorithms have become more powerful, which enabled technologies such as autonomous driving to evolve rapidly. However, current algorithms mainly share one limitation: They rely on directly visible objects. This is a significant drawback compared to human behavior, where visual cues caused by objects (e. g., shadows) are already used intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate occurring objects. While driving at night, this performance deficit becomes even more obvious: Humans already process the light artifacts caused by the headlamps of oncoming vehicles to estimate where they appear, whereas current object detection systems require that the oncoming vehicle is directly visible before it can be detected. Based on previous work on this subject, in this paper, we present a complete system that can detect light artifacts caused by the headlights of oncoming vehicles so that it detects that a vehicle is approaching providently (denoted as provident vehicle detection). For that, an entire algorithm architecture is investigated, including the detection in the image space, the three-dimensional localization, and the tracking of light artifacts. To demonstrate the usefulness of such an algorithm, the proposed algorithm is deployed in a test vehicle to use the detected light artifacts to control the glare-free high beam system proactively (react before the oncoming vehicle is directly visible). Using this experimental setting, the provident vehicle detection system's time benefit compared to an in-production computer vision system is quantified. Additionally, the glare-free high beam use case provides a real-time and real-world visualization interface of the detection results by considering the adaptive headlamps as projectors. With this investigation of provident vehicle detection, we want to put awareness on the unconventional sensing task of detecting objects providently (detection based on observable visual cues the objects cause before they are visible) and further close the performance gap between human behavior and computer vision algorithms to bring autonomous and automated driving a step forward.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Measuring the ever-changing 3-dimensional (3D) motions of the ocean requires simultaneous sampling at multiple locations. In particular, sampling the complex, nonlinear dynamics associated with submesoscales (<1-10 km) requires new technologies and approaches. Here we introduce the Mini-Autonomous Underwater Explorer (M-AUE), deployed as a swarm of 16 independent vehicles whose 3D trajectories are measured near-continuously, underwater. As the vehicles drift with the ambient flow or execute preprogrammed vertical behaviours, the simultaneous measurements at multiple, known locations resolve the details of the flow within the swarm. We describe the design, construction, control and underwater navigation of the M-AUE. A field programme in the coastal ocean using a swarm of these robots programmed with a depth-holding behaviour provides a unique test of a physical-biological interaction leading to plankton patch formation in internal waves. The performance of the M-AUE vehicles illustrates their novel capability for measuring submesoscale dynamics.

AB The paper describes the development of the Navigation, Guidance and Control system of a small, prototypal Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV), which is part of an ASV/UUV (Unmanned Underwater Vehicle) robotic system. The main task of the ASV is to serve as supply vessel for the UUV it can carry, deploy and recover and to allow communication with a remote control station. The main problem the NGC system has to handle is that of making the ASV track the UUV and maintain the relative distance within a given bound, using delayed information about the UUV position provided by an acoustic tracking and positioning systems. The specific tracking problem is formulated in a suitable way and a strategy for its solution is proposed and implemented by means of an appropriate control architecture. Stability is discussed using Lyapunov techniques and performances are shown by means of simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phenomenon of range anxiety is a disincentive to the uptake of electric vehicles by a large proportion of drivers despite the range afforded by an electric vehicle being more than is required by the majority of drivers for their daily journeys. Although efforts continue to alleviate the situation through increasing the autonomous range of vehicles that operate from a battery, in some cases, it might be that range anxiety may also be mitigated through better driver information. However, the systems comprising any vehicle and an electric vehicle in particular are highly complex and nonlinear and do not lend themselves to analytical modelling to allow range prediction; instead, model-free methods must be employed. One relatively recent advance in model-free methods is the 'Fuzzy Transform', which has now been adapted to online use for the prediction of remaining range of an electric vehicle.

AB Accurate tracking of a given path is one of the primary factors in the maneuverability of a vehicle and is also an important topic in autonomous vehicle research. To solve the problem of vehicle path tracking, the problem must first be transformed into an optimal control problem. Then, a symplectic pseudospectral method (SPM) based on the third-generation function of symplectic theory and pseudospectral discretization is proposed to efficiently solve the nonlinear optimal control problems. Finally, the results obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with those obtained by the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM). The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively solve the vehicle path tracking problem. Furthermore, the vehicle can track the given path controlled by the proposed algorithm with higher accuracy and greater applicability than other methods.

AB Formal models for the safety validation of autonomous vehicles have become increasingly important. To this end, we present a safety framework for longitudinal automated driving. This framework allows calculating minimum safe inter-vehicular distances for arbitrary ego vehicle control policies. We use this framework to enhance the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model and models based on it, which fail to cover situations where the ego vehicle has a higher decelerating capacity than its preceding vehicle. For arbitrary ego vehicle control policies, we show how our framework can be applied by substituting real (possibly computationally intractable) controllers with upper bounding functions. This comprises a general approach for longitudinal safety, where safety guarantees for the upper-bounded system are equivalent to those for the original system but come at the expense of larger inter-vehicular distances.

AB The autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) significantly improves the responsiveness and throughput of the traditional automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) in regard to handling unit loads. The AVS/RS consists of multiple tiers connected to an elevator system and is equipped with at least two autonomous vehicles, that is, a shuttle and satellite. Other necessary equipment are the lifts and input/output buffer areas. This paper aims to present and apply an original hybrid analytical-simulative model for the design of a deep-lane and multisatellite AVS-RS by evaluating and controlling the system performance. This AVS-RS is equipped with multiple free and non-free satellites for each tier. As an original contribution, this study reviews the literature on AVS/RS according to the introduction of multiple features categorized into five homogeneous groups: (1) rack configuration, (2) vehicle kinematics and configuration, (3) dispatching rules, (4) modeling approach, and (5) validation. Two of the most critical issues in existing research studies are the random arrival time of storage and retrieval transactions and the random storage policy. The proposed modeling approach is data-driven and based on realistic assumptions, filling the gap between the literature and real applications. This hybrid model is applied to a case study of the beverage industry according to a what-if comparative and competitive multiscenario analysis. This data-driven assessment supports the decision-making process on the number of satellites for each tier, while simultaneously controlling the service and waiting times, system throughput, and vehicle utilization. The analysis based on the maximum system throughput estimation demonstrates that introducing more than two satellites does not increase the productivity of the system.

AB To explore potential travel behavior shifts induced by personally owned, fully autonomous vehicles (AVs), we ran an experiment that provided personal chauffeurs to 43 households in the Sacramento region to simulate life with an AV. Like an advanced AV, the chauffeurs took over driving duties. Households were recruited from the 2018 Sacramento household travel survey sample. Sampling was stratified by weekly vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and households were selected to be diverse by demographics, modal preferences, mobility barriers, and residential location. Thirty-four households received 60 h of chauffeur service for 1 week, and nine households received 60 h per week for 2 weeks. Smartphone-based travel diaries were recorded for the chauffeur week(s), 1 week before, and 1 week after. During the chauffeur week, the overall systemwide VMT (summing across all sampled households) increased by 60%, over half of which came from "zero-occupancy vehicle" (ZOV) trips (when the chauffeur was the only occupant). The number of trips made in the system increased by 25%, with ZOV trips accounting for 85% of these additional trips. There was a shift away from transit, ridehailing, biking, and walking trips, which dropped by 70%, 55%, 38%, and 10%, respectively. Households with mobility barriers and those with less auto dependency had the greatest percent increase in VMT, whereas higher VMT households and families with children had the lowest. The results highlight how AVs can enhance mobility, but also caution against the potential detrimental effects on the transportation system and the need to regulate AVs and ZOVs.

ID SYSTEMS APPLICATION
AB This paper proposes a cooperative intersection control strategy, which aims to decrease the number of accidents and to increase the traffic flow at intersections. Existing high-level automation methodologies mainly focus on the determination of a safe crossing sequence of the involved vehicles, typically ignoring realistic vehicle dynamics aspects. The solution proposed in this paper, referred to as cooperative intersection control (CIC), takes into account the dynamics of the vehicles and is based on the novel concept of virtual platooning. Virtual platooning allows to form platoons of vehicles that are in different lanes of the intersection and have different directional intentions. Herewith, both safe passage of the vehicles through the intersection and a high intersection throughput (due to close "virtual" vehicle following) can be achieved. The performance of the proposed strategy is assessed, and a comparison between the CIC and an intersection controlled with traffic lights is presented.

DE autonomous vehicle; vehicle dynamics; torque vectoring; object-oriented
   programming; real-time simulations
AB Assessing passenger cars' dynamic performance is a critical aspect for car industries, due to its impact on the overall vehicle safety evaluation and the subjective nature of the involved handling and comfort metrics. Accordingly, ISO standards, such as ISO 4138 and ISO 3888, define several specific driving tests to assess vehicle dynamics performance objectively. Consequently, proper evaluation of the dynamic behaviour requires measuring several physical quantities, including accelerations, speed, and linear and angular displacements obtained after instrumenting a vehicle with multiple sensors. This experimental activity is highly demanding in terms of hardware costs, and it is also significantly time-consuming. Several approaches can be considered for reducing vehicle development time. In particular, simulation software can be exploited to predict the approximate behaviour of a vehicle using virtual scenarios. Moreover, motion platforms and detail-scalable numerical vehicle models are widely implemented for the purpose. This paper focuses on a customized simulation environment developed in C++, which exploits the advantages of object-oriented programming. The presented framework strives to perform concurrent simulations of vehicles with different characteristics such as mass, tyres, engine, suspension, and transmission systems. Within the proposed simulation framework, we adopted a hierarchical and modular representation. Vehicles are modelled by a 14 degree-of-freedom (DOF) full-vehicle model, capable of capturing the dynamics and complemented by a set of scalable-detail models for the remaining sub-systems such as tyre, engine, and steering system. Furthermore, this paper proposes the usage of autonomous virtual drivers for a more objective evaluation of vehicle dynamic performances. Moreover, to further evaluate our simulator architecture's efficiency and assess the achieved level of concurrency, we designed a benchmark able to analyse the scaling of the performances with respect to the number of different vehicles during the same simulation. Finally, the paper reports the proposed simulation environment's scalability resulting from a set of different and varying driving scenarios.

AB This paper proposes a systematic approach for automatic tasking and coordination of a heterogeneous team of cooperative autonomous vehicles forming an intelligent vehicle. Each vehicle is equipped with different resources, operating in a shared dynamic environment, and capable of executing a set of specific tasks. To coordinate such a heterogeneous team of vehicles, we develop a hierarchical modular coordination algorithm for generating local Behavior Trees (BTs) for tasking individual vehicles so that they, as a team, can collectively achieve a global mission. A hierarchical auctioning algorithm is embedded in the proposed framework to effectively assign tasks among the vehicles, so that they can complement each other and complete a mission that may not be achieved individually. Furthermore, by introducing operational and duration cost weight terms, the proposed approach provides the possibility to adjust the total operation cost and duration of the tasks. The details of the developed algorithms are illustrated through different case studies. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By resorting to the rotation matrix, AUV's attitude dynamics will be globally and uniquely represented without unwinding. However, this kind of attitude representation approach complicates the controller design process in the sense that the attitude tracking error is defined by a rotation matrix instead of a three-dimension vector. Regarding this, an alternative error vector is introduced for the simplicity of calculation and implementation. Then, a novel sliding mode surface that consists of two components is devised to provide the characters of finite-time convergence and singularity-free. Upon the application of this variable, an artful adaptive law is constructed such that the estimated information always appears as limited values in the controller. Eventually, theoretical analysis and comparative simulations can illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB The communication system is a critical part of the system design for the autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). It has to address different considerations, including efficiency, reliability and mobility of the UAV. In addition, a multi-UAV system requires a communication system to assist information sharing, task allocation and collaboration in a team of UAVs. In this paper, we review communication solutions for supporting a team of UAVs while considering an application in the power line inspection industry. We provide a review of candidate wireless communication technologies for supporting communication in UAV applications. Performance measurements and UAV-related channel modeling of those candidate technologies are reviewed. A discussion of current technologies for building UAV mesh networks is presented. We then analyze the structure, interface and performance of robotic communication middleware, ROS and ROS2. Based on our review, the features and dependencies of candidate solutions in each layer of the communication system are presented.

AB With the advancement of connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology, research on future traffic conditions after the popularization of CAVs needs to be resolved urgently. Bounded rationality of human drivers is essential for simulating traffic flow precisely, but few studies focus on the traffic flow simulation considered bounded rationality in CAV mixed traffic flow. In this study, we introduce random bounded rationality into the hybrid feedback strategy (HFS) under CAV mixed traffic flow to explore the impacts of CAV penetration rate on the trip cost of vehicles. First, we investigated the bounded rationality of drivers, and we found that it follows normal contribution. Then, we proposed HFS considering random bounded rationality and the CAV penetration rate to simulate the traffic condition. The numerical results show that the enhancement of the CAV penetration rate could reduce total trip cost. The research could help us to simulate the CAVs mixed traffic flow more precisely and realistically.

ID LAND-USE; ADOPTION; TRAVEL
AB The adoption of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is in its infancy. Therefore, very little is known about their potential impacts on traffic. Meanwhile, researchers and market analysts predict a wide range of possibilities about their potential benefits and the timing of their deployments. Planners traditionally use various types of travel demand models to forecast future traffic conditions. However, such models do not yet integrate any expected impacts from CAV deployments. Consequently, many long-range transportation plans do not yet account for their eventual deployment. To address some of these uncertainties, this work modified an existing model for Madison, Wisconsin. To compare outcomes, the authors used identical parameter changes and simulation scenarios for a model of Gainesville, Florida. Both models show that with increasing levels of CAV deployment, both the vehicle miles traveled and the average congestion speed will increase. However, there are some important exceptions due to differences in the road network layout, geospatial features, sociodemographic factors, land-use, and access to transit.

AB In this paper, we analyze the performance of a positioning system based on the fusion of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging estimates together with odometry and inertial data from the vehicle. For carrying out this data fusion, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has been used. Furthermore, a post-processing algorithm has been designed to remove the Non Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) UWB ranging estimates to further improve the accuracy of the proposed solution. This solution has been tested using both a simulated environment and a real environment. This research work is in the scope of the PRoPART European Project. The different real tests have been performed on the AstaZero proving ground using a Radio Control car (RC car) developed by RISE (Research Institutes of Sweden) as testing platform. Thus, a real time positioning solution has been achieved complying with the accuracy requirements for the PRoPART use case.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB We address the issue of autonomous navigation, that is, the ability for a navigation system to provide information about the states of a vehicle without the need for a priori infrastructure such as GPS, beacons, or a map. The algorithm is known as simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) and it is a terrain aided navigation system (TANS) which has the capability for online map building, and simultaneously utilising the generated map to bound the errors in the navigation solution. Since the algorithm does not require any a priori terrain information or initial knowledge of the vehicle location, it presents a powerful navigation augmentation system or more importantly, it can be implemented as an independent navigation system. Results are first provided using computer simulation which analyses the effect of the spatial density of landmarks as well as the quality of observation and inertial navigation data, and then finally the real time implementation of the algorithm on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

AB In the last years, a challenging field of autonomous robotics is represented by cooperative mobile manipulation carried out in different environments (aerial, terrestrial and underwater environment). As regards cooperative manipulation of Intervention-Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUVs), this application is characterized by a more complex environment of work, compared to the terrestrial or aerial ones, both due to different technological problems, e.g. localization and communication in underwater environment. However, the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and I-AUV will necessarily grow up in the future exploration of the sea. Particularly, cooperative I-AUVs represent the natural evolution of single centralized I-AUV because they may be used in various underwater assembly tasks, such as complex underwater structure construction and maintenance (e.g. underwater pipeline and cable transportation can be carried out by multiple cooperative I-AUVs). Furthermore, underwater search and rescue tasks could be more efficient and effective if multiple I-AUVs were used.
   In this paper, the authors propose an innovative decentralized approach for cooperative mobile manipulation of I-AUVs. This decentralized strategy is based on a different use of potential field method; in particular, a multi-layer control structure is developed to in parallel manage the coordination of the swarm, the guidance and navigation of the I-AUVs and the manipulation task. The main advantage of the potential field method is that less information is necessary: navigation and control problems are reduced to the evaluation of the distance vector among the vehicles, object and obstacles. Moreover, because of the technological problems caused by the underwater environment, the reduction of the transmitted data is one of the keypoints of this architecture. In MATLAB (R)-Simulink (R), the authors have simulated a transportation task of a partially known object along a reference trajectory in an unknown environment, where some obstacles are placed. The task is performed by an I-AUV swarm composed of four vehicles, each one provided of a 7 Degrees Of Freedom (DOFs) robotic arm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the development of underwater technology, it is important to develop a wide range of autonomous and remotely operated underwater vehicles for various tasks. Depending on the problem that needs to be solved, vehicles will have different designs and dimensions, while the issues surrounding reduced costs and increasing the functionality of vehicles are relevant. This article discusses the development of inspection class experimental remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for performing coastal underwater inspection operations, with a smaller number of thrusters, but having the same functional capabilities in terms of controllability (as vehicles with traditionally-shaped layouts). The proposed design provides controllability of the vehicle in six degrees of freedom, using six thrusters. In classical design vehicles, such controllability is usually achieved using eight thrusters. The proposed design of the ROV is described; the mathematical model, the results of modeling, and experimental tests of the developed ROVs are shown.

AB Although the difference between the velocity of two successive vehicles is considered in the full velocity difference model (FVDM), more status information from preceding vehicles affecting the behavior of car-following has not been effectively utilized. For improving the performance of the FVDM, an extended modified car-following model taking into account traffic density and the acceleration of a leading vehicle (DAVD, density and acceleration velocity difference model) is presented under the condition of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Stability in the developed model is derived through applying linear stability theory. The curves of neutral stability for the improved model indicate that when the driver pays more attention to the traffic status in front, the traffic flow stability region is larger. Numerical simulation illustrates that traffic flow disturbance could be suppressed by gaining more information on preceding vehicles.

AB The place of driving assistance systems is currently increasing drastically for road vehicles. Paving the road to the fully autonomous vehicle, the drive-by-wire technology could improve the potential of the vehicle control. The implementation of these new embedded systems is still limited, mainly for reliability reasons, thus requiring the development of diagnostic mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the detection and the identification of sensor and actuator faults for a drive-by-wire road vehicle. An Interacting Multiple Model approach is proposed, based on a non-linear vehicle dynamics observer. The adequacy of different probabilistic observers is discussed. The results, based on experimental vehicle signals, show a fast and robust identification of sensor faults while the actuator faults are more challenging.

AB An autonomous smartphone embedded inertial sensors aided vehicular navigation method is proposed in this study to solve the low accuracy of the embedded sensors and the indefinite installation angle between a smartphone and a vehicle in a smartphone-based vehicular navigation. First, the nonlinear MEMS-IMU model and nonlinear NHC model are derived, and analysis of the error generated by the traditional model under this case is conducted, proving the necessity of the nonlinear modeling in theory. Second, we establish the nonlinear integrated navigation scheme, the app is also implemented with the scheme on the Android platform. The satellite-denied simulation experiment verifies the accuracy of the proposed method is higher than that of the traditional method. The app performs well in the smartphone-based platform in the actual tunnel and underground parking lot tests.

AB It is well known that it is difficult to explore underwater terrains using an autonomous underwater vehicle due to the varieties and complexities of underwater terrain elements. Since conventional underwater terrain coverage techniques are usually based on the assumption that the underwater surface is planar, they generate an unnecessary exploration path especially on steep sloped surfaces of ocean basins. This paper proposes a new type of coverage technique, the hybrid terrain coverage framework (HTCF), which considers various surface conditions in three-dimensional environments and generates an efficient exploration path for all environments. The HTCF incorporates a planar terrain coverage algorithm, a spiral path terrain coverage algorithm, and a hybrid decision module to recognize and select the most suitable technique depending on the sloped surface variations. Simulation results show that the proposed HTCF is more efficient than the conventional terrain coverage algorithm in terms of the energy consumption of the underwater vehicle.

AB In this paper we investigate the geometry and algebra of multiple one-dimensional projections of a two-dimensional environment. This is relevant for one-dimensional cameras, e.g. as used in certain autonomous guided vehicles. It is also relevant for understanding the projection of lines in ordinary vision. A third application is on ordinary vision of vehicles undergoing so called planar motion. The structure and motion problem for such cameras is studied and the two possible minimal cases is solved. The technique of solving these questions reveal interesting ambiguities. It is shown that for each solution with three images there is an ambiguous solution. It is also shown that for each solution for four points there is an ambiguous solution. The connection between these two different types of ambiguities is also given. Although the paper deals with calibrated cameras, it is shown that similar results exist for uncalibrated cameras.

DE Multi-vehicle trajectory planning; Leader-following; Nonlinear systems
AB In this paper, a trajectory planner for n autonomous vehicles following a common leader is presented, with the planning being accomplished in real time and in a three dimensional setting. The trajectory planner is designed such that n follower vehicles behave as n distinct points of a unique two dimensional trailer attached to a single leader vehicle. We prove that for a wide range of initial conditions the trailer reference frame converges to a unique solution, meaning that convergence to a fixed formation of n + 1 vehicles is guaranteed and each follower can plan its trajectory independently from its peers, thereby reducing the need for communication among vehicles. Bounds on the planned velocity and acceleration, provide conditions for the feasibility of the planned trajectory. An experimental validation of the planner's behavior is presented with quadrotor vehicles, demonstrating the richness of the planned trajectories. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID RECOGNITION
AB The ability to recognize traffic signs is a critical skill for safe driving, as traffic signs provide drivers with essential information about the road conditions, potential hazards, speed limits, and other important details that can impact their driving. By recognizing and understanding traffic signs, drivers can react quickly and appropriately to different situations on the road, which helps prevent accidents and ensures the safety of all road users. As part of the Robotaxi-Full Scale Autonomous Vehicle Competition, a project was undertaken to develop a traffic sign recognition system using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning model that can detect and classify objects in real-time. The project team trained YOLOv8 on a dataset of traffic sign images to create a model that could accurately recognize and classify different types of traffic signs. This traffic sign recognition system has the potential to significantly improve road safety by helping autonomous vehicles and human drivers to better understand their surroundings and react appropriately to changing road conditions. The system can assist drivers by providing real-time alerts and warnings about potential hazards, speed limits, and other important information. Furthermore, this project demonstrates the power and potential of deep learning and artificial intelligence in improving transportation safety and efficiency. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more innovative applications in the automotive industry that will help improve the driving experience and make our roads safer for everyone.

AB Deep learning techniques have been widely used in autonomous driving community for the purpose of environment perception. Recently, it starts being adopted for learning end-to-end controllers for complex driving scenarios. However, the complexity and nonlinearity of the network architecture limits its interpretability to understand driving scenarios and judge the importance of certain visual regions in sensory scenes. In this paper, based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), we propose two complementary frameworks to automatically determine the most contributive regions of the input scenes, offering intuitive knowledge of how a trained end-to-end autonomous vehicle controller understands driving scenarios. In the first framework, a feature map-based method is proposed by leveraging current progress in CNN visualization, in which the deconvolution approach recovers the feature maps to extract features that contribute most to understand driving scenes. In the second framework, the importance level of regions is ranked using the error map between the labeled and predicted control inputs generated by occluding different parts of input scenes, thus providing a pixel-wise rank of importance. Test data sets with extracted contributive regions are input to the CNN controller. Then, different CNN controllers trained with the new data sets preprocessed using our proposed frameworks are verified via closed-loop tests. Results show that both the features identified from the first framework and the regions identified from the second framework are of crucial importance to scene understanding for the controller and can significantly affect the performance of CNN controllers.

AB Reliable prediction of surround vehicle motion is a critical requirement for path planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for surround vehicle maneuver classification and motion prediction that exploits multiple cues, namely, the estimated motion of vehicles, an understanding of typical motion patterns of freeway traffic and intervehicle interaction. We report our results in terms of maneuver classification accuracy and mean and median absolute error of predicted trajectories against the ground truth for real traffic data collected using vehicle mounted sensors on freeways. An ablative analysis is performed to analyze the relative importance of each cue for trajectory prediction. Additionally, an analysis of execution time for the components of the framework is presented. Finally, we present multiple case studies analyzing the outputs of our model for complex traffic scenarios.

AB In autonomous vehicles, driving in traffic poses significant challenges in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and ranging. Currently interest centers on enhanced V2V communication with multi-sensor and cooperative approaches. In this paper we propose a novel bidirectional Laser Radar Visible Light Bidirectional Communication Boomerang System (LRVLB-ComBo). LRVLB-ComBo affords nuanced real-time two-way V2V communication as a basis for complex but reliable decision making. Our approach involves combining existing automotive laser radar with visible light boomerang systems using THSS techniques. System simulations were performed using a random mix of extraneous interference pulse to evaluate system sensitivity to noise. Results suggest that LRVLB-ComBo is a viable two-way V2V communication system with increased ranging accuracy, enabling provision of detailed bidirectional data exchange for ITS precision, energy efficiency and safety.

TI Gap acceptance study of pedestrians crossing between platooning
   autonomous vehicles in a virtual environment

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating in shared urban environments, often referred to as "pods", will constantly have to interact with pedestrians. As a result, an effective strategy will be required for pods to continue operating, while in close proximity to people. This strategy could be in terms of active negotiation, where a pod identifies a person and gives way; or a more passive strategy, such as requiring pods to travel close together in platoons, in order to reduce the number of individual vehicle encounters. For this latter example, it is critical to understand how the spaces between pods and AVs in general are perceived by pedestrians, and what factors will persuade and dissuade crossing. Therefore, this paper seeks to understand this relationship, and presents results from a pedestrian gap acceptance study for platoons. To ensure the safety of participants, a virtual environment was used instead of real vehicles. The goal of the experiment described in this paper, is to understand the gap acceptance behaviour of participants, when presented with a platoon of pods in different environments. The experiment evaluated four vehicle speeds, from 1 km/h to 16 km/h, four temporal gaps, from 2 s to 5 s, and two environments. These environments were a typical road layout, with footpath and line markings, and a shared space, where all markings and separation between pod and pedestrian were removed. For each scenario, participants were asked if they would cross between the pods and how safe they felt about the situation, recorded as a Likert score. The results suggest that people are more likely to attempt to cross between a platoon of pods when they are travelling closer together in a shared space (no line markings or separation between vehicles and pedestrian), compared to a road environment (separated by raised pavement and road markings). However, it was also found that people's subjective rating of safeness was higher in the road environment, when presented with a platoon of pods, compared to the shared space. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID DUAL-CONSTELLATION
AB The automation of mining haulage vehicles has great potential in terms of safety and economy. The performance of autonomous vehicles depends largely on highly accurate vehicle state information. Deep mines are especially challenging, as satellite-based localization methods are reaching their limits. Therefore, we introduce a new navigation filter concept for the precise and robust localization of the haulage fleet that can handle temporary GNSS interruptions in deep open-pit mines. The multi-sensor navigation filter utilizes an inertial measurement unit and is aided by GNSS. We introduce a new optical speed sensor update within the tightly coupled unscented Kalman filter. The speed sensor measures the slip-free two-dimensional speed above ground. The filter was validated with an articulated dumper in a gravel pit. The new filter achieved a mean position error of 0.24 m during a test drive of 190 s with a simulated GNSS outage of 90 s.

AB The article focuses on two specific case studies - the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rise of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). The former is already being portrayed as a kind of unquestioned default assumption. The latter are being widely promoted to replace standard vehicles driven directly by humans on conventional roads. The article then outlines salient features of the two most dominant Internet giants, Facebook and Google, with two goals in mind. First, to identify ways to improve our understanding their interior human and cultural aspects and second, to use the insights gained to explore what should be done and by whom - an issue addressed in the third and final paper. Taken together this and the previous paper help define a draft agenda that can be critiqued, modified and put to wider use. The overarching goal is not merely to help moderate the present impacts of IT but to evolve strategies that better serve more constructive, humanly valuable ends.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors are commonly used in perception for autonomous vehicles because of their high accuracy, speed, and range. These characteristics make the sensor suitable for integration into the perception layer of controllers which have the capacity to avoid collisions with unpredicted obstacles. The objective of this work was to design a robust and efficient algorithm to acquire useful knowledge from LIDAR scans, and to test its performance in real road situations. The method is based on the construction of an Occupancy Grid based on the Transferable Belief Model, which has proved promising in other studies. Two clear advantages of this method are the reduction of the problem complexity in the phases of segmentation, occlusion detection and tracking, and its ease of integration with other sensors to allow the overall system to evolve towards reliable and complete perception.

SO AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS
LA English
DT Article
DE Underwater vehicles; Biomimetic; GAs; Maneuvering; Control
AB This work presents an approach for maneuvering and controlling a biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV). The BAUV swims forward by oscillating its body and caudal fin. It turns by bending its body and caudal fin toward the intended direction of motion. A body-spline function is specified by a set of parameters. Genetic algorithms are then used to find the values of the parameter by evaluating a fitness function over several swimming trials in a water tank. The fitness function is defined as the ratio of the kinetic energy of the forward motion to the required driving power of the joint motors. A control law that uses the oscillating frequency to control the forward speed, and applies a body-spline offset parameter to control the yawing rate is proposed. Moving averages of swimming speeds and heading angles are utilized as feedback signals to control the forward speed and heading angle of the BAUV. The effectiveness of the control algorithm is experimentally confirmed.

AB Powered two-wheeler (PTW) users are exposed to a high risk of accidents leading to severe injuries and fatalities. The trend of PTW accidents has pointed out the need for an intervention on PTW safety with new and effective solutions. One of the possible answers came from the EC-funded Powered two wheeler Integrated Safety (PISa) project which identified the autonomous braking of the vehicle as one of the most promising safety functions for PTWs.
   The aim of this paper is to report on the design of the decision logic for deploying a PTW autonomous braking system in case of an imminent collision. Rationales and limitations for this pioneering application are given. The feasibility of the autonomous deceleration is demonstrated by an experimental study conducted with the PISa test bike implementing a prototype of the autonomous braking system, named the Active Braking (AB) system.

AB In automatic driving, the recognition of Front-Vehicle taillights plays a key role in predicting the intentions of the vehicle ahead. In order to accurately identify the Front-Vehicle taillights, we first analyze the different characteristics of the vehicle taillight signal, and then propose an improved taillight recognition model based on YOLOv5s. First, CA(coordinate attention) is inserted into the backbone network of YOLOv5s model to improve small target recognition and reduce interference from other light sources; Then, the EIOU Loss is used to solve the class imbalance problem; Finally, EIOU-NMS is used to solve the problem of anchor box error suppression in the recognition process. We use the actual scene video and vehicle taillights dataset to conduct ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of the improved algorithm. The experimental results show that the mAP value of the model is 9.2% higher than YOLOv5s.

AB The use of technology for disaster response and relief in the aftermath of natural disasters is growing. To explore the opportunity afforded by emerging technologies, this work developed an experimental automated emergency response system. Given a set of requests from the field and infrastructure information, a high-level optimization method generates a mission plan for a fleet of autonomous vehicles, including ground vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, and delivery rotorcraft. The mission plan assigns vehicles to a list of functions and locations to be visited. Internet technology integrates the various system elements and provides a unifying environment for the physical and the modeled world in cyberspace. Guidance and control enable the vehicles to autonomously execute their plans. The movements of the fleet vehicles including their dynamic behavior are illustrated in a virtual reality interface. Preliminary experiments with a small fleet of simulated vehicles show the feasibility of such an approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Effective detection of curbs is crucial for the perception and localization of autonomous vehicles, but, in practical applications, complex road scenes and the occlusion of curbs by various obstacles are two difficult problems to deal with. Therefore, this article proposes a fast curb detection and compensation method. First, the multiblock RANSAC method is used for ground segmentation to distinguish between ground points and nonground points. Second, the candidate curb points are obtained by processing the ground points with the jumping-window algorithm associated with multispatial features. The jumping-window algorithm only processes the region of interest, which greatly improves the operation efficiency of the method. Third, a joint filtering method is used to refine the candidate curb points, mainly to remove obstacles and other interfering points contained in the candidate curb points. Finally, the missing part of the curb caused by the obstruction is interpolated by a piecewise cubic spline to compensate for the curb points and improve the continuity. We use the KITTI dataset to evaluate the proposed method, and the obtained precision, recall, and harmonic mean in various road scenarios are all above 80%, which is sufficient to demonstrate the robustness of our method. At the same time, the average processing time of each frame is only 47 ms, which can meet the real-time requirements of automatic driving.

DT Article
ID COOL-ROBOT
AB The National Science Foundation operates stations on the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland to investigate Earth's climate history, life in extreme environments, and the evolution of the cosmos. Understandably, logistics costs predominate budgets due to the remote locations and harsh environments involved. Currently, manual ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys must preceed vehicle travel across polar ice sheets to detect subsurface crevasses or other voids. This exposes the crew to the risks of undetected hazards. We have developed an autonomous rover, Yeti, specifically to conduct GPR surveys across polar ice sheets. It is a simple four-wheel-drive, battery-powered vehicle that executes autonomous surveys via GPS waypoint following. We describe here three recent Yeti deployments, two in Antarctica and one in Greenland. Our key objective was to demonstrate the operational value of a rover to locate subsurface hazards. Yeti operated reliably at 30 degrees C, and it has has good oversnow mobility and adequate GPS accuracy for waypoint-following and hazard georeferencing. It has acquired data on hundreds of crevasse encounters to improve our understanding of heavily crevassed traverse routes and to develop automated crevasse-detection algorithms. Importantly, it helped to locate a previously undetected buried building at the South Pole. Yeti can improve safety by decoupling survey personnel from the consequences of undetected hazards. It also enables higher-quality systematic surveys to improve hazard-detection probabilities, increase assessment confidence, and build datasets to understand the evolution of these regions. Yeti has demonstrated that autonomous vehicles have great potential to improve the safety and efficiency of polar logistics. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Present study consists the overall development aspects of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) such as mechanical design, modelling, software architecture, controllers and navigation in combination with the lake experiments conducted on the vehicle at a shallow depth. AUV prototype in discussion is designated, AUV-150 and is designed to operate at a depth of 150 meters. It is a cylindrical-shaped carrier with streamlined fairing to reduce hydrodynamic drag. It is embedded with active propulsion, navigation, and control systems. Propulsion system comprises thrusters for generating motion in different directions to control surge, sway, heave, pitch, and yaw. Two arrays of cross-fins have also been fixed at the two ends to provide additional stability to the AUV against roll. A lithium polymer battery powers the vehicle and a pressure hull contains its electronics and energy system. Equipped with a camera, CTD and side scan sonar as payload sensors the AUV-150 is perfectly designed for performing underwater terrain mapping as well as oceanographic survey activities. The experimental results obtained from the shallow depth operation are quite satisfactory from the operational point of view.

AB Intelligent visual surveillance for road vehicles is the key to developing autonomous intelligent traffic systems. Recently, traffic incident detection employing computer vision and image processing has attracted much attention. In this paper, a probabilistic model for predicting traffic accidents using three-dimensional (3-D) model-based vehicle tracking is proposed. Sample data including motion trajectories are first obtained by 3-D model-based vehicle tracking. A fuzzy self-organizing neural network algorithm is then applied to learn activity patterns from the sample trajectories. Finally, vehicle activity is predicted by locating and matching each partial trajectory with the learned activity patterns, and the occurrence probability of a traffic accident is determined. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE; LANES
AB Vehicle platoons were recently proposed to reduce energy consumption and emissions. However, the majority of platooning studies have focused on pure connected automated vehicle (CAV) environments with limited insights into energy consumption and emissions. This paper quantifies fuel consumption and emissions by studying the microscopic movements of CAVs and human driving vehicles (HDVs) in mixed traffic flows. With an extended cellular automaton model, a four-lane mixed traffic flow of CAVs and HDVs is investigated in detail. The results have shown that ad hoc platoon formation can lead to frequent acceleration and lane changing, resulting in more fuel consumption and emission. With a dedicated CAV lane (DCL) strategy, the interference of CAVs and HDVs is greatly reduced, thereby improving the fuel economy and emission reduction. The findings can benefit the organization of vehicle platoons in the persisting mixed traffic flow environment.

AB The dynamic, control-oriented model of an underwater glider with independently controllable wings is presented. The onboard vehicle's actuators are a ballast tank and two hydrodynamic wings. A control strategy is proposed to improve the vehicle's maneuverability. In particular, a switching control law, together with a backstepping feedback scheme, is designed to limit the energy-inefficient actions of the ballast tank and hence to enforce efficient maneuvers. The case study considered here is an underwater vehicle with hydrodynamic wings behind its main hull. This unusual structure is motivated by the recently introduced concept of the underwater wave glider, which is a vehicle capable of both surface and underwater navigation. The proposed control strategy is validated via numerical simulations, in which the simulated vehicle has to perform three-dimensional path-following maneuvers.

AB This paper studies the trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We investigate the nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method looking for possible approaches to alleviate the heavy computational burden. Novel distributed NMPC algorithms are developed exploiting the dynamic properties of the AUV motion. By appropriately decomposing the original optimization problems into smaller size subproblems and then solving them in a distributed manner, the expected floating point operations (flops) can be reduced dramatically. We show that the convergence of the AUV trajectory can be guaranteed by the proposed contraction constraints in the decomposed subproblems. Recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability are proved. Taking advantage of the guaranteed stability, a real-time distributed implementation algorithm is further developed to automatically trade off between control performance and computational complexity. Extensive simulation studies on the Falcon AUV model demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel approach to measuring the ground speed of autonomous vehicles using interferometric radar is presented. Using a microwave radar with interferometric processing and a feedforward neural network with local regression, high-accuracy velocity estimation is achieved with a downward-facing radar that, unlike forward-looking Doppler radars, can be protected from road debris and is, furthermore, unaffected by wheel slip and requires no external inputs, such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). A 16.9-GHz active interferometric array generates a grating lobe pattern and as the ground passes through the pattern, the range of frequencies over which the response is distributed increases proportionally with the ground velocity. We implement a feedforward neural network to estimate the velocity based on the interferometer's frequency response. The estimator achieved a root-mean-squared error of 0.138 (m/s), equivalent to that of the forward-looking Doppler radars.

A type of incremental stochastic algorithm known as rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) is merged with a manoeuvre automaton (MA) representation to form the motion planner. The improved planner is not only capable of taking into account the dynamics of the system, but it also allows complex non-linear manoeuvres to be performed. In addition, it is highly computationally efficient. This paper also extends it to take into account dynamic targets. The output trajectory from the planner is then tracked using a kinematic based state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) controller. In other words, by omitting the requirement of a dynamic model of the system, one can extend the application to a more encompassing types of vehicle whilst reducing the number of tuning parameters. Detailed simulation studies are conducted using a non-linear AUTOSUB model to investigate the feasibility of the proposed methods.

AB The growing interest in utilizing autonomous vehicles (AVs) for public transportation is increasingly evident in urban areas, and numerous locations worldwide have set up demonstration sites to test autonomous shuttles (ASs). However, there is a significant necessity to investigate the future traffic operational performance resulting from such services, in addition to the user behavior-based studies conducted during pilot projects. In this paper, an experimental approach is presented using a microsimulation environment to develop the traffic model with dedicated AS lanes. The approach examines different combinations of conventional vehicles (CVs), ASs, AV driving logics, and geometric modifications required to accommodate the AS service. The traffic performance of the network is evaluated using five measures of effectiveness (MoEs) at various market penetration rates (MPRs). The results reveal that the cautious driving behavior poses challenges primarily during the early stages of the MPR, and the same holds true at very high MPRs or if this driving behavior is sustained for an extended period. Thus, it is advisable to transition towards adopting higher driving logics (Normal and Aggressive), which exhibit highly promising results in meeting expectations. The trend of the results clearly indicates that utilizing dedicated lanes for AS buses is a potential option for integrating the emerging mobility solution into the current transportation system. The findings of this study are of significant importance, as they offer valuable quantitative insights that enable key stakeholders to make well-informed decisions on AS deployment.

AB Offloading processes responsible for a robot's control operation to external computational resources has been in the spotlight for many years. The vision of having access to a full cloud cluster for any autonomous robot has fueled many scientific fields. Such implementations rely strongly on a robust communication link between the robot and the cloud and have been tested over numerous network architectures. However, various limitations have been highlighted upon the realization of such platforms. For small-scale local deployments, technologies such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, and blacktooth are inexpensive and easy to use but suffer from low transmit power and outdoor coverage limitations. In this study, the offloading time-critical control operations for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using cellular network technologies were evaluated and demonstrated experimentally, focusing on the 5G technology. The control process was hosted on an edge server that served as a ground control station (GCS). The server performs all the computations required for the autonomous operation of the UAV and sends the action commands back to the UAV over the 5G interface. This research focuses on analyzing the low-latency needs of a closed-loop control system that is put to the test on a real 5G network. Furthermore, practical limitations, integration challenges, the intended cellular architecture, and the corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that correlate to the real-life behavior of the UAV are rigorously studied.

AB The progress of autonomous driving cars is a difficult movement that causes problems regarding safety, ethics, social acceptance, and cybersecurity. Currently, the automotive industry is utilizing these technologies to assist drivers with advanced driver assistance systems. This system helps different functions to careful driving and predict drivers' ability of stable driving behavior and road safety. A great number of researches have shown that the driver's emotion is the major factor that handles the emotions, resulting in serious vehicle collisions. As a result, continuous monitoring of drivers' behavior could assist to evaluate their behavior to prevent accidents. The study proposes a new Squirrel Search Optimization with Deep Learning Enabled Facial Emotion Recognition (SSO-DLFER) technique for Autonomous Vehicle Drivers. The proposed SSO-DLFER technique fo-cuses mainly on the identification of driver facial emotions in the AVs. The proposed SSO-DLFER technique fol-lows two major processes namely face detection and emotion recognition. The RetinaNet model is employed at the initial phase of the face detection process. For emotion recognition, the SSO-DLFER technique applied the Neural Architectural Search (NASNet) Large feature extractor with a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model as a classifier. For improving the emotion recognition performance, the SSO-based hyperparameter tuning procedure is performed. The simulation analysis of the SSO-DLFER technique is tested under benchmark datasets and the experimental outcome was investigated under various aspects. The comparative analysis reported the enhanced performance of the SSO-DLFER algorithm on recent approaches. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on various types of sensor technologies to perceive the environment and to make logical decisions based on the gathered information similar to humans. Under ideal operating conditions, the perception systems (sensors onboard AVs) provide enough information to enable autonomous transportation and mobility. In practice, there are still several challenges that can impede the AV sensors' operability and, in turn, degrade their performance under more realistic conditions that actually occur in the physical world. This paper specifically addresses the effects of different weather conditions (precipitation, fog, lightning, etc.) on the perception systems of AVs. In this work, the most common types of AV sensors and communication modules are included, namely: RADAR, LiDAR, ultrasonic, camera, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS). A comprehensive overview of their physical fundamentals, electromagnetic spectrum, and principle of operation is used to quantify the effects of various weather conditions on the performance of the selected AV sensors. This quantification will lead to several advantages in the simulation world by creating more realistic scenarios and by properly fusing responses from AV sensors in any object identification model used in AVs in the physical world. Moreover, it will assist in selecting the appropriate fading or attenuation models to be used in any X-in-the-loop (XIL, e.g., hardware-in-the-loop, software-in-the-loop, etc.) type of experiments to test and validate the manner AVs perceive the surrounding environment under certain conditions.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is playing a more and more important role in marine scientific research and resource exploration due to its flexibility. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been used to improve the autonomy of AUV. However, it is very time-consuming and even unpractical to define efficient reward functions for DRL to learn control policies in various tasks. In this paper, we implemented the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) algorithm learning from demonstrated trajectories and proposed GA2IL learning from demonstrations and additional human rewards for AUV path following. We evaluated GAIL and our GA2IL method in a straight line following task and a sinusoids curve following task on the Gazebo platform extended to simulated underwater environments with AUV simulator of our lab. Both methods were compared to PPO-a classic traditional deep reinforcement learning from a predefined reward function, and a well-tuned PID controller. In addition, to evaluate the generalization of GAIL and our GA2IL method, we tested the trained control policies of the previous two tasks via GAIL and GA2IL in a new complex comb scan following task and a different sinusoids curve following task respectively. Our simulation results show AUV path following with GA2IL and GAIL can obtain a performance at a similar level to PPO and PID controller in both tasks. Moreover, GA2IL can generalize as well as PPO, adapting better to complex and different tasks than traditional PID controller.

AB The aim of this study is to develop robust guidance laws for the control motion of an underwater autonomous vehicle (UAV) in a three-dimensional (3D) space. The control design is based on the use of Averaged Sub-Gradient (ASG) version of a class of dynamic integral sliding mode (ISM) method being sequentially applied to the subsystems of the complete model realizing, the so-called backstepping (or cascade) approach. The mathematical form of the UAV model induces a backstepping formulation for solving the tracking trajectory problem sequentially for the position, translation velocity, angular velocity and actuators (thrusters) dynamics. The solution of the trajectory tracking problem at each stage implements the ASG-version of the ISM method. This problem is treated as the optimization of a suitable convex (not obligatory strongly convex) cost functional, depending on the tracking error and reaching its minimal value at the origin of the error tracking space. This study shows that the minimization of the proposed functional leads to the optimal tracking regime under the presence of uncertainties in the mathematical model description. A numerical example proves the effectiveness of the suggested robust dynamic controller. The comparison between the obtained trajectory tracking results and the outcomes produced by a set of standard proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers, is presented. The proposed controller exhibits a better tracking of the reference trajectory compared with the PID version, showing a smaller mean square estimation for the tracking error.

AB This work follow the verification as planning paradigm and propose to use model-checking techniques to solve planning and goal reasoning problems for autonomous systems with high-degree of assurance. It presents a novel modelling framework - Goal Task Network (GTN) that encompass both goal reasoning and planning under a unified formal description that enables the use of assurance tools. The paper provides a systematic method that highlights how an industrial model checker (PAT) can be used to solve goal reasoning and planning problems modelled by GTNs. Further, this paper also introduces the design of an automated system framework for Goal Reasoning And Verification for Independent Trusted Autonomous Systems (GRAVITAS). The proposed framework is demonstrated in an experiment that simulates a survey mission performed by the REMUS-100 autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB In this article, we develop a novel composite adaptive control system for the dive-plane maneuvers and parameter identification of a multi-input multi-output submarine model. The composite adaptive control system consists of (1) an input-output feedback linearizing control law and (2) an identifier formed by gradient algorithm-based two-parameter estimation laws. Unlike the existing adaptive systems for autonomous underwater vehicles and submarines, a novelty of this composite identifier lies in the use of regressor matrix integral feedback for enhancement in parameter excitation. By the Lyapunov analysis, asymptotic convergence of the depth and pitch angle tracking errors is established. Simulation results show precise depth and pitch angle control, estimation of all model parameters, and robustness to random and sinusoidal disturbance inputs.

AB Connected/autonomous electric vehicles (C/AEVs) have the potential to provide safe, efficient, and low-carbon-emission transportation solutions. Proper and efficient management of the C/AEV lithium-ion battery (LIB) system is key to guaranteeing that all benefits associated with C/AEVs are achieved. This requires that the design and control of LIBs be informed by the C/AEV system operation. This article first demonstrates that C/AEV operation is distinct from human-driven electric vehicle operation, thus necessitating the development of application-specific testing protocols to properly characterize and model their LIBs. Laboratory-prone synthetic duty cycles are generated from C/AEV driving data, enabling a design of experiments representing a wide range of C/AEV driving modes and LIB system sizes. We share data collected from 31 LIB cells undergoing the synthetic cycling experiments. This paper provides the academic community with an application-specific C/AEV LIB dataset for the design and calibration of data-driven battery models for real-time control and operation.

ID VARIABLE BUOYANCY
AB There are several compelling reasons for exploring the ocean, for instance, the potential for accessing valuable resources, such as energy and minerals; establishing sovereignty; and addressing environmental issues. As a result, the scientific community has increasingly focused on the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for ocean exploration. Recent research has demonstrated that buoyancy change modules can greatly enhance the energy efficiency of these vehicles. However, the literature is scarce regarding the dynamic models of the vertical motion of buoyancy change modules. It is therefore difficult to develop adequate depth controllers, as this is a very complex task to perform in situ. The focus of this paper is to develop simplified linear models for a buoyancy change module that was previously designed by the authors. These models are experimentally identified and used to fine-tune depth controllers. Experimental results demonstrate that the controllers perform well, achieving a virtual zero steady-state error with satisfactory dynamic characteristics.

AB Self-driving vehicles are currently being developed in major industries for mass public deployment. Their benefits are attractive, and there is interest in having them on the streets as quickly as possible. Delegating responsibility to the cars has far-reaching impacts. As accidents will be unavoidable, the self-driving car will be asked to make life and death decisions that will impact human lives. However, the impact of machine decision making on the overall acceptance of self-driving cars in society is far from sufficiently addressed. The research presented here investigates three factors, i.e., technology, self-safety, and utilitarianism, and hypothesizes their link to self-driving car acceptance. Survey-collected data is statistically analyzed to assess the proposed hypotheses. The empirical outcome of this work shows that the three investigated factors contribute to the societal acceptance of self-driving cars, with technology being the major contributor while the ethical aspects (self-safety and utilitarianism) follow.

AB This study analyzes the potential benefits and drawbacks of taxi sharing using agent-based modeling. New York City (NYC) taxis are examined as a case study to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of ride sharing using both traditional taxis (with shifts) and shared autonomous taxis. Compared to existing studies analyzing ride sharing using NYC taxi data, our contributions are that (1) we proposed a model that incorporates individual heterogeneous preferences; (2) we compared traditional taxis to autonomous taxis; and (3) we examined the spatial change of service coverage due to ride sharing. Our results show that switching from traditional taxis to shared autonomous taxis can potentially reduce the fleet size by 59% while maintaining the service level and without significant increase in wait time for the riders. The benefit of ride sharing is significant with increased occupancy rate (from 1.2 to 3), decreased total travel distance (up to 55%), and reduced carbon emissions (up to 866 metric tonnes per day). Dynamic ride sharing, wich allows shared trips to be formed among many groups of riders, up to the taxi capacity, increases system flexibility. Constraining the sharing to be only between two groups limits the sharing participation to be at the 50-75% level. However, the reduced fleet from ride sharing and autonomous driving may cause taxis to focus on areas of higher demands and lower the service levels in the suburban regions of the city.

AB In this article, the drag characteristics of an underwater vehicle propelled by a synthetic jet (SJ) is numerically studied. The underwater vehicle studied is REMUS Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The cruising speed studied is up to 10 knots. The actuation parameters of the SJ actuator are the same under different cruising speeds. When the SJ actuator works, the drag of the vehicle changes periodically. The SJ-induced additional pressure drag increases with increasing cruising speed. The additional friction force is negligible. The thrust of the actuator decreases with increasing cruising speed. The thrust outputted by the SJ actuator when used for underwater vehicle propulsion is smaller than the thrust of an isolated actuator. The mathematical model of the additional drag, the model of the thrust, and the velocity distribution is given to assist the analysis in this article.

First, the longitudinal design was studied which includes the spacing policy as the upper level controller and throttle and brake control as the lower level controller. A safety spacing policy was proposed considering both the vehicle states and the vehicle capability. A coordinated throttle and brake controller was also designed to ensure the vehicle pursuing the desired acceleration. Second, a multimodel lateral controller was proposed which can perform the lane tracking and lane changing manoeuvres. Then, an integrated control structure was proposed to manage both the longitudinal and lateral controller. Finally, simulation and visualization works were carried out to validate the proposed solutions. An electric vehicle experiment platform was also built, and field tests showed encouraging results.

AB This paper introduces a method to extract driving behaviors from a human expert driver which are applied to an autonomous agent to reproduce proactive driving behaviors. Deep learning techniques were used to extract latent features from the collected data. Extracted features were clustered into behaviors and used to create velocity profiles allowing an autonomous driving agent could drive in a human-like manner. By using proactive driving behaviors, the agent could limit potential sources of discomfort such as jerk and uncomfortable velocities. Additionally, we proposed a method to compare trajectories where not only the geometric similarity is considered, but also velocity, acceleration and jerk. Experimental results in a simulator implemented in ROS show that the autonomous agent built with the driving behaviors was capable of driving similarly to expert human drivers.

TI Autonomous airborne refueling of unmanned air vehicles using the global
   positioning system
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous airborne refueling requires that the position of the receiving aircraft relative to the tanker be known very accurately and in real time. To meet this need, highly precise carrier-phase differential global positioning system solutions are being considered as the basis for navigation. However, the tanker introduces severe sky blockage into the autonomous airborne refueling mission, which reduces the number of visible global positioning system satellites and hence degrades the positioning accuracy. In this paper, we analyze the autonomous airborne refueling navigation problem in detail, define an optimal navigation architecture, and quantify navigation system availability. As part of this work, a high-fidelity dynamic sky-blockage model is developed and used to plan autonomous airborne refueling flight tests. The flight tests were conducted to obtain time-tagged global positioning system and attitude data that were processed offline to validate the blockage model.

AB The research field of autonomous self-driving vehicles has recently become increasingly popular. In addition, motion-planning technology is essential for autonomous vehicles because it mitigates the prevailing on-road obstacles. Herein, a deep-learning-network-based architecture that was integrated with VGG16 and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) was applied for lane-following on roads. The normalized input image was fed to the three-layer VGG16 output layer as a pattern and the GRU output layer as the last layer. Next, the processed data were fed to the two fully connected layers, with a dropout layer added in between each layer. Afterward, to evaluate the deep-learning-network-based model, the steering angle and speed from the control task were predicted as output parameters. Experiments were conducted using the a dataset from the Udacity simulator and a real dataset. The results show that the proposed framework remarkably predicted steering angles in different directions. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieved higher mean square errors of 0.0230 and 0.0936 and and inference times of 3-4 and 3 ms. We also implemented our proposed framework on the NVIDIA Jetson embedded platform (Jetson Nano 4 GB) and compared it with the GPU's computational time. The results revealed that the embedded system took 45-46 s to execute a single epoch in order to predict the steering angle. The results show that the proposed framework generates fruitful and accurate motion planning for lane-following in autonomous driving.

AB We extend existing oceanographic sampling methodologies to sample an advecting feature of interest using autonomous robotic platforms. GPS-tracked Lagrangian drifters are used to tag and track a water patch of interest with position updates provided periodically to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for surveys around the drifter as it moves with ocean currents. Autonomous sampling methods currently rely on geographic waypoint track-line surveys that are suitable for static or slowly changing features. When studying dynamic, rapidly evolving oceanographic features, such methods at best introduce error through insufficient spatial and temporal resolution, and at worst, completely miss the spatial and temporal domain of interest. We demonstrate two approaches for tracking and sampling of advecting oceanographic features. The first relies on extending static-plan AUV surveys (the current state-of-the-art) to sample advecting features. The second approach involves planning of surveys in the drifter or patch frame of reference. We derive a quantitative envelope on patch speeds that can be tracked autonomously by AUVs and drifters and show results from a multi-day off-shore field trial. The results from the trial demonstrate the applicability of our approach to long-term tracking and sampling of advecting features. Additionally, we analyze the data from the trial to identify the sources of error that affect the quality of the surveys carried out. Our work presents the first set of experiments to autonomously observe advecting oceanographic features in the open ocean.

AB We present an introspective failure prediction approach for autonomous vehicles. In autonomous driving, complex or unknown scenarios can cause a disengagement of the self-driving system. Disengagements can be triggered either by automatic safety measures or by human intervention. We propose to use recorded disengagement sequences from test drives as training data to learn to predict future failures. The system then learns introspectively from its own previous mistakes. In order to predict failures as early as possible, we propose a machine learning approach where sequences of sensor data are classified as either failure or success. The car itself is treated as a black box. Our method combines two sensor modalities that contain different types of information. An image-based model learns to detect generally challenging situations such as crowded intersections accurately multiple seconds in advance. A state data based model allows to detect fast changes immediately before a failure, such as sudden braking or swerving. The outcome of the individual models is fused by averaging the individual failure probabilities. We evaluate our approach on a data set provided by the BMW Group containing 14 hours of autonomous driving. The proposed late fusion approach allows for predicting failures at an accuracy of more than 85% seven seconds in advance, at a false positive rate of 20%. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art failure prediction by more than 15% while being a flexible framework that allows for straightforward addition of further sensor modalities.

AB In this paper, a novel autonomous tracking control (ATC) of intelligent electric vehicles (IEVs) based on lane detection and sliding-mode control (SMC) is innovatively developed to implement accurate path tracking and optimal torque distribution between the motors of IEVs. Initially, the road image was captured by the camera and was processed to extract the lane markings and to calculate the desired steering angle by the lateral trajectory tracking error and the head tracking error. Then, to accurately track the desired path, an optimal preview linear quadratic regulator (OP_LQR) based on SMC approach with 2-DOF vehicle model was proposed. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed OP_LQR scheme, the marking recognition analysis and the optimization results of the traditional three controllers are obtained and compared. Results show that the lane marking identification algorithm has high accuracy. Moreover, the actual path with the proposed method can better track the desired trajectory and appropriate differential braking torques are allocated into four wheels. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nowadays, intelligent systems applied to vehicles have grown very rapidly; their goal is not only the improvement of safety, but also making autonomous driving possible. Many of these intelligent systems are based on making use of computer vision in order to know the environment and act accordingly. It is of great importance to be able to estimate the pose of the vision system because the measurement matching between the perception system (pixels) and the vehicle environment (meters) depends on the relative position between the perception system and the environment. A new method of camera pose estimation for stereo systems is presented in this paper, whose main contribution regarding the state of the art on the subject is the estimation of the pitch angle without being affected by the roll angle. The validation of the self-calibration method is accomplished by comparing it with relevant methods of camera pose estimation, where a synthetic sequence is used in order to measure the continuous error with a ground truth. This validation is enriched by the experimental results of the method in real traffic environments.

DE AU V; Teams; Cooperation; vehicle
AB STARFISH AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) are a group of open architecture vehicles with high degree of modularity and well defined mechanical, electrical, and software interfaces. This enables the baseline AUV configuration to be simple and low in cost, while allowing its capabilities to be extended with various specialized modules depending on the need. Various AUVs can easily be configured in different ways to form a team of heterogeneous AUVs tailored to a specific mission. STARFISH AUVs employ a flexible Command and Control (C2) architecture that is capable of adapting to various configurations of AUVs. The vehicle command is loosely based on the C2 hierarchy in submarines, with software agents such as Captain, Executive Officer, Navigator, etc interacting to each other to control the AUV's behaviors. Numerous field trials have been conducted in open waters. Results from some of these trials are presented in this paper to illustrate the capability of deploying a heterogeneous team of cooperative AUVs. Specifically, the mission illustrated shows how a single AUV with high positioning accuracy can be used to reduce the positioning error of one or more AUVs with poorer navigational sensors.

AB The Defense Applied Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Learning Applied to Ground Vehicles (LAGR) program aims to develop algorithms for autonomous vehicle navigation that learn how to operate in complex terrain. Over many years, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a reference model control system architecture called 4D/RCS that has been applied to many kinds of robot control, including autonomous vehicle control. For the LAGR program, NIST has embedded learning into a 4D/RCS controller to enable the small robot used in the program to learn to navigate through a range of terrain types. The vehicle learns in several ways. These include learning by example, learning by experience, and learning how to optimize traversal. Learning takes place in the sensory processing, world modeling, and behavior generation parts of the control system. The 4D/RCS architecture is explained in the paper, its application to LAGR is described, and the learning algorithms are discussed. Results are shown of the performance of the NIST control system on independently-conducted tests. Further work on the system and its learning capabilities is discussed.

AB Featured Application High definition (HD) map, advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs), localization, iterative closest point (ICP), automated driving vehicle. This paper presents high definition (HD) map-based localization using advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) environment sensors for application to automated driving vehicles. A variety of autonomous driving technologies are being developed using expensive and high-performance sensors, but limitations exist due to several practical issues. In respect of the application of autonomous driving cars in the near future, it is necessary to ensure autonomous driving performance by effectively utilizing sensors that are already installed for ADAS purposes. Additionally, the most common localization algorithm, which is usually used lane information only, has a highly unstable disadvantage in the absence of that information. Therefore, it is essential to ensure localization performance with other road features such as guardrails when there are no lane markings. In this study, we would like to propose a localization algorithm that could be implemented in the near future by using low-cost sensors and HD maps. The proposed localization algorithm consists of several sections: environment feature representation with low-cost sensors, digital map analysis and application, position correction based on map-matching, designated validation gates, and extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based localization filtering and fusion. Lane information is detected by monocular vision in front of the vehicle. A guardrail is perceived by radar by distinguishing low-speed object measurements and by accumulating several steps to extract wall features. These lane and guardrail information are able to correct the host vehicle position by using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The rigid transformation between the digital high definition map (HD map) and environment features is calculated through ICP matching. Each corrected vehicle position by map-matching is selected and merged based on EKF with double updating. The proposed algorithm was verified through simulation based on actual driving log data.

AB There have been plenty of segment-based real-time safety analyses for expressways or freeways. In these analyses, it was considered that the occurrence of a crash is because of segment conditions, including traffic and geometric. However, the movement of a vehicle is continuous from upstream to downstream. Thus, the crash occurrence of a vehicle might also be because of the traffic conditions along its trajectory. Under this idea, the study on the quasi-vehicle-trajectorybased real-time safety for expressways is proposed. It is hard to directly obtain the trajectory data of the vehicle involved in a crash. Thus, the crash-related vehicle's trajectory is derived from other traffic data sources, and it is called quasi-trajectory. To find vehicles' quasi-trajectories, the exact crash time was first identified by observing significant speed drops, and then, the vehicle locations for every one minute was distinguished by using the data from HERE, which provides space-mean speed information. The traffic information along the quasi-trajectories is from the Microwave Vehicle Detection System. A Bayesian matched-case-control logistic regression model was built to explore the impact of traffic parameters along the vehicle quasi-trajectory on real-time crash risk. The results showed that the segment speed difference and segment volume difference along the vehicle quasi-trajectory in the 0-4 min interval before crash occurrence all had a significant positive impact on crash risk. Meanwhile, the truck volume difference and average segment speed in the 0-1 min interval before crashes also have a positive impact on real-time crash likelihood. This study is new in real-time safety analysis and the findings have the potential to be applied to improve the safety of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). A CAV continuously collects the traffic information along with its trajectory and could calculate the crash risk. When the hazardous traffic condition happens, actions can be taken by CAV to prevent the crash occurrence.

TI Shore Construction Detection by Automotive Radar for the Needs of

SO ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION

ID ALGORITHM; SYSTEM
AB Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are becoming more and more popular for performing hydrographic and navigational tasks. One of the key aspects of autonomous navigation is the need to avoid collisions with other objects, including shore structures. During a mission, an ASV should be able to automatically detect obstacles and perform suitable maneuvers. This situation also arises in near-coastal areas, where shore structures like berths or moored vessels can be encountered. On the other hand, detection of coastal structures may also be helpful for berthing operations. An ASV can be launched and moored automatically only if it can detect obstacles in its vicinity. One commonly used method for target detection by ASVs involves the use of laser rangefinders. The main disadvantage of this approach is that such systems perform poorly in conditions with bad visibility, such as in fog or heavy rain. Therefore, alternative methods need to be sought. An innovative approach to this task is presented in this paper, which describes the use of automotive three-dimensional radar on a floating platform. The goal of the study was to assess target detection possibilities based on a comparison with photogrammetric images obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The scenarios considered focused on analyzing the possibility of detecting shore structures like berths, wooden jetties, and small houses, as well as natural objects like trees or other kinds of vegetation. The recording from the radar was integrated into a single complex radar image of shore targets. It was then compared with an orthophotomap prepared from AUV camera pictures, as well as with a map based on traditional land surveys. The possibility and accuracy of detection for various types of shore structure were statistically assessed. The results show good potential for the proposed approach-in general, objects can be detected using the radar-although there is a need for development of further signal processing algorithms.

AB High-speed autonomous emergency collision avoidance for intelligent vehicles is a challenging task. Many existing studies have not considered the effect of the road adhesion coefficient in the vehicle high-speed collision avoidance planning layer. Additionally, in lateral control, the effect of strong coupling of vehicle motion on the system model is not considered. This effect increases the uncertainty in the collision avoidance process and correlates with driving safety. In this regard, this article conducted relevant studies. First, a distributed drive electric vehicle (DDEV) with controlled longitudinal speed was selected as the research platform and derived the transformed square-root cubature Kalman filter (T-SCKF) algorithm with cubature point sampling rule transformation to estimate the road adhesion coefficient. Second, the road adhesion coefficient information was used to calibrate the following vehicle safety distance model, and the lane change collision avoidance lateral acceleration information was used to determine the vehicle autonomous emergency collision avoidance trajectory and to optimize the planning decision of the vehicle collision avoidance process. Last, the DDEV was laterally controlled to complete the tracking of the high-speed emergency collision avoidance trajectory by the adaptive model predictive control (adaptive MPC) method with real-time updating of the system model. The relevant validation shows that the T-SCKF algorithm proposed in this article can effectively estimate the road adhesion coefficient. The tracking control of the high-speed collision avoidance trajectory by the adaptive MPC method has better tracking accuracy and stability than traditional MPC and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) methods.

ID MOTION ESTIMATION
AB The realization of vision-based, autonomous flight for micro air vehicles presents numerous technical challenges in diverse fields such as image processing, trajectory planning, control theory, and microhardware design. This paper explores one aspect of the overall problem: robust, real-time estimation of aircraft states from a set of tracked feature. points. This vision-based approach is realized via an implementation of the implicit extended Kalman filter, a variation of the classical Kalman filter that allows for nonlinear dynamic models and updates from measurements that are implicit functions of the state variables.The epipolar constraint, which is a geometric relationship between the feature point position vectors and the camera translation vector, is employed in this paper as the implicit measurement in the Kalman filter. In order for the vison-based Kalman filter to provide reliable state estimation, it must, be robust with respect to modeling errors in the dynamic propagator. This is especially true because the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a micro air vehicle are frequently not known to a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the algorithm must be robust with respect to noise in the measured feature point positions in the image plane. This paper explores both of these robustness issues using results from a micro air vehicle simulation model developed at the NASA Langley Research Center. In particular, a hierarchy of dynamic models ranging from a random walk model to a high-fidelity nonlinear micro air vehicle model, is employed in the Kalman filter for a simulated micro air vehicle trajectory with varying levels of measurement noise. It is demonstrated that the vision-based measurement updates in the filter are capable of compensating for significant modeling errors and filter initialization errors. As would be expected, superior overall results are achieved using higher-fidelity dynamic models in the Kalman filter. The work presented in this paper represents the first step toward the ultimate objective of incorporating vision-based state estimation into the design of autonomous flight control systems for micro air vehicles operating in urban environments.

AB The deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer is an ecologically important feature of the open ocean. The DCM cannot be observed using aerial or satellite remote sensing; thus, in situ observations are essential. Further, understanding the responses of microbes to the environmental processes driving their metabolism and interactions requires observing in a reference frame that moves with a plankton population drifting in ocean currents, i.e., Lagrangian. Here, we report the development and application of a system of coordinated robots for studying planktonic biological communities drifting within the ocean. The presented Lagrangian system uses three coordinated autonomous robotic platforms. The focal platform consists of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) fitted with a robotic water sampler. This platform localizes and drifts within a DCM community, periodically acquiring samples while continuously monitoring the local environment. The second platform is an AUV equipped with environmental sensing and acoustic tracking capabilities. This platform characterizes environmental conditions by tracking the focal platform and vertically profiling in its vicinity. The third platform is an autonomous surface vehicle equipped with satellite communications and subsea acoustic tracking capabilities. While also acoustically tracking the focal platform, this vehicle serves as a communication relay that connects the subsea robot to human operators, thereby providing situational awareness and enabling intervention if needed. Deployed in the North Pacific Ocean within the core of a cyclonic eddy, this coordinated system autonomously captured fundamental characteristics of the in situ DCM microbial community in a manner not possible previously.

AB Apart from their ecological value, the world's oceans are among the planet's most valuable resources, a rich source of food and wealth and in urgent need of protection. This article describes BUSCAMOS-RobObs, a robot-based observatory, consisting of an autonomous solar-powered marine robot with specialized sensing systems designed to carry out long-term observation missions in the inland sea of the Mar Menor in southeastern Spain. This highly specialised device is unique because it has the capacity to anchor itself to the seabed and become a buoy, either to take measurements at specific points or to recharge its batteries. It thus avoids drifting and possible accidents in the buoy mode, especially near the coast, and resumes monitoring tasks when the required energy levels are reached. The robot is equipped with a broad range of sensors, including side scan sonar, sub-bottom sonar, laser systems, ultrasound sonar, depth meters, a multi-parametric probe and a GPS, which can collect georeferenced oceanic data. Although various types of autonomous vehicles have been described in the literature, they all have limited autonomy (even in the long term) as regards operational time and covering the seabed. The article describes a permanent monitoring mission in the Mar Menor, with a combination of solar energy and a decision-making strategy as regards the optimum route to be followed. The energy and mission simulation results, as well as an account of actual monitoring missions are also included.

AB Autonomous systems are becoming ubiquitous and gaining momentum within the marine sector. Since the electrification of transport is happening simultaneously, autonomous marine vessels can reduce environmental impact, lower costs, and increase efficiency. Although close monitoring is still required to ensure safety, the ultimate goal is full autonomy. One major milestone is to develop a control system that is versatile enough to handle any weather and encounter that is also robust and reliable. Additionally, the control system must adhere to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) for successful interaction with human sailors. Since the COLREGs were written for the human mind to interpret, they are written in ambiguous prose and therefore not machine-readable or verifiable. Due to these challenges and the wide variety of situations to be tackled, classical model-based approaches prove complicated to implement and computationally heavy. Within machine learning (ML), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential for a wide range of applications. The model-free and self-learning properties of DRL make it a promising candidate for autonomous vessels. In this work, a subset of the COLREGs is incorporated into a DRL-based path following and obstacle avoidance system using collision risk theory. The resulting autonomous agent dynamically interpolates between path following and COLREG-compliant collision avoidance in the training scenario, isolated encounter situations, and AIS-based simulations of real-world scenarios.

The overall duty is analysed and proper suggestions are developed to organise the operation cycle in view of regulatory schemes, most likely, soon issued by Authorities for development sustainability rules. The manipulation architecture appears to be central requirement for the effectiveness of any feasible fixture and the main characteristics of the purposely selected solution are shortly summarised. For the related overseeing arrangement, the project moves from an analysis of prototypal fixtures, already built and tested in the USA and EU, and looks about opportunities in standardising subsets of vehicles devices to simplify the fuelling tasks.

AB In recent years, great efforts have been devoted to deep imitation learning for autonomous driving control, where raw sensory inputs are directly mapped to control actions. However, navigating through densely populated intersections remains a challenging task due to uncertainty caused by uncertain traffic participants. We focus on autonomous navigation at crowded intersections that require interaction with pedestrians. A multi-task conditional imitation learning framework is proposed to adapt both lateral and longitudinal control tasks for safe and efficient interaction. A new benchmark called IntersectNav is developed and human demonstrations are provided. Empirical results show that the proposed method can achieve a success rate gain of up to 30% compared to the state-of-the-art.

AB This paper describes how decentralized control theory can be used to analyze the control of multiple cooperative robotic vehicles. Models of cooperation are discussed and related to the input/output reachability, structural observability, and controllability of the entire system. Whereas decentralized control research in the past has concentrated on using decentralized controllers to partition complex physically interconnected systems, this work uses decentralized methods to connect otherwise independent nontouching robotic vehicles so that they behave in a stable, coordinated fashion. A vector Liapunov method is used to prove stability of two examples: the controlled motion of multiple vehicles along a line and the controlled motion of multiple vehicles in formation. Also presented are three applications of this theory: controlling a formation, guarding a perimeter, and surrounding a facility.

AB It has been almost half a century since the first interest in autonomous robots was shown, and research is still continuing to improve their ability to make perfectly conscious decisions from a user safety point of view. These autonomous robots are now at a fairly advanced level, which means that their adoption rate in social environments is also increasing. This article reviews the current state of development of this technology and highlights the evolution of interest in it. We analyze and discuss specific areas of its use, for example, its functionality and current level of development. Finally, challenges related to the current level of research and new methods that are still being developed for the wider adoption of these autonomous robots are highlighted.

AB Due to recent advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), freeway traffic control (FTC) has become a trendy area of research. Combining CAVs and control measures has opened more efficient traffic flow possibilities. However, while there is extensive research on how traffic control and CAVs can enhance traffic flow performance, their safety benefits should be evaluated more comprehensively. It is challenging to distinguish their contributions to traffic flow safety. Studies on the safety of CAVs in traffic flow indicate that traffic flow safety improves with higher market penetration rates (MPR) of CAVs. However, this finding only sometimes aligns with the traffic flow performance effects of CAVs on freeways. This paper introduces a framework for assessing the safety effects of FTC strategies in mixed traffic scenarios involving human-driven vehicles and CAVs. The proposed framework is tested through a microsimulation-based case study in Istanbul, Turkey. The results show that, despite varying MPRs, the safety effects of CAVs and FTC methods do not consistently reduce the number of conflicts in the traffic flow context.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology is expected to play a massive role in road infrastructure design in the United States. While some states are leading CAV testing and implementation efforts, most states follow a wait-and-watch approach. However, to fully utilize CAV technology, each state must first understand its current capabilities related to CAV and, more broadly, to transportation systems management and operations (TSMO). The TSMO/CAV Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Framework, published by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) in 2017, provides a set of guidelines to agencies across the country for assessing and advancing the agencies' CAV and TSMO capabilities. However, no case studies on its implementation are currently available. This paper summarizes the implementation of the self-assessment of the capabilities of the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities across the U.S. DOT's six prescribed dimensions. The authors believe that this paper is one of the first documents to summarize an agency's TSMO/CAV CMM process.

AB Increasing endurance is a major challenge for battery-powered aerial vehicles. A method is presented which makes use of an updraft around obstacles to decrease the power consumption of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle. A soaring flight controller has been developed that can autonomously soar while the unmanned aerial vehicle keeps its relative position to that of a moving object. Multiple simulations have been performed to analyse the limitations of the soaring controller under different conditions. The effect of a change in wind velocity and updraft has been analysed. The simulations showed that an increase in updraft decreases the energy consumption of the flight controller. An increase in wind velocity results in a higher updraft requirement, while a decrease in the wind velocity requires less updraft. The simulations achieved sustained flight at 0% throttle. The controller has been validated experimentally using the updraft generated by a moving ship. The practical, autonomous tests reduced the average throttle down to 4.5% in front of a ship. The method presented in this study achieved successful hovering flight using an energy control module for longitudinal positioning.

AB Virtual reality (VR) has proven to be a useful tool for conducting human factors research in interface design. With the development and promotion of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, researchers are focusing on designing different types of interfaces to induce trust in road users toward this new technology. In this article, VR is used to investigate pedestrians' understanding of proposed designs for external features on AVs. We are also interested in investigating how the presence of an operator inside the vehicle influences pedestrians' preference for features. VR headset tracking, survey-based responses, and video-recorded body movements are used to collect data on pedestrian responses to three operator statuses and seven feature types. Pedestrians prefer both "walk" in text and verbal message saying safe to cross as clear and comforting features on an AV. They perceive the distracted operator condition as to be an inconvenient situation even for the AV equipped with visual or audible features. Older people find the features more helpful and people with higher innovativeness rate the feature ideas with higher ratings.

AB In this paper, we propose a generalized algorithm that converts traffic composed of vehicles located randomly in a set of lanes into sorted traffic in which vehicles are moved into the lane corresponding to their destination group. Focus is placed on the cooperative behavior of vehicles. The proposed algorithm architecture divides the entire scenario into various independent sections (called frames) that can be processed in parallel at the same time. Processing each frame involves solving an optimization procedure of a nonlinear programming problem reducible to a linear programming problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulator. Results are obtained and presented for average sorting distance required for sorting all vehicles in the scenario for different traffic settings.

AB This paper presents a non-cooperative vehicle-to-vehicle trajectory-planning algorithm with consideration of the characteristics of different drivers. The driver-vehicle model considering vehicle dynamics and characteristics of the drivers is used to formulate a vehicle-to-vehicle encountering system. A non-cooperative control algorithm considering each of the driver-vehicle system as a player is employed to plan collision-free trajectories for the encountering vehicles with respective initial driving intentions. The non-cooperative problem is solved with the theory of Nash equilibrium and is ultimately converted to a standard nonlinear Model Predictive Control problem. Simulations are conducted in the scenarios of the lane-exchanging and overtaking with different initial vehicle speeds to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the algorithm can accomplish the trajectory-planning task with consideration of both the safety requirement and the characteristics of drivers. The simulation results also show that the proposed algorithm has effectiveness for trajectory planning in different vehicle-to-vehicle encountering scenarios.

AB Introduced autonomous and connected vehicles equipped with emerging technologies are expected to change the automotive market. In this study, using stated preference (SP) data collected from choice experiments conducted in Korea with a mixed multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model (MDCEV), we analyzed how the advent of next-generation of vehicles with advanced vehicle technologies would affect consumer vehicle choices and usage patterns. Additionally, ex-ante market simulations and market segmentation analyses were conducted to provide specific management strategies for next-generation vehicles. The results showed that consumer preference structures of conventional and alternative fuel types primarily differed depending on whether they were drivers or non-drivers. Additionally, although the introduction of electric vehicles to the automobile market is expected to negatively affect the choice probability and mileage of other vehicles, it could have a positive influence on the probability of purchasing an existing conventional vehicle if advanced vehicle technologies are available.

AB The problem of redundancy resolution and motion coordination between the vehicle and the manipulator in underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMSs) is addressed in this paper. UVMSs usually possess more degree of freedom than those required to perform end-effector tasks; therefore, they are redundant system and kinematic control techniques can be applied aimed at achieving additional control objectives besides tracking of the end-effector trajectory. In this paper, a task-priority inverse kinematics approach to redundancy resolution is merged with a fuzzy technique to manage the vehicle-arm coordination. The fuzzy technique is used both to distribute the motion between vehicle and manipulator and to handle multiple secondary tasks. A numerical case study is developed to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed technique. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The advancement of autonomous driving technology has had a significant impact on both transportation networks and people's lives. Connected and automated vehicles as well as the surrounding driving environment are increasingly exchanging information. The traditional open road test or closed field test, which has large costs, lengthy durations, and few diverse test scenarios, cannot satisfy the autonomous driving system's need for reliable and safe testing. Functional testing is the emphasis of the test since features such as frontal collision and traffic sign warning influence driving safety. As a result, simulation testing will undoubtedly emerge as a new technique for unmanned vehicle testing. A crucial aspect of simulation testing is the creation of test scenarios. With an emphasis on the map generating method and the dynamic scenario production method in the test scenarios, this article explains many scenarios and scenario construction techniques utilized in the process of self-driving car testing. A thorough analysis of the state of relevant research is conducted, and approaches for creating common scenarios as well as brand-new methods based on machine learning are emphasized.

AB This paper presents the development and hardware implementation of an autonomous battery maintenance mechatronic system that significantly extends the operational time of battery powered small-scaled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A simultaneous change and charge approach is used to overcome the significant downtime experienced by existing charge-only approaches. The automated system quickly swaps a depleted battery of a UAV with a replenished one while simultaneously recharging several other batteries. This results in a battery maintenance system with low UAV downtime, arbitrarily extensible operation time, and a compact footprint. Hence, the system can enable multi-agent UAV missions that require persistent presence. This capability is illustrated by developing and testing in flight a centralized autonomous planning and learning algorithm that incorporates a probabilistic health model dependent on vehicle battery health that is updated during the mission, and replans to improve the performance based on the improved model. Flight test results are presented for a 3-h-long persistent mission with three UAVs that each has an endurance of 8-10 min on a single battery charge (more than 100 battery swaps).

AB Dynamically charged vehicles suffer from power loss during wireless power transfer due to receiver and transmitter coil misalignment while driving. Autonomous, dynamically charged vehicles can maximize wireless power transfer by minimizing the misalignment, but the repeated high-precision driving increases road wear. To avoid unnecessary road wear and rutting, a noise shaping filter is proposed that adds variability to a vehicle's trajectory that complies with passenger acceleration and position constraints. However, introducing variability into an optimal charging path also risks depleting battery life prior to destination arrival. Therefore, a path planner is proposed that guarantees average charge within a specified probability and ensures rider comfort while reducing road wear.

AB In this paper, some generalizations of the problem of formation of a group of autonomous mobile agents under nonlinear cyclic pursuit is studied. Cyclic pursuit is a simple distributed control law, in which the agent i pursues agent i + 1 modulo n. Each agent is subjected to a nonholonomic constraint. A necessary condition for equilibrium formation to occur among a group of agents with different speeds and different controller gains is obtained. These results generalize equal speed and equal controller gain results available in the literature. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Novel numerical methods for analyzing robust peak-to-peak performance of heterogeneous vehicle platoons are presented. The goal is to compute worst-case spacing error peaks in terms of platoon heterogeneity, communication delays, disturbances and uncertainties in the vehicle dynamics. First, a convex set of parametric linear vehicle models is employed to analyze the effect of platoon heterogeneity. Then, a data-driven uncertainty modeling algorithm is developed that computes the least conservative spacing error bound for a given disturbance model class. The methods are demonstrated on three platoon controllers. One of them is a new constant spacing controller receiving control information from both the platoon leader and the immediate preceding vehicle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SLAM
AB This paper presents a precise and robust localization framework for autonomous vehicles. In contrast to simultaneous localization and mapping, localization and mapping in our method are separate (i.e., first mapping and then localization within this map). The map used in this paper is a 3-D occupancymap that is generated from a stitched point cloud. For localization, a hybrid filtering framework is proposed to match the live data with the prior map. In the upper layer, odometer data, IMU data, and the mapmatching result are fused by a cubature Kalman filter, which will limit the predictive pose within a reasonable bound. In the lower layer, the map matching problem is converted into a point set registration problem that is solved using a particle filter, which will make the matching result robust to local minima. This hybrid scheme makes localization more robust to convergence to a local minimum, which is often encountered in the localization task for autonomous vehicles. This method can also guarantee decimeter-level precision in industrial environments. Experiments demonstrate the validity of this method and also show that it outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.

AB The connectivity aspect of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) is beneficial because it facilitates dissemination of traffic-related information to vehicles through Vehicle-to-External (V2X) communication. Onboard sensing equipment including LiDAR and camera can reasonably characterize the traffic environment in the immediate locality of the CAV. However, their performance is limited by their sensor range (SR). On the other hand, longer-range information is helpful for characterizing imminent conditions downstream. By contemporaneously coalescing the shortand long-range information, the CAV can construct comprehensively its surrounding environment and thereby facilitate informed, safe, and effective movement planning in the shortterm (local decisions including lane change) and long-term (route choice). Current literature provides useful information on CAV control approaches that use only local information sensed from the proximate traffic environment but relatively little guidance on how to fuse this information with that obtained from downstream sources and from different time stamps, and how to use the fused information to enhance CAV movements. In this paper, we describe a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach that integrates the data collected through sensing and connectivity capabilities from other vehicles located in the proximity of the CAV and from those located further downstream, and we use the fused data to guide lane changing, a specific context of CAV operations. In addition, recognizing the importance of the connectivity range (CR) to the performance of not only the algorithm but also of the vehicle in the actual driving environment, the study carried out a case study. The case study demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithm and duly identifies the appropriate CR for each level of prevailing traffic density. It is expected that implementation of the algorithm in CAVs can enhance the safety and mobility associated with CAV driving operations. From a general perspective, its implementation can provide guidance to connectivity equipment manufacturers and CAV operators, regarding the default CR settings for CAVs or the recommended CR setting in a given traffic environment.

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; driver modeling; adaptive cruise control; model
   predictive control
AB Autonomous vehicles are gaining increased attention but surveys have shown that a large percentage of people are wary of adopting the new technology. One possible explanation for the hesitancy is that the occupant would not be comfortable with the driving style as a result of the control models and their parameters as set by the manufacture. Comfort level is subjective in nature and therefore varies between individuals. To combat this issue, autonomous vehicles must be able to adapt to the driving style preference of the user. If we assume drivers are more comfortable with their own driving style, we can choose to have the vehicle learn and incorporate the driver's style into the control models. However, there is still no widely accepted "best" model. One modelmay prove to better represent a particular driver than other models though a driver may choose unsafe driving conditions, the replication of which should not take precedence over the safety of the occupant. In this paper, we propose a multimodel approach to find the best driver model for describing an individual's longitudinal driving style on highway. A method for extracting the indicators of an individual's driving style is proposed first. Then, a multimodel-based evaluation method is described in detail. Chandler, Herman,& Montroll, General Motors Nonlinear, Tampere, Addison & Low, Optimal Velocity Model, and Neural Network models are trained and compared in this paper. The model with the best performance in replicating driving style is further coupled with a model predictive controller to include safety constraints for safer driving. Finally, the proposed multimodel approach is tested with driving data collected from five different drivers. The test results show that our multimodel-based approach is showing advantage over a single model approach in imitating an individual's longitudinal driving style.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); peak detection; thin phytoplankton
   layer; water sample acquisition
AB Thin layers of phytoplankton have an important impact on coastal ocean ecology. The high spatial and temporal variability of such layers makes autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) ideal for their study. At the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI, Moss Landing, CA), the authors have used an AUV for obtaining repeated high-resolution surveys of thin layers in Monterey Bay, CA. The AUV is equipped with ten "gulpers" that can capture water samples when some feature is detected. In this paper, the authors present an adaptive triggering method for an AUV to capture water samples at chlorophyll fluorescence peaks in a thin layer. The algorithm keeps track of the fluorescence background level and the peaks' baseline in real time to ensure that detection is tuned to the ambient conditions. The algorithm crosschecks for concurrent high values of optical backscattering to ensure that sampling targets true particle peaks and not simply physiologically controlled fluorescence peaks. To let the AUV capture the thin layer's peak without delay, the algorithm takes advantage of the vehicle's sawtooth (i.e., yo-yo) trajectory: in one yo-yo cycle, the vehicle makes two crossings of the thin layer. On the first crossing, the vehicle detects the layer's fluorescence peak and saves the peak height; on the second crossing, as the fluorescence measurement reaches the saved peak height (plus meeting additional timing and depth conditions), a sampling is triggered. Based on the thin layer's vertical position in the vehicle's yo-yo profiles, the algorithm selects the pair of detection and triggering crossings so as to minimize the spacing between them. We use the algorithm to postprocess a data set of 20 AUV missions in the 2005 Layered Organization in the Coastal Ocean (LOCO) Experiment in Monterey Bay, CA, and compare its performance with that of a threshold triggering method. In October 2009, the presented method was field tested in an AUV mission in northern Monterey Bay, CA.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles provide water column observations of phytoplankton biomass using chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorometers. However, under high incident light, phytoplankton fluorescence yield decreases in a process known as non-photochemical quenching, resulting in a reduced Chl a fluorescence signal. Methods have been developed to identify and remove the quenched signal from observations by autonomous underwater vehicles. These existing methods rely on assumptions of the homogeneity of the system, both in terms of time (i.e., between day and night observations) and space (i.e., within the water column or between neighboring profiles). These assumptions are not valid in shallow shelf seas or when sampling across different water masses. Thus, we evaluate six new quenching correction methods based on an existing ocean-based method, but adapted for a continental shelf sea environment where the water mass changes between night and day observations. We have included two main changes to the existing method. First, we interpolate the unquenched, nighttime signal across the daytime observations and use this as a reference for correcting the quenched, daytime signal. Second, we explore the inclusion of a fluorescence quenching depth limit. By interpolating nighttime observations across daytime periods, the diel changes in non-photochemical quenching were separated from the phytoplankton population changes. The proposed methods all show improved performance compared to existing approach. The methods presented here, and the approach used to evaluate them, are applicable in other shelf sea environments, enabling studies using autonomous Chl a fluorescence data across shelf sea ecosystems.

TI Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles: An Ant Colony

DE Ant colony optimization; autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); path

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Path planning is a critical issue to ensure the safety and reliability of the autonomous navigation system of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Due to the nonlinearity and constraint issues, existing algorithms perform unsatisfactorily or even cannot find a feasible solution when facing large-scale problem spaces. This paper improves the path planning of AUVs in terms of both the path planning model and the optimization algorithm. The proposed model is comprehensive, which aggregates the length, energy consumption, and collision risk into the objective function and incorporates the steering window constraint. Based on the model, we develop a nature-inspired ant colony optimization algorithm to search the optimal path. Our algorithm is named alarm pheromone-assisted ant colony system (AP-ACS), since it incorporates the alarm pheromone in addition to the traditional guiding pheromone. The alarm pheromone alerts the ants to infeasible areas, which saves invalid search efforts and, thus, improves the search efficiency. Meanwhile, three heuristic measures are specifically designed to provide additional knowledge to the ants for path planning. In the experiments, different from the previous works that are tested on synthetic instances only, we implement an interface to retrieve the practical underwater environment data. AP-ACS and the compared algorithms are thus tested on several practical environments of different scales. The experimental results show that AP-ACS can effectively handle the constraints and outperforms the other algorithms in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and stability.

AB This paper, deals with a path planning and intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle which should move safely in its road partially structured. This road, involves a number of obstacles like donkey, traffic lights and other vehicles. In this paper, the Neural Networks (NN)-based technique Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is described to solve the motion planning problem in Unmanned Vehicle (UV) control. This is accomplished by choosing the appropriate inputs/outputs and by carefully training the ANN. The network is supplied with distances of the closest obstacles around the vehicle to imitate what a human driver would see. The output is the acceleration and steering of the vehicle. The network has been trained with a set of strategic input-output. The results show the effectiveness of the technique used, the UV drives around avoiding obstacles.

AB This paper is concerned with the cooperative path maneuvering of multiple underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) moving along a parameterized path. Each vehicle is subject to uncertain kinematics and unknown kinetics induced by model uncertainty and ocean disturbances. A modular adaptive control method is presented to develop the cooperative controller such that a queue formation along the parameterized path can be achieved. First, two identification modules are developed such that the uncertain kinematics and unknown kinetics can be estimated by an adaptive term and echo state networks, respectively. Next, a cooperative path maneuvering controller module is designed based on a line-of-sight guidance scheme, tracking differentiators, and a path variable containment approach. The path variable containment approach is used to guarantee that the ASVs are evenly spaced between two virtual leaders moving along the path. Finally, the stability of the identification-controller pair is analyzed. Comparative studies are performed to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.

DE Automotive networks; deep learning; intrusion detection; threat analysis
AB With the rapid development of Internet of vehicles, connected vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and autonomous driving technologies, automotive Controller Area Networks (CAN) have suffered from numerous security threats. Deep learning models are the current mainstream intrusion detection techniques for threat analysis, and the state-of-the-art intrusion detection technique introduces the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model to generate usable attacked samples to supplement the training samples, but it exists the limitations of rough CAN message block construction and fails to detect the data tampering threat. Based on the CAN communication matrix defined by the automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for a vehicle model, we propose an enhanced deep learning GAN model with elaborate CAN message blocks and the enhanced GAN discriminator. The elaborate CAN message blocks in the training samples can precisely reflect the real generated CAN message blocks in the detection phase. The GAN discriminator can detect whether each message has suffered from the data tampering threat. Experimental results illustrate that the enhanced deep learning GAN model has higher detection accuracy, recall, and F1 scores than the state-of-the-art deep learning GAN model under various attacks and threats.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) offer significant advantages in terms of traffic and fuel efficiency, accident prevention, and reduced travel time. 'Sense-plan-act' cycle of the AV has been designed and implemented to achieve a high level of active safety that considerably reduces the risk to passengers and pedestrians. However, within existing path planning and tracking algorithms, the subject of passenger comfort has received less attention compared to other AV topics. This paper is aimed at characterizing vehicle handling criteria and path profiles configuration in order to identify self-driving requirements for passenger comfort. The emphasis is given to the efficacy and usability of the classical handling analysis methods from a self-driving perspective. To these aims, we initially establish a framework which is defined by comfortable path profiles and a versatile handling model of an AV. Then, we introduce a directional path tracking unit which optimally implements AV's trajectories using a controller and a speed regulator. The path tracking unit includes a multi-objective optimizer enabling improvement the handling behavior of the AV. The integration of the proposed methodology into the state-of-the-art AVs' control system can lead to an enhanced comfort level.

AB This paper addresses the problem of goal-directed robot path planning in the presence of uncertainties that are induced by bounded environmental disturbances and actuation errors. The offline infinite-horizon optimal plan is locally updated by online finite-horizon adaptive replanning upon observation of unexpected events (e.g., detection of unanticipated obstacles). The underlying theory is developed as an extension of a grid-based path planning algorithm, called nu*, which was formulated in the framework of probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA) and language measure from a control-theoretic perspective. The proposed concept has been validated on a simulation test bed that is constructed upon a model of typical autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of uncertainties.

AB This paper addresses the problem of decentralized position and velocity estimation in formations of autonomous vehicles. A limited number of vehicles in the formation have access to absolute position measurements, while the rest must rely on range measurements to neighboring agents, local sensor data, and limited communication capabilities to estimate their own position and velocity. The contribution is threefold: (i) a method for designing local state observers for each agent in the formation that rely only on locally available information is presented; (ii) the stability of the continuous-time linear time-varying Kalman filter subject to exponentially decaying perturbations in some variables is studied; and (iii) the stability of the error dynamics of the resulting decentralized state observer is analyzed for acyclic formations with fixed topologies, and it is shown that the error converges exponentially fast to the origin for all initial conditions. Simulation results are presented and discussed to validate the proposed solution, as well as assessing its performance under the influence of measurement noise.

AB The paper studies computation models for tasks performed by autonomous mobile robots. Such tasks can be accomplished by reactive control algorithms. Reactive control systems can be described using different models of computation which have as distinguishing feature the abstraction level of time. Thus, three computation models are defined: the untimed model, the synchronous model and the timed model. It is shown that the clocked-synchronous model of computation is more appropriate for describing the controller for a parallel parking task. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent development of autonomous vehicle (AV) provides new travel opportunities for citizens, and traditional vehicles (TVs) will still be used for a long time. Therefore, it is highly possible that both AVs and TVs will be used as travel modes in a city. In a transportation system with both AVs and TVs, the traffic pattern is worthy of studying. This paper investigates user equilibrium traffic pattern based on the traditional bottleneck model considering AVs and TVs. For both TVs and AVs, travel costs include queuing delay and schedule delay. However, they also have different components of travel costs; more specifically, for AVs, passengers have to pay r a riding fare, and, for TVs, travelers encounter a walking time cost after parking their cars. For different combinations of travel demands and riding fare of AVs, analytical solutions of three different user equilibrium traffic patterns are obtained. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the analytical models. Sensitivity analyses are examined to show the impacts of AVs time-dependent fee and trip-based fixed fee on the traffic pattern and travel costs.

TI Persistent Sampling of Vertically Migrating Biological Layers by an

   Echosounder
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); biological layers; echosounder;
   Environmental Sample Processor (ESP); sampling; Wave Glider
AB Many pelagic animals, such as krill, lanternfish, and cephalopods, migrate to deep water at dawn to avoid visual predators during daylight hours and move up toward the sea surface at dusk to search for food. This behavior is termed "diel vertical migration." Migrating animals graze on phytoplankton or zooplankton and in turn serve as food for higher trophic levels, hence providing a key mechanism for carbon export via this migration. These animals are often observed as sound-scattering layers by echosounders, but the animals causing the acoustic scattering are difficult to identify using acoustics alone. In a spring 2019 experiment in Monterey Bay, we deployed autonomous underwater and surface vehicles over a seabed-mounted upward-looking echosounder to collect environmental DNA (eDNA) with the goal of identifying the vertically migrating animals. The echosounder was installed at 890-m depth on the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) seabed cabled ocean observatory, providing realtime data of acoustic backscatter from the full water column. One long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (LRAUV) carrying a Third-Generation Environmental Sample Processor (3G-ESP) acquired water samples from a sequence of layers from near surface down to similar to 290 m as directed by the distribution of animals observed by the echosounder. During the sampling of each layer, the LRAUV ran on a tight circular yo-yo trajectory directly above the echosounder, remaining in its beam by acoustically tracking a station-keeping Wave Glider on the sea surface marking the echosounder's latitude and longitude. The persistent and simultaneous acoustic observation and eDNA acquisition enables identification of animals at precise locations to better understand their vertical migration behaviors. We present the methods and the system performance in the experiment.

AB With the development of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and autonomous driving technologies, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) enable to absorb surrounding information to enhance economic driving. This study proposes a dynamic inverse hierarchical optimization method, which incorporates traffic-signal phase and timing as well as road data, to plan economic velocity and improve PHEV energy consumption. The hierarchical control framework determines the desired speed and arrival time in the upper layer using the shortest path faster al-gorithm. The lower level accounts for multi-objective velocity planning based on particle swarm optimization and Pareto theory. The inverse layering method solves the economic velocity optimization problem. With the support of V2X and autonomous driving technologies, the method enhances energy efficiency and computational efficiency in PHEVs through dynamic inverse hierarchical optimization. Simulation results highlight that the proposed algorithm leads to 7.43% improvement in energy consumption economy and the reduced calculation time, compared to the existing solutions. The hardware-in-the-loop experiments validate the real-time applica-bility of the proposed algorithm.

AB Harmful algal blooms (HABs) cause harm to human health or hinder sustainable use of the marine environment in Blue Economy sectors. HABs are temporally and spatially variable and hence their mitigation is closely linked to effective early warning. The European Union (EU) Interreg Atlantic Area project "PRIMROSE", Predicting Risk and Impact of Harmful Events on the Aquaculture Sector, was focused on the joint development of HAB early warning systems in different regions along the European Atlantic Area. Advancement of the existing HAB forecasting systems requires development of forecasting tools, improvements in data flow and processing, but also additional data inputs to assess the distribution of HAB species, especially in areas away from national monitoring stations, usually located near aquaculture sites. In this contribution, we review different novel technologies for acquiring HAB data and report on the experience gained in several novel local data collection exercises performed during the project. Demonstrations include the deployment of autonomous imaging flow cytometry (IFC) sensors near two aquaculture areas: a mooring in the Daoulas estuary in the Bay of Brest and pumping from a bay in the Shetland Islands to an inland IFC; and several drone deployments, both of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and of Autonomous Surface vehicles (ASVs). Additionally, we have reviewed sampling approaches potentially relevant for HAB early warning including protocols for opportunistic water sampling by coastguard agencies. Experiences in the determination of marine biotoxins in non-traditional vectors and how they could complement standard routine HAB monitoring are also considered.

AB Cellular Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V) communications take autonomous driving technology to the next level by allowing a Vehicular User Equipment (V-UE) to receive Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) from other V-UEs, and enable the V-UE to see beyond what is detectable by vision-based sensors, thereby preventing accidents and ensuring user safety. However, there remains a fundamental limitation in the conventional CAM broadcasting since a transmitter (TX) V-UE cannot confirm whether its CAM is successfully received at other V-UEs. Without a feedback process, a significant uncertainty arises in CAM reception, posing a critical threat to user safety. To address this threat, we propose Beyond-Vision, an effective C-V2V on-demand relay system that allows CAMs that are not well received at nearby V-UEs to be better received. Through simulation that reflects realistic vehicle mobility and road environments in urban scenarios, we verify the superiority of Beyond-Vision over the conventional C-V2V, which improves performance by up to 215% in terms of message reception ratio (MRR) within a communication range under Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) channels.

ID MULTIROBOT COORDINATION
AB In this paper, we present a contract-based, decentralized planning approach for a team of autonomous unmanned surface vehicles (USV) to patrol and guard an asset in an environment with hostile boats and civilian traffic. The USVs in the team have to cooperatively deal with the uncertainty about which boats pose an actual threat and distribute themselves around the asset to optimize their guarding opportunities. The developed planner incorporates a contract-based algorithm for allocating tasks to the USVs through forward simulating the mission and assigning estimated utilities to candidate task allocation plans. The task allocation process uses a form of marginal cost-based contracting that allows decentralized, cooperative task negotiation among neighboring agents. The task allocation plans are realized through a corresponding set of low-level behaviors. In this paper, we demonstrate the planner using two mission scenarios. However, the planner is general enough to be used for a variety of scenarios with mission-specific tasks and behaviors. We provide detailed analysis of simulation results and discuss the impact of communication interruptions, unreliable sensor data, and simulation inaccuracies on the performance of the planner.

AB In transportation, LiDAR has been primarily used in autonomous vehicles to assist self-driving until recently when people realized it could also be installed at the roadside to support connected vehicles and infrastructure systems. Unlike onboard LiDAR sensors used in autonomous vehicles, roadside applications must perform complete background filtering and clustering as well as tracking real-time traffic movements within the detection zone. This paper presents an unsupervised clustering method for roadside or infrastructure-based LiDAR applications. It first converts 3D LiDAR data points into 2D so that only target points (after background filtering) will be saved in the channel-azimuth 2D structure; then, a method combining the region growing algorithm and counted component labeling is used to perform clustering. Lastly, a merging process is conducted to enhance the connected component labeling method for better outcomes. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed method could reach 0.011s per frame (10 Hz sensor rotation frequency) in clustering while maintaining high accuracy.

AB Interest in autonomous driving (AD) and intelligent vehicles (IVs) is growing at a rapid pace due to the convenience, safety, and economic benefits. Although a number of surveys have reviewed research achievements in this field, they are still limited in specific tasks and lack systematic summaries and research directions in the future. Our work is divided into three independent articles and the first part is a survey of surveys (SoS) for total technologies of AD and IVs that involves the history, summarizes the milestones, and provides the perspectives, ethics, and future research directions. This is the second part (Part 1 for this technical survey) to review the development of control, computing system design, communication, high-definition map (HD map), testing, and human behaviors in IVs. In addition, the third part (Part 2 for this technical survey) is to review the perception and planning sections. The objective of this article is to involve all the sections of AD, summarize the latest technical milestones, and guide abecedarians to quickly understand the development of AD and IVs. Combining the SoS and Part 2, we anticipate that this work will bring novel and diverse insights to researchers and abecedarians, and serve as a bridge between past and future.

AB The rapid development of autonomous vehicles (AV) in recent years has drawn the attention of numerous countries in terms of its feasibility for use and deployment as individually-owned vehicles or for large-scale fleet planning and deployment as a mobility-on-demand (MOD) service. Singapore is no exception to this global trend and in her pursuit to be smart and car-lite, numerous efforts are made to have AV trials in place and test out their potential deployment in the city state. As one of the many prerequisites of AV planning, public perception on AV plays a vital role when designing any potential AV deployment scheme. As such, a stated preference survey comprising both online survey and field interviews/surveys, was performed island-wide to understand how commuters in Singapore perceive about different AV-based MOD modes. The logit kernel model is adopted to determine how different preference attributes and key demographic indicators can affect the use of AV-based MOD services over other existing first- and last-mile connection modes. The model results have identified how demographics such as gender, age, housing type, education level and income level can influence the travel mode choice. Also, the impacts brought by individuals' stated preferences over convenience, privacy and familiarity of ride-hailing apps are also investigated. Such findings can provide useful insight in planning future car-lite towns and implementing AV-based MOD services in these towns.

AB Robust and performing navigation systems for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) play a discriminant role towards the success of complex underwater missions involving one or more AUVs. The quality of the filtering algorithm for the estimation of the AUV navigation state strongly affects the performance of the overall system. In this paper, the authors present a comparison between the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach, classically used in the field of underwater robotics and an Unscented. Kalman Filter (UKF). The comparison results to be significant as the two strategies of filtering are based on the same process and sensors models. The UKF-based approach, here adapted to the AUV case, demonstrates to be a good trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational load. UKF has not yet been extensively used in practical underwater applications, even if it turns out to be quite promising. The proposed results rely on the data acquired during a sea mission performed by one of the two Typhoon class vehicles involved in the NATO CommsNetl3 experiment (held in September 2013). As ground truth for performance evaluation and comparison, performed offline, position measurements obtained through Ultra-Short Base Line (USBL) fixes are used. The result analysis leads to identify both the strategies as effective for the purpose of being included in the control loop of an AUV. The UKF approach demonstrates higher performance encouraging its implementation as a more suitable navigation algorithm even if, up to now, it is still not used much in this field.

   via IP (NTRIP); Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM);
   real-time kinematic (RTK); relative positioning;
   vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I); vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
AB This paper provides a three-layered framework to monitor the positioning performance requirements of real-time relative positioning (RRP) systems of the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems that support cooperative collision warning (CCW) applications. These applications exploit state data of surrounding vehicles obtained solely from the Global Positioning System (GPS) and dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) units without using other sensors. To this end, this paper argues the need for the GPS/DSRC-based RRP systems to have an autonomous monitoring mechanism, since the operation of CCW applications is meant to augment safety on roads. The advantages of autonomous integrity monitoring are essential and integral to any safety-of-life system. The autonomous integrity monitoring framework proposed necessitates the RRP systems to detect/predict the unavailability of their subsystems and of the integrity monitoring module itself and, if available, to account for effects of data link delays and breakages of DSRC links, as well as of faulty measurement sources of GPS and/or integrated augmentation positioning systems, before the information used for safety warnings/alarms becomes unavailable, unreliable, inaccurate, ormisleading. Hence, a monitoring framework using a tight integration and correlation approach is proposed for instantaneous reliability assessment of the RRP systems. Ultimately, using the proposed framework, the RRP systems will provide timely alerts to users when the RRP solutions cannot be trusted or used for the intended operation.

DE Reinforcement learning; Deep learning; Human inspired meta-heuristics;
   Decision making; Autonomous vehicles
AB The complexity of taking decisions for an autonomous vehicle (AV) to avoid road accident fatalities, provide safety, comfort, and reduce traffic raises the need for improvements in the field of decision making. To solve these challenges, many algorithms and techniques were applied, and the most common ones were reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms combined with deep learning techniques. Therefore, in this paper we proposed a novel extension of the popular "SARSA" (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) RL technique called "Harmonic SK Deep SARSA" that takes advantage of the stability which SARSA algorithm provides and uses the notion of similar and cumulative states saved in an alternative memory to enhance the stability of the algorithm and achieve remarkable performance that SARSA could not accomplish due to its on policy nature. Through the investigation of our novel extension the adaptability of the algorithm to unexpected situations during learning and to unforeseen changes in the environment was proved while reducing the computational load in the learning process and increasing the convergence rate that plays a key role in upgrading decision making application that require numerous real time consecutive decisions, including autonomous vehicles, industrial robots, gaming, aerial navigation... The novel algorithm was tested in a gym environment simulator called "Highway-env" with multiple highway situations (multiple lanes configurations, highway with dynamic number of lanes (from 4-lane to 2-lane, from 4-lane to 6-lane), merge) with numerous dynamic obstacles. For the purpose of comparison, we used a benchmark of cutting edge algorithms known for their prominent performance. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm outperformed the comparison algorithms in learning stability and performance that were validated by the following metrics: average loss value per episode, average accuracy per episode, maximum speed value reached per episode, average speed per episode, and the total reward per episode.

AB This paper presents the results of a Carbon Footprint (CF) study of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and their environmental impact on the transportation network. By assuming that fully AVs are battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with connectivity, light detection and ranging sensors, this study measures the environmental impact at the urban mobility level. The AV complete life cycle impact was firstly evaluated. Next, by comparing the current situation with a future hypothetical scenario (100% AVs penetration), the positive environmental effect of the adoption of AVs on a real road network (city of Rome) is shown. For this scope, a traffic simulation-based approach was used to investigate the effects of AVs on the network congestion.
   The results show that the full AVs penetration scenario leads to an improvement in the network performances in terms of travel time and average speed. The Total Time Spent (TTS) decreases ( 35% for intra-urban roads and 21% for highways), and the average network speed increases (48% for infra-urban road and 37% for highways). Moreover, the final amount of Vehicle Kilometer Traveled (VKT) shows an 8% increase on longer extra urban routes, due to the higher capacity impact of AVs on highways, with a consequent load reduction for infra-urban shortcutting routes. In terms of life cycle impacts, AVs are characterized by the highest Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions related to construction, maintenance and end-of-life processes (on average 35% compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, 22% compared to hybrid electric vehicles and 5% compared to battery electric vehicles). Nevertheless, a 100% AVs penetration scenario generates a reduction of the environmental impact at the mobility system level of about 60%.

AB This paper develops a distributed cooperative control logic to determine conflict-free trajectories for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in signal-free intersections. The cooperative trajectory planning problem is formulated as vehicle-level mixed-integer non-linear programs (MINLPs) that aim to minimize travel time of each vehicle and their speed variations, while avoiding near-crash conditions. To push vehicle-level solutions towards global optimality, we develop a coordination scheme between CAVs on conflicting movements. The coordination scheme shares vehicle states (i.e., location) over a prediction horizon and incorporates such information in CAVs' respective MINLPs. Therefore, the CAVs will reach consensus through an iterative process and select conflict-free trajectories that minimize their travel time. The numerical experiments quantify the effects of the proposed methodology on traffic safety and performance measures in an intersection. The results show that the proposed distributed coordinated framework converges to near-optimal CAV trajectories with no conflicts in the intersection neighborhood. While the solutions are found in real-time, the comparison to a central intersection control logic for CAVs indicates a maximum marginal objective value of 2.30%. Furthermore, the maximum marginal travel time, throughput, and average speed do not exceed 0.5%, 0.1%, and 0.5%, respectively. The proposed control logic reduced travel time by 43.0-70.5%, and increased throughput and average speed respectively by 0.8-115.6% and 59.1-400.0% compared to an optimized actuated signal control, while eliminating all near-crash conditions.

AB This paper presents a method for the generation of trajectories for autonomous system operations. The proposed method is based on the use of Bernstein polynomial approximations to transcribe infinite dimensional optimization problems into nonlinear programming problems. These, in turn, can be solved using off-the-shelf optimization solvers. The main motivation for this approach is that Bernstein polynomials possess favorable geometric properties and yield computationally efficient algorithms that enable a trajectory planner to efficiently evaluate and enforce constraints along the vehicles' trajectories, including maximum speed and angular rates as well as minimum distance between trajectories and between the vehicles and obstacles. By virtue of these properties and algorithms, feasibility and safety constraints typically imposed on autonomous vehicle operations can be enforced and guaranteed independently of the order of the polynomials. To support the use of the proposed method we introduce BeBOT (Bernstein/Bezier Optimal Trajectories), an open-source toolbox that implements the operations and algorithms for Bernstein polynomials. We show that BeBOT can be used to efficiently generate feasible and collision-free trajectories for single and multiple vehicles, and can be deployed for real-time safety critical applications in complex environments.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicles; feedforward compensation; adaptive fuzzy
   control; depth control; dead zone
AB This article presents a computed-torque controller plus adaptive fuzzy trajectory feedforward compensator suitable for the trajectory tracking control of uncertain underwater vehicle. To address the issue of unavailable normalization factor, an adaptive fuzzy trajectory feedforward compensator is proposed and assembled at the input trajectory level of the computed-torque controller rather than at the joint drive torque position. The compensator serving as a low-pass filter is implemented outside the inner control loop by adjusting the desired characteristic depth. Due to the nearly unchanged internal control algorithm, the adaptive fuzzy compensator is feasible to implement and is robust when varying the feedback gain in the inner control loop. Moreover, an adaptive dead zone fuzzy compensator is designed to reduce the effect of the dead zone on the actuators of underwater vehicles according to the unknown input dead zone characteristics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, simulations are conducted for a desired characteristic depth, and the performance of the proposed controller has been compared with conventional controllers to illustrate the usefulness and efficiency of the proposed controller.

AB In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the current progress of visual-inertial (VI) navigation systems and sensor fusion research with a particular focus on small unmanned aerial vehicles, known as microaerial vehicles (MAVs). Such fusion has become very topical due to the complementary characteristics of the two sensing modalities. We discuss the pros and cons of the most widely implemented VI systems against the navigational and maneuvering capabilities of MAVs. Considering the issue of optimum data fusion from multiple heterogeneous sensors, we examine the potential of the most widely used advanced state estimation techniques (both linear and nonlinear as well as Bayesian and non-Bayesian) against various MAV design considerations. Finally, we highlight several research opportunities and potential challenges associated with each technique.
   Note to Practitioners-Robotic aircraft have been widely implemented to improve safety, efficiency, and productivity (e.g., agriculture, law enforcement, building inspections, and so on). As a part of its autonomous navigation system, this review aims to address several aspects of VI navigation systems both from data fusion and technological perspectives.

DE Autonomous vehicles; speed profile; RRT; motion planning
AB In the autonomous navigation of intelligent vehicles, collision avoidance is essential for driving safety. Similar to the driving preference of human, the driving path and speed can be determined separately. This paper is concerned with speed profile optimisation problem for dynamic obstacle avoidance given the reference path. The optimisation consists of smoothness, risk, and efficiency terms with obstacle constraints. For task formulation, thes-tmotion space is constructed to describe the motion of the ego vehicle and obstacles. Then the high-dimensional trajectory space is mapped to the low-dimensionals-tspace for computational efficiency. The speed optimisation problem is transformed into a path searching problem considering collision avoidance and searching efficiency. RRT-based algorithm is proposed to search for the optimal speed profile in thes-tspace asymptotically. In each searching step, node extension strategy is designed for the space exploring efficiency; then the tree structure is locally refined for asymptotic optimisation. The optimal speed profile is generated after the searching process converges and the speed profile is planned periodically. For performance evaluation, simulation tests in typical traffic conditions are conducted based on the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) platform. Results show the effectiveness and efficiency of this method.

AB This paper proposes a new hybrid robust control method for control of an autonomous underwater vehicle. Fractional sliding mode control (FSMC) is robust against external disturbances. The main drawback of the FSMC method is creating a chattering phenomenon. Therefore, a compound control method is applied, which benefits in both robustness of the FSMC method and chattering elimination by the new control algorithm. A random noise is applied in order to verify the robustness of the proposed control method. The stability of FSMC and proposed compound control method has been verified by Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is compared with FSMC, which numerical simulation results confirm the best performance of the proposed control method.

As such, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the fields that have significantly adopted the CPS approach to improving people's lives in smart cities by reducing energy consumption and air pollution. Therefore, autonomous vehicle-cyber physical systems (AV-CPSs) have attracted enormous investments from major corporations and are projected to be widely used. However, AV-CPS is vulnerable to cyber and physical threat vectors due to the deep integration of information technology (IT), including cloud computing, with the communication process. Cloud computing is critical in providing the scalable infrastructure required for real-time data processing, storage, and analysis in AV-CPS, allowing these systems to work seamlessly in smart cities. CPS components such as sensors and control systems through network infrastructure are particularly vulnerable to cyber-attacks targeted by attackers using the communication system. This paper proposes an intelligent intrusion detection system (IIDS) for AV-CPS using transfer learning to identify cyberattacks launched against connected physical components of AVs through a network infrastructure. First, AV-CPS was developed by implementing the controller area network (CAN) and integrating it into the AV simulation model. Second, the dataset was generated from the AV-CPS. The collected dataset was then preprocessed to be trained and tested via pre-trained CNNs. Third, eight pre-trained networks were implemented, namely, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, ShuffleNet, MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, SqueezeNet, and AlexNet. The performance of the implemented models was evaluated. According to the experimental evaluation results, GoogLeNet outperformed all other pre-rained networks, scoring an F1- score of 99.47%.

AB This paper is focused on design of dive maneuvers that can be performed outdoors on flapping wing air vehicles (FWAVs) with a minimal amount of on-board computing capability. We present a simple computational model that provides accuracy of 5 m in open loop operation mode for outdoor dives under wind speeds of up to 3 m/s. This model is executed using a low power, on-board processor. We have also demonstrated that the platform can independently execute roll control through tail positioning, and dive control through wing positioning to produce safe dive behaviors. These capabilities were used to successfully demonstrate autonomous dive maneuvers on the Robo Raven platform developed at the University of Maryland.

AB In this paper, we provide a new approach for intelligent traffic transportation in the intelligent vehicular networks, which aims at collecting the vehicles' locations, trajectories and other key driving parameters for the time-critical autonomous driving's requirement. The key of our method is a multi-vehicle tracking framework in the traffic monitoring scenario. . Our proposed framework is composed of three modules: multi-vehicle detection, multi-vehicle association and miss-detected vehicle tracking. For the first module, we integrate self-attention mechanism into detector of using key point estimation for better detection effect. For the second module, we apply the multi-dimensional information for robustness promotion, including vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) features, historical trajectory information, and spatial position information For the third module, we re-track the miss-detected vehicles with occlusions in the first detection module. Besides, we utilize the asymmetric convolution and depth-wise separable convolution to reduce the model's parameters for speed-up. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed multi-vehicle tracking framework.

AB Over the past 100 years there has been an almost unbroken rise in both automotive ownership and use. Its evolution has been a product of powerful positive feedback mechanisms leading to a locking in of the automotive mode as the dominant element of transport systems. But there are now a number of social, economic, technological and environmental changes the coincidence of which are bringing fundamental and far reaching changes to our urban transport systems. The automobile in its ubiquitous internal combustion powered privately owned form is progressively giving way to, variously, car sharing, electric powertrains and autonomous driving systems.
   This special issue's review of the Future of Transport looks at both the causes and effects of these changes. In terms of the phenomenon of peak car, its socio-economic drivers are examined in the context of changing urban demographics and the extent to which it is becoming a global phenomenon. Environmental drivers of change are examined in the context of climate change, public transport efficiency, rebates for retiring old higher polluting vehicles and fuel efficiency standards. The emergence of the electric powered car (EV) and its likely rapid replacement of internal combustion engined vehicles (ICVs) is shown to be a key agent in the transformation of our transport systems.
   Technology is identified as an equally important driver through its enabling of car sharing and autonomous driving systems. As the new forms of usage and powering of vehicles progressively become integrated, new forms of transport are likely to emerge and blur the distinction between private and public transport. In this way transport as a service (TaaS) is beginning to emerge and the era or private ownership of cars recede. (C) 2019 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In order to solve the unmanned underwater vehicle two-dimensional autonomous path planning problem in the environment affected by ocean current and obstacles, this paper applies the improved Fireworks-Ant Colony Hybrid Algorithm to solve it. Firstly, a two-dimensional Lamb vortex ocean current environment model with randomly distributed obstacles is established, and the circular obstacle is equivalent to a square grid. Then, the mathematical model of path planning is established considering the energy consumption cost, navigation time cost and navigation distance cost. Finally, the improved fireworks-ant colony hybrid algorithm is applied to solve the nonlinear optimization problem, and this algorithm is compared with the basic ant colony algorithm for simulation experiments in the four different marine environments. The experimental results show that this algorithm can quickly find the global optimal solution, and the more complex the environment, the more obvious its advantages. The algorithm proposed in this paper provides a new way for autonomous path planning of underwater vehicles. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects on traffic flow of increasing proportions of both autonomous and cooperative adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles relative to manually driven vehicles were studied. Such effects are difficult to estimate from field tests on highways because of the low market penetration of ACC systems. The research approach used Monte Carlo simulations based on detailed models presented in the literature to estimate the quantitative effects of varying the proportions of vehicle control types on lane capacity. The results of this study can help to provide realistic estimates of the effects of the introduction of ACC to the vehicle fleet. Transportation system managers can recognize that the autonomous ACC systems now entering the market are unlikely to have significant positive or negative effects on traffic flow. An additional Value of studying ACC systems in this way is that these scenarios can represent the first steps in a deployment sequence that will lead to an automated highway system. Benefits gained at the early stages in this sequence, particularly through the introduction of cooperative ACC with priority access to designated (although not necessarily dedicated) lanes, can help support further investment in and development of automated highway systems.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies have been rapidly advancing. One benefit of AVs is that the technology could eliminate many driver errors and also mitigate many pedestrian and bicyclist collisions. Real-world AVs have been tested in many cities. Five companies are running around 50 AVs in Pittsburgh, following the autonomous testing guidelines. BikePGH, a non-profit organization located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania conducted a follow-up survey in 2019 (the first survey was conducted in 2017) to understand non motorists' opinions of AVs. This study examined how pedestrians and bicyclists perceived AV safety based on their understanding and experiences. At first, this study performed a comparison group test to determine which questions vary by participants' AV safety rating. The responses were later analyzed with a data mining method known as 'association rules mining.' A new performance measure, known as the rule power factor, was then used to identify the significant patterns in the form of rules. The participants also provided their thoughts in responses to the open-ended questions. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling algorithm, 40 topic models were developed based on five openended questions. The findings show that the non-motorists showed comparatively fewer negative opinions towards AVs than positive assessments. The results also show that perception patterns vary by the participant's rating on AV safety. Findings of this study would be beneficial for the AV stakeholders in making AVs and roadways safer for non-motorists. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous vehicles are being developed rapidly in recent years. In advance implementation stages, many particular problems must be solved to bring this technology into the market place. This paper focuses on the problem of driving in snow and wet road surface environments. First, the quality of laser imaging detection and ranging (LIDAR) reflectivity decreases on wet road surfaces. Therefore, an accumulation strategy is designed to increase the density of online LIDAR images. In order to enhance the texture of the accumulated images, principal component analysis is used to understand the geometrical structures and texture patterns in the map images. The LIDAR images are then reconstructed using the leading principal components with respect to the variance distribution accounted by each eigenvector. Second, the appearance of snow lines deforms the expected road context in LIDAR images. Accordingly, the edge profiles of the LIDAR and map images are extracted to encode the lane lines and roadside edges. Edge matching between the two profiles is then calculated to improve localization in the lateral direction. The proposed method has been tested and evaluated using real data that are collected during the winter of 2016-2017 in Suzu and Kanazawa, Japan. The experimental results show that the proposed method increases the robustness of autonomous driving on wet road surfaces, provides a stable performance in laterally localizing the vehicle in the presence of snow lines, and significantly reduces the overall localization error at a speed of 60 km/h.

AB Rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the ability to operate in confined spaces and to hover over point of interest, but they have limited flight time and endurance. Conventional contact-based charging system for UAVs has been used, but it requires high landing accuracy for proper docking. Instead of the conventional system, autonomous wireless battery charging system for UAVs in outdoor conditions is proposed in this paper. UAVs can be wirelessly charged using the proposed charging system, regardless of yaw angle between UAVs and wireless charging pad, which can further reduce their control complexity for autonomous landing. The increased overall mission time eventually relaxes the limitations on payload and flight time. In this paper, a cost effective automatic recharging solution for UAVs in outdoor environments is proposed using wireless power transfer (WPT). This research proposes a global positioning system (GPS) and vision-based closed-loop target detection and a tracking system for precise landing of quadcopters in outdoor environments. The system uses the onboard camera to detect the shape, color and position of the defined target in image frame. Based on the offset of the target from the center of the image frame, control commands are generated to track and maintain the center position. Commercially available AR.Drone. was used to demonstrate the proposed concept which is equppied with bottom camera and GPS. Experiments and analyses showed good performance, and about 75% average WPT efficiency was achieved in this research.

AB We have developed an adaptive sampling algorithm for an Explorer autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to conduct in-situ analysis of acoustic measurements to perform autonomous oil plume detection and tracking. The methodology of the tracking phase involves ongoing analysis of the detected plume, assessing target validity and proximity for AUV decision-making for plume mapping. We previously introduced the bumblebee flight path, a new biomimetic search pattern designed to maximize the spatial coverage in the oil plume detection phase. This paper focuses on a new tracking strategy as the key adaptive stage in our plume delineation. For initial development we used a 360-degree scanning sonar sensor model. Simulations were done with different plume models to assess the performance of the developed adaptive sampling algorithm. A convergence study demonstrated that the algorithm could successfully track the boundary of a non-regular shaped/patchy oil plume at up to a 0.05Hz sampling frequency. A sensitivity study identified the correlations between plume feature complexity and the anticipated range of acoustic measurement update delays. The decision-making architecture consists of three separate components which implements either proximity or boundary following control and contributes to the final decision on the next desired heading of the vehicle. A weight ratio, that determined the relative allocation of each component, was varied to study its impact on the tracking performance of the AUV. The novelty of our approach is in addressing the discontinuous and patchy nature of realistic oil plumes. Our sampling algorithm and its performance in simulations is a significant step beyond the practical limitations of existing gradient-following methods because it accounts for the oil patches and droplets which gradient-following algorithms do not.

AB Even though autonomous cars have not yet crossed into the mainstream car market, their adoption seems inevitable, but not much is known about the purchasing intention of ACs and potential influences on it. To better understand the influences of various factors on purchasing intentions of autonomous cars, research using bibliometrics, an online survey and SEM modelling was performed. Based on an analysis of previous research work and the unified theory of acceptance of technology, an empirical model was produced and tested using data obtained from an online survey involving 266 individuals. The goal was to analyse which characteristics of autonomous cars, socio-demographic variables of potential buyers, and buyers' personal and social characteristics could potentially influence the adoption of autonomous cars. The results show that factors of car safety, buyer age and level of education, perceived social influence, anxiety and performance expectancy are significantly correlated to purchasing intention of ACs, while correlations with other factors to purchasing intentions have not been proven.

AB This paper presents extensions and practical realization of a previously proposed novel approach to navigation and sensor integration for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The proposed approach employs vehicle dynamic model (VDM) as process model within navigation system, and treats data from other sensors such as inertial measurement unit (IMU), barometric altimeter, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver as observations within the system. In comparison to conventional approach that employs inertial navigation system (INS) as process model, employing VDM requires no added hardware, yet significantly improves navigation performance, especially in case of GNSS outages. Experimental results from a real flight on a custom made fixed-wing UAV, as well as Monte Carlo simulation results, reveal improvements of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in navigation accuracy during GNSS outages of 3 minutes' duration. This is a prerequisite for safer navigation without exteroceptive sensors. Uncertainty levels are predicted consistently within the filter, and a discussion on observability based on covariance matrix analysis is presented. Computation time is also compared to conventional INS-based approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One of those problems is the difficulty of designing a car-following decision-making system for complex traffic conditions. In recent years, reinforcement learning shows the potential in solving sequential decision optimization problems. In this article, we establish the reward function R of each driver data based on the inverse reinforcement learning algorithm, and r visualization is carried out, and then driving characteristics and following strategies are analyzed. At last, we show the efficiency of the proposed method by simulation in a highway environment.

First, according to the positioning model of the moving long baseline positioning system, the relationship between measurement noises and positioning error is established. Second, a cost function is proposed to evaluate the positioning performance. Then, based on the optimal formation, the optimal distance is deduced. Finally, the relationship between the optimal distance and the parameter for the distance-dependent error is proposed. By using this relationship, the effect of distance-dependent measurement noise on optimal distance is analyzed. Simulation examples illustrate the results.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) should reduce traffic accidents, but they will sometimes have to choose between two evils, such as running over pedestrians or sacrificing themselves and their passenger to save the pedestrians. Defining the algorithms that will help AVs make these moral decisions is a formidable challenge. We found that participants in six Amazon Mechanical Turk studies approved of utilitarian AVs (that is, AVs that sacrifice their passengers for the greater good) and would like others to buy them, but they would themselves prefer to ride in AVs that protect their passengers at all costs. The study participants disapprove of enforcing utilitarian regulations for AVs and would be less willing to buy such an AV. Accordingly, regulating for utilitarian algorithms may paradoxically increase casualties by postponing the adoption of a safer technology.

AB In this paper, we propose a neural network (NN)-based tracking control method for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with model uncertainties. In order to solve the difficulties in designing the controller for underactuated AUVs, the additional virtual control input is developed, and the approach angle, which generates the desired yaw angle to track any reference trajectory, is introduced. Moreover, the NNs are used to deal with model uncertainties in the hydrodynamic damping terms of AUVs. Finally, the proposed controller is designed based on the dynamic surface control (DSC) method, and the boundedness of all tracking errors is proved by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Some simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed control method.

AB Near-bottom magnetic anomaly data have been acquired using autonomous underwater vehicles at Brothers volcano, southern Kermadec arc, New Zealand. Crustal magnetization for the study area was obtained by inverting the magnetic data and shows a strong correlation between areas of low magnetization and four hydrothermal fields, one of which was unknown prior to our surveys. The magnetization pattern is consistent with a model of discrete, individual zones of fluid upflow focused along caldera ring faults that provide preferred pathways for the ascent of the hydrothermal fluids. Differences in the amplitude of the magnetization over the vent fields appear to correlate with age and temperature variations of the hydrothermal fields.

TI Robust Control of Formation Dynamics for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles

SO JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE

LA English
DT Article
ID CONSENSUS
AB This paper presents a novel robust controller design for formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). We consider a nonlinear three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model for the horizontal motion of each AUV. By using the Jacobi transform, the horizontal dynamics of AUVs are explicitly expressed as dynamics for formation shape and formation center, and are further decoupled by feedback control. We treat the coupling terms as perturbations to the decoupled system. An H-infinity state feedback controller is designed to achieve robust stability of the closed loop formation and translation dynamics. By incorporating an orientation controller, the formation shape under control converges and the formation center tracks a desired trajectory simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the controllers. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4005507]

AB This paper investigates the consensus problem of a class of third-order discrete-time connected autonomous vehicle systems (CAVS) with constant delay and multiplicative noise. Based on the neighboring vehicle information, a novel cooperative look-ahead predictor-like control protocols are firstly designed for the CAVS to deal with time delay. Secondly, different from the existing literature that only the sufficient condition is obtained, the necessary and sufficient conditions in sense of the mean-square consensus are derived in this paper. The obtained results not only reveal an explicit relation among the system matrices, noise variance and time delay via an algebraic Riccati equation (ARE), but also amount the optimal control design problem to solving an eigenvalue problem (EVP). Furthermore, considering time delay and perturbations simultaneously, the necessary and sufficient conditions of string stability are further derived. Such conditions only depend on the controller parameters and the network weight. Finally, the validity of derived results is verified by some simulations.

AB This paper proposes a systematic driving framework where the decision making module of reinforcement learning (RL) is integrated with rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) as motion planning. RL is used to generate local goals and semantic speed commands to control the longitudinal speed of a vehicle while rewards are designed for the driving safety and the traffic efficiency. Guaranteeing the driving comfort, RRT returns a feasible path to be followed by the vehicle with the speed commands. The scene decomposition approach is implemented to scale the deep neural network (DNN) to environments with multiple traffic participants and double deep Q-networks (DDQN) with prioritized experience replay (PER) is utilized to accelerate the training process. To handle the disturbance of the perception of the agent, we use an ensemble of neural networks to evaluate the uncertainty of decisions. It has shown that the proposed framework can tackle unexpected actions of traffic participants at an intersection yielding safe, comfort and efficient driving behaviors. Also, the ensemble of DDQN with PER is proved to be superior over standard DDQN in terms of learning efficiency and disturbance vulnerability.

AB Biologically inspired maneuvering of autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in the dive plane using pectoral-like oscillating fins is considered. Computational fluid dynamics are used to parameterize the forces generated by a mechanical flapping foil, which attempts to mimic the pectoral fin of a fish. Since the oscillating fins produce periodic force and moment of a variety of wave shapes, the essential characteristics of these signals are captured in their Fourier expansions. Maneuvering of the biorobotic AUV in the dive plane is accomplished by periodically altering the bias angle of the oscillating tin. Based on a discrete-time AUV model, an inverse control system for the dive-plane control is derived. It is shown that, in the closed-loop system, the inverse control system accomplishes accurate tracking of the prescribed time-varying depth trajectories and the segments of the intersample depth trajectory remain close to the discrete-time reference trajectory. The results show that the fins located away from the center of mass toward the nose of the vehicle provide better maneuverability.

AB Being able to rapidly respond to the changing scenes and traffic situations by generating feasible local paths is of pivotal importance for car autonomy. We propose to train a deep neural network (DNN) to plan feasible and nearly-optimal paths for kinematically constrained vehicles in a small constant time. Our DNN model is trained using a novel weakly supervised approach and a gradient-based policy search. On real and simulated scenes and a large set of local planning problems, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing planners with respect to the number of successfully completed tasks. While the path generation time is about 40 ms, the generated paths are smooth and comparable to those obtained from conventional path planners.

This article aims at investigating whether V2X can help VP from different perspectives. We first explain V2X's critical advantages over other technologies (e.g., GPS, RADAR, LIDAR, and camera) and suggest new scenarios of V2X-based VP. Then, we review the state-of-the-art positioning techniques discussed in different standardizations and point out their limitations. Lastly, some promising research directions for V2X-based VP are presented, which contribute to realizing fully autonomous driving by overcoming the current obstacles.

AB This letter proposes a novel and simple smooth path generation algorithm for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method can rapidly generate feasible and curvature continuous paths connecting any two given states with null curvature. The generated path comprises straight lines, circular arcs and clothoid segments that are close to human driving behavior. Moreover, while keeping an accurate connection with the boundary states, the proposed method also allows fine-tuning the curve with the maximum curvature of the path and the midpoint's position, which makes it more flexible in avoiding obstacles while keeping feasibility. Various experiments show that the proposed method has extremely low time consumption and high robustness for different conditions. Meanwhile, it is more flexible than the recent research and the spline-based methods.

AB The concept of communication using acoustic media of underwater sensor networks is important in pollution monitoring, oceanographic data collection and meet future development needs. To improve communication security, it is proposed co-communication of underwater sensor networks with quantum and acoustic communication capabilities by taking advantage of quantum communication and entanglement correlation nonlocality. Between the surface base station and autonomous underwater vehicle, it shares quantum keys by quantum communication and classical communication. Between autonomous underwater vehicle and underwater nodes, it employs symmetric cryptography without causing much encryption and decryption overhead to relay information and correct received information with low-complex on current technique level. In addition, it particularly analyzes the security and throughput efficiency.

AB As an introduction to the Special Section on cars in contemporary communication, this article positions the seven current studies against the backdrop of historical investigations from previous decades. While the car has always intrigued scholars as a highly personal machine; a context for new, mobile communication technologies; and a vehicle of autonomy, all these aspects are taking on new significance with the emergence of connected and increasingly autonomous cars. We identify some common theoretical foundations for the articles in this Special Section both in fundamental reflections on communication and transportation technologies by James Carey and in current initiatives toward a deeper integration of communication and mobility research. All the articles share an emphasis on a certain ritual view of automobility. Each contribution is introduced with its unique perspective.

DT Article

   driving; Input models
AB Context Ontologies are known as a formal and explicit conceptualization of entities, their interfaces, behaviors, and relationships. They have been applied in various application domains such as autonomous driving where ontologies are used for decision making, traffic description, auto-pilot etc. It has always been a challenge to test the corresponding safety-critical software systems in autonomous driving that have been playing an increasingly important role in our daily routines.
   Objective: Failures in these systems potentially not only cause great financial loss but also the loss of lives. Therefore, it is vital to obtain and cover as many as critical driving scenarios during auto drive testing to ensure that the system can always reach a fail-safe state under different circumstances.
   Method: We outline a general framework for testing, verification, and validation for automated and autonomous driving functions. The introduced method makes use of ontologies for describing the environment of autonomous vehicles and convert them to input models for combinatorial testing. The combinatorial test suite comprises abstract test cases that are mapped to concrete test cases that can be executed using simulation environments.
   Results: We discuss in detail on how to automatically convert ontologies to the corresponding combinatorial testing input models. Specifically, we present two conversion algorithms and compare their applicability using ontologies with different sizes. We also carried out a case study to further demonstrate the practical value of applying ontology-based test generation in industrial settings.
   Conclusion The proposed approach for testing autonomous driving takes ontologies describing the environment of autonomous vehicles, and automatically converts it to test cases that are used in a simulation environment to verify automated driving functions. The conversion relies on combinatorial testing. The first experimental results relying on an example from the automotive industry indicates that the approach can be used in practice.

AB A novel fuzzy control method is presented for AUV (Autonomous underwater vehicles) path planning in both static and dynamic three-dimensional environment. First, on the basis of the forward looking sonar model, the virtual acceleration and velocity of AUV in both horizontal and vertical plane can be gotten through the fuzzy system. Then the velocity synthesis approach is applied to generate the real control variables in the body-fixed frame. In addition, a fuzzy-inference system with an accelerate/break (A/B) module is developed for real-time navigation, which enables AUV to avoid dynamic obstacles automatically. Finally, simulation results indicate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.

AB This paper proposes a real-time multi-agent fleet management strategy for autonomous underground mines vehicles. The fleet management strategy is based on multi-agent technology and includes a novel variation of the Contract-Net protocol. This paper also proposes a set of conflict management procedures to deal with the narrow nature of underground drifts, as well as the sequencing of trucks' loading activities. This strategy is tested in a simulated environment based on an industrial case study. Both the strategy and the test environment were implanted using AnyLogic. More specifically, the fleet management activities addressed are dispatching, routing and traffic management of mining vehicles, which deal respectively with the assignment of the next destination to a vehicle that has just completed a task; the choice of the route to be followed to reach the selected destination; and traffic coordination in the underground transportation network, made up of one-lane bi-directional road segments. To evaluate the proposed solution, an agent-based simulation model of a Canadian underground gold mine is implemented with AnyLogic. Results show that the proposed coordination strategy outperform the one currently employed strategy by the mine under investigation.

AB Road vehicle lateral positioning is a key aspect of many assistance applications and autonomous driving. However, conventional GNSS-based positioning systems and fusion with inertial systems are not able to achieve these levels of accuracy under real traffic conditions. Onboard perception systems provide knowledge of the surroundings of the vehicle, and some algorithms have been proposed to detect road boundaries and lane lines. This information could be used to locate the vehicle in the lane. However, most proposed algorithms are quite partial and do not take advantage of a complete knowledge of the road section. This paper proposes an integrated approach to the two tasks that provides a higher level of robustness of results: road boundaries detection and lane lines detection. Furthermore, the algorithm is not restricted to certain scenarios such as the detection of curbs; it could be also used in off-road tracks. The functions have been tested in real environments and their capabilities for autonomous driving have been verified. The algorithm is ready to be merged with digital map information; this development would improve results accuracy.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; AUTOMATED VEHICLES; CONTROL DESIGN; SYSTEMS;
   COMMUNICATION
AB The current platoon control strategies of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) focus on controlling the fixed intervehicle distance, i.e., the string stability of the platoon system. Here, we aimed to design a CAV platoon control strategy based on a constraint-following approach to solve the problem of platoon starting. As the resistance of the vehicle during driving varies with time, this study regarded the CAV platoon system as a changing dynamic system and introduced the Udwadia-Kalaba (U-K) approach to simplify the solution. Apart from adding an equality constraint, unlike most other studies, this study imposed a bilateral inequality constraint on the intervehicle distance between successive CAVs to prevent collisions. Meanwhile, a diffeomorphism method was introduced to transform the bounded state into an unbounded state. The proposed control strategy could render each CAV compliant with both the original imposed bilateral inequality constraint and the equality constraint. The former avoids collisions, and the latter indicates the string stability of the designed CAV platoon system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller was verified by numerical experiments. The gap errors tend to converge to zero, which is not amplified by the propagation of traffic flow.

AB To collect high quality geological data, the seafloor mapping autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is required to change depth in accordance with seafloor terrain to keep a constant altitude above seabed. Therefore, the motion performance of the AUV, involving motion stability and maneuverability (especially in vertical plane), is critical to its security and the quality of survey data. While the balance weight parameters of the vehicle, including net buoyancy and the relative position between gravity center and buoyant center, have great influences on motion performance. In this paper, the influences of balance weight parameters on its motion performance in vertical plane were researched based on dynamic equations. The influence rules of these parameters on motion performance and their reasonable value ranges were provided as well. The research can provide references for the overall design, internal layout planning and trimming of the vehicle, improve its motion performance and shorten the development cycle. Finally, the calculation principles of these parameters were verified by the offshore trial data of the seafloor mapping AUV developed by Tianjin University. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Trajectory generation; linear algebra; trajectory smoothening; micro air
   vehicle; pitch plane
AB For autonomous operations, unmanned micro air vehicles depend on novel trajectory generation schemes. Trajectories parallel to the ground are fairly well understood in surveillance and reconnaissance contexts. In addition, trajectories with altitude as one of the navigational parameters are also envisioned for aerial robots, urban terrain coverage, etc. In these missions, trajectory generation in pitch plane becomes an important problem. In this article, a linear algebraic procedure is applied to generate the pitch plane trajectories. That is, when a terrain (latitude, longitude and altitude) is sensed from a global positioning system, a trajectory to navigate the aircraft along the terrain is presented. By linear algebra, the state vector is spanned using a set of known vectors and some of their scalars (coefficients of spanning vectors) are solved in an optimization framework so that the state variables mapping the desired terrain are determined. After the trajectories are generated, normally smoothening is recommended so that the trajectories are continuous for autonomous control development. Thus, an extended Kalman filter is applied to smooth the trajectories. A nonlinear micro air vehicle model is considered to illustrate the trajectory generation and smoothening scheme.

AB In this paper, a new approach for lane change and double-lane change planning and following for autonomous driving is proposed. Herein, we introduce a novel technique, based on exponential functions, to generate online and feasible lane change maneuvers; these maneuvers satisfy the constraints on the maximum allowable curvature a given vehicle can handle. In addition, a simultaneous local path planning and path-following control framework is adapted. The framework utilizes a multi-threading architecture to run the local planner module concurrently with the control module. The planning module generates parametric reference paths based on the proposed lane change and double-lane change maneuvers. The control module is based on a Model Predictive Path-following Control (MPFC) scheme, which achieves the path following objective while satisfying vehicle's state and control limits. To validate the proposed framework, several real-time simulation scenarios are designed and tested on CARLA soft real-time vehicle simulator. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in generating and smoothly following lane change maneuvers.

AB Due to the small size of Micro Aerial Vehicles, they are well suited for various indoor applications, especially search/rescue operations. Most of these operations are performed in unknown 3D environments. Real-time map construction and vehicle's localization are essential tasks. Various approaches provide solutions for 3D-map representation. However, these approaches require expensive embedded systems to afford high-processing memory/computational costs. Because of its exposure to risks, the MAV should be equipped with a low-cost navigation system. The principal aim of map construction herein is to facilitate the navigation task. Thus, constructing a massive 3D map is not required. Consequently, this paper proposes an efficient real-time 3D SLAM. The proposed method avoids the 3D-map representation of each region of the trajectory. Alternatively, it divides the environment along the trajectory into several 2D maps with a single 2D map in every region at the height of the MAV, as well as a transient region between each of the two constructed maps to enable connecting neighboring maps.

AB Several missions with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in different realistic safety, security, and rescue field tests are presented. First, results from two safety and security missions at the 2009 European Land Robot Trials (ELROB) are presented. A UAV in form of an Airrobot AR100-B is used in a reconnaissance and in a camp security scenario. The UAV is capable of autonomous waypoint navigation using onboard GPS processing. A digital video stream from the vehicle is used to create photo maps-also known as mosaicking-in real time at the operator station. This mapping is done using an enhanced version of Fourier Mellin based registration, which turns out to be very fast and robust. Furthermore, results from a rescue oriented scenario at the 2010 Response Robot Evaluation Exercises (RREE) at Disaster City, Texas are presented. The registration for the aerial mosaicking is supplemented by an uncertainty metric and embedded into Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which further enhances the photo maps as main mission deliveries.

AB H-2 and H-infinity designs applied to the diving and course control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) considering the presence of wave disturbances are described. The six-degrees-of-freedom equations of motion of the vehicle are described as a linear model and divided into three noninteracting (or lightly interacting) subsystems for speed control, steering, and diving. This work is based on the slender form of the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS, Monterey, CA) AUV, considering that the subsystems can be controlled by means of two single-screw propellers, a rudder, port and starboard bow planes, and a stern plane. A model of the AUV dynamics is presented with the first- and the second-order wave force disturbances, i.e., the Froude-Kriloff and diffraction forces. An algorithm of nonlinear regression for the rationalization of the subsurface sea spectrum is provided in this case study. The obtained results are analyzed and evaluated in the frequency domain comparing the controllers performance considering or not the inclusion of the model of waves.

AB In this paper, a novel integrated real-time trajectory planning and tracking control framework capable of dealing with autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) parking maneuver problems is presented. In the motion planning component, a newly-proposed idea of utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for approximating optimal parking trajectories is further extended by taking advantages of a recurrent network structure. The main aim is to fully exploit the inherent relationships between different vehicle states in the training process. Furthermore, two transfer learning strategies are applied such that the developed motion planner can be adapted to suit various AGVs. In order to follow the planned maneuver trajectory, an adaptive learning tracking control algorithm is designed and served as the motion controller. By adapting the network parameters, the stability of the proposed control scheme, along with the convergence of tracking errors, can be theoretically guaranteed. In order to validate the effectiveness and emphasize key features of our proposal, a number of experimental studies and comparative analysis were executed. The obtained results reveal that the proposed strategy can enable the AGV to fulfill the parking mission with enhanced motion planning and control performance. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the problem of optimal automatic parking planning and tracking control for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) maneuvering in a restricted environment (e.g., constrained parking regions). A number of challenges may arise when dealing with this problem (e.g., the model uncertainties involved in the vehicle dynamics, system variable limits, and the presence of external disturbances). Existing approaches to address such a problem usually exploit the merit of optimization-based planning/control techniques such as model predictive control and dynamic programming in order for an optimal solution. However, two practical issues may require further considerations: 1). The nonlinear (re)optimization process tends to consume a large amount of computing power and it might not be affordable in real-time; 2). Existing motion planning and control algorithms might not be easily adapted to suit various types of AGVs. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we present an idea of utilizing the recurrent deep neural network (RDNN) for planning optimal parking maneuver trajectories and an adaptive learning NN-based (ALNN) control scheme for robust trajectory tracking. In addition, by introducing two transfer learning strategies, the proposed RDNN motion planner can be adapted to suit different AGVs. In our follow-up research, we will explore the possibility of extending the developed methodology for large-scale AGV parking systems collaboratively operating in a more complex cluttered environment.

AB An n-degree of freedom nonlinear control law for the trajectory tracking of marine vehicles that operate in the presence of unknown time-varying disturbances, input saturation and actuator rate limits is developed using a disturbance observer and nonlinear dynamic surface control. In marine vehicle applications, n would typically be 3, 4 or 6. The disturbance observer provides estimates of the unknown time-varying disturbances and a continuously differentiable function is employed to model input saturation. The uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop control system is proved. Trajectory-tracking simulations of an autonomous underwater vehicle demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes a vehicle platooning algorithm to minimize the disruption from a lane-changing maneuver. Towards achieving this objective, while most studies emphasize the interaction between the lane-changing vehicle and vehicles directly or indirectly impacted by the lane-changing maneuver (i.e., the followers of the lane-changing vehicle in the target lane after the lane-changing maneuver), this study will focus on the leaders of the lane-changing vehicle in the target lane. Assuming the connectivity between vehicles, we propose a novel approach to implement both Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) for platoon control. The proposed hybrid algorithm will create a forward-moving shockwave, resulting in an additional gap for the lane-changing vehicle. Simulation results indicate the ability of the proposed approach to generate an additional gap for the lane-changing vehicle and consequently, minimizing and potentially eliminating the disruption from the lane-changing maneuver.

AB Recently, there has been increased interest in the development of autonomous flying vehicles. However, as most of the proposed approaches are suitable for outdoor operation, only a few techniques have been designed for indoor environments, where the systems cannot rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and, therefore, have to use their exteroceptive sensors for navigation. In this paper, we present a general navigation system that enables a small-sized quadrotor system to autonomously operate in indoor environments. To achieve this, we systematically extend and adapt techniques that have been successfully applied on ground robots. We describe all algorithms and present a broad set of experiments, which illustrate that they enable a quadrotor robot to reliably and autonomously navigate in indoor environments.

AB A new approach to the fault-accommodating allocation of thruster forces of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is investigated in this paper. This paper presents a framework that exploits the excess number of thrusters to accommodate thruster faults during operation. First, a redundancy resolution scheme is presented that considers the presence of an excess number of thrusters along with any thruster faults and determines the reference thruster forces to produce the desired motion. This framework is then extended to incorporate a dynamic state feedback technique to generate reference thruster forces that are within the saturation limit of each thruster. Results from both computer simulations and experiments are provided to demonstrate the viability of the proposed scheme.

AB Underwater Mobile Sensor Network (UWMSN) has marked a new era in ocean observation systems involving large scale ocean phenomena monitoring applications. These spatial and temporally varying applications demand multiple mobile entities for the collection of large amounts of data. This paper gives a concise view of the current state of the art of such networks comprising multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and their challenges. It provides a literature review of the channel model and networking protocols of the physical layer, data link layer and network layer. Important algorithms and techniques for localization and time synchronization have also been reviewed. These algorithms play a huge role in a cooperative mission involving multiple AUVs, to achieve a common notion of time and to share the location information among the vehicles. Moreover, this paper includes a survey of various software platforms that support UWMSN, testbeds/real-time deployments of UWMSN developed by various research institutes/organizations and briefly discusses the recent advancement in the field of UWMSN.

AB To avoid crashes caused by driver error in avoiding obstacles, a driver-centered steering assist controller with an adaptive authority allocation system is proposed for cooperative control purposes. To begin with, a concept of space collision risk (SCR) is introduced creatively for assessing the vehicle's safety status in which the relative distance and the relative angle between the vehicle and the obstacle are taken into consideration. Meanwhile, the SCR-based authority allocation system is addressed to allocate steering authorities between the human driver and the assist controller adaptively to reduce SCR to zero as soon as possible. After that, an autonomous steering controller based on the model predictive control (MPC) technique and the artificial potential field (APF) method, considering not only the vehicle stability constraints but also roads and obstacles constraints, is developed to aid the human driver when necessary. In the end, the proposed algorithm is simulated in the CarSim-Simulink cosimulation platform under a series of typical scenarios, which shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented shared steering control method.

AB This article describes a natural landmark navigation algorithm for autonomous vehicles operating in relatively unstructured environments. The algorithm employs points of maximum curvature, extracted from laser scan data, as point landmarks in an extended Kalman filter. A curvature scale space algorithm is developed to locate points of maximum curvature. The location of these points is invariant to view-point and sensor resolution. They can therefore be used as stable and reliable landmarks in a localization algorithm. This information is then fused with odometric information to provide localization information for an outdoor vehicle. The method described is invariant to the size and orientation of the range images under consideration (with respect to rotation and translation), is robust to noise, and can reliably detect and localize naturally occurring landmarks in the operating environment. The method developed is generally applicable to a range of unstructured environments and may be used with different types of sensors. The method is demonstrated as part of a navigation system for an outdoor vehicle in an unmodified operating domain. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the application scenarios of quadrotors, it is expected that only part of the obstacles can be identified and located in advance. In order to make quadrotors fly safely in this situation, we present a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to realize autonomous navigation in semi-known environments. Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes the dueling double deep recurrent Q-learning, which can implement global path planning with the obstacle map as input. Moreover, the proposed framework combined with contrastive learning-based feature extraction can conduct real-time autonomous obstacle avoidance with monocular vision effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework exhibits remarkable performance for both global path planning and autonomous obstacle avoidance.

AB The automotive industry continues to grow rapidly with technological developments. Vehicles are being equipped with new software and sensors which assist drivers. People have become familiar with the L1 and L2 vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. However, the idea of full automation is still new to most people. In Turkiye, AVs are not present on roads. Thus, neither pedestrians nor drivers have been in interaction with AVs yet. This study investigates the preliminary perception of AVs among road users in Turkiye. The data were collected via a face-to-face survey. A binary logit and a random forest model were used to identify the critical factors in the positive attitudes toward AVs. Binary logit and random forest models resulted in similar findings. Age, education level, people who would feel safe driving in an AV, and who believed that urban traffic congestion would decrease were positive about AVs. The random forest model showed the same accuracy when the two models were compared. Most public opinion studies about AVs have been investigated in developed countries. It is believed that this study will help to understand the perception of AVs in developing countries.

AB Platooning of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) has a significant potential for throughput improvement. However, the interaction between CAVs and non-CAVs may limit the practically attainable improvement due to platooning. To better understand and address this limitation, we introduce a new fluid model of mixed-autonomy traffic flow and use this model to analyze and design platoon coordination strategies. We propose a tandem-link fluid model that considers randomly arriving platoons sharing highway capacity with non-CAVs. We derive verifiable conditions for stability of the fluid model by analyzing an underlying M/D/1 queuing process and establishing a Foster-Lyapunov drift condition for the fluid model. These stability conditions enable a quantitative analysis of highway throughput under various scenarios. The model is useful for designing platoon coordination strategies that maximize throughput and minimize delay. Such coordination strategies are provably optimal in the fluid model and are practically relevant. We also validate our results using standard macroscopic (cell transmission model) and microscopic (simulation for urban mobility) simulation models.

AB Public acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is still questionable. Nevertheless, it can be influenced by proper communication strategy. Therefore, our research focuses on (1) the type of information concerning AVs that consumers seek and (2) how to communicate this technology in order to increase its acceptance. In the first study (N = 711) topic modeling showed that the most sought for information concern the communion and the agency of AVs. In the second, experimental study (N = 303) we measured the participants' fear and goal-orientation in relation to AVs. Then, after the manipulation of the AV advertisement (imbued with communal vs agentic content), technology acceptance components (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and behavioral intention) were verified. The comparative analysis of the structural model estimates showed that the both participants' fear and goal-orientation in relation to AVs were associated much more with the acceptance components of the communal AV rather than the agentic one. Therefore, people want to know both whether AVs are communal and agentic, but they are more prone to accept a communal AV than agentic one.

AB This study investigates agent-based interbay control of a wafer fabrication facility with a single-loop track. Doing so will simultaneously resolve the production scheduling and vehicle dispatching problems for an interbay over-hoist-transportation system which is commonly employed in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Two issues are focused on in this study: (i) To design appropriate agent-based control architecture for an interbay system and (ii) to develop a coordination mechanism for the autonomous agents in the interbay system, so that wafer manufacturing tasks can be accomplished efficiently. In this study, we construct a distributed interbay system architecture, in which wafer cassettes, vehicles, and manufacturing cells with stockers are modelled as independent and autonomous agents. This study develops an agent coordination mechanism that is based on a vehicle-initiated contract net protocol. Three types of bidding strategies are proposed and empirically examined via simulation. The performances of the proposed agent-based control mechanism, in terms of cassette sojourn time and throughput, are observed and our experiments have shown promising results.

ID ROBOTS
AB This paper presents a control architecture endowing a car-like vehicle moving in a dynamic and partially known environment with autonomous motion capabilities. Like most recent control architectures for autonomous robot systems, it combines three functional components: a set of basic real-time skills, a reactive execution mechanism and a decision module. The main novelty of the architecture proposed lies in the introduction of a fourth component akin to a meta-level of skills: the sensor-based manoeuvers, i.e., general templates that encode high-level expert human knowledge and heuristics about how a specific motion task is to be performed. The concept of sensor-based manoeuvers permit to reduce the planning effort required to address a given motion task, thus improving the overall response-time of the system, while retaining the good properties of a skill-based architecture, i.e., robustness, flexibility and reactivity. The paper focuses on the trajectory planning function (which is an important part of the decision module) and two types of sensor-based manoeuvers, trajectory following and parallel parking, that have been implemented and successfully tested on a real automatic car-like vehicle placed in different situations.

TI A Measurement Scheduling Method for Multi-vehicle Cooperative
   Localization Considering State Correlation

AB Accurate and robust localization is a fundamental requirement for safe autonomous driving. Currently, most vehicles rely on single-vehicle localization (SVL) using the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for obtaining the position data. However, in urban canyons or areas with signal interruptions, the GNSS signals may be unreliable, thus leading to accumulated errors in SVL. In contrast, cooperative localization provides the advantages of superior accuracy, good fault tolerance, and high flexibility by leveraging multi-source data from self-sensors and neighboring vehicles. Nevertheless, establishing communication links with all surrounding vehicles can introduce a severe communication burden and thus impact real-time data processing performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cooperative localization method with loosely-coupled communication that considers the state correlation. In this study, the communication process is divided into two topologies to ensure filter consistency, and an approximate variable substitutions technique enables suboptimal estimation of a cross-covariance matrix. Furthermore, a dynamic period measurement scheduling (DPMS) method is proposed. The DPMS optimally selects vehicles for cooperative localization based on the covariance matrix trace values, considering three factors of location uncertainty and employing a weight function for period adjustment. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated through multiple simulations and field tests, assessing the algorithm convergence, localization accuracy, execution time, and communication burden. The results demonstrate that compared to the sequential greedy algorithm, the proposed method can significantly reduce communication and computation burden while achieving higher localization accuracy than the random measurement scheduling method and the measurement scheduling method based on a deep neural network.

AB We tackle the problem of trajectory planning in an environment comprised of a set of obstacles with uncertain time-varying locations. The uncertainties are modeled using widely accepted Gaussian distributions, resulting in a chance-constrained program. Contrary to previous approaches however, we do not assume perfect knowledge of the moments of the distribution, and instead estimate them through finite samples available from either sensors or past data. We derive tight concentration bounds on the error of these estimates to sufficiently tighten the chance-constraint program. As such, we provide provable guarantees on satisfaction of the chance-constraints corresponding to the nominal yet unknown moments. We illustrate our results with two autonomous vehicle trajectory planning case studies. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Address Mapping Table; In-Vehicle Edge Gateway; self-diagnosis
AB This paper proposes a Lightweight In-Vehicle Edge Gateway (LI-VEG) for the self-diagnosis of an autonomous vehicle, which supports a rapid and accurate communication between in-vehicle sensors and a self-diagnosis module and between in-vehicle protocols. A paper on the self-diagnosis module has been published previously, thus this paper only covers the LI-VEG, not the self-diagnosis. The LI-VEG consists of an In-Vehicle Sending and Receiving Layer (InV-SRL), an InV-Management Layer (InV-ML) and an InV-Data Translator Layer (InV-DTL). First, the InV-SRL receives the messages from FlexRay, Control Area Network (CAN), Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST), and Ethernet and transfers the received messages to the InV-ML. Second, the InV-ML manages the message transmission and reception of FlexRay, CAN, MOST, and Ethernet and an Address Mapping Table. Third, the InV-DTL decomposes the message of FlexRay, CAN, MOST, and Ethernet and recomposes the decomposed messages to the frame suitable for a destination protocol. The performance analysis of the LI-VEG shows that the transmission delay time about message translation and transmission is reduced by an average of 10.83% and the transmission delay time caused by traffic overhead is improved by an average of 0.95%. Therefore, the LI-VEG has higher compatibility and is more cost effective because it applies a software gateway to the OBD, compared to a hardware gateway. In addition, it can reduce the transmission error and overhead caused by message decomposition because of a lightweight message header.

AB Due to vehicle mobility, the topology of Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) may change dynamically. High mobility, limited bandwidth, and dynamic network topology pose challenges for communication in the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). Literature works have attempted to promote efficient (e.g., lower end-to-end latency) message forwarding. However, due to the uncertain direction of message forwarding and vehicle mobility, they suffer from unreachable destinations and unstable connections. This paper explores the efficient method of message forwarding to alleviate network congestion in IoVs. We propose a Spatio-Temporal domain Autonomous Load Balancing (STALB) routing protocol. Specifically, STALB is a trajectory-based method for controlling the direction of message forwarding. STALB can significantly reduce the end-to-end latency and overload ratio, since it considers the local status of network relay devices (i.e., buffer score, congestion status) from the spatio-temporal domain. Then, we present a path reconstruction mechanism, which ensures that messages are forwarded to destinations within limited Time-To-live (TTL). Extensive simulation results show that STALB significantly outperforms other baseline methods (BSaW, TDOR, and TBHGR) regarding overhead ratio, average delivery latency, and average buffer time. Especially, the delivery rate of STALB can reach 99.9% under the sparse network scenario (4,500 messages), at least 0.7% higher than other baseline methods. Similarly, the average delivery delay of STALB is at least 84.31% lower than that of other baseline methods under the dense network scenario (18,000 messages).

AB We consider a service network design problem for the tactical planning of parcel delivery in a city logistics setting. A logistics service provider seeks a repeatable plan to transport commodities from distribution centers on the periphery to inner-city satellites. In a hetero-geneous infrastructure, autonomous vehicles in level 4 may only drive in feasible streets but need to be pulled elsewhere by manually operated vehicles in platoons. We formulate an integer program to determine the fleet mix, schedule transportation services, and decide on the routing or outsourcing of commodities. Platooning requires a high level of synchronization between vehicles which demands the time-expanded networks to contain narrow time intervals. Thus, we develop an algorithm based on the dynamic discretization discovery scheme which refines partially time-expanded networks iteratively without having to enumerate the fully time-expanded network a priori. We introduce valid inequalities and provide two enhanced versions of the algorithm that exploit linear relaxations of the problem. Further, we propose heuristic ideas to speed up the search for high-quality solutions. In a computational study, we analyze the efficacy of the algorithm in different versions and observe improvements of computational performance in comparison to a commercial solver. Finally, we solve a case study on a real-world based network to obtain insights into the deployment of a mixed autonomous fleet in an existing heterogeneous infrastructure. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Self-localisation is vital for autonomous vehicles. In this study, the authors present an augmented extended Kalman filter (AEKF) framework for intelligent vehicle localisation applications. Compared to the previous approach, the proposed AEKF is enhanced through a model fusion, which incorporates a constant velocity model, constant acceleration model, constant turn rate and velocity, and constant turn rate and acceleration model by using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference technique, where the typical prediction procedure in the extended Kalman filter is modified by a fusion of those various motion models for the state estimation. Furthermore, they proposed a flexible cooperative Bayesian filter to incorporate the data from nearby-vehicles' position and lateral distance from the host vehicle to the lane lines, to improve the raw global positioning system (GPS) performance under multi-sensor observation environments. They conduct simulation experiments under vividly, near-realistic scenarios with random traffic-flows to show the superiorities of the proposed framework when compared with the consumer-grade GPS implementation. The results show that the obtained positioning enhancement can significantly reduce the positioning error from the original larger than 5 m to the sub-meter level under various scenarios.

AB This paper presents an interactive motion predictor to infer the intention of cut-in vehicles using a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) module. The proposed predictor consists of three modules: maneuver recognition, trajectory prediction, and interaction. The driving data for training and validating the Bi-LSTM module were collected by sensors mounted on an autonomous vehicle (AV). In total, 3,828 trajectories of human-driven vehicles around the AV are accumulated in a global coordinate system. After postprocessing the collected trajectories, 83,188 and 35,652 data samples were used to train and validate the Bi-LSTM module, respectively. In the Bi-LSTM module, a maneuver is defined as the desired driving lane of a vehicle, which extend the behavior coverage of the proposed approach. The trajectory prediction step is based on the path-following model with a motion parameter estimator to predict the trajectories for all possible maneuvers. The interaction module considers the likelihood of each maneuver and the collision risk to determine the future trajectories of the surrounding vehicles in terms of the driving scene. The proposed predictor was evaluated in terms of its prediction accuracy and its effects on the motion planner of the AV. It has been shown that the AV benefits from the improved motion prediction of target vehicles provided by the proposed predictor with respect to enhanced safety and reduced control effort in the case of cut-in situations.

AB The bearing estimation problem of low-frequency underwater acoustic sources is of paramount importance in antisubmarine warfare and passive acoustic monitoring applications. Typical solutions require manned vessels and towed arrays characterized by high costs, risks, and deployment difficulties. An alternative solution for such applications is represented by acoustic vector sensors (AVSs), which are lightweight, compact, and moderate in cost, have promising performance in terms of bearing discrimination and the potential to operate from autonomous underwater platforms. This article presents an experimental assessment of a 2-D AVS derived from a sonobuoy and mounted on a hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for estimating the bearing of underwater sources. The sensor model, its technical characteristics, the installation onboard the vehicle, and the implementation of the passive signal processing chain are reported. Three different algorithms for bearing estimation have been tested on real data: one based on a time-domain representation, one based on the frequency domain, and one relying on joint time-frequency representation. Experimentation and data are presented, first from very shallow waters within the Italian Navy base of CSSN, La Spezia, and then from the Tyrrhenian Sea, in the context of a multiplatform exercise led by the NATO S&TO CMRE. Using an acoustic navigation system as ground truth, these experiments allow the assessment of bearing estimation capabilities in both AUV (by using propeller and pump jets) and gliding navigation modes. While the results of all the three processing methods are at least par to those recently reported in similar experiments with different vector sensors and processing, the time-frequency-domain method can identify multiple sources without prior knowledge of the source signal waveform or bandwidth.

AB In this study, the authors propose a simple adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to unknown dynamic parameters and disturbances under asymmetric time-varying line-of-sight (LOS) range and angle constraints. A simple error mapping function is constructed to transform the LOS range and angle constraint problems of AUVs trajectory tracking into the problem of the boundedness of transform variable, such that any constraint boundaries of LOS range and angle can be handled. The compounded uncertain item caused by the unknown dynamic parameters and disturbances is transformed into a linear parametric form with only three unknown parameters called virtual parameters. Based on the above, a simple adaptive trajectory tracking control law is developed using dynamic surface control technique, where the adaptive laws online provide the estimations of virtual parameters. As a result, the proposed trajectory tracking control scheme is simple to compute and easy to implement in engineering applications. Strict stability analysis indicates that the designed control law makes AUVs track the desired trajectory within the LOS range and angle constraints and guarantees the boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop control system. Simulation results and comparison verify the effectiveness of the designed control scheme.

AB This paper presents a data-driven approach to control the movement of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating as receivers of a multistatic sonar surveillance network. The algorithm adopts a nonmyopic receding horizon policy to control the AUV heading, with the objective of minimizing the expected estimate error in the target location produced by the onboard tracker. Minimizing this error is of the utmost interest in target state estimation since it is one way of maintaining tracks. The proposed policy builds on an automated perception module which produces a target track and on an acoustic model to estimate the target measurement signal-to-noise ratio. Driven by the mission objectives, it explores the best decisions for the AUV by evaluating the evolution of the tactical situation over a future time window. Nonmyopic approaches can offer increased performance if compared to myopic ones. The downside is an increase of the computational burden. Methods are described to simplify and solve effectively the resulting decision tree to allow the execution of these kinds of computational intensive algorithms onboard autonomous vehicles. At the same time, they aim at producing AUV paths robust to possible misleading target measurements, which might cause meandering trajectories. These are crucial factors to use data-driven strategies for AUVs which must work in real applications. Results from the COLLAB13 sea trial are reported and discussed. They show both the feasibility of executing the algorithm in realtime on an onboard computer and the benefits of using the proposed approach over conventional predefined paths. These results are, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful demonstration at sea of a complex nonmyopic algorithm running in realtime onboard AUVs in a realistic multistatic littoral surveillance scenario.

AB This study proposes an effective trajectory planning algorithm based on the quartic Bezier curve and dangerous potential field for automatic vehicles. To generate collision-free trajectories, potential field functions are introduced to evaluate the collision risk of path candidates. However, many studies on artificial potential field approaches primarily focus on static and straight roads, and attach less importance to more complex driving scenarios, such as curving roads. In this study, a novel method based on the Frenet coordinate system is proposed to address such limitations. Moreover, to balance the driving comfortability and the driving safety of the path candidate, the path-planning problem is converted to an optimisation problem, and sequential quadratic programming algorithm is employed to tackle this task. Another merit of this algorithm is the curvature of the generated path is continuous even at the joints of adjacent sub-trajectories by utilising several specific properties of the Bezier curve. Furthermore, to execute the generated trajectory, a framework of velocity generation is proposed while vehicle dynamic constraints are considered. Some typical traffic scenarios, including lane-changing, lane-keeping, and collision avoidance have been designed to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, and simulations demonstrate the validity of this method.

ID ACCIDENT RISK
AB It is often argued that driverless vehicles will save lives. In this paper, we treat the ethical case for driverless vehicles seriously and show that it has radical implications for the future of transport. After briefly discussing the current state of driverless vehicle technology, we suggest that systems that rely upon human supervision are likely to be dangerous when used by ordinary people in real-world driving conditions and are unlikely to satisfy the desires of consumers. We then argue that the invention of fully autonomous vehicles that pose a lower risk to third parties than human drivers will establish a compelling case against the moral permissibility of manual driving. As long as driverless vehicles aren't safer than human drivers, it will be unethical to sell them. Once they are safer than human drivers when it comes to risks to 3rd parties, then it should be illegal to drive them: at that point human drivers will be the moral equivalent of drunk robots. We also describe two plausible mechanisms whereby this ethical argument may generate political pressure to have it reflected in legislation. Freeing people from the necessity of driving, though, will transform the relationship people have with their cars, which will in turn open up new possibilities for the transport uses of the automobile. The ethical challenge posed by driverless vehicles for transport policy is therefore to ensure that the most socially and environmentally beneficial of these possibilities is realised. We highlight several key policy choices that will determine how likely it is that this challenge will be met. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sideslip angle is an important state parameter for vehicle stability control; in this study, a robust sideslip angle observer with regional stability constraint is presented. In order to achieve more accurate sideslip angle estimation, the vehicle heading angle and yaw angle are distinguished and the relational expression between vehicle heading angle, yaw angle and sideslip angle was applied to the singular vehicle modelling process. Considering the time-varying tire cornering stiffness, the uncertain singular vehicle model is established by integrating the singular vehicle dynamic equation and model uncertainty. Then, a robust sideslip angle observer whose pole assignment has the regional stability constraint is designed. Simulation studies and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed sideslip angle estimation method.

AB Autonomous vehicles are effective environmental sampling platforms whose sampling performance can be optimized by path-planning algorithms that drive vehicles to specific regions of the operational domain containing the most informative data. In this paper, we apply tools from nonlinear observability, nonlinear control, and Bayesian estimation to derive a multi-vehicle control algorithm that steers vehicles to an optimal sampling formation in an estimated flowfield. Sampling trajectories are optimized using the empirical observability gramian, which quantifies the sensitivity of output measurements to variations of the flowfield parameters. We reconstruct the parameters of the flowfield from noisy flow measurements collected along the sampling trajectories using a recursive Bayesian filter.

AB The work in this paper addresses the performance characteristics of a group of autonomous vehicles utilizing coordinated motion control. The vehicle dynamics correspond to planar unicycle systems with constant forward speed and heading control, and the coordination is implemented via phase-coupled oscillation, such as Kuramoto oscillators. We provide bounds on vehicle transient behavior in terms of maximal displacement from nominal and relation of those bounds to communication bandwidth and energy.

AB The traffic capacity of signalized intersections can be increased using vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication by broadcasting traffic control signals to connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, the potential improvement in traffic capacity with only CAVs can be substantially reduced under mixed traffic environments that include autonomous vehicles (AVs) without V2I communication. The main contribution of this work is to increase the traffic capacity (close to that achieved by CAVs with V2I communication) when there is a substantial number of AVs without V2I communication - by using a delayed-self-reinforcement (DSR) approach for vehicle spacing control with already available history of the AVs own control inputs and sensed information. Moreover, analytical estimates are established to predict the improvements in traffic capacity achieved for AVs with the DSR approach compared to the case without the DSR approach. Simulation results match the analytical predictions and show that AVs using the DSR approach (without V2I communication) are able to recover 88% of intersection capacity achieved with CAVs (with V2I communication) and result in 2.7 times the intersection capacity achieved by AVs without DSR on one way traffic. Moreover, similar improvements with DSR are shown for a real-world intersection using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) platform. AVs with DSR approach are able to recover 96% of intersection capacity achieved with CAVs (with V2I communication) and result in 1.4 times the intersection capacity achieved by AVs without DSR. Improvements using DSR are also seen with mixed traffic that includes human-driven vehicles (HDVs).

AB In the open scene of auto-docking for wireless charging, vehicle needs to approach the station with the capability of real-time path planning to achieve the time efficiency, and to stop with a certain posture to guarantee high charging efficiency. The prominent challenge arises from the coupled problem of dynamic obstacle avoidance and precise targeting posture control. To simultaneously address these two issues, this paper takes into considerations of vehicle jerk and targeting posture constrains, and proposes a generic real-time planning and tracking control method for the wireless charged nonholonomic autonomous vehicle. First, a kinematic and dynamic model for nonholonomic differential-drive vehicle is built as the foundation of the planning and tracking control. Then, a real-time layered planner consisting of a path planning and a trajectory planning stage is designed to generate reference trajectory, which encompasses jerk constraints and vehicle dynamics to ensure the global time and energy efficiency in an intermittent acceleration and deceleration scenario. Finally, a fast nonlinear model predictive control (FNMPC) algorithm is established to realize high precision trajectory tracking during the dynamic obstacle avoidance. Numerical experimentation shows that the proposed method achieves a straightforward, less than 3 cm docking error posture under a given autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) configuration, and outperforms general-purpose simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) planning and control algorithms for dynamic obstacle avoidance. The results show that the proposed method is feasible for the general efficiency-aware applications of vehicle auto docking in the wireless charging station.

AB Introduced by the authors, the hybrid electromagnetic brake (HEB) has considerable advantages over conventional friction and hybrid brakes. One of its advantages is the controllability of the brake system even when the HEB is integrated in a vehicle. Therefore, in this paper, robust speed and slip control schemes for HEB systems taking into account the brake and vehicle dynamics are developed for uncertain system parameters, and unknown external disturbance conditions, owing to neural networks learning and adaptation abilities. The presented robust control schemes exhibit advantages such as not requiring exact information about the brake and vehicle parameters for the controller design, and that the control algorithm is capable of efficiently tracking performance while ensuring the stability of the closed-loop system. The controllers are suitable for many vehicle active safety control systems such as, adaptive cruise control, anti-lock braking systems, electronic stability control, rollover prevention and autonomous vehicle operations. Both simulations and experiments are presented to show the controllers performances and the effectiveness of the presented control schemes.

AB Compared with grid to vehicle (G2V) and vehicle to grid (V2G) modes, electric vehicle (EV) battery chargers are more vulnerable to power quality problems at the autonomous mode, i.e., creating its own electric grid during the grid blackout while facing unbalanced and nonlinear loads. Active damping is another common challenge given most charger equip LC filters at grid-end voltage-source inverters (VSIs). In this article, an output-voltage control with harmonic compensation plus virtual impedance term is proposed to achieve high power quality and necessary damping, respectively. The physical meaning of the virtual impedance is further explained, and the voltage loop with PI plus multiresonant terms is analyzed in depth. More importantly, the analytical solutions and procedures to design such controllers considering the time delays are proposed. Finally, simulation results and experimental data on an EV battery charger prototype using SiC devices, which is made of one VSI and one isolated dc/dc converter, validate the effectiveness of the proposed design methodology.

At present, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Japan Atomic Energy Agency, and Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology are jointly working on the investigation of radioactivity in mud deposited in estuaries in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The main objective is unmanned mud collection using the ASV. For mud collection, we developed a side thruster system and implemented it to the ASV. We developed a unified main and side thruster system for one-man operation of the ASV using a joystick. We confirmed the operation of the ASV with the joystick in field tests.

AB This paper is concerned with bidirectional autonomous platoon control with saturating actuator and time-varying delay. First, A new bidirectional platoon control system model is established, in which the effect of engine time uncertainty, actuator saturation and time-varying actuator delay is involved. Then, the robust exponential stability conditions of the platoon system are presented, only use information from its immediate neighbors. The theoretical results show that the proposed platoon controller would be able to safely maintain a smaller inter-vehicle spacing, less fuel and would be bidirectional string stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the presented methodology.

DT Article
AB This paper presents the design and simulation validation of a multivariable GPC (generalized predictive control) for AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) in vertical plane. This control approach has been designed in the case of AUV navigating with low speed near water surface, in order to restrain wave disturbance effectively and improve pitch and heave motion stability. The proposed controller guarantees compliance with rudder manipulation, AUV output constraints, and driving energy consumption. Performance index based on pitch stabilizing performance, energy consumption, and system constraints is used to derive the control action applied for each time step. In order to deal with constrained optimization problems, a Hildreth's QP procedure is adopted. Simulation results of AUV longitudinal control show better stabilizing performance and minimized energy consumption improved by multivariable GPC.

SO JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB A compact water sampler rated to full ocean depth has been deployed from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to enable oceanographic tracer measurements. Techniques developed to allow the instrument to collect up to 49 samples of sufficient purity for tracer measurement without the need for extensive flushing have increased its sampling frequency, allowing a 200-mL seawater sample to be collected in 10 min. This is achieved by flushing the instrument and sample containers before deployment with a fluid of known properties that can be detected after recovery using salinity analysis. A deployment in which water samples were collected for oxygen isotope ratio analysis is presented as an example. Factors limiting the reliability of the instrument when deployed from an AUV are identified and procedures are developed to address critical problems.

DE Risk-aware autonomous systems; DL; Test set generation; Uncertainty
AB Correct environmental perception of objects on the road is vital for the safety of autonomous driving. Making appropriate decisions by the autonomous driving algorithm could be hindered by data perturbations and more recently, by adversarial attacks. We propose an adversarial test input generation approach based on uncertainty to make the machine learning (ML) model more robust against data perturbations and adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks and uncertain inputs can affect the ML model's performance, which can have severe consequences such as the misclassification of objects on the road by autonomous vehicles, leading to incorrect decision-making. We show that we can obtain more robust ML models for autonomous driving by making a dataset that includes highly -uncertain adversarial test inputs during the re-training phase. We demonstrate an improvement in the accuracy of the robust model by more than 12%, with a notable drop in the uncertainty of the decisions returned by the model. We believe our approach will assist in further developing risk-aware autonomous systems.(c) 2022 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a complex 3-D environment, efficiently and safely reaching the target position is of great significance for autonomous underwater vehicles. This article proposes a cylinder-based informed rapid exploration random tree (Cyl-iRRT*) algorithm, which seeks to find the homotopy optimal path by focusing the search space on the designed gradually shrinking cylinder. The proportional shrinkage method and obstacle-based sampling strategy are presented to yield a fast convergence response and robust stability. Furthermore, the probabilistic completeness and homotopic optimality of Cyl-iRRT* are proven to be effective. Finally, both simulation and real-world experimental results reveal the superiorities of the Cyl-iRRT* algorithm.

AB The applications of time-reversal waves to underwater acoustic technologies have been researched by the authors, particularly for long horizontal communication with autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In this study, the influence of a moving source-receiver to time-reversal communication is investigated because AUV is desired to maintain its speed. The simulations based on the normal mode method including such effect are executed. As for the results, it is clarified that the convergency of time reversal is not so affected and that the proposed method of combining time reversal and an adaptive filter can compensate the influences of the moving source-receiver adequately whose speed is not so high.

AB Recent advances in smart connected vehicles and intelligent transportation systems are based on the collection and processing of massive amounts of sensor data. There are various internal sensors integrated into modern vehicles that are useful to monitor multiple mechanical and electrical systems, and the shift to semi-autonomous vehicles adds outward-facing sensors such as cameras, lidar, and radar. Low-cost, dependable sensing, connectivity, computational capacity, and powerful analytics are ushering in a new era of vehicle context sensing and vehicular network (VANET). However, due to latency, bandwidth, cost, security, and privacy issues, as well as the growing capabilities of edge computing devices, it is necessary to examine both edge and cloud computing in order to make informed judgments based on their contexts and performances. So, in this paper, we have proposed an architecture that focuses on an intelligent transportation system based on both Cloud and Edge computing in order to monitor and analyze vehicle sensor data and its environment; known as monitoring and analyzing as a service. Our proposed architecture is able to react in real-time to any vehicle context changes in a dynamic, adaptive, and autonomous way. It generates many plans adapted to the vehicle context that will be useful for future research to achieve a self-learning and self-adaptive system. This suggested architecture helped us improve vehicle and road safety, traffic efficiency, and convenience as well as comfort to both drivers and passengers. Also, we have reduced latency and increased bandwidth. Finally, we have approved the performance of our architecture based on different evaluation metrics.

AB As the vital factor of vehicle behavior understanding and prediction, vehicle taillight recognition is an important technology for autonomous driving, especially in diverse actual traffic scenes full of dynamic interactive traffic participants. However, in practical application, it always faces many challenges, such as `variable lighting conditions', `non-uniform taillight standards' and `random relative observation pose', which lead to few mature solutions in current common autopilot systems. This work proposes an action-state joint learning-based vehicle taillight recognition method on the basis of vehicles detection and tracking, which takes both taillight state features and time series features into account, consequently getting practicable results even in complex actual scenes. In detail, vehicle tracking sequence is used as input and split into pieces through a sliding window. Then, a CNN-LSTM model is applied to simultaneously identify the action features of brake lights and turn signals, dividing taillight actions into five categories: None, Brake_on, Brake_off, Left_turn, Right_turn. Next, the brightness of high-position brake light is extracted through semantic segmentation and combined with taillight actions to form higher-level features for taillight state sequence analysis. Finally, an undirected graph model is used to establish the long-term dependence between successive pieces by analysing the higher-level features, thus inferring the continuous taillight state into: off, brake, left, right. Datasets including daytime, nighttime, congested road, highway, etc. were collected, tested and published in our work to demonstrate its effectiveness and practicability.

DE Trajectory prediction; Autonomous vehicles; Variational autoencoder;
   Diffusion model
AB Accurate prediction of the future motion of surrounding vehicles is crucial for ensuring the safety of motion planning in autonomous vehicles. However, it is challenging to perform because of the complex interactions between vehicles. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal vehicle trajectory prediction framework that utilizes a coarse-to-fine approach by first generating initial trajectory proposals with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and then refining them using the conditional diffusion model. We first address the problems of data sparsity and irregularity by converting the trajectory coordinates to the Frenet coordinate system. To enable the model to better distinguish between different features, we employ a temporal encoder to extract trajectory features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract lane features. The target lane evaluator is utilized to calculate the attention weights for each lane candidate, thereby generating more deterministic future trajectories. We then use the CVAE to generate initial multiple trajectory proposals based on the surrounding scene context and the trajectory features of the target vehicle. Finally, we formulate the trajectory refinement task as a reverse process of the conditional diffusion model, which effectively enhances the multi-modal trajectory proposals. Experiments conducted on Argoverse and nuScenes demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in some evaluation metrics while achieving the optimal trade-off between predictive accuracy and efficiency. Field experiments conducted in urban environments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a data set collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle testbed in the unstructured environment of an underwater cave complex. The vehicle is equipped with two mechanically scanned imaging sonar sensors to simultaneously map the caves horizontal and vertical surfaces, a Doppler velocity log, two inertial measurement units, a depth sensor, and a vertically mounted camera imaging the sea floor for ground truth validation at specific points. The testbed collected the data in July 2013, guided by a human diver, to sidestep autonomous navigation in a complex environment. For ease of use, the original robot operating system bag files are provided together with a version combining imagery and human-readable text files for processing on other environments.

ID TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION; INVERSE
AB Trajectory optimization is performed to generate a flight path passing specified waypoints. To deal with the unspecified time of passing through a waypoint, an auxiliary variable is introduced. Normalization of the time variable by the auxiliary variable transforms the waypoint optimization problem into the conventional optimization problem. The condition for passing through the waypoints can be relaxed, so that the vehicle passes specified waypoints within a certain acceptable range. Sequential quadratic programming is used to solve the optimization problem. As a numerical example, six degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics is considered. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional trajectory optimization problems with several waypoints are solved to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Coastal areas are among the most vulnerable of all regions to global climate change. Projected impacts from global warming include rising sea levels, intensification of tropical cyclones, larger storm surges, increasing sea-surface temperatures, rising sea levels and larger storm surges caused by climate change, etc. These potential hazards threaten human life and property. So, it becomes unavoidable to understand the Ocean systems. Continuous time series observation is essential and development of innovative Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) with suite of sensors would be very necessary. In order to address these ocean related problems, this paper introduces a new approach to the design of such interdisciplinary systems that are functionally complex in structure.

AB This paper investigates the problem of fuel-efficient and safe control of autonomous vehicle platoons. We present a two-part hierarchical control method that can guarantee platoon stability with minimal fuel consumption. The first part vehicle controller is derived in the context of receding horizon optimal control by constructing and solving an optimization problem of overall fuel consumption. The Second part platoon controller is a complementation of the first part, which is given on the basis of platoon stability analysis. The effectiveness of the presented platoon control method is demonstrated by both numerical simulations and experiments with laboratory-scale Arduino cars.

First, an AUV dynamic model is established without external disturbances. Next, the control synthesis includes the H-infinity loop-shaping design, incorporating co-prime factorization perturbations. Then the autopilot controller is reduced to a reasonable order. In addition, the resulting control system has been evaluated extensively in both the frequency and the time domains. Finally, it is found that the proposed vehicle system provides good manoeuvrability over a wide range of operating conditions, even under model uncertainties.

AB Autonomous navigation systems provide the vehicle with estimates of its states without ground support. This work develops an autonomous navigation architecture for lunar transfer using optical sensors and celestial navigation. Measurement and error models are developed for two classes of celestial measurements, the elevation of known stars from the Earth's or moon's limb, and the apparent radius of the Earth or moon. Monte Carlo methods are used to support the development of measurement error models. The proposed architecture is tested with linear covariance techniques; navigation errors and trajectory dispersions are obtained to confirm the feasibility of the approach. The navigation system is required to provide 0.5 deg flight-path angle accuracy at entry interface for mission safety. The simulation results show that the proposed autonomous navigation system meets the reentry safety requirement.

AB This paper presents an integrated guidance and control design scheme for an unmanned air vehicle (UAV), and its flight test results. The paper focuses on the longitudinal control and guidance aspects, with particular emphasis on the terrain-following problem. An introduction to the mission, and the terrain-following problem is given first. Waypoints for climb and descent are defined. Computation of the reference trajectory in the vertical plane is discussed, including a terrain-following (TF) algorithm for real-time calculation of climb/descent points and altitudes. The algorithm is particularly suited for online computation and is therefore useful for autonomous flight. The algorithm computes the height at which the vehicle should fly so that a specified clearance from the underlying terrain is always maintained, while ensuring that the vehicle's rate of climb and rate of descent constraints are not violated. The output of the terrain-following algorithm is used to construct a smooth reference trajectory for the vehicle to track. The design of a robust controller for altitude tracking and stability augmentation of the vehicle is then presented. The controller uses elevators for pitch control in the inner loop, while the reference pitch commands are generated by the outer altitude control loop. The controller tracks the reference trajectory computed by the terrain-following algorithm. The design of an electromechanical actuator for actuating the control surfaces of the vehicle during flight is also discussed. The entire guidance and control scheme is implemented on an actual experimental vehicle and flight test results are presented and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Indoor vehicle localization is an underlying technology for realizing Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP), which demands high accuracy and reliability. However, existing localization technologies, such as GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, suffer from either low availability or high cost, which are not practical in the real world. In order to put AVP into practice, We desperately need an efficient and reliable indoor vehicle localization technology. In this paper, we propose a Deep learning and FM fingerprint map based indoor vehicle Localization method, namely DeFLoc, which leverages FM signals to achieve accurate and practical indoor localization. In order to reduce the workload of the FM fingerprints collecting process, DeFLoc uses partially uniform sampling to decrease sample data volume and reconstructs the FM fingerprint map from collected incomplete fingerprints precisely using a dedicated deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To alleviate the influence of signal distortions in some FM frequencies, we further design smooth layers in the neural network for improving the accuracy of map reconstruction. Moreover, we devise a continuous vehicle localization algorithm by considering the preferences of vehicle movements to assist us to calibrate localization. We implemented a prototype of DeFLoc and conducted extensive experiments both in simulation and practice. Evaluation results show that our proposed reconstruction model improves accuracy by 40% over conventional matrix completion methods even under the 60% data missing rate. With the precisely reconstructed fingerprint map, DeFLoc achieves over 90% localization accuracy, which indicates DeFLoc can realize accurate and practical indoor vehicle localization.

AB The rear-facing seat has become a potential seating configuration for the future autonomous vehicle, therefore the potential injury risk of a rear-facing occupant merits further investigation not only for adults, but also for children. The objectives of this study were to compare the child occupant injury risk on specific body regions in frontal and rear impact, and to investigate the effect of those crash conditions and occupant related factors on the occupant injury risk. Data from the NASS-CDS and CISS were studied for crashes during 2000-2019 involving model year 2000-2020 motor vehicles, including frontal and rear-end collision. The injury risk by specific body regions were compared by descriptive statistics. Logistic regression models were developed to examine the effects of various factors on injury risk, controlling for crash type (frontal impact and rear impact), vehicle impact speed, vehicle impact location, vehicle model year, and occupant gender, age, restraint use, and seating position. After controlling for the confounding factors, the children age 3-17 had higher injury risk than infant and toddler (age 0-2) (at MAIS 2+, OR 8.71, p < 0.001). The child occupant injury risk was higher in frontal impact than in rear impact (at MAIS 2+, OR 4.96, p < 0.001), especially for children age 3-17 with the exception of the MAIS 1+ neck/spine injury risk. This study provided child injury risk references for current vehicle which may provide insight to the potential injury risk of rear-facing child occupant in future vehicle configurations.

AB In this article, we propose a novel predictive strategy for collision avoidance of multiple mobile robots by precisely quantifying the robot's impending collisions. Our proposed approach is based on formulating the collisions by predicting the robots' states and provides generalized safety conditions that are more realistic measures for collisions. This is a novel safety condition that extends the previous methods that use distance or velocity for safety conditions into a more generalized format to effectively avoid underestimating or overestimating the collisions by explicitly considering surrounding objects' motions. We formulate the safety condition based on the robots' motion into a vector format and construct a predictive safety matrix. We then consolidate the safety condition based on the proposed safety matrix's eigenvalues. To effectively incorporate the safety condition into a control design considering uncertainties in the input sensor measurements, we perform uncertainty analysis on our proposed safety condition, the results of which are further used in this article to design a robust collision avoidance and tracking controller. This tracking controller avoids collisions effectively by incorporating the proposed safety condition into a robust tracking control design that is mathematically proven to be stable and guaranteeing safe motion. We show that the proposed safety condition, by effectively quantifying the conflicts among the robots, avoids collisions while achieving improved tracking performance compared to other existing reactive methods. This method is also verified experimentally and is shown to be effective in real-time control with superior tracking performance to the existing methods.

AB As new mobility called automated vehicles (AVs) appears on the road, positive effects are expected, but in fact, unexpected adverse effects may arise due to the mixed traffic situation with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Prior to the commercialization of AVs, a preliminary review and preventive measures are required, and among them, the interaction between the existing vehicle and the new mobility and the interaction with the infrastructure must be considered. Therefore, we propose (i) the positive-negative effect of introducing AVs in a mixed traffic situation and (ii) the optimal operation plan for the dedicated lane for AVs. First, the effect of introducing AVs considering the interaction between vehicles in the mixed traffic situation showed mostly positive such as speed increase, delay time reduction, and capacity increase. However, in a 75% Market Penetration Rate (MPR) environment of all levels of Service (LOS), the effect was diminished compared to the previous MPR. This is contemplated to be the result of a conflict caused by the operation of some HVs (including heavy vehicles) behavior as obstacles in the situation where most of the vehicles on the road are AVs. Based on the previous result, we deployed the dedicated lane to resolve the negative effect in the 75% MPR environment and proposed an optimal operation strategy for the AVs dedicated lane from the perspective of operational efficiency for a more feasible operation. Given the 75% MPR, the Mixed-Use operation strategy of High-Occupancy Vehicles (HOV) and AVs is ascertained as the most suitable operation strategy. This implies that even in the era of AVs, the influence of other vehicles (e.g., heavy vehicles, other mobility) must be considered. This study is significant by considering the negative effects of the introduction of AVs and presenting an optimal operation strategy for dedicated lanes, and it can expect to be used as a new strategy as part of the Free/Expressway Traffic Management System (FTMS) applicable in the era of autonomous driving.

AB As a key technology of autonomous driving, the high-precision vehicle localization is the prerequisite for automatic steer. With the advantage of accuracy and robustness, the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is widely employed in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which has been utilized to provide reliable positioning information. Compared with the experimental vehicles in the restricted laboratory driving circumstances, autonomous vehicles are devoted to actual roads and contain complicated activities, where closed loops can be noticed. In general, the accumulated error may be accumulated with the increasing of maneuver scope of SLAM. A distinct drift phenomenon may thus be incurred in the completed point cloud map and threaten the accuracy of positioning results. Focusing on this deficiency, a tightly-coupled LiDAR inertial odometry, named PDLC-LIO, is developed in this paper towards large-scale environments with close loops. A direct point cloud registration approach without extracting features has been introduced into this framework. Strategies including the pre-integration on the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the direct scan match in local-scale, and an efficient fusion loop closure detection method with conditional detection are included to guarantee the precision. Also, the factor graph optimization is considered, and measurements from LiDAR odometry, IMU and loop closures can thus be integrated into the back-end optimization. The proposed method has been verified on both the public datasets and the test cases collected by our own autonomous driving experiment platform. Accurate experimental results can be obtained. Such results show that the performance including accumulated errors and the drift phenomenon outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms LeGO-LOAM/ LIO-SAM /FAST-LIO2, and the loop closure detection rate can be promoted up to 75%.

AB The four-month mission of a Wave Glider in the Southern Ocean has demonstrated the capability for an autonomous surface vehicle to make sustained measurements of air-sea interactions in remote regions. Several new sensor payloads were integrated for this mission, including a three-axis sonic anemometer for turbulent wind stress estimation and a high-resolution atmospheric pressure gage. The mission focused on Drake Passage, where strong gradients are common along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) fronts. Using satellite data products, pilots ashore were able to remotely navigate the Wave Glider across the ACC Polar Front and measure changes in air-sea coupling. The resulting data set combines the persistence of a mooring with the adaptability of a ship-based survey.

AB Central to the successful operation of an autonomous undersea vehicle (AUV) is the capability to return from a mission, in that there is consistent recovery or docking of the AUV. In addition, some missions may require communication with and power transfer to the AUV after docking. This paper describes an inductive system that provides a nonintrusive power and communications interface between the dock and the AUV. The system makes up to 200 W of ac or de power available to the AUV. The communications interface is 10BaseT ethernet and is platform- and protocol-independent. The overall design of the system is given as well as results from wet laboratory and field tests.

AB Autonomous driving of unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) at road intersection is a challenging task due to the complicated traffic conditions. In this paper, an event-triggered model predictive adaptive dynamic programming (MPADP) algorithm is proposed for path planning of UGV at road intersection. Following the critic-actor scheme of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), cost function approximation and control policy generation are combined to formulate MPADP. The infinite horizon cost function of ADP is stacked over predictive horizon of model predictive control (MPC), and then the infinite horizon cost function is converted to the finite horizon-stacked cost function in MPADP. By minimizing the approximation error within predictive horizon, the approximation accuracy is enhanced. Considering the limitation of energy consumption, the event-triggered mechanism is designed based on the mismatch of cost function approximation. Three triggering conditions are designed, and the corresponding boundedness of approximation error is proved. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness, efficiency and feasibility in application of the event-triggered MPADP method for path planning at road intersection.

TI Emergency Collision Avoidance by Steering in Critical Situations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Collision avoidance; AEB; AES; MPC
AB In this paper, an emergency collision avoidance system is proposed by including not only braking but also steering control actions. The minimum distance to avoid collision is calculated separately for braking and steering based on the relative motion to the surrounding vehicles and the lane information obtained through the vision sensor. For steering avoidance control, an optimal control input is calculated through the model predictive control that satisfies constraints such as safe avoidance region created by surrounding vehicles and capacity of the vehicle actuator. In particular, for avoiding collision by lane changing, the maximum lateral acceleration and the maximum angle of the trajectory are considered. In addition, the abrupt lateral movement in avoidance causes nonlinear characteristics in tires and, thus, tire parameters are estimated through EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) to improve model prediction accuracy. The control intervention time of avoidance maneuvering is determined for braking and steering, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm of integrating AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) and AES (Autonomous Emergency Steering) can effectively avoid the collision in critical situations and that the host vehicle can still maintain the safety inside the road boundary.

It uses wireless broadband connections to support specific end-users and businesses services. It is specifically useful for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), guaranteeing fast connections and security. The 5G network technology can be used to support Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications and applications on autonomous vehicles. It can enable information exchanges between vehicles and other infrastructures and people. It can also provide a more comfortable and safer environment and accurate traffic knowledge. The traffic ?ow can be improved, reducing pollution and accident rates. The cellular network can be associated with V2X as a communicating base to offer enhanced road safety and autonomous driving, and also to offer the IoV connections. This survey presents the 5G technology evolution, standards, and infrastructure associated with V2X ecosystem by IoV. In other words, it presents the IoV supported by 5G V2X communications, considering its architecture, applications and also the V2X features and protocols, as well as the modes, the evaluation and the technological support in such combination. The contribution of this paper is a systematized study about the interaction among these three contents: IoV, 5G, and V2X. Eighty four works were selected to present concepts, standards and to identify the ways to overcome challenges. This survey aims to guide the development of new 5G-V2X services and technologies dedicated to vehicle communications, and also to indicate future directions.

AB In a context in which the connectivity level of last-generation vehicles is constantly on the rise, the combined use of Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) connectivity and autonomous driving can provide remarkable benefits through the synergistic optimization of the route and the speed trajectory. In this framework, this paper focuses on vehicle ecodriving optimization in a connected environment: the virtual test rig of a premium segment passenger car was used for generating the simulation scenarios and to assess the benefits, in terms of energy and time savings, that the introduction of V2X communication, integrated with cloud computing, can have in a real-world scenario. The Reference Scenario is a predefined Real Driving Emissions (RDE) compliant route, while the simulation scenarios were generated by assuming two different penetration levels of V2X technologies. The associated energy minimization problem was formulated and solved by means of a Variable Grid Dynamic Programming (VGDP), that modifying the variable state search grid on the basis of the V2X information allows to drastically reduce the DP computation burden by more than 95%. The simulations show that introducing a smart infrastructure along with optimizing the vehicle speed in a real-world urban route can potentially reduce the required energy by 54% while shortening the travel time by 38%. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the biobjective optimization cost function to find a set of Pareto optimal solutions, between energy and travel time minimization.

Thus, those models cannot be robust. This paper aims to break this limitation and builds a lane change prediction model for surrounding vehicles based on machine learning methods. The lane change prediction model contains a basic model and an adaptive model: the basic model is a long short-term memory (LSTM) based prediction model which reflects the decision-making mode for drivers; the adaptive prediction model embeds an adaptive decision threshold on the basic model, and the threshold updates by Bayesian Inference method on time. We prove the performance of the adaptive model based on the HighD dataset, and the results are inspiring that the model achieves 93.64-97.52% accuracies for target-vehicle in the left adjacent lane and 94.30-98.01% accuracies for target-vehicle in the right adjacent lane. Besides, our proposed model is capable of different driving environments, especially when the traditional LSTM method cannot capture drivers' lane change decision well. Because of the timeliness and transferability nature of our proposed model, this model could be applied to the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles in the future to reduce driving perception errors.

AB This paper proposes novel distributed control methods to address coverage and flocking problems in three-dimensional (3D) environments using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Two classes of coverage problems are considered in this work, namely barrier and sweep problems. Additionally, the approach is also applied to general 3D flocking problems for advanced swarm behavior. The proposed control strategies adopt a region-based control approach based on Voronoi partitions to ensure collision-free self-deployment and coordinated movement of all vehicles within a 3D region. It provides robustness for the multi-vehicle system against vehicles' failure. It is also computationally-efficient to ensure scalability, and it handles obstacle avoidance on a higher level to avoid conflicts in control with the inter-vehicle collision avoidance objective. The problem formulation is rather general considering mobile robots navigating in 3D spaces, which makes the proposed approach applicable to different UAV types and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, implementation details have also been shown considering quadrotor-type UAVs for an example application in precision agriculture. Validation of the proposed methods have been performed using several simulations considering different simulation platforms such as MATLAB and Gazebo. Software-in-the-loop simulations were carried out to asses the real-time computational performance of the methods showing the actual implementation with quadrotors using C++ and the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Good results were obtained validating the performance of the suggested methods for coverage and flocking scenarios in 3D using systems with different sizes up to 100 vehicles. Some scenarios considering obstacle avoidance and robustness against vehicles' failure were also used.

TI Event-triggered optimisation of overtaking decision-making strategy for
   autonomous driving on highway
SO IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID LANE; MODEL; VEHICLES
AB Appropriate overtaking can improve the safety and efficiency of driving. Practically, overtaking consists of two asymmetric lane-changes: firstly to the left lane and then return back. Existing literatures treated the two lane-changes as the same behaviour, which may result in frequent and unnecessary lane-changes. For the more complex first lane-change, discretionary lane-change strategies have been developed to gain speed advantage with least deceleration. Most of them, however, described vehicles' dynamics with rough simplifications different from actual execution (e.g. constant speed and constant acceleration), which may fail them in practical applications. This paper presents an event-triggered overtaking decision-making strategy for autonomous vehicles to make the overtaking meet the driver's expectations. Firstly, the difference between the left-lane change and right-lane change is analysed. Left-lane change is mainly concerned with the efficiency, whereas driving safety is the main target of the right-lane change. Secondly, an event-triggering condition covering the speed difference between the ego vehicle and its preceding vehicle is set. Afterwards, based on quantified speed advantage, considering surrounding vehicles' changes in both speed and acceleration, an optimisation of overtaking decision-making strategy is proposed. During right-lane change in an overtaking, safety is ensured by predicting whether the ego vehicle will collide with surrounding vehicles. Finally, several scenarios are defined in the combination of SCANeR studio and Simulink, which are used to test and demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the overtaking decision-making strategy. The results show that the proposed overtaking decision-making strategy, by mathematical quantification of speed advantage, performs well in measuring the motivation of lane-change and avoiding frequent lane changes, which correspond to driver habits.

AB This letter considers a remote control Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV), where packets carrying sensory data and control information are sent through a time-correlated wireless fading channel. We illustrate there is an inherent dependency between the data rate and the resulting control accuracy for such a system. We propose a goal-oriented wireless solution, in which data transmission rate is continuously adapted according to Age-of-Loop metric to achieve precise remote trajectory control of an AGV. The numerical analysis shows that the proposed solution provides higher control accuracy at the AGV trajectory compared to straightforward fixed-rate transmission policies, and to a reference solution based on Age-of-Information metric, more commonly used in research of wireless networked control systems.

AB A nonlinear image-based visual servo control approach for pipeline following of fully-actuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) is proposed. It makes use of the binormalized Plucker coordinates of the pipeline borders detected in the image plane as feedback information while the system dynamics are exploited in a cascade manner in the control design. Unlike conventional solutions that consider only the system kinematics, the proposed control scheme accounts for the full system dynamics in order to obtain an enlarged provable stability domain. Control robustness with respect to model uncertainties and external disturbances is reinforced using integral corrections. Robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach are illustrated via both realistic simulations and experimental results on a real AUV.

AB In order to improve the continuity and smoothness of transpolar flight and optimize autonomous navigation performance, a SINS/SRS/CNS (strapdown inertial navigation system/spectral redshift navigation system/celestial navigation system) multi-information fusion global autonomous navigation method based on parameter conversion was studied for this article. The global autonomous navigation scheme based on multi-information fusion was designed. The principle of spectral redshift navigation was studied. On this basis, the system equations of the SINS/SRS/CNS multi-information fusion global autonomous navigation system were established in the middle-low latitudes and high latitudes. Furthermore, the navigation and filter parameter conversion relationships between the geographic navigation coordinate frame and the grid navigation coordinate frame were derived. The simulation and experiment verified that the SINS/SRS/CNS multi-information fusion global autonomous navigation method with parameter conversion can effectively improve the accuracy and smoothness and realize non-oscillation switching in transpolar navigation. In the vehicle experiment, the proposed algorithm improved the horizontal position accuracy by more than 29% compared with the multi-information fusion global autonomous navigation method without filter parameter conversion.

AB Undersampling of the coastal oceans remains a persistent problem for standard oceanographic measurement practice wherein an instrument package is tethered to a research vessel. The overhead costs associated,with operating a large research vessel impose a strict minimum on the cost of data collected Owing to the overheads, significant improvements in sampling technology on the tethered platform can only produce modest gains in the cost effectiveness. In contrast, untethered vehicles if operated simultaneously! have the potential to increase cost effectiveness significantly by distributing the overhead costs over several sampling platforms. Furthermore, synoptic and pseudosynoptic data can be collected with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), thereby providing the type of information critical to dynamic process modeling unattainable with non-synoptic data. While the goal of simultaneous multiple-vehicle operation has been espoused over the last few years, A UV technology and practice have until recently beer? too immature to realize that potential. Recently, Florida Atlantic University (FAU) has developed a new series of modular AUT's with the express purpose of supporting multiple sensors and multiple-vehicle operation. This series of vehicle is called the Ocean Explorer of which three have been produced so far. This paper will explore some of the associated navigation, tracking, control and deployment problems associated with multiple-vehicle operation in coastal applications. In addition, the characteristics of the component level intelligent distributed control system, integrated data logger and vehicle control system will be discussed. III particular this paper will discuss how FAU has applied the concepts of elastic constraint propagation and the symmetric fuzzy decision-making model to AUV control systems. Some results of early experiments in synoptic data collection with a conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) sensor using multiple AUVs for the determination of horizontal structure will be described.

AB This paper presents a method to design an integrated path tracking and lateral stability controller for an autonomous electric vehicle with four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) on low friction roads. Recent advances in autonomous driving have led to extensive studies on path tracking control. However, path tracking is difficult on low friction roads. In this paper, path tracking control was converted to the yaw rate tracking one to cope with problems caused by low friction roads. To generate a reference yaw rate for path tracking, we present several methods using a driver model and a target path. For yaw rate tracking, we designed a controller with a two-layer control hierarchy, i.e., upper and lower layers. The control yaw moment was calculated using a direct yaw moment controller in the upper layer. In the low layer, a control allocation method was adopted to allocate the control yaw moment into steering angles of 4WIS. To verify the performance of the proposed controller, we conducted a simulation on vehicle simulation software. From the simulation results, it is shown that the proposed controller is effective for path tracking and lateral stability on low friction roads. To analyze path tracking and lateral stability performance of the proposed controller on low friction roads, the effects of the steady-state yaw rate gain are investigated from the simulation results.

AB The paper proposes a general framework for the assessment of the impacts of the introduction of Connected and Automated Transport Systems (CATS) on traffic. The main objective is to address the question of scalability and transferability of the identified impacts of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in particular, focusing on network performance of urban areas. A combination of microscopic and macroscopic simulations as well as statistical methods are applied. Microscopic simulation is conducted to measure the changes in network capacities by utilizing the concept of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), under different AV penetration rates. The resulting capacities are used to estimate the effects on the Passenger Car Units (PCU) under different AV penetration rates and derive functional relationships, which are further introduced to travel demand models to forecast the macroscopic impacts on network performance. The results indicate a positive impact in relation to capacity changes resulting from the presence of AVs which vary with penetration rate. Analysis of three different urban networks, Barcelona, Bilbao (Spain), and Athens (Greece), reveals consistent trends. However, notable differences are observed on the estimated PCUs for Athens, potentially because of the different mixed-traffic composition. Further exploration of the critical AV modeling specifications and network characteristics is therefore required for deriving transferable PCU functional relationships across networks. Nevertheless, the static assignment results verify the expected trends in network performance impacts in relation to the applied PCU relationships. Finally, the transferability of the proposed methodology across networks is demonstrated.

AB This paper introduces an autonomous system employing multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles for fast 3D exploration and inspection of vast, unknown, dynamic, and complex environments containing large open spaces as well as narrow passages. The system exploits the advantage of small-size aerial vehicles capable of carrying all necessary sensors and computational power while providing full autonomy and mobility in constrained unknown environments. Particular emphasis is put on the robustness of the algorithms with respect to challenging real-world conditions and the real-time performance of all algorithms that enable fast reactions to changes in environment and thus also provide effective use of limited flight time. The system presented here was employed as a part of a heterogeneous ground and aerial system in the modeled Search & Rescue scenario in an unfinished nuclear power plant during the Urban Circuit of the Subterranean Challenge (SubT Challenge) organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The main goal of this simulated disastrous scenario is to autonomously explore and precisely localize specified objects in a completely unknown environment and to report their position before the end of the mission. The proposed system was part of the multirobot team that finished in third place overall and in first place among the self-funded teams. The proposed unmanned aerial vehicle system outperformed all aerial systems participating in the SubT Challenge with respect to versatility, and it was also the self-deployable autonomous aerial system that explored the largest part of the environment.

AB Autonomous and connected cars (ACCs), together with edge computing (EC), have been recognized as a promising solution to achieve green intelligent transportation for smart cities. This paper aims to address short-term traffic prediction, a fundamental enabler for the success of ACC applications, under the European Telecommunications Standards Institute multiaccess EC (MEC) architecture that exhibits constraints different from conventional cloud computing. First, a data-centric experiment platform is designed and implemented to facilitate traffic prediction algorithm development. This paper further proposes a novel short-term traffic prediction model that integrates a traffic light model and a vehicle velocity model, considering limited computing resources of MEC servers. We note that the effects of traffic lights are complicated and have not been rigorously examined in most, if not all, of the related work. This work models the queueing time when a driver arrives at a road intersection and faces a red light. Moreover, to forecast the vehicle velocity, we propose a novel low-complexity semiparametric prediction model considering periodic features and spatial/temporal correlations of dynamic road events. The experiment results demonstrate that our vehicle-velocity prediction model achieves almost equivalent accuracy to the well-known Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network model, requiring much lower computational complexity. Our experiment results also confirm that since our integrated model pays attention to the traffic-light effects and the individual driver behavior, it can more effectively capture the real-time changes of traffic conditions.

AB In this brief, a non-identical gain based control design scheme is proposed to stabilise balanced collective formation in multi-vehicle systems, modelled with non-holonomic unicycle dynamics. Balanced collective formation refers to a situation in which the vehicles' motion causes their positional centroid to become stationary. This study mainly focuses on achieving stable balanced collective formation about the prescribed location of the collective centroid along with desired orientations of the vehicles. It is assumed that the vehicles are moving in a force field which is controlled externally. The proposed control algorithm consists of two controls - one of the controls, pertaining to the external force field, is directly applied to the system, and assumes the same value for all the vehicles. While the other control, which operates with heterogeneous gains, provides the steering force to the vehicles and is derived using Lyapunov analysis. Theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

AB In navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the estimation of position is an important issue, especially, when the sensors such as gyroscopes contain a lot of noise, and the velocity information of Doppler velocity log (DVL) is affected by the motion attitude of the vehicle. In this paper, based on an improved auto regressive (AR) model, a real-time filter is utilized for gyroscope signal de-noising. Meanwhile, according to the characteristics of the AUV, the influence of the vehicle attitude on the DVL velocity measurement error is analyzed and a motion attitude assist (MAA) method based on error model is introduced for enhancing DVL velocity accuracy. In this paper, using the proposed hybrid approach, an inertial navigation system (INS)/DVL integrated navigation system is designed. The proposed approach is evaluated by simulation and experimental test in different acceleration bound, and the existence of the DVL outage for an AUV. The results indicate that the precisions of the velocity and position are improved effectively, especially in complex motion attitude and long sailing conditions.

AB Robot machine capture protein seafood like sea cucumber and seashell is expected to play a great role in food economy improvement and divers protection. In order to realize robot capture, a sea organism absorptive type remotely operated vehicle (ROV) has been designed with the pilot operation and vision-based autonomous capture modes. A novel region-based fully convolutional network with deformable convolutional networks has been developed to realize organism target recognition. The comparisons in offline experiments have verified its advantages. In order to realize organism target following and capture control, a novel learning-based type-II fuzzy controller has been developed. Through online fuzzy rule optimization and learning, the controller can realize organism target following and capture control under image coordinate without vehicle horizontal velocity or position information in the complicated submarine environment. Field trials have been made in the Zhangzidao Island of China with the designed absorptive type ROV. The trials manifest that the designed absorptive type ROV can realize online organism target recognition, following and capture in the real submarine environment.

AB Navigation and guidance systems are a critical part of any autonomous vehicle. In this paper, a novel sensor grid using 40 KHz ultrasonic transmitters is presented for adoption in indoor 3D positioning applications. In the proposed technique, a vehicle measures the arrival time of incoming ultrasonic signals and calculates the position without broadcasting to the grid. This system allows for conducting silent or covert operations and can also be used for the simultaneous navigation of a large number of vehicles. The transmitters and receivers employed are first described. Transmission lobe patterns and receiver directionality determine the geometry of transmitter clusters. Range and accuracy of measurements dictate the number of sensors required to navigate in a given volume. Laboratory experiments were performed in which a small array of transmitters was set up and the sensor system was tested for position accuracy. The prototype system is shown to have a 1-sigma position error of about 16 cm, with errors between 7 and 11 cm in the local horizontal coordinates. This research work provides foundations for the future development of ultrasonic navigation sensors for a variety of autonomous vehicle applications.

AB Accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories is crucial to the safety and comfort of autonomous vehicles. Although several graph-based models have exhibited substantial progress in acquiring spatiotemporal dependencies among vehicles in the driving environment, the potential for additional exploration in this domain persists. The main reason is that they concentrated on independently capturing the spatial relations and temporal dependencies, neglecting to incorporate the temporal feature into the spatial feature for co-training, which limits their ability to yield satisfactory predictive accuracy. Typically, spatial and temporal correlations are coupled and should be modeled jointly. Inspired by this, a novel dynamic graph neural network with spatial-temporal synchronization (STS-DGNN) for vehicle trajectory prediction is proposed, which constructs the driving scene as dynamic graphs and can jointly extract spatial-temporal features. Specifically, low-order and high-order dynamics of vehicle trajectories are considered collaboratively in a one-stage framework rather than independently modeling the spatial relationship and temporal correlations of vehicles in two-stage models. The proposed model also considers the dynamic nature of graph sequence by utilizing gate recurrent unit (GRU) to update the graph neural network (GNN) parameters dynamically. The spatial-temporal features are subsequently conveyed to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and processed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to generate the ultimate trajectories. Finally, to illustrate the effectiveness of the STSDGNN model, the model is assessed on three well-known datasets, namely highD, EWAP, and UCY. The results confirm that our model performs better at making predictions than cuttingedge models. The visualization results intuitively explain that our method can extract sophisticated and subtle multivehicle interactions, resulting in accurate predictions.

AB Motorists' fatalities and the fatality rate (roadway deaths per vehicle-mile traveled (VMT)) tend to decrease during recessions. Using a novel data set of individual drivers, we establish that recessions have differential impacts on driving behavior by decreasing the VMT of observably risky drivers, such as those over age 60, and by increasing the VMT of observably safer drivers. The compositional shift toward safer drivers associated with a one percentage point increase in unemployment would save nearly 5000 lives per year nationwide. This finding suggests that policymakers could generate large benefits by targeting new driver-assistance technology at vulnerable groups.

ID OUTPUT-FEEDBACK CONTROL; STABILIZATION; GUIDANCE; VEHICLES
AB The lane keeping system (LKS), a promising driver assistance system, is essential for autonomous vehicles. In real-world road conditions, it can be quite challenging because LKS must stay within the lane without causing passenger discomfort while both disturbances (e.g., road curvature, wind gusts, and hydroplaning) and model uncertainties in parameters [e.g., vehicle mass, center of gravity (CG), and tire cornering stiffness] are present. In this paper, the performance limits and tradeoffs between three performance criteria (lane tracking, stability robustness, and passenger comfort) are first investigated by exploring the entire design space of three prominent controllers, i.e., proportional-integral-derivative, linear-quadratic-Gaussian, and H-infinity (H-infinity). Then, a sensitivity study on the vehicle parameters is conducted in order to investigate the impact of the parameters on the three performance metrics. Based on the aforementioned studies, this paper concludes that a robust controller can provide the maximum performance limit with respect to the lane tracking and stability robustness, when properly designed. However, it is observed that the robust controller is still sensitive to a few design and model parameters, such as look-ahead distance and CG. Therefore, the sensitivity study suggests that for vehicles with excessive mass and CG changes, such as SUVs and trucks, the adaptation of controller and look-ahead distance may be necessary to maximize both tracking performance and passenger comfort over a wide range of vehicle speeds.

DE Probabilistic planning; safety-preserving controller; backward
   reachability analysis; vehicle model predictive control; human-robot
   interaction
AB Action anticipation, intent prediction, and proactive behavior are all desirable characteristics for autonomous driving policies in interactive scenarios. Paramount, however, is ensuring safety on the road: a key challenge in doing so is accounting for uncertainty in human driver actions without unduly impacting planner performance. This article introduces a minimally interventional safety controller operating within an autonomous vehicle control stack with the role of ensuring collision-free interaction with an externally controlled (e.g., human-driven) counterpart while respecting static obstacles such as a road boundary wall. We leverage reachability analysis to construct a real-time (100 Hz) controller that serves the dual role of (i) tracking an input trajectory from a higher-level planning algorithm using model predictive control, and (ii) assuring safety by maintaining the availability of a collision-free escape maneuver as a persistent constraint regardless of whatever future actions the other car takes. A full-scale steer-by-wire platform is used to conduct traffic-weaving experiments wherein two cars, initially side-by-side, must swap lanes in a limited amount of time and distance, emulating cars merging onto/off of a highway. We demonstrate that, with our control stack, the autonomous vehicle is able to avoid collision even when the other car defies the planner's expectations and takes dangerous actions, either carelessly or with the intent to collide, and otherwise deviates minimally from the planned trajectory to the extent required to maintain safety.

AB This study aims to present a method to analyze the problems that arise from the increasing use of shared mobility systems to solve the current problems of congestion. The use of shared and/or autonomous vehicles (SAVs) is beneficial since it could reduce the number of vehicles on the roads. On the other hand, the increased usage of SAVs to fulfill the same transportation needs would affect the total life of those vehicles. Current cost models are based on average values and life cycles of 15 years; they may not be useful in the case of increased daily travel miles of vehicles when subscription-based shared mobility systems become prevalent. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework which considers the interactions of new cost structures and the system performance under new mobility schemes. This paper envisions the scenarios that will exemplify the importance of considering the changing costs because of the increased mileage of vehicles. Cost functions are properly designed to assess the new scenarios, a pricing scheme is introduced from the service provider's point of view to adjust the demand for the services and the profits, an agent-based simulation platform is presented, and a framework is demonstrated to consider the interactions and optimize the system.

AB This paper quantifies the safety benefits of a proposed near real-time traffic control system for highway-rail grade crossing (HRGC) utilizing emerging safety technologies in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV). The connected-vehicle technologies that have applications at a railroad crossing include vehicle-based technologies (railroad crossing violation warning, automated or semi-automated braking system, drowsiness/distracted driver alert) and technologies that require cooperation from the railroad industry (advanced warnings to trains about an occupied crossing). This paper provides a methodology to quantify the reduction in crashes as safety technologies become prevalent. It first identifies crash characteristics that enable the classification of crashes as preventable crashes or not. This classification is used to train machine learning models to estimate the likelihood of a potential crash being preventable. The machine learning model is used along with the zero inflated negative binomial with empirical Bayes system (ZINEBS) model to estimate the expected accident count at a crossing when a percentage of vehicles in the traffic stream is CAV. This paper presents case studies for three crossings to show the reduction in crashes with the increase in the percentage of connected vehicles in the traffic stream. It also presents the general trend in the reduction expected by analyzing 50 crossings of each warning device type.

ID CHALLENGES; ISSUES
AB Recently, numerous vehicles have been installed with an autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system for protecting pedestrians. This system helps in avoiding or reducing accidents by alerting the driver and controlling the automatic brake actuator before an accident. Moreover, the European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) has stipulated AEB pedestrian systems as a standard requirement since 2016. This paper presents pedestrian target selection using a funnelmap for a pedestrian AEB system. The concept of target selection is based on crash probability calculations by comparing the pedestrian's predicted position and the current position to deduce the vehicle speed before an accident occurs. It is necessary to allow early breaking to avoid an accident. To determine the precise warning and brake timing, the warning distance is calculated using the vehicle and sensor fusion information. The pedestrian target selection algorithm is tested using a real vehicle on a test track in three different scenarios for the Euro NCAP using a pedestrian dummy authorized by the Euro NCAP. Upon comparing the results before and after the application of the proposed algorithm, the longitudinal distance is shown to have a maximum margin of 1.5 m, and the vehicle speed has a maximum reduction effect of 24.7 km/h. Test results show that the proposed pedestrian AEB system can avoid or mitigate an accident when the vehicle travels at speeds up to 40 km/h.

AB Object detection using remote sensing data is a key task of the perception systems of self-driving vehicles. While many generic deep learning architectures have been proposed for this problem, there is little guidance on their suitability when using them in a particular scenario such as autonomous driving. In this work, we aim to assess the performance of existing 2D detection systems on a multi-class problem (vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists) with images obtained from the on-board camera sensors of a car. We evaluate several one-stage (RetinaNet, FCOS, and YOLOv3) and two-stage (Faster R-CNN) deep learning meta-architectures under different image resolutions and feature extractors (ResNet, ResNeXt, Res2Net, DarkNet, and MobileNet). These models are trained using transfer learning and compared in terms of both precision and efficiency, with special attention to the real-time requirements of this context. For the experimental study, we use the Waymo Open Dataset, which is the largest existing benchmark. Despite the rising popularity of one-stage detectors, our findings show that two-stage detectors still provide the most robust performance. Faster R-CNN models outperform one-stage detectors in accuracy, being also more reliable in the detection of minority classes. Faster R-CNN Res2Net-101 achieves the best speed/accuracy tradeoff but needs lower resolution images to reach real-time speed. Furthermore, the anchor-free FCOS detector is a slightly faster alternative to RetinaNet, with similar precision and lower memory usage.

ID PREDICTIVE CONTROL; STEERING CONTROL
AB If the driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle is similar to that of a skilled driver, the human driver can extricate himself from fatigue operation and the comfort of passengers can also be guaranteed. Therefore, this paper studies the human-like lane-changing model of an autonomous vehicle. The lane-changing characteristic data of skilled drivers are collected and analyzed through a real vehicle test. Then, comparing the MPC-based driver model with the steering wheel angle of human drivers, we found that the MPC-based model could hardly reflect the maneuvering characteristics of human drivers, so we proposed a driver model with steering wheel angle continuity for human drivers. This paper uses four neural network models to compare the prediction on the test set, then uses different input types to compare the prediction accuracy of the model, and finally verifies the generalization ability of the model on the verification set. These three test results show that the prediction results of the human-like lane-changing driving model based on Bi-LSTM are closest to the real steering wheel angle sequence of skilled drivers. The test results demonstrate that the Bi-LSTM-based human-like lane-changing driving model achieves 9.8% RMSE and 6.8% MAE, which improves 10.8% RMSE and 10.3% MAE over LSTM. The model can generate the steering wheel angle sequence in the process of lane changing like a human, so as to realize the human simulation control of an autonomous vehicle for lane-changing conditions.

AB Day by day, new intelligent systems and autonomous machines are being developed to help and assist humans in a myriad of activities ranging from smart manufacturing to smart cities. Such new-generation intelligent systems need to work in teams and communicate with humans and other agents/robots to share information and coordinate activities. Furthermore, there is an increasing demand from government agencies and the private sector alike to use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for tasks including search and rescue, surveillance, and monitoring. As these intelligent systems have to interact with humans in several scenarios involving multi-agent collaboration, data collection, and decision-making, it is urgent to discuss the technical as well as the ethical aspects in their design and function. Hence, ontology-based models for this Robotics and Automation (R&A) domain have the potential to enable a clear communication among the different intelligent systems and stakeholders, the formulations of standards, and the building of AI-based and robotics systems with full alignment with what stakeholders expect from these intelligent systems, in terms of economical benefits and enhanced human well-being.

AB Navigation capability in complex and unknown outdoor environments is one of the major requirements for an autonomous vehicle and a robot that perform tasks such as a military mission or planetary exploration. Robust traversability estimation in unknown environments would allow the vehicle or the robot to devise control and planning strategies to maximize their effectiveness. In this study, we present a self-supervised on-line learning architecture to estimate the traversability in complex and unknown outdoor environments. The proposed approach builds a model by clustering appearance data using the newly proposed incremental non-parametric Bayesian clustering algorithm. The clusters are then classified as being either traversable or non-traversable. Because our approach effectively groups unknown regions with similar properties, while the vehicle is in motion without human intervention, the vehicle can be deployed to new environments by automatically adapting to changing environmental conditions. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed clustering algorithm through intensive experiments using synthetic and real data and evaluate the viability of the traversability estimation using real data sets collected in outdoor environment.

TI Platooning Strategy for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Transition
   from Light Traffic
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; MODEL
AB This study presents a strategy for platoon formation and evolution of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in free-flow traffic. The proposed strategy is based on swarm intelligence, which describes bird flocking, fish schooling, and so on, in natural and artificial systems. In this concept, CAVs behave according to some rules to move together as a platoon without collisions. The rules are expressed by a spring-mass-damper system: CAV platoon formation and evolution are controlled by the spring constant and damping coefficient. Valid domains of these control parameters were derived on the basis of physical vehicle properties (e.g., bounded acceleration and deceleration) for realistic control. Furthermore, various relationships-maximum (in which the spring constant was set at its maximum for the given flow), quadratic, and cubic-between the control parameters and traffic flow were examined with simulations to obtain insight into desirable control parameter settings. The results suggest that the most efficient platooning can be achieved by the maximum relationship between the spring constant and flow with critical damping. However, the cubic relationship coupled with overdamping is more desirable in low-flow states to allow more freedom for vehicles to change lanes.

AB In this paper we address the stabilization of the attitude and position of a birotor miniUAV to perform autonomous flight. For this purpose, we have implemented a Kalman-based sensor fusion between inertial sensors (gyros-accelerometers) and the optical flow (OF) provided by the vehicle. This fusion algorithm extracts the translational-OF (TOF) component and discriminates the rotational OF (ROF). The aircraft's position is obtained through an object detection algorithm (centroid tracking). Newton-Euler motion equations were used to deduce the mathematical model of the vehicle. In terms of control we have employed a saturated-based control to stabilize the state of the aircraft around the origin. Experimental autonomous flight was successfully achieved, which validates the sensing strategy as well as the embedded control law.

AB In order to achieve better trajectory tracking of intelligent vehicle on different road surfaces, which include underling the weather of rain and snow, an adaptive tire cornering stiffness strategy (ACS) and a trajectory tracking autonomous steering control strategy were proposed in this paper. Firstly, the tire-road friction coefficient estimator was designed to obtain the tire-road friction coefficient based on Bi-LSTM neural network, then combining the tire cornering stiffness coefficient by fuzzy controller to obtain the online tire cornering stiffness. Secondly, considering the uncertainty of tire cornering stiffness, a trajectory tracking upper-level controller based on model predictive control (MPC) algorithm was proposed to calculate the optimal front wheel angle. Thirdly, in order to better adapt to various road conditions, a dynamic equivalent stiffness model is proposed to replace the self-aligning torque model during vehicle steering, and a lower-level controller for pinion gear target position tracking was designed based on the sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm. In addition, this paper also designed a dual-motor control strategy, which cooperates with the pinion gear target position tracking lower-level controller to quickly and accurately achieve the target front wheel angle. Finally, the simulation and HiL test results show that the proposed control algorithm greatly improves the trajectory tracking accuracy and stability of the intelligent vehicle on roads with different tire-road friction coefficients.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to significantly reshape urban mobility. Whether advancements at vehicle level also translate into positive environmental outcomes at city level is still uncertain. We investigate under which conditions a city could enable low emission AV mobility and what challenges are to be expected along the way from an environmental point of view. We build upon our recent environmental performance study of Vienna and combine city organizational life cycle assessment (city-OLCA) with AV transport models from literature for three AV use cases: an own AV, a shared AV, and a shared AV ride service. Most cases lower Vienna's passenger capacity (by up to 28%) and increase motorized road traffic by a maximum of 49% (own AVs). Traffic relief is observed for shared AVs (-40%) if accompanied by a conventional car ban. This case reduces transport related GHG emissions compared to both Vienna's current baseline (-60%) and a future electrified transportation system (-4.2%). These transformations have also shifted emission responsibility to the public level. While Vienna's total GHG emissions could be reduced by 12%, the city's emission responsibility increases from 25% to 32%. Efficient mass transit, the electrification of the mobility sector and grid decarbonization are key to reducing transport emissions in Vienna. The direction of GHG emission development will be determined by the extent to which these conditions are promoted. AV mobility probably will not be a main contributor.

AB This study examined the transition from Traditional Vehicles (TVs) to Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) using microsimulation modelling approaches. For this purpose, the study first optimised the parameters of human driving behaviours to find out what would happen if AVs could drive with modified human behaviours. Then, the study acquired the optimised driving behaviours to evaluate how efficient AVs can be within the context of the anticipated driving behaviours. The shared road of AVs and TVs was tested for where the proportion of the AVs incremented by 10% from an entirely traditional network to a network fully occupied by AVs. Such an assessment of the shared road represented the transition periods between TVs and AVs in highway transport. Overall, the simulation results in this study indicated that AVs could substantially improve the quality of traffic, especially by reducing the number of stops, queue length, and delay time. The study also found that TVs and AVs can efficiently share their road, and the improvement in the quality of traffic increases with an increase in the proportion of AVs to TVs, up to a specific level, on the road. In this regard, according to the results from the peak and normal traffic conditions, a road with a 60% share of AVs can see its traffic quality improved as much as a road entirely populated by AVs. Therefore, dedicating 100% of the road traffic to AVs or devoting a dedicated lane for AVs in peak traffic hours might be as efficient as a shared road with 60% AVs.

AB With the rapid development of the vehicle chassis control and autonomous driving technology, it is more and more urgent to realize the active steering technology of autonomous driving stability control. Under emergency conditions, the adhesion constraints, the model uncertainty, and the strong nonlinearity of vehicle bring great challenges to active steering control. In this paper, a model predictive control method for an active steering system based on a nonlinear vehicle model is proposed to solve the problems of adhesion constraint, model uncertainty, and external disturbance in the active steering system. Based on the real-time measurement of vehicle state, a new optimization method is proposed in this paper, which has good performance in dealing with the uncertainty and nonlinearity of the model. The control method transforms the constraint problem into quadratic programming and nonlinear programming. In order to ensure the control accuracy when the vehicle enters the nonlinear area, the control model is built with the combination of the nonlinear tire model and the 2DOF model. The control model is built based on Simulink, and the effectiveness of the controller is the verified joint simulation of Simulink and CarSim. The hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test bench based on LabVIEW RT is built and tested in order to verify the feasibility and real effect of the controller. Simulation and HIL test results demonstrate that, compared with PID controller, the model predictive controller can accomplish the driving task well and improve the vehicle handling stability.

AB This article examines autonomous reconnaissance in a complex urban environment using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Environments with many buildings and other types of obstacles and/or an uneven terrain are harder to be explored as occlusion of objects of interest may often occur. First, in this article, the problem of autonomous reconnaissance in a complex urban environment via a swarm of UAVs is formulated. Then, the algorithm based on the metaheuristic approach is proposed for a solution. This solution lies in deploying a number of waypoints in the area of interest to be explored, from which the monitoring is performed, and planning the routes for available UAVs among these waypoints so that the monitored area is as large as possible and the operation as short as possible. In the last part of this article, two types of main experiments based on computer simulations are designed to verify the proposed algorithms. The first type focuses on comparing the results achieved on the benchmark instances with the optimal solutions. The second one presents and discusses the results obtained from a number of scenarios, which are based on typical reconnaissance operations in real environments.

AB A concept of a small and simple Lunar rover weighing 450 kg was studied to define mission and system baseline as well as technological feasibility. The rover is carried to the nearside of a point on the Moon where a precise map is given before the landing. Radio link to the Earth stations is almost always kept. Teleoperation from the Earth is the basic control mode for this system, though the autonomous navigational capability is provided for backup and experimental purpose.
   The primary objective of this mission is the scientific exploration and experiment to investigate the potential of lunar resources utilization in a broad sense.
   This paper also introduces an actural vehicle with a laser imaging sensor, to demonstrate the feasibility of the navigation concept. This vehicle can move either in teleoperation mode or in autonomous mode. In autonomous mode, after the reception of the global path transmitted from Earth, the rover autonomously senses the terrain, plans the travelling path and moves itself along the path.
   Results of the driving test under the two modes in the simulated natural terrain indicated that they worked well. A data processing from the acquisition of terrain to path planning has been functionally executed and the basic part of the autonomous navigation has shown its feasibility, and teleoperation method as well.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being extensively tested on public roads in several states in the USA, such as California, Florida, Nevada, and Texas. AV utilization is expected to increase into the future, given rapid advancement and development in sensing and navigation technologies. This will eventually lead to a decline in human driving. AVs are generally believed to mitigate crash frequency, although the repercussion of AVs on crash severity is ambiguous. For the data-driven and transparent deployment of AVs in California, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (CA DMV) commissioned AV manufacturers to draft and publish reports on disengagements and crashes. This study performed a comprehensive assessment of CA DMV data from 2014 to 2019 from a safety standpoint, and some trends were discerned. The results show that decrement in automated disengagements does not necessarily imply an improvement in AV technology. Contributing factors to the crash severity of an AV are not clearly defined. To further understand crash severity in AVs, the features and issues with data are identified and discussed using different machine learning techniques. The CA DMV accident report data were utilized to develop a variety of crash AV severity models focusing on the injury for all crash typologies. Performance metrics were discussed, and the bagging classifier model exhibited the best performance among different candidate models. Additionally, the study identified potential issues with the CA DMV data reporting protocol, which is imperative to share with the research community. Recommendations are provided to enhance the existing reports and append new domains.

AB This study presents a novel robust controller strategy for submersible autonomous robotized vehicles (SARV). This controller applies the averaged sub-gradient (ASG) descendant method to optimize the tracking of well -posed reference trajectories. The motion control form of the SARV is done in three stages (cascade-like control design). The phases consist of using the translation velocities as pseudo controllers to adjust the SARV position, regulating the angular velocities to attain the requested translation velocities, and using the proposed ASG to control the thrusters to get the needed angular velocities. ASG implementation optimizes a convex cost function depending on the integral of the tracking error using the ASG method. The application of Barbalat's lemma justifies the tracking error is converging the origin asymptotically. A class of integral sliding mode controllers with a variable state-dependent gain solves the tracking of the designed reference trajectories in each of the three stages. The sliding surface depends on the tracking error for each pseudo-controller, its integral, and the cost function average. The optimization of the cost function can be done without complete knowledge of the SARV dynamics. A numerical example is presented in this study to confirm the suggested control design's effectiveness based on the cost function's time evolution analysis. The forced motion by the proposed controller is compared with the movement obtained by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The proposed controller exhibits a better tracking of the reference trajectory than the PID version.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are programmable, robotic vehicles that can drift, drive, or glide through the ocean without real-time control by human operators. AUVs that also can follow a planned trajectory with a chosen depth profile are used for geophysical surveys, subsea pipeline inspection, marine archaeology, and more. Most AUV5 are followed by a mother ship that adds significantly to the cost of an AUV mission. One pathway to reduce this need is to develop long-endurance AUV5 by improving navigation, autonomy and energy storage. Long-endurance AUVs can open up for more challenging mission types than what is possible today. Fuel cell systems are a key technology for increasing the endurance of AUVs beyond the capability of batteries. However, several challenges exist for underwater operation of fuel cell systems. These are related to storage or generation of hydrogen and oxygen, buoyancy and trim, and the demanding environment of the ambient seawater. Protecting the fuel cell inside a sealed container brings along more challenges related to condensation, cooling and accumulation of inert gases or reactants. This paper elaborates on these technical challenges and describes the solutions that the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) has chosen in its development of a fuel cell system for long-endurance AUVs. The reported solutions enabled a 24 h demonstration of FFI's fuel cell system under water. The remaining work towards a prototype sea trial is outlined. (C) 2019 The Authors.

   Intention Recognition of Connected Autonomous Vehicle Based on Mobile

DT Article
AB One of the major challenges that connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are facing today is driving in urban environments. To achieve this goal, CAVs need to have the ability to understand the crossing intention of pedestrians. However, for autonomous vehicles, it is quite challenging to understand pedestrians' crossing intentions. Because the pedestrian is a very complex individual, their intention to cross the street is affected by the weather, the surrounding traffic environment, and even his own emotions. If the established street crossing intention recognition model cannot be updated in real time according to the diversity of samples, the efficiency of human-machine interaction and the interaction safety will be greatly affected. Based on the above problems, this paper established a pedestrian crossing intention model based on the online semisupervised support vector machine algorithm ((OSVM)-V-3). In order to verify the effectiveness of the model, this paper collects a large amount of pedestrian crossing data and vehicle movement data based on laser scanner, and determines the main feature components of the model input through feature extraction and principal component analysis (PCA). The comparison results of recognition accuracy of SVM, (SVM)-V-3, and (OSVM)-V-3 indicate that the proposed (OSVM)-V-3 model exhibits a better ability to recognize pedestrian crossing intentions than the SVM and (SVM)-V-3 models, and the accuracy achieves 94.83%. Therefore, the (OSVM)-V-3 model can reduce the number of labeled samples for training the classifier and improve the recognition accuracy.

ID DYNAMICS
AB Adaptive cruise control (ACC) considering vehicle performances becomes a core technology for autonomous vehicle to adjust the vehicle speed while maintaining a safe distance from preceding vehicles. Improvement of the vehicle performances has limitations by only designing ACC's control parameters or its strategies. Furthermore, uncertainties of vehicle parameters and vehicle occupants can affect the vehicle performances considerably. Therefore, this paper studies the total design process of ACC system considering the control and the vehicle parameters simultaneously and reflecting the uncertainties. Three cases of deterministic design optimisation (DDO) are performed to show the effectiveness of considering the vehicle parameters. Additionally, one case of robust design optimisation (RDO) is performed to demonstrate the importance of considering the uncertainties. Conclusively, by performing the RDO, the vehicle performances are improved, and especially mean of fuel efficiency is increased and the standard deviation of the fuel efficiency is decreased. Moreover, enhancement and robustness of the product's performance are expected by implementing this design process to the development of control system with structural discipline at the concept design stage.

AB Objective: This article provides a review of empirical studies of automated vehicle takeovers and driver modeling to identify influential factors and their impacts on takeover performance and suggest driver models that can capture them. Background: Significant safety issues remain in automated-to-manual transitions of vehicle control. Developing models and computer simulations of automated vehicle control transitions may help designers mitigate these issues, but only if accurate models are used. Selecting accurate models requires estimating the impact of factors that influence takeovers. Method: Articles describing automated vehicle takeovers or driver modeling research were identified through a systematic approach. Inclusion criteria were used to identify relevant studies and models of braking, steering, and the complete takeover process for further review. Results: The reviewed studies on automated vehicle takeovers identified several factors that significantly influence takeover time and post-takeover control. Drivers were found to respond similarly between manual emergencies and automated takeovers, albeit with a delay. The findings suggest that existing braking and steering models for manual driving may be applicable to modeling automated vehicle takeovers. Conclusion: Time budget, repeated exposure to takeovers, silent failures, and handheld secondary tasks significantly influence takeover time. These factors in addition to takeover request modality, driving environment, non-handheld secondary tasks, level of automation, trust, fatigue, and alcohol significantly impact post-takeover control. Models that capture these effects through evidence accumulation were identified as promising directions for future work. Application: Stakeholders interested in driver behavior during automated vehicle takeovers may use this article to identify starting points for their work.

AB Despite the significant advances in vehicle automation and electrification, the next-decade aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous electric mobility on demand (AEMoD) services in big cities are still threatened by two major bottlenecks, namely, the communication/computation and charging delays. In order to target the communication/computation delays, the paper suggests the exploitation of fog-based architectures for localized AEMoD system operations. These emerging architectures are soon to become widely used, allowing for all localized operational decisions to be made with very low latency by fog controllers located close to the end applications (e.g., each city zone for AEMoD systems). As for the charging delays, an optimized multi-class charging and dispatching queuing model, with partial charging option for AEMoD vehicles is developed for each of these zones. The stability conditions of this model and the optimal number of classes are then derived. The decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to partially/fully charge or directly serve customers are optimized to minimize the maximum and average system response times using convex optimization and Lagrangian analysis. The results show the merits of our proposed model and optimized decision scheme compared to both the always-charge and the equal-split scheme. Furthermore, the comparison of the maximum and average response time minimization results shows a very low variance in performance, which suggests by using the linear programming solution for lower complexity.
